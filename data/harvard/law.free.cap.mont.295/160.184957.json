We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying the Contestants\u2019 discovery requests?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">\u00b64 2.

Did the District Court abuse its discretion in refusing the Contestants\u2019 proposed instruction regarding the existence of a confidential relationship as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-17\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-18\">\u00b66 Cubby owned a ranch near Pryor, Montana, when he died on January 4, 1997. He was survived by four adopted children: Clifford, Kande and Kip had been adopted many years earlier; Joshua Payne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>(Joshua) was adopted several months prior to Cubby\u2019s death. Cubby\u2019s wife, Dorothea Bell Lande (Dorothea), predeceased him.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b67 Cubby was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in January of 1996 and was hospitalized several times in November and December of 1996. Cubby had executed several wills in previous years and executed two more in the months just prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b68 On November 25, 1996, Cubby executed a will naming Nancy Witt (Witt), Joshua\u2019s mother, and Clifford co-personal representatives of his estate and creating two trusts. In the first, a 15-year trust with a $50,000 corpus, Witt was designated the trustee and Joshua was the sole beneficiary. In the second 15-year trust (hereinafter, the Ranch Property Trust), Clifford, Kande and Kip were designated co-trustees and equal beneficiaries of income produced by the ranch. The will provided that, at the expiration of the Ranch Property Trust, the ranch would be divided equally between Clifford, Kande and Kip. The residue of Cubby\u2019s estate not provided for in the trusts was to be divided equally among the four children.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b69 Cubby executed a codicil to the November will on December 12, 1996. In pertinent part, the codicil left Cubby\u2019s ranch house to Joshua and named him an equal beneficiary \u2014 with Clifford, Kande and Kip \u2014 of income produced under the Ranch Property Trust. The codicil did not alter the earlier provisions requiring division of the ranch property between Clifford, Kande and Kip at the expiration of that trust. The codicil also designated Clifford and Witt as co-trustees of the Ranch Property Trust and, again, as co-personal representatives of Cubby\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b610 Cubby was hospitalized at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Billings, Montana, from December 17, until December 28,1996. On December 28,1996, Wilma Lande (Wilma) and Vickie Lande MacCarty (Vickie) checked Cubby out of the hospital and drove him to their ranch near Pryor, Montana. Wilma is the widow of Cubby\u2019s deceased nephew and Vickie is Wilma\u2019s daughter. On December 29,1996, Cubby instructed Vickie to contact his attorney, Ingrid Gustafson (Gustafson), about his will and he executed another will the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u00b611 The December 30, 1996, will created three 15-year, $50,000 trusts, naming Clifford, Kande and Kip as the beneficiaries. The remaining corpus of each trust was to be distributed equally to the beneficiaries on expiration of the trust. This will again created the 15-year Ranch Property Trust, but altered the terms so that Clifford, Kande and Kip would each receive 10% of the income produced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ranch. In addition, at the expiration of the Ranch Property Trust, the ranch would be divided equally between Joshua and Vickie. The December 30,1996, will designated Vickie and Witt as co-personal representatives of Cubby\u2019s estate and co-trustees of the Ranch Property Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b612 After Cubby\u2019s death, Gustafson filed a motion on behalf of Vickie and Witt (collectively, the Personal Representatives) in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, requesting probate of the will executed on December 30,1996, and appointment of Vickie and Witt as co-personal representatives of the estate. In April of 1997, Clifford filed a <em>pro se </em>motion disputing Cubby\u2019s testamentary capacity and claiming that Cubby had been unduly influenced at the time he executed the December 30,1996, will. Clifford\u2019s motion requested, and the court ordered, that venue be changed to Big Horn County.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b613 In June of 1997, Clifford filed an additional <em>pro se </em>pleading renewing his prior objections and, in addition, objecting to Vickie and Witt acting as Cubby\u2019s co-personal representatives under the December 30,1996, will. Clifford also requested supervised administration of the estate pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-301, MCA. Thereafter, Clifford obtained representation and Kande and Kip joined Clifford in contesting the validity of the December 30,1996, will. The parties filed various motions and discovery ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b6 14 The Contestants\u2019 discovery request to the Personal Representatives included a request for production of files relating to Gustafson\u2019s representation of Cubby and the files in her possession relating to Cubby\u2019s representation by her predecessor, Marcie Schwarz (Schwarz). The Personal Representatives objected to the discovery requests, asserting the attorney-client privilege, and the Contestants requested that the files be produced at Gustafson\u2019s deposition. During her deposition, Gustafson reasserted the attorney-client privilege, refused to answer questions about her communications with Cubby and refused to produce the requested files. Gustafson\u2019s deposition was discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b6 15 The Contestants subsequently filed a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting that Gustafson be prohibited from testifying at trial. The Personal Representatives responded that, in light of further legal research, they were withdrawing the assertion of the attorney-client privilege with regard to Cubby\u2019s estate planning and related legal services, but would continue to assert the privilege with regard to other legal work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>performed for Cubby; the responses also indicated that all estate planning files and records had been provided to the Contestants. At the final pretrial conference, the District Court treated the Contestants\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>as a motion to compel and ordered Gustafson to submit all files in her possession related to legal work performed for Cubby \u2014 including the Schwarz files, but excluding estate planning files previously produced \u2014 for <em>in camera </em>inspection. The court also ordered legal memoranda relating to the applicability of the attorney-client privilege vis-a-vis the files ordered for <em>in camera </em>inspection, and the Personal Representatives again responded that they had produced all the estate planning files in Gustafson\u2019s possession. During the same period of time, the Personal Representatives moved for summary judgment, the Contestants responded and the District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b616 The Personal Representatives continued to assert the attorney-client privilege with regard to eight other files, however, and submitted those files \u2014 including Dorothea\u2019s probate file and Joshua\u2019s adoption file \u2014 -to the District Court for its <em>in camera </em>inspection. After reviewing the files, the District Court concluded that the Personal Representatives could not assert the attorney-client privilege against the Contestants, Dorothea\u2019s probate file and Joshua\u2019s adoption file were not relevant or discoverable, and the remaining six files it had inspected were relevant and discoverable. The court ordered production of the latter files, Gustafson\u2019s deposition was completed and the case proceeded to a jury trial on the issues of testamentary capacity and undue influence vis-a-vis Cubby\u2019s December 30,1996, will.</p>\n<p id=\"A5h\">\u00b617 The jury returned a special verdict finding that Cubby had testamentary capacity and was not unduly influenced when he executed the will. Based on that verdict, the District Court admitted the December 30,1996, will to formal probate as Cubby\u2019s valid last will and testament and confirmed Vickie and Witt as Cubby\u2019s co-personal representatives. The Contestants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b618 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying the Contestants\u2019 discovery requests?</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u00b619 The Contestants concede that the District Court ultimately rejected the Personal Representatives\u2019 privilege-based discovery objections, ordered submission of all legal files relating to representation of Cubby in Gustafson\u2019s possession which had not been produced previously, and required production of all but Dorothea\u2019s probate file and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Joshua\u2019s adoption file. They contend, however, that the District Court erred in failing to: A) \u201cstrike\u201d the Personal Representatives\u2019 objections to discovery based on the attorney-client privilege; B) require production of Dorothea\u2019s probate file and Joshua\u2019s adoption file; and C) require production of Cubby\u2019s complete estate planning files, including the Schwarz files, in Gustafson\u2019s possession. We review a district court\u2019s discovery-related rulings to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re Estate of Bolinger, </em>1998 MT 303, \u00b6 24, 292 Mont. 97, \u00b624, 971 P.2d 767, \u00b6 24 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\n<em>A. Failure to \u201cstrike\u201dprivilege-based discovery objections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b620 The Contestants discuss at length the Personal Representatives\u2019 assertion \u2014 and withdrawal \u2014 of the attorney-client privilege and the District Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the privilege could not be asserted. They argue, however, that the court \u201cdid not give [them] relief\u201d when it failed to \u201cstrike\u201d the privilege-related discovery objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b621 The Contestants\u2019 suggestion that the District Court was required to strike privilege-related objections from the record, in addition to rejecting the applicability of the privilege, is entirely without merit. Perhaps for that reason, no authority is advanced for the Contestants\u2019 position, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. Having failed to advance supporting authority, the Contestants cannot establish error in this regard. <em>See Duck Inn, Inc. v. Montana State Univ. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 519, 523, 949 P.2d 1179, 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\n<em>B. Failure to require production of Dorothea\u2019s probate file and Joshua\u2019s adoption file</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u00b622 After inspecting Gustafson\u2019s files <em>in camera, </em>the District Court determined that Dorothea\u2019s probate file and Joshua\u2019s adoption file were not relevant to the case and, therefore, were not discoverable pursuant to Rule 26(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P. The Contestants contend that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to require production of those files.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u00b623 In regard to Dorothea\u2019s probate file, the Contestants specifically contend in their opening brief that the District Court abused its discretion because a copy of Dorothea\u2019s 1988 will was introduced as part as an exhibit during the trial, trial testimony indicated Cubby had promised Dorothea that Clifford, Kande and Kip would always be provided for in the will and Gustafson testified she did \u201csome estate work with [Cubby] and Dorothea.\u201d We observe at the outset, however, that the trial-related matters on which the Contestants rely occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>subsequent to the District Court\u2019s refusal to require production of Dorothea\u2019s probate file. Therefore, those matters cannot properly serve as the basis for a determination that the District Court abused its discretion at the time it failed to require production of Dorothea\u2019s probate file.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b624 Rule 26(b)(1), M.R.Civ.R, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of any other party....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR7\">Thus, the proper inquiry is whether Dorothea\u2019s probate file was relevant to the Contestants\u2019 claims that Cubby lacked testamentary capacity or was unduly influenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b625 The District Court concluded that Dorothea\u2019s probate file was not relevant because it was completed some years ago. In their reply brief, the Contestants contend only that Dorothea\u2019s probate file was relevant because it \u201cwas not completed that long ago.\u201d The Contestants\u2019 mere assertion that Dorothea\u2019s probate file was relevant because it \u201cwas not completed that long ago\u201d does not established a connection between Dorothea\u2019s probate file and the subject matter involved in this case \u2014 that is, testamentary capacity and undue influence vis-a-vis Cubby\u2019s December 30, 1996, will \u2014 as required by Rule 26(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b626  In determining that Joshua\u2019s adoption file was not relevant, the District Court relied on the following statements from the Contestants\u2019 brief in opposition to the Personal Representatives\u2019 motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">[T]he contestants do not contest that Joshua Payne is a child of Thor Lande, and also entitled to whatever benefits that status may bestow. Contestants agree that Joshua has been a continual beneficiary of Thor Lande, just as they themselves have been.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The Contestants contend in three sentences in their opening brief that Joshua\u2019s adoption file was \u201ccertainly a matter which bore upon Cubby Lande\u2019s estate planning.\u201d In support of that contention, the Contestants merely state that Gustafson represented Cubby in Joshua\u2019s adoption and testified in her deposition that she assumed one of the reasons Cubby adopted Joshua was to avoid Montana inheritance tax. In their reply brief, the Contestants briefly contend that Joshua\u2019s adoption two or three months prior to Cubby\u2019s death was a significant estate planning event.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u00b627 It may well be that Joshua\u2019s adoption was a significant estate planning event near in time to Cubby\u2019s death. However, Joshua had long been a substantial devisee in Cubby\u2019s wills and the Contestants were not challenging his adoption or his status as a beneficiary. Again, the Contestants have not established the relevance of Joshua\u2019s adoption to their claims that Cubby lacked testamentary capacity and was unduly influenced when he executed the December 30,1996, will as required by Rule 26(b)(1), M.R.Civ.R</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b628 We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to require production of Dorothea\u2019s probate file and Joshua\u2019s adoption file.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>C. Failure to require production of Cubby\u2019s complete estate planning files, including the Schwarz files, in Gustafson\u2019s possession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARq\">\u00b629 While not particularly clear, the Contestants seem to argue that they did not receive estate planning documents created by Schwarz which were in Gustafson\u2019s possession. The problem with this argument is that the record does not support it. Indeed, the Personal Representatives\u2019 responses to several of the Contestants\u2019 requests for production pertaining to Cubby\u2019s estate planning file were attached to an affidavit in support of the Contestants\u2019 motion <em>in limine. </em>Those responses included, among other things, estate planning documents prepared by Schwarz for Cubby as early as 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b630  The Contestants have failed to make any showing that the Personal Representatives did not produce Cubby\u2019s entire estate planning files. Moreover, while we recognize the difficulty involved in \u201cproving a negative,\u201d the Contestants bear the burden of establishing error by the District Court. <em>See Duck Inn, </em>Inc., 285 Mont. at 523, 949 P.2d at 1181. Having failed to identify any \u201cmissing\u201d documents, the Contestants have failed to meet their burden of establishing error by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\u00b631 We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion with regard to requiring production of Cubby\u2019s estate planning files, including the Schwarz files, in Gustafson\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"Anb\">\u00b632 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by implicitly denying the Contestants\u2019 motion <em>in </em>limine?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\u00b633 Subsequent to Gustafson\u2019s assertion of the attorney-client privilege during her initial deposition and her privilege-based refusal to answer questions or produce requested files, the Contestants filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to prohibit Gustafson from testifying at trial. They asserted prejudice based on their inability to explore the files \u2014 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Gustafson\u2019s knowledge relating to those files \u2014 which could have led to admissible evidence. The District Court treated the motion <em>in limine </em>as a motion to compel and ordered Gustafson to produce for <em>in camera </em>inspection all the files in her possession relating to Cubby\u2019s legal representation which had not already been produced. Gustafson produced eight files for inspection and the court concluded only two were not relevant and ordered production of the remaining files. Thereafter, Gustafson\u2019s deposition was reconvened and completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b634 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>for abuse of discretion. <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 94, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 15. Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8z\">\u201c[t]he purpose of a motion in limine is to prevent the introduction of evidence which is irrelevant, immaterial, or unfairly prejudicial.\u201d Accordingly, the authority to grant or deny a motion in limine \u201crests in the inherent power of the court to admit or exclude evidence and to take such precautions as are necessary to afford a fair trial for all parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>City of Helena v. Lewis </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 421, 425-26, 860 P.2d 698, 700).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b63 5 The Contestants contend that the District Court erred by treating their motion <em>in limine </em>as a motion to compel. They cite to <em>Aysseh v. Lawn </em>(N. J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1982), 452 A.2d 213, as supporting their claim that a motion <em>in limine </em>prohibiting Gustafson from testifying was the \u201conly method of eliminating the prejudice... brought about by their inability to obtain information and files in discovery.\u201d Specifically, the Contestants contend that Gustafson had information critical in resolving the issues in this case and that her assertion of the attorney-client privilege prejudiced them.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b636 In <em>Aysseh, </em>an attorney who had information critical to the resolution of the issues involved asserted the attorney-client privilege during his deposition by the plaintiff. <em>Aysseh, </em>452 A.2d at 214. The defendants subsequently waived the attorney-client privilege and offered the attorney as a witness at trial. <em>Aysseh, </em>452 A.2d at 220. The New Jersey trial court concluded that where prejudicial frustration of discovery resulted from the assertion of the attorney-client privilege \u2014 which was subsequently waived during trial \u2014 the only appropriate sanction was to bar the attorney as a witness. <em>Aysseh, </em>452 A.2d at 221-22. The Contestants\u2019 reliance on <em>Aysseh </em>is misplaced for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u00b637 First, <em>Aysseh </em>is a trial court decision which is neither authoritative nor persuasive in our review of a Montana trial court decision. Moreover, <em>Aysseh </em>is readily distinguishable. In <em>Aysseh, </em>the assertion of the attorney-client privilege prejudiced the plaintiff because he was unable to explore in a deposition facts known by the attorney which were critical in resolving the issues in the case and about which he later testified during trial. Here, after the privilege was asserted and partially withdrawn, the District Court rejected the applicability of the privilege altogether, compelled production of the files in question for <em>in camera </em>inspection, determined that six of the files were discoverable and ordered those files produced to the Contestants. Thereafter, Gustafson\u2019s deposition was reconvened to allow the Contestants an opportunity to explore her knowledge relating to the newly produced files. Under these circumstances, and unlike the situation <em>in Aysseh, </em>the Contestants were not prejudiced by Gustafson\u2019s early assertion of the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b638  In any event, the usual procedure following a party\u2019s objection or refusal to respond to discovery is a motion to compel discovery. <em>See </em>Rules 34(b), 37(a), M.R.Civ.R In the event an order compelling discovery is issued, a party\u2019s failure to comply may result in sanctions appropriate to the situation. <em>See </em>Rule 37(b), M.R.Civ.R Here, the District Court essentially converted the Contestants\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>to a motion to compel pursuant to Rule 37(a), M.R.Civ.R, and, following its <em>in camera </em>inspection, compelled production of most of the documents requested by the Contestants. Gustafson\u2019s deposition continued thereafter and the Contestants did not raise an issue of incomplete production or seek sanctions in the form of exclusion of testimony at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b639 The Contestants contend, however, that they were prejudiced later because Gustafson testified at trial about wills and codicils created prior to her representation of Cubby, and they point out that they renewed their motion <em>in limine </em>when she began that testimony. Close scrutiny of the record reveals, however, that \u2014 during a direct examination spanning approximately 60 pages of transcript \u2014 Gustafson answered only two questions about any will of Cubby\u2019s prepared prior to her representation of him and those responses merely summarized the provisions of that 1992 will. Furthermore, the will itself had been produced to the Contestants and admitted into evidence, and the Contestants\u2019 only objection to the questions was that the will \u201cspeaks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>for itself.\u201d On this record, the Contestants have not established prejudice with regard to Gustafson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b640  We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by implicitly denying the Contestants\u2019 motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b641 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in refusing the Contestants\u2019 proposed instruction regarding the existence of a confidential relationship as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b642 As discussed above, the Contestants challenged the validity of the December 30, 1996, will on the basis that Wilma and Vickie unduly influenced Cubby. A party contesting a will on grounds of undue influence must establish five criteria, one of which is the existence of a confidential relationship between the testator and the person attempting to influence the testator. <em>Estate of DeCock v. DeCock </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 437, 444, 925 P.2d 488, 492 (citations omitted). The Contestants concede that whether a confidential relationship exists ordinarily is a question for the factfinder. <em>See Estate of DeCock, </em>278 Mont. at 444-46, 925 P.2d at 492-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u00b643 In this case, the Contestants offered Proposed Instruction No. 15 which told the jury that the court had determined, as a matter of law, that a confidential relationship existed between Wilma and Vickie, on the one hand, and Cubby, on the other. The District Court refused the instruction and the Contestants assert error.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\u00b644 \u201cWe review jury instructions in a civil case for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Moore v. Imperial Hotels Corp., </em>1998 MT 248, \u00b6 21, 291 Mont. 164, \u00b6 21, 967 P.2d 382, \u00b6 21 (citation omitted). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">[a] district court has broad discretion in deciding whether to give or refuse a party\u2019s proposed jury instruction. In reviewing whether a particular jury instruction was properly given or refused, we must consider the instruction in its entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and <em>with the evidence introduced at trial.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-11\"><em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">\u00b645 The Contestants assert that the evidence establishing the existence of a confidential relationship was undisputed in this case. As a result, they urge that the District Court should have instructed the jury that a confidential relationship existed as a matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">\u00b646 Pursuant to <em>Moore\u2019s </em>directive, we consider the evidence introduced at trial in reviewing whether the Contestants\u2019 Proposed Instruction No. 15 was properly refused. <em>See Moore, </em>f 21 (citation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ted). It is trae that the record before us contains substantial evidence which would support a finding that a confidential relationship existed in this case. Among other things, Wilma was granted power of attorney regarding Cubby\u2019s banking transactions and health care, Cubby stayed at her house after he left the hospital and she provided Cubby with medication and food. With regard to a confidential relationship between Cubby and Vickie, the record reflects that Vickie arranged to bring Cubby to her mother\u2019s house, filled prescriptions for Cubby and discussed Cubby\u2019s business and estate affairs with him.</p>\n<p id=\"Aueq\">\u00b647 The record also reflects, however, that Cubby remained in control of his finances and business decisions, directed Vickie and Wilma regarding how to care for him and did not share the contents of his December 30,1996, will with them. Given the conflicting evidence at trial, the determination of whether a confidential relationship existed was a question to be resolved by the jury, as the finder of fact. <em>See Estate of DeCock, </em>278 Mont. at 444-46, 925 P.2d at 492-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b648 Moreover, the Contestants\u2019 attempt to analogize the present case to <em>Estate of DeCock, Matter of Estate of Lien </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 295, 892 P.2d 530 and <em>Christensen v. Britton </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 393, 784 P.2d 908, in support of their assertion that a confidential relationship existed here as a matter of law is unpersuasive. None of those cases involved either the legal issue or the procedural posture now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b649 In <em>Estate of DeCock, </em>we reviewed a jury verdict finding that a daughter exerted undue influence over her mother to determine if substantial credible evidence supported that finding. <em>Estate of DeCock, </em>278 Mont. at 444-46, 925 P.2d at 492-93. More particularly, we determined whether sufficient evidence had been presented on each of the five criteria needed to establish undue influence. <em>Estate of DeCock, </em>278 Mont. at 445, 925 P.2d at 492-93. With regard to a confidential relationship, we mentioned the evidence supporting its existence in that case. <em>Estate of DeCock, </em>278 Mont. at 445, 925 P.2d at 492. Given that we were merely determining whether evidence supported a finding, it is clear we did not conclude in <em>Estate of DeCock </em>that similar evidence in a different case would establish the existence of a confidential relationship as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b650 In <em>Estate of Lien, </em>we reviewed a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and conclusion that no factual issues existed to submit the contestant\u2019s claim of undue influence to a jury. <em>Estate of Lien, </em>270 Mont. at 298, 892 P.2d at 531-32. While not reflected in our opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ion, the contestant set forth evidence on appeal claiming generally that the devisor was unduly influenced, but did not specifically address the confidential relationship criterion. The personal representatives claimed, and we agreed, that the contestant failed to demonstrate the existence of the second and third criteria necessary to establish undue influence, namely, the devisor\u2019s physical and mental condition. <em>See Estate of Lien, 270 </em>Mont. at 298, 892 P.2d at 535. Prior to reaching those criteria, we set forth the evidence of record sufficient to establish the existence of a confidential relationship, in the procedural context of a summary judgment proceeding in which neither party specifically disputed that criterion. <em>See Estate of Lien, 270 </em>Mont. at 298, 892 P.2d at 535. The evidence set forth in <em>Estate of Lien </em>regarding the existence of a confidential relationship does not bear on the question of whether a confidential relationship existed as a matter of law in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b651 <em>Christensen </em>involved a bench trial on the conservator\u2019s claim of undue influence in an effort to set aside certain transfers. <em>Christensen, </em>240 Mont. at 394, 784 P.2d at 909. We reviewed the evidence, including the evidence supporting the existence of a confidential relationship, and determined that evidence of undue influence was \u201coverwhelming;\u201d on that basis, we reversed. In doing so, however, we applied the \u201cclear preponderance of evidence against\u201d the trial court\u2019s finding standard of review. <em>Christensen, </em>240 Mont. at 396-40, 784 P.2d at 911-13. We no longer use that standard of review and, in any event, we were merely determining whether evidence supported the trial court\u2019s findings. The evidence enumerated in <em>Christensen </em>cannot equate to the existence of a confidential relationship as a matter of law in the present case. Here, the evidence was conflicting and, as concluded above, the question was one for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b652  We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing the Contestants\u2019 proposed instruction regarding the existence of a confidential relationship as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b653 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b192-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
