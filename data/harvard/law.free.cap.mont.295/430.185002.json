We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the court erred in dismissing the complaint against Triple E for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b63 On July 22,1995, a 1990 Regency motor home manufactured by Triple E swerved off Interstate Highway 15 south of Dillon, Montana. The motor home went over an embankment, rolled over onto its top, and broke apart. The chassis came to rest upside down on the motor home body, crushing its occupants. Four occupants, including the driver, Marbel Yoro, were killed; two others were injured. Relatives of the victims traveling behind the motor home in a van witnessed the wreck.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b64 The victims and their surviving relatives, all citizens of the Philippines or Canada, brought this suit against Marbel Yoro and Triple E, a Canadian corporation authorized to do business in Manitoba, Canada. Triple E entered a limited special appearance to move to dismiss the action against it for lack of personal jurisdiction. After discovery and briefing, the District Court granted Triple E\u2019s motion. That decision has been certified as final pursuant to Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b65 Did the court err in dismissing the complaint against Triple E for lack of personal jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u00b66 Rule 4(B), M.R.Civ.P, describes the persons who are subject to the jurisdiction of Montana state courts. Plaintiffs argue that the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction is justified under principles of both general jurisdiction and long arm jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\u00b67  Any person \u201cfound within the state of Montana\u201d is subject to the general jurisdiction of the courts of this state. Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P. To be \u201cfound within\u201d a state, the defendant\u2019s activities in that state must be substantial, systematic, and continuous. <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington </em>(1945), 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">\u00b68 The plaintiffs list as evidence that Triple E is \u201cfound within\u201d Montana the following factors: Triple E advertises in nationally circulated magazines which are distributed in Montana; Triple E runs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>an interactive web site on the Internet\u2019s World Wide Web which is available to Montana web users; Triple E has a network of dealerships, none of which are in Montana, but some of which provide sales coverage for at least three Montanans who have purchased Triple E vehicles; and Triple E provided an \u201cAdventure Club\u201d for its members, through which it planned trips throughout Canada and the United States, some of which, the plaintiffs allege, would necessitate travel through Montana. The plaintiffs assert that these activities demonstrate Triple E\u2019s continuous, substantial, and systematic presence in Montana. Alternatively, the plaintiffs allege that the existence of Triple E\u2019s web site alone is enough to justify the Montana court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b69 This Court has never been faced with the issue of whether maintaining an Internet web site may be considered an act by which a person purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting business in Montana. The plaintiffs cite <em>Inset Systems, Inc. v. Instruction Set, Inc. </em>(D. Conn. 1996), 937 F.Supp. 161; <em>Maritz, Inc. v. Cybergold, Inc. </em>(E.D. Mo. 1996), 947 F.Supp. 1328; and <em>Heroes, Inc. v. Heroes Foundation </em>(D. D.C. 1996), 958 F.Supp. 1,as examples of cases in which the defendants\u2019 business via Internet web pages was considered justification for determinations that the state court had jurisdiction over the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b6 10 The three cases cited by the plaintiffs are distinguishable from the present case in that the subject matter of those lawsuits either involved communication through the Internet or trademark infringement claims directly connected with the Internet activity of the defendant. In contrast, the tortious event which is the subject of this action is the sale of an allegedly defective motor home, which sale did not occur in Montana. Plaintiffs have established no connection between Triple E\u2019s Internet web site and the events upon which this case is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b6 11 Triple E is not registered with the Montana Secretary of State to conduct business in Montana. It does not have an office, warehouse, or any other facilities in Montana. It does not have a telephone listing in Montana. Triple E does not have any employees in Montana. It does not have any distributors or dealers located in Montana to sell motor homes, and the plaintiffs presented no evidence that the Triple E motor home which wrecked was purchased in Montana. Triple E does not own any real estate in Montana, nor does it do direct advertising in Montana with any Montana media.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u00b612  The above-listed facts are significant in determining whether general jurisdiction exists and indicate that it does not. <em>See, e.g., Bi-Lo Foods, Inc. v. Alpine Bank, Clifton, </em>1998 MT 40, \u00b6 19, 287 Mont. 367, \u00b6 19, 955 P.2d 154, \u00b6 19; <em>Simmons Oil Corp. v. Holly Corp. </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 75, 796 P.2d 189. Triple E\u2019s advertising in national magazines, its Internet web site, its Adventure Club, and its out-of-state dealerships which have served at least three Montanans do not establish a substantial, systematic, and continuous presence in Montana. We hold that Triple E was not \u201cfound within\u201d Montana so as to subject it to the general jurisdiction of Montana courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b613 Plaintiffs next argue that the exercise of Montana\u2019s long arm jurisdiction is justified under the following statutory provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">In addition, any person is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state as to any claim for relief arising from the doing personally, through an employee, or through an agent, of any of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">(b) the commission of any act which results in accrual within this state of a tort action!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Rule 4(B)(1), M.R.Civ.P. Plaintiffs contend that the tort action accrued in this case when the motor home wrecked south of Dillon and that the District Court thus had personal jurisdiction over Triple E for purposes of this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u00b614 If the Rule 4(B)(1) requirements for long arm jurisdiction are met, a court must also determine whether exercising jurisdiction over the defendant would be commensurate with the defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>Simmons v. State </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 264, 272-73, 670 P.2d 1372, 1376-77. The exercise of jurisdiction comports with a defendant\u2019s right of due process only if the following three elements are present:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">1. The nonresident defendant must have done some act or consummated some transaction with the forum or performed some act by which he purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking its laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">2. The claim must be one which arises out of or results from the defendant\u2019s forum-related activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-12\">3. The exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-13\"><em>Simmons, </em>206 Mont. at 276, 670 P.2d at 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">\u00b615 Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Triple E purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in Montana is based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>same acts cited under their argument that Triple E was subject to the general jurisdiction of Montana courts. Again, the plaintiffs make no direct allegation that their claims arose out of or resulted from Triple E\u2019s \u201cforum-related activities\u201d of having an Internet web site, Adventure Club, or network of dealerships. Nothing was presented to connect the victims or the driver of the motor home with any of these \u201ccontacts\u201d between Montana and Triple E.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b6 16 The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Triple E\u2019s advertisements in nationally circulated magazines to establish that Triple E is subject to Montana\u2019s long arm jurisdiction is misplaced. As a threshold matter, the plaintiffs have not established that the national magazines in which Triple E advertises are available in Montana. Moreover, the law is clear that the \u201cmere placement of advertisements in nationally distributed papers or journals does not rise to the level of purposeful contact with a forum required by the Constitution in order to exercise personal jurisdiction over the advertiser.\u201d <em>Federated Rural Elec. Ins. v. Kootenai Elec. Co-op </em>(10th Cir. 1994), 17 F.3rd 1302, 1305.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b617 We have stated, relative to long arm jurisdiction, that \u201c[interstate communication is an almost inevitable accompaniment to doing business in the modern world, and cannot by itself be considered a \u2018contact\u2019 for justifying the exercise of personal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>206 Mont. at 280, 670 P.2d at 1380. This statement is applicable to Triple E\u2019s advertising in nationally distributed magazines as well as to its maintenance of an Internet web site.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b618 Triple E cites several cases in which the defendants\u2019 Internet web sites have been rejected as bases for long arm jurisdiction. In <em>Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King </em>(S.D. N.Y. 1996), 937 F.Supp. 295, <em>aff\u2019d </em>126 F.3d 25 (2nd Cir. 1997), the court concluded that the defendant, the operator of a Missouri nightclub, could not be haled into court in New York on grounds that he had created a web site accessible in New York:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">King has done nothing to purposefully avail himself of the benefits of New York. King, like numerous others, simply created a Web site and permitted anyone who could find it to access it. Creating a site, like placing a product into the stream of commerce, may be felt nationwide \u2014 or even worldwide \u2014 but, without more, it is not an act purposefully directed toward the forum state.... There are no allegations that King actively sought to encourage New Yorkers to access his site, or that he conducted any business \u2014 let alone a continuous and systematic part of its [sic] business \u2014 in New York. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>is in fact no suggestion that King has any presence of any kind in New York other than the Web site that can be accessed worldwide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A26\"><em>Bensusan Restaurant, </em>937 F.Supp. at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b619 Triple E further quotes <em>Millennium Enterprises, Inc. v. Millennium Music LP </em>(D. Or. 1999), 33 F.Supp.2d 907, 922-23:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">The existence of a Web site, whether passive or interactive, does not rise to the requisite level of conduct. Publishing a Web site requires no \u201cdeliberate\u201d action within the forum state. Furthermore, a Web site is not automatically projected to a user\u2019s computer without invitation as are advertisements in a newspaper or on the television and radio. Rather, the user must take affirmative action to access either a passive or interactive Web site. The user must turn on a computer, access the Internet and the Web, and browse the Web for a particular site. Thus, ... information published on Web sites is not thrust upon users indiscriminately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">... Web sites are accessible day and night to all who possess the necessary technological know-how and equipment. Thus, if an interactive Web site can constitute \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d of a forum simply by being continuously accessible to residents of that forum, surely that contact can be considered \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d for purposes of general jurisdiction. Taking this reasoning to its logical conclusion, a plaintiff could sue a foreign defendant in any forum and claim jurisdiction based on the defendant\u2019s interactive Web site, even if the cause of action is unrelated to the Web site. Such results hardly conform with notions of \u201cfair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>International Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 320, 66 S.Ct. 154. The grasp of personal jurisdiction was never intended to reach so far and so wide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">In <em>Millennium, </em>the court examined whether having varying levels of interactivity of web sites constitutes \u201cdeliberate action\u201d within the forum state. The <em>Millennium </em>court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">[ujntil transactions with Oregon residents are consummated through defendants\u2019 Web site, defendants cannot reasonably anticipate that they will be brought before this court, simply because they advertise their products through a global medium which provides the capability of engaging in commercial transactions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abb\"><em>Millennium, </em>33 F.Supp.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u00b620 <em>Bensusan </em>and <em>Millennium </em>are persuasive as to the present case. In that regard, although Triple E\u2019s web site is available for view<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ing in Montana, there was no evidence of any transactions with Montana residents through that web site.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b621  We conclude that the plaintiffs have not established that Triple E purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Montana, nor did the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arise out of or result from Triple E\u2019s alleged activities in Montana. We agree with the District Court that any \u201centry\u201d by Triple E into Montana amounted to only \u201can insignificant trickle\u201d in the stream of commerce, and we hold that the exercise of jurisdiction over Triple E would not be reasonable. We affirm the decision of the District Court that it lacked jurisdiction over Triple E for purposes of this lawsuit.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-6\">JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
