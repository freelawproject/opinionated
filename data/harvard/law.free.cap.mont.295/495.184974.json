(TCI). The Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, granted summary judgment for both Defendants and Hale appealed, asserting that publication of his photo and personal information by Billings Police and the subsequent broadcast by TCI of this information on its cable program \u2018Yellowstone County\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d along with the terms \u201cfugitive,\u201d \u201cmost wanted,\u201d and \u201carmed and dangerous\u201d were defamatory. Hale also asserted that Billings Police were negligent when they failed to timely inform TCI of Hale\u2019s arrest and thereby prevent further broadcast of the information. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by granting both Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment on the issue of defamation with respect to the falsity of the statements made?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in granting Billings Police\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of defamation with respect to Billings Police\u2019s claimed privilege?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in granting Billings Police\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of negligence by finding that Billings Police owed no duty to Hale?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Background Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">\u00b66 On April 2, 1995, a complaint was filed in Billings City Court charging Appellant Mark Hale with misdemeanor domestic abuse following a March 25, 1995 incident between Hale and his then estranged wife, Kathryn, at one of their places of business in Billings. A warrant was issued for Hale\u2019s arrest the next day. Several attempts by the investigating officer to serve the warrant at Hale\u2019s personal residence proved unsuccessful. The record indicates that the officer admittedly refrained from attempting to execute the warrant at Hale\u2019s known places of business during the officer\u2019s day-time shift, not wishing to \u201cembarrass\u201d Hale. Also, as a matter of Billings Police domestic abuse arrest practice, the investigating officer made no attempt to contact Hale by telephone, mail, or in any other way alert Hale that a complaint had been filed or that a warrant had been issued. Consequently, Hale claims he remained unaware for the ensu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ing ten months prior to his arrest that Kathryn had called the police, that a complaint had been filed against him, or that an outstanding warrant for his arrest had been issued. Hale\u2019s arrest at his home occurred shortly after midnight on January 24, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b67 The parties agree that the arrest most likely resulted from the broadcast of Hale\u2019s name, photograph, physical description, and charge against him on TCI\u2019s \u201cYellowstone County\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d cable television program. The program, which aired for approximately eight-to-nine minutes four times daily, featured a \u201cvoice-over\u201d and still photos of Hale, and other persons similarly depicted. The voice-over informed viewers that the persons shown were \u201cfugitives\u201d against whom a valid arrest warrant was in effect, that viewers should not attempt to apprehend any of the people as they \u201cmay be armed and dangerous,\u201d that viewers should call the Billings Police with any information regarding \u201cthese fugitives,\u201d and that all persons depicted on \u201cYellowstone County\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d program were presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b68 The information regarding Hale, which was provided to TCI by Billings Police on January 9,1996, first aired January 22, 1996, and continued airing until January 29,1996 \u2014 for five, perhaps six, viewing days after Hale had been arrested. On January 30,1996, following several requests by Hale, Billings Police notified TCI personnel that Hale had been arrested and that his photo and related information should be removed from the program. By then, however, the one-week air time had expired and the use of Hale\u2019s photo and information had already been discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b69 Hale filed a complaint in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, alleging that both the Billings Police and TCI defamed him with his inclusion in the \u201cYellowstone County\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d program and that the Billings Police were negligent for not timely notifying TCI of Hale\u2019s arrest, which resulted in the post-arrest airing of information pertaining to Hale. On June 26, 1998, the District Court granted both Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Hale appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u00b6 10 Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and any affidavits on file show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a mater of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. To sustain a motion for summary judgment, the moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>party must establish that no genuine issues of material fact exist which would necessitate a trial of the issues presented. <em>Berens v. Wilson </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 269, 271, 806 P.2d 14, 16. Upon meeting this initial burden, the burden shifts to the party opposing the motion, who must show that an issue of material fact does exist. <em>Sprunk v. First Bank System </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 463, 466, 830 P.2d 103, 104. This Court reviews a summary judgment decision under the same standard as the district court in making the decision. <em>Minnie v. City of Roundup </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 429, 431, 849 P.2d 212, 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b6 11 Did the District Court err by granting both Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment on the issue of defamation with respect to the falsity of the statements made?</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b6 12 Appellant Hale argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Billings Police and TCI based on the conclusion that the information Billings Police provided TCI and the information TCI broadcast to the public was either truthful, or, if not truthful, then constitutionally protected, and therefore not defamatory as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u00b613 Pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-802, MCA, defamatory libel is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">[Fjalse and unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, or other fixed representation to the eye which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy or which causes him to be shunned or avoided or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Thus, as a first step toward summary judgment, the moving parties here must establish the absence of genuine issues of material fact relating to the truthfulness of the publications in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">\u00b614 Montana\u2019s Constitution provides a necessary beginning reference point to this discussion, a point not directly raised by the parties but, nevertheless, present within the parties\u2019 cited authority. \u201cIn all suits and prosecutions for libel or slander the truth thereof may be given in evidence; and the jury, under the direction of the court, <em>shall determine the law and the facts.\u201d </em>Art. II, \u00a7 7 Mont. Const, (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">\u00b615 This Court, however, has distinguished this provision by finding that \u201cthere is no absolute prohibition against granting summary judgment in libel cases.\u201d <em>Williams v. Pasma </em>(1982), 202 Mont. 66, 72, 656 P.2d 212, 215 (citing <em>Griffen v. Opinion Publishing Co. </em>(1943), 114 Mont. 502, 138 P.2d 580). Not since <em>Griffen </em>was decided, however, has the specific interplay between judge and jury been adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>addressed by this Court. In light of the District Court\u2019s summary judgment memorandum and order, which include conclusions of law as well as fact on a number of issues that seemingly conflict with Montana\u2019s Constitution, it is imperative that we at this time determine the scope of constitutional directives found in Article II, Section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b6 16 The Restatement (Second) of Torts has been referenced as a reliable authority in myriad defamation cases in Montana, and, in fact, provided the foundation for the rules regarding the roles of judges and juries in <em>Griffen. </em>See, <em>e.g., Griffen v. Opinion Publishing Co. </em>(1943), 114 Mont. 502, 138 P.2d 580, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Helfrich </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 452, 922 P.2d 1159; <em>Granger v. Time, Inc. </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 42, 568 P.2d 535; <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411. The Restatement acknowledges that while such states as Montana \u201cprovide that in libel cases the jury shall determine the law .... it is still the province of the court\u201d to determine certain questions of law. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 614 cmt. c. (1977). It is therefore crucial to the determination of the issues before us on appeal that we establish conclusive guidelines that accord with the directives of both Article II, Section 7 and the Restatement for this and future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b6 17 To this end, we find persuasive the rule that, \u201csubject to the control of the court whenever the issue arises, the jury determines whether ... the matter was true or false.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 617. The Restatement provides one caveat to this rule: \u201cif the evidence is so overwhelming that any other conclusion would be unreasonable,\u201d the court is afforded the discretion to make a proper finding. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 617 cmt. a. In contrast, the Restatement provides that the court, as a preliminary finding, must determine \u201cwhether a communication is capable of bearing a particular meaning; and ... whether the meaning is defamatory.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b618 Applying the foregoing to the issue of whether the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the information Billings Police provided TCI was \u201cessentially truthful,\u201d we conclude that Article II, Section 7 of the Montana Constitution, coupled with Sections 614 and 617 of the Restatement, is dispositive. Unless the evidence is \u201cso overwhelming that any other conclusion would be unreasonable,\u201d the issue of whether the statements were true or false is a determination for the jury alone to make. <em>See also Hickey v. Settlemier </em>(Or. App. 1993), 841 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>P.2d 675, 678 (following Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 617(b), and concluding that the truth or substantial truth of a defendant\u2019s statement is a question of fact for the jury and summary judgment is inappropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b619 The record here indicates that Billings Police provided TCI with Hale\u2019s name, physical description, photo, and crime charged, all of which at the time \u2014 January 9, 1996 \u2014 was seemingly true information on its face. However, reviewing the evidence in the record as a whole, we cannot agree that \u201cany other conclusion\u201d as to the truth or falsity of the statements would be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b620 Hale contends, and Respondents do not deny, that the information Billings Police provided to TCI, along with similar information of other persons subject to outstanding arrest warrants, was offered on a sheet upon which the phrase \u201cmost wanted\u201d was printed. Pleadings by Respondent Billings Police indicate that they provided information to create a \u201cmost wanted\u201d list for dissemination to the public. Furthermore, the record indicates that Billings Police, in assisting TCI with its \u201cCrimestopper\u201d program, were to some extent aware that the broadcast would portray Hale as a potentially armed and dangerous fugitive, who in fact was one of the \u201cmost wanted\u201d criminal suspects in Yellowstone County. Unlike circumstances where members of the press access public records, TCI\u2019s crime prevention program <em>requested </em>that the Billings Police supply names and information involving their <em>most-wanted fugitives </em>in Yellowstone County, so that ordinary citizens could assist the police in locating these suspects for apprehension. Therefore, the question can be asked, \u201cBased on this solicitation, was the information Billings Police provided TCI false?\u201d The answer to this question, gathered from the entirety of the record before this Court, is far from conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b621  The record indicates that Hale\u2019s name was chosen randomly from the three-to-five thousand outstanding arrest warrants on file with Billings Police and that his whereabouts were known at all times following the issuance of the arrest warrant, suggesting perhaps that, under any ordinary, plain-meaning definitions of the terms, he was neither a \u201cmost-wanted\u201d suspect, nor a \u201cfugitive\u201d from justice. It is apparent from the record that the evidence is not so overwhelming that the statements were \u201cessentially truthful,\u201d so as to preclude a jury from determining otherwise. Thus, we hold that summary judgment as to this issue was improper, and should be determined by the jury, with proper instruction from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u00b622 As for whether statements made in TCI\u2019s broadcast were constitutionally protected opinion\u2014 the second conclusion reached on this issue by the District Court \u2014 we conclude that this is a matter which a court can and should rightfully determine upon a motion for summary judgment. Such a determination, pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 617, goes to whether the statement is capable of bearing a defamatory meaning, and whether the meaning is in fact defamatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b623 The District Court determined that the information broadcast by TCI, namely the references to \u201cmay be armed and dangerous,\u201d \u201cmost wanted,1\u2019\u2019and \u201cfugitive,\u201d if not entirely accurate were, nevertheless, constitutionally protected under First Amendment analysis as statements of \u201copinion as opposed to factual assertions,\u201d and therefore could not, as a matter of law, be deemed defamatory. All parties to this action refer this Court\u2019s attention to its own analysis in <em>Roots v. Montana Human Rights Network </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 408, 913 P.2d 638, where we established the following rule pertaining to opinion speech derived from the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2695, 111 L.Ed.2d 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU-\">The First Amendment protects statements of opinion on matters of public concern where they do not contain a provable false factual connotation or where they cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><em>Roots, </em>275 Mont. at 412, 913 P.2d at 640 <em>(citing Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 18-20, 110 S.Ct. at 2705-06). Although crime prevention is certainly a matter of public concern, that the \u201copinion privilege\u201d would be raised in this case, and then ruled on as a matter of law by the District Court, necessitates the following elaboration and clarification of our analysis and rule found in <em>Roots.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b624 The origins of constitutionally protected opinion can be traced, of course, to Supreme Court Justice Holmes\u2019 notion of the \u201cmarketplace of ideas.\u201d <em>See Abrams v. United States </em>(1919), 250 U.S. 616, 630, 40 S.Ct. 17, 22, 63 L.Ed. 1173 (dissenting opinion). Thus, ideas expressed as opinions, although potentially defamatory, may be corrected through discussion rather than by the courts. <em>See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 339-40, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3007, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (stating \u201c[hjowever pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of ideas. But there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u00b625 In reversing summary judgment in favor of an Ohio newspaper, the <em>Milkovich </em>Court reviewed the various protections afforded under its First Amendment jurisprudence and consequently rejected the direction taken by many lower courts, that, under <em>Gertz </em>dictum, opinions as opposed to facts require an \u201cadditional separate constitutional privilege.\u201d <em>Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 21, 110 S.Ct. at 2707. Two of the protections identified by the <em>Milkovich </em>Court were melded by this Court into the above <em>Roots </em>rule. <em>See, e.g., Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 19-20, 110 S.Ct. at 2706 (citing <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., v. Hepps </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 767, 106 S.Ct. 1558, 89 L.Ed.2d 783, for the proposition that statements relating to matters of public concern containing a provably false factual connotation do not receive full constitutional protection; <em>and, Hustler Magazine v. Falwell </em>(1988), 485 U.S. 46, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41, for the proposition that statements reasonably interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual \u2014 and which are therefore not \u201cimaginative expression\u201d or \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d \u2014 receive no constitutional protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b626 The misguided direction identified by the <em>Milkovich </em>Court was precisely the path followed by the District Court here. The trial court erred in relying on an Illinois appellate court decision that followed a <em>pre-Milkovich </em>federal circuit court decision. <em>See Gist v. Macon County Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t </em>(Ill. App. 1996), 671 N.E.2d 1154 (following test derived from <em>Oilman v. Evans </em>(D.C. Cir. 1984), 750 F.2d 970).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b627  In further reliance on <em>Milkovich </em>as a touchstone, we now conclude that it is error for a court to create an \u201cartificial dichotomy\u201d by distinguishing statements of opinion from statements of fact, and thereby granting unqualified immunity to the former. <em>Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 19, 110 S.Ct. at 2706. Such a dichotomy was not our intent in <em>Roots. </em>In order to further clarify the rule stated there, we turn to the Restatement approach and conclude: if an opinion is not based on disclosed facts, and as a result creates the reasonable inference that the opinion is based on undisclosed defamatory facts, such an opinion is not afforded constitutional protection. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 <em>and </em>cmt. c. (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b628 We now apply the <em>Roots </em>rule, along with the foregoing clarification, to the alleged defamatory \u201copinion\u201d statements here. In a close paraphrase of the analysis in <em>Milkovich, </em>when the Billings Police and TCI informed the public, essentially, \u201cIn our <em>opinion, </em>we think Mark Hale is a most wanted fugitive, who may be armed and dangerous,\u201d the statement implied a knowledge of facts far beyond those disclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>which may have reasonably led viewers to conclude that Hale <em>was </em>most wanted, <em>was </em>a fugitive, and <em>was </em>possibly armed and dangerous. <em>See Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 18-19, 110 S.Ct. at 2705-06. Such statements of opinion can cause damage, pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-802, MCA, and are actionable, under <em>Roots, </em>if they contain a provably false factual connotation or can reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b629 The term \u201carmed and dangerous,\u201d although qualified with \u201cmay be,\u201d nevertheless implies to viewers that there are undisclosed, potentially defamatory facts upon which the opinion is based. Had the program stated that Hale was wanted for the commission of a crime involving a weapon, such as armed robbery, or \u201cwas last seen carrying a sawed-off shotgun,\u201d then the statement would have been based on disclosed facts, and therefore could not have been found defamatory. Such is not the case here. Hale never stood accused of using a weapon and, ten months following the issuance of the warrant, Billings Police and TCI apparently had no idea one way or the other whether Hale even possessed a gun, let alone whether he may have been armed. Moreover, their \u201copinion\u201d that Hale was dangerous is belied by the undisclosed fact that the Billings Police knew for months Hale\u2019s whereabouts and the nature of the offense with which was he charged, but made little effort to apprehend him. Consequently, Hale could demonstrate the falsity of the implied factual connotation created in the viewers\u2019 minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b630 The term \u201cmost wanted\u201d is offered for public consumption for a similar singular purpose: to warn that the person in question, above all other ordinary wanted persons, is the focus of intense scrutiny by law enforcement personnel, thus providing a clear connotation that the person has been identified as such based on undisclosed facts. This connotation is rendered all the more acute when coupled with the instructions to the public that police should be notified immediately, and that the suspect may be armed and dangerous. Such a factual connotation, in turn, may be proven false. The record indicates that neither the Billings Police nor TCI used any method whatsoever for determining who is or is not deserving of being identified as one of the most wanted criminal suspects in Yellowstone County. Respondents do not deny that names for \u201cYellowstone County\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d program were chosen entirely at random.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u00b631 Likewise, the term \u201cfugitive\u201d suggests but one urgent message to the intended hearer: the suspect has allegedly committed a crime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>has eluded capture, and is now fleeing justice. Indeed, this is the essential purpose of all such Crimestopper broadcasts, to legitimately assist the police in apprehending suspects whose whereabouts are unknown. One common definition of the term describes a person who is \u201c[rjunning away or fleeing, as from the law.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 538 (2d College ed. 1985). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary similarly defines fugitive as \u201c[ojne who flees; used in criminal law with the implication of a flight, evasion, or escape from arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 671 (6th ed. 1990). Furthermore, a more specific definition of \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d describes \u201c[a] person who, having committed a crime, flees from jurisdiction of court where crime was committed or <em>departs from his usual place of abode and conceals himself within the district.\u201d </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 671 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis added). Once offered for public consumption, the term inherently connotes that police are in pursuit of the person, and that the person is, with knowledge of the pursuit, actively avoiding confrontation or capture by either fleeing or hiding. Such a factual connotation can be proven as either true or false, and, in order for Respondents to prevail for the purposes of summary judgment here, must be unequivocally resolved in their favor. The record does not bear this out.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b632  As previously stated, the record indicates that Hale\u2019s whereabouts were known at all times following the issuance of the arrest warrant, and that he was unaware that a warrant against him had been issued. Furthermore, the post-arrest broadcast contained factual discrepancies; namely, that a valid warrant for Hale\u2019s arrest remained in effect, and that Hale remained at large as a most-wanted fugitive. Therefore, providing constitutional protection under the rule stated in <em>Roots </em>to the statements made during TCI\u2019s broadcast would be in error. Without such protection, genuine issues of material fact regarding the falsity of the statements made during the broadcast remain in contention, and summary judgment in favor of Respondents was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u00b633 Did the District Court err in granting Billings Police\u2019s motion \u25a0for summary judgment on the issue of defamation with respect to Billings Police\u2019s claimed privilege?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u00b634 The second element of libel from which Billings Police must dispel the presence of disputed material facts is whether or not the statements made to TCI were privileged. The District Court ruled, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>matter of law, that the communication made by Billings Police to TCI was privileged as either a proper discharge of an official duty or concerned a judicial proceeding in accordance with \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA. If privileged, truth or falsity of the statement is irrelevant and, consequently, a plaintiff cannot recover damages under a defamation theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b635 Pursuant to our prior discussion, we conclude that, in accordance with Article II, Section 7 of the Montana Constitution, determination of whether a publication is privileged is a question of law for the court. Furthermore, this determination may be reached by the court only when facts are not in dispute. <em>See Rasmussen v. Bennett </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 106, 110, 741 P.2d 755, 758; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 619 cmt. a. (1977). However, subject to the control of the court, the jury determines whether the defendant abused a conditional privilege. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b636 Section 27-1-804, MCA, governs whether a communication is privileged. The relevant portion of the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">What communications are privileged. A privileged publication is one made:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">(1) in the proper discharge of an official duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">(2) in any legislative or judicial proceeding or in any other official proceeding authorized by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">(4) by a fair and true report without malice of a judicial, legislative, or other public official proceeding or of anything said in the course thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">\u00b637 The first subsection, (1), does not explicitly confer an \u201cabsolute\u201d or \u201cconditional\u201d privilege to a party. In accordance with the Restatement (Second) of Torts, if a privilege is absolute the protection once given cannot be lost through abuse of the privilege. <em>See Skinner v. Pistoria </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 257, 263, 633 P.2d 672, 676. In such an event, whether the discharge is \u201cproper\u201d is irrelevant to a court\u2019s inquiry. <em>See, e.g., </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 585-592A (1977). Conditional or \u201cqualified\u201d privileges, on the other hand, may be lost as a result of abuse, such as reckless disregard for the truth, knowledge that the matter is false, or other forms of actual malice. <em>See, e.g., </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 594-605A (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">\u00b638 We have held that, pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-804(1), MCA, the discharge of an official duty, one which requires a statutory mandate from the legislature, confers an \u201cabsolute\u201d privilege and thereby an absolute defense to a libel action. <em>See Storch v. Board of Directors </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>(1976), 169 Mont. 176, 181-82, 545 P.2d 644, 647-48; <em>Small v. McRae </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 497, 519, 651 P.2d 982, 993-94. These holdings, we believe, accord with the principles expressed in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 592A, which states that an absolute privilege may be invoked by a party who is required by law to publish defamatory matter. These holdings, however, in concluding that <em>only </em>an absolute privilege is available, do not entirely mesh with the precise language of \u00a7 27-1-804(1), MCA. Stating that the discharge must be \u201cproper\u201d implies that an \u201cimproper\u201d discharge could result in the loss of a privilege, a condition not applicable to an absolute privilege. Pursuant to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, such a privilege is conditional, or, as they are often referred to in Montana case law, \u201cqualified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b639 Conceivably, a court could determine that an \u201cofficial duty\u201d exists in the sphere of employment that is not mandated by the legislature. For example, an \u201cofficial duty of a corporate officer could result in a defamatory publication regarding an employee. If so, then the privilege would be conditional, because the party would not be violating statutory mandate by failing to publish the statement, but publication nevertheless could be an \u201cofficial\u201d requisite of the person\u2019s employment. Although this Court has not ruled conclusively on this point, the issue was recognized in <em>Niles v. Big Sky Eyewear </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 455, 771 P.2d 114, <em>overruled on other grounds by Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIx\">Citing the Restatement of Torts and case law from Alaska and Kansas, defendants assert that a qualified privilege exists for a statement made by an employer about an employee for the protection of a lawful business. However, the qualified privilege is waived if it is abused. Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 599 (1977). Abuse of a qualified privilege is an issue of fact to be decided by the jury. Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 619 (1977). Defendants did not offer a jury instruction on qualified privilege, instead using the defense that the statements made were true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">This Court has held that an unsolicited complaint to the police is not privileged under section 27-1-804, MCA. <em>Shors v. Branch </em>(1986), [221 Mont. 390, 399], 720 P.2d 239, 245. Moreover, the record contains substantial evidence that Leonard Vainio waived any conditional privilege to which defendants were entitled by making his statements without good faith. We hold that there was no error on the issue of defamation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Niles, </em>236 Mont. at 461, 771 P.2d [at] 117. Thus, the \u201cproper\u201d element found under \u00a7 27-1- 804(1), when a conditional privilege is evidenced by the record, requires a factual determination. Again, we look to Article II, Section 7 and the Restatement (Second) of Torts for guidance. Section 619 of the Restatement provides that \u201csubject to the control of the court whenever the issue arises, the jury determines whether the defendant abused a conditional privilege.\u201d The Restatement provides the following relevant caveat: the jury determines this issue \u201cunless the facts are such that only one conclusion can reasonably be drawn.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 619 cmt. b. Accordingly, we conclude that the determination of whether the discharge of a non-statutoiy \u201cofficial duty\u201d is proper, when facts are in dispute as to its propriety, is a matter that should, under Montana\u2019s constitutional directive, be decided by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b640 The District Court here did not find, as a matter of law, that the privilege invoked by Billings Police was either an absolute or conditional privilege, as it should have, nor is there any indication by any party that the legislature has mandated that the police provide information regarding arrest warrants to crime prevention cable programs. Absent a mandate by law, which to our knowledge there is not, the privilege is at best conditional, based on the premise that in its \u201cofficial duty\u201d to prevent crime, Billings police enlisted the help of TCI in apprehending criminals. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 598 (communication to one who may act in the public interest). Billings Police, in fact, indicate that one of its officer\u2019s \u201cofficial duties\u201d included providing TCI with the names of individuals who had outstanding arrest warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"A62\">\u00b641 Upon remand, if the court finds that such a conditional privilege exists, then it is a matter for the jury to determine whether the discharge of the official duty \u2014 here, all statements provided to TCI by Billings Police \u2014 was \u201cproper\u201d to the extent Billings Police did not abuse the privilege. Hale argues that the dissemination of such information runs contrary to the policy expressed in the Montana Criminal Justice Information Act, \u00a7\u00a7 44-5-103 and 301-303, MCA. In turn, Billings Police contend that such dissemination is permissible, and therefore proper, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 44-5-103(12) and 301. These obvious conflicting contentions go to whether a conditional privilege was subsequently abused. We do not believe that \u201conly one conclusion can reasonably be drawn,\u201d from these facts and therefore determine that granting summary judgment based on the conclusion that Billings Police enjoyed a privilege pursuant to the proper discharge of an official duty was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u00b642 As for whether Billings Police\u2019s statements to TCI were made in a \u201cjudicial proceeding,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-804(2) and (4), MCA, and therefore privileged, we turn to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411. In <em>Sacco, </em>we adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts approach to this issue verbatim and determined \u201cstatements made by the police... as to the facts of the case or the evidence expected to be given are <em>not yet part of the judicial proceeding .... </em>and are not privileged.\u201d <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 240, 896 P.2d at 430 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 611 cmt. h. (1977) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b643  Respondents\u2019 reliance on our holding in <em>Cox v. Lee Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 527, 723 P.2d 238, which was a civil matter, is misplaced. In <em>Cox, </em>we determined that civil pleadings, once filed, become part of the \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d and subsequent publication of their contents by the press afforded its members the conditional privilege under \u00a7 27-1-804(4), MCA. <em>Cox, </em>222 Mont. at 530, 723 P.2d at 240. Accordingly, the holding in <em>Cox </em>extends to subsection (2), which also turns on whether the communications were in a judicial proceeding. <em>See also Skinner v. Pistoria </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 257, 263, 633 P.2d 672, 676 (holding that subsection (2) of \u00a7 27-1-804 confers an absolute privilege). Therefore, Respondent TCI\u2019s argument on appeal, that it, too, should be afforded a privilege is likewise without merit. Consequently, the District Court\u2019s determination, as a matter of law, that statements made to TCI by Billings Police were privileged publications made in a judicial proceeding was in error, and summary judgment as to this issue was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u00b644 Did the District Court err in granting Billings Police\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of negligence by finding that Billings Police owed no,duty to Hale?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\u00b645 Hale argues that the District Court erred in determining that Billings Police owed no duty to him regarding timely notification to TCI of his arrest. We agree with Hale.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">\u00b646  Under \u00a7 28-1-201, MCA, \u201c[ejvery person is bound, without contract, to abstain from injuring the person or property of another or infringing upon any of his rights.\u201d It is well within the reasonable limits of the foregoing statute that informing cable television viewers that a valid warrant for a person\u2019s arrest exists and stating that the person is a most-wanted fugitive who may be armed and dangerous could, potentially, injure the person in question once the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>is no longer accurate. Thus, a duty of reasonable care arises from the dissemination of such information. Consequently, Billings Police, in responding to TCI\u2019s solicitation for arrest warrant information, and in light of the nature of the crime prevention program, owed a duty to Hale to reasonably notify TCI of his subsequent arrest to prevent any potential harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b647 The record indicates that Billings Police were aware that such a duty existed. For example, a November 3, 1995 letter from Billings Police to TCI acknowledges the need to \u201cproperly\u201d manage the dissemination of information \u201c[i]n light of concerns recently expressed.\u201d The letter further describes suggested guidelines, such as \u201conce a warrant is served on a person featured on the program the Billings Police Department will notify [TCI] and the picture should be removed or marked within 12 hours.\u201d The letter also suggests that Billings Police would \u201cattempt to limit the types of arrest warrants to be featured to serious criminal offenses.\u201d In response, TCI, in a letter dated November 15,1995, stated that upon apprehension, the police could notify TCI via fax so that an \u201capprehended\u201d sign could be placed over the person\u2019s photo. The record indicates that such steps were never taken, and that Hale, himself, requested that Billings Police remove his photo and information from the program shortly after his arrest. The record further indicates that the subsequent request by Billings Police to TCI that the information in question be removed from the program did not occur until January 30,1996, at least one day after the airing had ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u00b648  In light of the foregoing, material issues of fact remain as to what constituted a \u201ctimely\u201d notification in accordance with the duty owed, and whether Billings Police breached this duty. Therefore, summary judgment on this issue was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u00b649 The order of the District Court is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b530-8\">JUSTICES GRAY, TRIEWEILER, HUNT and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
