He contends that the District Court\u2019s restriction on his parole eligibility was unlawful. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u00b62 The issue raised on appeal is whether the District Court\u2019s restriction of Christianson\u2019s parole eligibility complied with \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA. To resolve this issue, we address three sub-issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court violate \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA, by failing to state in open court its reasons for restricting Christianson\u2019s parole eligibility?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">\u00b64 2. Was the District Court authorized to issue an order amending the written judgment to list its reasons for imposing the parole eligibility restriction, in compliance with \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court impose the parole eligibility restriction for insufficient reasons, and thus abuse its discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">\u00b66 On the morning of September 6,1996, Christianson was drinking beer and playing video games in his living room. His three-year-old daughter, Taylor Nicole Salley, was running and playing in the house. Taylor ran in front of Christianson, spilled his beer and accidentally unplugged the power cord on Christianson\u2019s game machine. Christianson became angry and struck her in the stomach with a backhanded blow. He hit Taylor with such force that she was knocked unconscious. When she regained consciousness, she complained of stomach pains. Christianson failed to seek medical attention, even though Taylor continued to get sicker throughout the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">\u00b67 At about 9:00 p.m. that evening, Taylor began coughing up a dark colored mucous. Only then did Christianson contact emergency services. By the time help arrived, Taylor was unconscious, and upon her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>arrival at the hospital, she was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed that Taylor died as the result of sepsis due to the transection of her bowel. Christianson\u2019s blow, in conjunction with damage done on previous occasions when he hit her, had severed Taylor\u2019s intestine and caused her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b68 Christianson was charged by information with deliberate homicide. He subsequently pleaded guilty to an amended charge of mitigated deliberate homicide. After a sentencing hearing held on October 9, 1997, the District Court sentenced Christianson to a prison term of 40 years, with 10 years suspended. It further designated that Christianson be ineligible for parole. The District Court filed its written judgment and commitment that same day. However, the document failed to set forth the court\u2019s reasons for restricting Christianson\u2019s parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b69 Christianson did not appeal the judgment and commitment, but thereafter he filed an application for sentence review with the Sentence Review Division of this Court. The Division remanded the case to the District Court with instructions that it include in its judgment the reasons it declared Christianson ineligible for parole or participation in a supervised release program pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"ArN\">\u00b610 In compliance with the Division\u2019s directive, the District Court entered an order on March 19,1998, amending its prior judgment and commitment and setting forth its reasons for ordering that Christianson be ineligible for parole. Christianson filed his notice of appeal on May 12, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b6 11 Asa preliminary matter, we deem it necessary to set forth the basis of jurisdiction for entertaining this appeal. As stated earlier, the District Court orally pronounced Christianson\u2019s sentence and entered the written judgment on October 9,1997. After remand from the Sentence Review Division, it entered its order amending the judgment on March 19,1998. Christianson filed his notice of appeal on May 12,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u00b612 Rule 5(b), M.R.App.R, provides that an appeal from a judgment must be taken within 60 days. This Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal filed more than 60 days after judgment. <em>State v. Rice </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 81, 83, 910 P.2d 245, 246 (citation omitted). Because Christianson did not file his notice of appeal within 60 days of the October 9th judgment, an appeal from that judgment is not timely, and the Court has no jurisdiction to hear it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u00b613 However, a criminal defendant is also entitled to appeal from \u201corders after judgment which affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d Section 46-20-104, MCA. Christianson filed his notice of appeal on May 12,1998, which was within 60 days of the issuance of the March 19, 1998 order amending the judgment. This Court thus has jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s post-judgment order to the extent that it affects Christianson\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b614 The District Court has the discretion to restrict a criminal defendant\u2019s parole eligibility. Section 46-18-202(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJx\">Whenever the district court imposes a sentence of imprisonment in the state prison for a term exceeding 1 year, <em>the court may also impose the restriction that the defendant is ineligible for parole and participation in the supervised release program while serving that term. If the restriction is to be imposed, the court shall state the reasons for it in writing. </em>If the court finds that the restriction is necessary for the protection of society, it shall impose the restriction as part of the sentence and the judgment must contain a statement of the reasons for the restriction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">(emphasis added). Additionally, \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA, provides that <em>\u201cthe court shall specifically state all reasons for the sentence, including restrictions ...in open court on the record and in the written judgment.\u201d(evaph.a.s\\s </em>added).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u00b615 Christianson asserts that the parole restriction is unlawful for several reasons. First, he contends that the District Court failed to state its reasons for restricting his parole eligibility in the oral pronouncement of sentence and in the original written judgment, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-202(2) and 115(6), MCA, which renders the restriction invalid. Christianson further contends that the court could not correct that error by amending the written judgment. He next argues that even if the court could correct its error by amending the judgment, the reasons given by the court for restricting his parole eligibility are insufficient. We examine each argument individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\u00b6 16 Did the District Court violate \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA, by failing to state in open court its reasons for restricting Christianson\u2019s parole eligibility?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\u00b617 First, Christianson contends that his sentence is unlawful, because the District Court failed to state in open court its reasons for re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>striding parole eligibility as required by \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA. However, as this Court has already elaborated, an appeal from the original judgment is untimely because Christianson failed to file a notice of appeal within 60 days. This Court thus has no jurisdiction to entertain his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b618 Nevertheless, because the reasons articulated by the court at the sentencing hearing are relevant to the determination of other issues properly before the Court, we take the opportunity at this time to comment on the District Court\u2019s pronouncement. At the sentencing hearing, the court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">[Y]ou\u2019re here convicted of an unspeakable crime against a victim that was defenseless. A child that should have been able to expect safety in your arms was denied that safety. And what is particularly offensive about this is that this child was apparently repeatedly struck. And which is most offensive is that this little girl took several hours to die what must have been a very painful death without any medical attention by you. That is inexcusable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">Therefore, I will sentence you to 40 years in the Montana State Prison. I will, as [the probation officer] has suggested, suspend 10 of those. And that suspension will be on all of the conditions set forth in the pre-sentence investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">As to the matter of parole, I have received a lot of letters from your family and friends, and you\u2019re fortunate to have those people standing with you. They ask that I give you mercy and that I show you compassion. And I feel somewhat as the representative of your now deceased child. I will show you the mercy and compassion that you showed her, as you let her die a painful death, and you will not be eligible for parole during your prison sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">\u00b6 19 A review of the District Court\u2019s oral statement it its entirety reveals that it imposed the restriction because of the heinous nature of Christianson\u2019s crime. The court recounted several horrific features of the crime and found that Christianson let his daughter \u201cdie a painful death\u201d without exhibiting any mercy or compassion. In short, it imposed the parole restriction because Christianson\u2019s crime was brutal and callous.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">\u00b620 Thus, although this Court has no jurisdiction to address whether the District Court violated the statute\u2019s mandate that it state its reason for imposing the restriction in open court, we nevertheless note that the court did, in fact, state its reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b621 Was the District Court authorized to issue an order amending the written judgment to list its reasons for imposing the parole eligibility restriction, in compliance with \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b622 Christianson next contends that the District Court violated both \u00a7 46-18-115(6) and \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, by failing to state its reasons for restricting his parole eligibility in the original written judgment. He further argues that the court lacked authority to correct that error by amending the written judgment after remand from the Sentence Review Division. We reject Christianson\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"AcD\">\u00b623 Section 46-18-117, MCA, expressly provides that the District Court may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner after remand from an appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">Correction of sentence. The court may correct an erroneous sentence or disposition at any time and may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner within 120 days after the sentence is imposed or after remand from an appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Additionally, this Court has similarly held that a district court has the authority to modify a judgment where the Court has remanded the matter for clarification. <em>State v. Owens </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 135, 137, 748 P.2d 473, 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b624 In conducting its review of the sentence, the Sentence Review Division functions as an arm of this Court. Section 46-18-901, MCA. As this Court has stated in other contexts, the Division thus functions as part of the appellate process. <em>Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, \u00b6 27, 288 Mont. 391, \u00b6 27, 958 P.2d 670, \u00b6 27. Accordingly, when the Sentence Review Division, acting as an arm of this Court, remanded the matter to the District Court, the District Court had the express statutory authority to correct the sentence which was imposed in an illegal manner.</p>\n<p id=\"A3j\">\u00b625 Additionally, \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA, provides that the court may correct an erroneous sentence at any time. Based upon that statutory provision, it is well-settled that it is within a district court\u2019s power to enter an order amending a judgment to remedy certain clerical errors. <em>State v. Winterrowd </em>1998 MT 74, \u00b6 14, 288 Mont. 208, \u00b6 14, 957 P.2d 522, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). The purpose of such an order is to make the record reflect what was actually decided. <em>Winterrowd, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted). The error \u201cmust be apparent on the face of the record to insure that the correction does not in effect set aside a judgment actually rendered nor change what was originally intended.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>Owens, </em>230 Mont. at 138, 748 P.2d at 474 (citation omitted). In <em>Owens, </em>for example, the sentencing court had failed to designate the defendant as a dangerous offender in the written order, even though it had made that specific finding in open court. <em>Owens, </em>230 Mont. at 138, 748 P.2d at 474-75. The court amended the sentence in what was deemed a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order to include this designation. This Court held that a review of the record clearly revealed that \u201cthe District Court intended to designate the defendant as dangerous\u201d and thus upheld the district court\u2019s order. <em>Owens, </em>230 Mont. at 138-39, 748 P.2d at 474-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b626 In another case, <em>Lane, </em>the sentencing court orally required that the defendant complete sexual offender treatment before being eligible for parole, but in its written judgment it incorrectly stated that such treatment was only recommended. <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 9, 288 Mont. 286, \u00b6 9, 957 P.2d 9, \u00b6 9. A year later, the court entered a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order to correct the error. <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 10. This Court held that where the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment and commitment conflict, the oral pronouncement controls. In such a case, the court may issue a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order to correct the written judgment. <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 48. In <em>Lane, </em>the record revealed that the district court intended the treatment to be required, and this Court thus upheld the district court\u2019s <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order. <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b627 Similarly, in this case, the record reveals that the District Court intended to impose the parole eligibility restriction. However, the original written judgment did not set forth the reasons for the restriction, which is an error that is readily apparent on the face of the judgment. The amended judgment is consistent with the oral pronouncement of judgment. It neither sets aside the original judgment nor changes what was originally ordered. Instead, in compliance with the statutes, the order merely set forth the court\u2019s reasons for imposing the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b628 We additionally note, however, that even if the District Court did not have the authority to amend the written judgment to comply with \u00a7 46-18-115(6) and \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, Christianson\u2019s appeal would nevertheless be rejected. As elaborated upon earlier, Christianson did not challenge the District Court\u2019s original judgment within 60 days as required by Rule 5(b), M.R.App.P. This Court would have no jurisdiction to entertain Christianson\u2019s argument that the District Court failed to articulate in its written judgment its reasons for restricting his parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b629  We hold that the District Court had authority to issue an order amending the written judgment to list its reasons for imposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the parole eligibility restriction, in compliance with \u00a7 46-18-115(6) and \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b630 Did the District Court impose the parole eligibility restriction for insufficient reasons, and thus abuse its discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b631 It is well settled that district courts are afforded broad discretion in sentencing criminal defendants. We will not overturn a court\u2019s sentencing decision, including the imposition of parole eligibility restrictions, absent an abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Blake </em>(1995) 274 Mont. 349, 351, 908 P.2d 676, 677 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b632 As pointed out earlier, at the oral pronouncement of the sentence, the District Court restricted Christianson\u2019s parole eligibility because of the heinous nature of the crime. It found that Christianson let his daughter die a painful death without showing any compassion.</p>\n<p id=\"Atq\">\u00b633 When the District Court entered its order amending its prior judgment and commitment, it set forth three reasons for ordering Christianson be ineligible for parole. First, the court noted that the presentence investigation report recommended that Christianson be ineligible for parole. Second, it found that Christianson\u2019s crime was \u201cparticularly awful\u201d and \u201csavage.\u201d It found that Christianson had severed his three-year old daughter\u2019s intestine by severely striking her; that his daughter had died a slow death, because despite her repeated complaints of stomach pain, Christianson failed to give her medical attention; that Christianson had hit his daughter in a similar fashion in the past; and that Christianson was too busy playing video games and drinking beer to assist his daughter. Third, the District Court found that the genuineness of Christianson\u2019s alleged remorse and acceptance of responsibility was questionable. Allowing the small child to suffer for many hours before obtaining medical attention was a crime that shocked the conscience of the court. The court distinguished this case from similar offenses, and noted that this case was particularly unusual because in the court\u2019s experience, most people who have hit their child become immediately remorseful and seek medical attention for the child. Finally, the court noted that Christianson had a lengthy criminal history, consisting primarily of a string of DUI convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u00b634 Christianson argues that there were insufficient reasons for imposing the restriction, and that the District Court therefore abused its discretion. Christianson first contends that the rationale expressed by the District Court in its written order improperly exceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the rationale expressed by the court at the oral pronouncement of sentence. Christianson asserts that according to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 40, where we held that the oral sentence is the legally effective sentence, this Court may not now consider the reasons articulated in the amended written judgment to the extent that they differ from the reasons articulated at the oral pronouncement. In particular, for example, he notes that although the District Court did not articulate Christianson\u2019s lack of remorse as a reason for imposing the restriction at the sentencing hearing, the court articulated that as a reason in the amended judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b63 5 The State, in contrast, contends that this Court may consider all the reasons expressed by the District Court in its amended written judgment. The State notes that the two pronouncements of judgment are consistent. Regardless of the reasons given, Christianson\u2019s parole eligibility is restricted. The State also cites <em>State v. Morrison </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 282, 848 P.2d 514 and <em>State v. Krantz </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 501, 788 P.2d 298, and maintains that where the court has failed to sufficiently articulate its reasons in the judgment, but the record contains substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s determination, the case is remanded to the district court for the purpose of making findings to support the determination. In this case, the State insists that the reasons expressed in the amended judgment are fully supported by the record, and upon remand the District Court was well within its authority to articulate all reasons for imposing the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b636  At this time, however, we need not decide whether this Court can properly consider written reasons that expand the rationale articulated at the sentencing hearing. At both the oral pronouncement of sentence and in the amended written judgment, the District Court stated that it was imposing the parole eligibility restriction due to the brutal and callous nature of Christianson\u2019s crime. The heinous nature of the crime is sufficient reason alone for imposing the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"AfW\">\u00b637 In the past, this Court has upheld restrictions based at least in part upon the heinous nature of the crime. For example, in <em>State v. Heit </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 488, 791 P.2d 1379, this Court noted that the sentencing court set forth facts demonstrating the pointless and brutal nature of the crime. Although the trial court did not specifically articulate that the brutality of the crime distinguished it from other crimes, we stated that the \u201cheinous nature\u201d of the crime as evidenced by the facts specifically found by the trial court make the rational for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the denial of parole eligibility obvious. <em>Heit, </em>242 Mont. at 494, 791 P.2d at 1383-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b638 Christianson emphasizes that at the sentencing hearing, the court failed to articulate his alleged lack of remorse as a reason for the restriction. He also cites <em>Blake, </em>274 Mont. 349,908 P.2d 676, and notes that the court never found he posed a danger to society. But this Court has never set forth a litmus test that must be met before the District Court may impose parole eligibility restrictions. We have never held that parole can be denied only in cases where the defendant poses a danger to society or where the defendant lacks remorse. Instead, we have left that decision to the court\u2019s broad discretion based upon all the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b639 In this case, the District Court recounted several facts and found that Christianson murdered his young daughter in a particularly brutal fashion. It thus concluded that parole restriction was warranted. This decision is left to the sound discretion of the District Court in light of all the evidence. The record supports the District Court\u2019s determination, and we will not substitute our judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b640  Finally, Christianson points to the court\u2019s statement at the sentencing hearing that it felt \u201csomewhat as the representative of [Christianson\u2019s] now deceased child.\u201d Christianson contends that this statement indicates that the District Court became unduly partisan and failed to act as an objective judicial officer. We disagree. When viewed in the context of the entire proceeding, the court\u2019s comment simply underscores its conclusion that the heinous, brutal nature of the crime was sufficient reason alone to withdraw the privilege of parole eligibility. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed the parole eligibility restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b641 Based upon all the foregoing, we hold that the District Court\u2019s restriction of Christianson\u2019s parole eligibility complied with \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA and \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA .</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\u00b642 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b129-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
