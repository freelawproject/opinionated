During a jury trial, she relied on the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force. However, on March 5,1998, the jury convicted her of the lesser-included offense of negligent homicide. She appeals from several of the court\u2019s rulings. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">\u00b62 The following issues are raised in this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court\u2019s instructions on justifiable use of force deny Longstreth her right to due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-16\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it denied Longstreth\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-17\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b478-18\">\u00b65 On December 19,1997, Longstreth was charged by information with the crime of deliberate homicide, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA. The State alleged that she killed Johnny Lee Tudor on December 14, 1997, by stabbing him with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u00b66 Longstreth and Tudor were living together for approximately two years, during which time Tudor was twice convicted of partner assault as a result of physically abusing Longstreth. The abuse followed a general pattern in which Tudor would assault Longstreth physically after he became intoxicated. The evidence established that Longstreth suffered physical injuries on several occasions. As a result, Longstreth would temporarily move in with friends, but always return to live with Tudor.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b67 On the evening of the stabbing, Longstreth and Tudor were arguing at a bar. Tudor was intoxicated. At about 8:30 p.m., they left the bar together; however, Tudor proceeded to another bar while Longstreth drove home to the trailer where they lived. At home, Longstreth made herself a rum-and-coke and watched a movie. She testified that she kept her boots on and her keys in her pocket in case Tudor caused a problem when he came home. Tudor arrived home by taxi between 9:15 and 9:30 p.m., and immediately went to bed. Approximately 15 minutes later, Longstreth looked into the bedroom, saw Tudor lying on the bed, and returned to the living room. Ten minutes later, Tudor came into the living room, began screaming at Longstreth and threw couch cushions at her. Then, he went back to bed. Longstreth sat down at the kitchen table to work on a crossword puzzle. While she was sitting there, Tudor allegedly came into the kitchen and hit her. According to Longstreth, she tried to escape from the kitchen but Tudor blocked her. She testified that out of fear she grabbed a butcher knife and held it out at arm\u2019s length. She thought that by seeing the knife Tudor would back off. Instead, she testified, Tudor came forward and walked into the knife. Longstreth further testified that Tudor then backed off, turned toward the living room, fell down, got back up, walked toward her again, then turned toward the phone. Longstreth said she assumed Tudor would call for help.</p>\n<p id=\"Avq\">\u00b68 After she wiped off the knife, she took it with her and she left the trailer and drove to a bar where she contacted an acquaintance. The acquaintance drove her to his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b69 At the acquaintance\u2019s residence, Longstreth made several telephone calls, including two to the Bozeman police in which she used the name \u201cSarah Parker.\u201d In her first call, which she made at 11:38 p.m., she reported a domestic disturbance at the trailer, but she did not identify the trailer as theirs. In her second call, she asked the police if everything was okay at the trailer. She did not request medical assistance for Tudor in either call.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u00b610 Two police officers were dispatched to the trailer, where they found Tudor dead on the floor wearing only underwear with a stab wound to his chest. The knife entered Tudor just below his left clavicle to a depth of five inches and severed the subclavian vein. There was evidence in the trailer that a struggle had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b611 There was conflicting testimony as to Longstreth\u2019s condition. The testimony was inconsistent as to whether Longstreth showed signs of injury. The testimony suggested, however, that Longstreth did not appear intoxicated and when she was given a breath analysis test at 6:43 a.m., she had a blood alcohol concentration of .000. Longstreth told the police that she did not intend to kill Tudor.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b612 On January 20,1998, Longstreth filed notice of her intention to rely upon the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force. On March 5,1998, after a four-day jury trial, Longstreth was found guilty of the lesser-included offense of negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b613 The District Court committed Longstreth to the Montana Department of Corrections for a term of five years, subject to suspension on the condition that Longstreth apply and be accepted for admission to the Department\u2019s prerelease diversion program. Longstreth also was sentenced to a consecutive term of two years for the use of a weapon, which was suspended. Longstreth was released on bail on June 2, 1998, pending her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u00b6 14 Longstreth rests her appeal on the District Court\u2019s instructions regarding her defense of justifiable use of force. Also, Longstreth appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\u00b615 If the district court\u2019s jury instructions, reviewed as a whole, fully and fairly present the law to the jury, then the jury has been properly instructed. <em>See State v. Stone </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 345, 349, 880 P.2d 1296, 1299. The test to be applied is whether, when an instruction is considered as a part of the whole body of instructions, the instruction is prejudicial to the appealing party. <em>See Stone, </em>266 Mont. at 350, 880 P.2d at 1299 (citing <em>State v. Graves </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 81, 96, 622 P.2d 203, 211-12).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">\u00b616 We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a directed verdict to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>See State v. Berger, </em>1998 MT 170,\u00b6 25, 290 Mont. 78, \u00b6 25, 964 P.2d 725, \u00b6 25; <em>State v. Miller, </em>1998 MT 177, \u00b6 21, 290 Mont. 97, \u00b6 21, 966 P.2d 721, \u00b6 21.A directed verdict of acquittal is appropriate only when no evidence exists to support a guilty verdict. <em>See State v. Clay, </em>1998 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>MT 244, \u00b6 29, 967 P.2d 370, \u00b6 29. We find no abuse of discretion if, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Berger, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b617 Did the District Court\u2019s instructions on justifiable use of force deny Longstreth her right to due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b6 18 After instructing the jury on the statutory elements of deliberate, mitigated, and negligent homicide, the District Court further instructed the jury on Longstreth\u2019s defense of justifiable use of force. Longstreth challenges several of these instructions, essentially arguing that the instructions improperly allocate the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"ADE\">\u00b619 She focuses on Instruction Nos. 18 and 19, in particular. Instruction No. 18, offered as State\u2019s Proposed Instruction No. 9, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">The defendant has the burden of producing sufficient evidence of justification in the use of force to raise a reasonable doubt of her guilt. You are to consider the following requirements of the law in determining whether the use of force claimed by defendant was justified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">(1) The defendant must not be the aggressor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">(2) The danger of harm of the defendant must be a present one and not made by a person without the present ability to carry out the threat;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">(3) The force threatened against the defendant must be unlawful;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">(4) The defendant must actually believe that the danger exists, that is, use of force by her is necessary to avert the danger and that the kind and amount of force which defendant uses is necessary; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">(5) The defendant\u2019s belief, in each of the aspects described, is reasonable even if it is mistaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">You are further advised that even if you determine the use of force by defendant was not justified, the state still has the duty to prove each of the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Instruction No. 19, offered as State\u2019s Proposed Instruction No. 8, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>The defense of justifiable use of force is an affirmative defense and the defendant has the burden of producing sufficient evidence on the issue to raise a reasonable doubt of her guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">If you find that she was justified in the use of force, you must find her not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b620 At the settlement of instructions, Longstreth objected to these instructions contending that they were prejudicial, illogical and that they prevented her from fairly presenting her theory of the case because they failed to properly allocate the burden on the State to prove an absence of justification beyond a reasonable doubt. Although Longstreth does not contest her own burden of producing sufficient evidence to support a finding of justification, she contends that the State should have the burden to prove that a justifiable use of force did not exist. Longstreth contends that in the absence of the State\u2019s burden, she was denied her right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b621 The State first argues that Longstreth failed to object to both instructions. Our review of the transcript, however, discloses that, although somewhat confusing, the defendant sufficiently objected to the instructions. Thus, we conclude that Longstreth has sufficiently preserved this issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b622 The State next contends on a substantive basis that Longstreth\u2019s burden of proof argument lacks any support under Montana case law. Indeed, this Court has consistently stated over the years that justifiable use of force is an affirmative defense and that only the defendant has the burden of producing sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt of her guilt. <em>See, e.g., Miller, </em>\u00b6 5; <em>State v. Daniels </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 1, 16, 682 P.2d 173, 181; <em>Graves, </em>191 Mont. at 92-93, 622 P.2d at <em>210; State v. Cooper </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 68, 72-73, 589 P.2d 133, 136; <em>State v. Grady </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 168, 175, 531 P.2d 681, 684. In <em>Daniels, </em>210 Mont. at 15-16, 682 P.2d at 181, we held that as an affirmative defense, justifiable use of force requires the defendant to produce sufficient evidence on the issue to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt and that the State\u2019s burden is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the offense charged, which does not include the absence of justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u00b623 Longstreth cites <em>State v. Azure </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 47, 591 P.2d 1125, and <em>Graves, </em>and argues that our cases have confused this issue. In <em>Azure, </em>181 Mont. at 54, 591 P.2d at 1130, we stated the jury should be instructed that the State must prove the absence of justification beyond a reasonable doubt; however, we sustained the refusal of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>instruction to that effect because other instructions had covered the subject. Subsequently in <em>Graves, </em>191 Mont. at 92-93, 622 P.2d at 210, this Court referred to the statement made in <em>Azure </em>without disavowing it, but also recognized that justifiable use of force is an affirmative defense rather than an element of deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b624  We addressed both of these cases in our opinion in <em>Daniels </em>and clarified any uncertainties they may have caused. More recently in <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 23, we reiterated that although the State retains the burden of proving the underlying offense beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant who raises justifiable use of force assumes the burden of producing sufficient evidence on the issues to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt. Although Longstreth and <em>amicus </em>urge us to revisit the propriety of our prior case law in regard to affirmative defenses and the relative burdens of the state and the defendant, we are not inclined to do so at this time. We conclude that the District Court committed no error in its use of Instructions Nos. 18 and 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b625 Closely related to Longstreth\u2019s objections to Instructions Nos. 18 and 19 is her objection to Instruction No. 14(a). Instruction No. 14(a) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">In a deliberate homicide, knowledge or purpose may be inferred from the fact that the accused committed a homicide and no circumstances of mitigation, excuse or justification appear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The authority for this instruction is \u00a7 45-5-112, MCA. Longstreth asserts that by allowing the jury to make an inference as to her mental state as a result of her own failure to produce sufficient evidence to establish a justification, and without an instruction that the State had the burden to prove an absence of justification, Instruction No. 14(a) impermissibly shifted the burden of proving an essential element of the crime charged to her. She relies on two United States Supreme Court cases for the proposition that the burden of proof may not shift to the defendant by allowing the jury to presume or infer the presence of one element based simply upon proof of another. <em>See Francis v. Franklin </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 307, 105 S. Ct. 1965, 85 L. Ed. 2d 344; <em>Patterson v. New York </em>(1977), 432 U.S. 197, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281. She also relies on <em>State v. Woods </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 401, 414, 662 P.2d 579, 585, where we recognized that in determining the effect of an instruction, the appropriate question is whether that instruction has the effect of allocating to the defendant some part of the burden of proof that properly rests on the State throughout the trial. To remedy the alleged burden of proof problem prompted by Instruction No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>14(a), Longstreth again suggests that the District Court should have instructed the jury that the State has the burden to prove the absence of justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b626 In <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1979), 185 Mont. 299, 394, 605 P.2d 1000, 1052, <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 970, 100 S. Ct. 2952, 64 L. Ed. 2d 831 (1980), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>448 U.S. 914, 101 S. Ct. 34, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1177 (1980), we pointed out that \u00a7 45-5-112, MCA, allows for a permissive inference by the jury rather than a mandatory inference. We stated that the critical question is whether the permitted inference, when read with the other instructions in the case, relieves the State of its burden of proof to convict the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Coleman, </em>185 Mont. at 394, 605 P.2d at 1052. Just as in <em>Coleman, </em>the District Court here instructed the jury that the State had the burden of proving the guilt of the defendant on the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and that the defendant was presumed innocent until otherwise proven guilty. Our review of the instructions when considered in their entirety did not effectively relieve the State of its obligation to prove every element of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b627  We have repeatedly followed the rationale of <em>Coleman </em>in cases such as <em>Woods, </em>203 Mont. at 412-15, 662 P.2d at 585-86; <em>State v. Gratzer </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 308, 317, 682 P.2d 141, 145-46; and <em>State v. Moore </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 20, 64, 885 P.2d 457, 484-85. In <em>Gratzer, </em>209 Mont. at 317, 682 P.2d at 145-46, a mitigated homicide case, we specifically stated that \u201cto require the State in a deliberate homicide case to negate mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt before the jury may infer purpose or knowledge\u201d was not necessary. In our view, this statement applies equally to the State\u2019s burden on the issue of justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u00b628 We have previously stated that a defendant\u2019s burden of presenting evidence of justifiable use of force as an affirmative defense does not unconstitutionally place a burden of proof upon the defendant. <em>See State v. Warnick </em>(1982), 202 Mont. 120, 130, 656 P.2d 190, 195. In <em>State v. Lopez </em>(1980), 185 Mont. 187, 195-96, 605 P.2d 178, 183, we recognized the following language written by the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">[T]he long-accepted rule was that it was constitutionally permissible to provide that various affirmative defenses were to be proved by the defendant. This did not lead to such abuses or to such widespread redefinition of crime and reduction of the prosecution\u2019s burden that a new constitutional rule was required .... Nor does the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>fact that a majority of the States have now assumed the burden of disproving affirmative defenses for whatever reasons mean that those States that strike a different balance are in violation of the Constitution. <em>Patterson, </em>432 U.S. at 211, 97 S.Ct. at 2327, 53 L.Ed2.d at 292-93.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We also recognized the language in <em>Leland v. Oregon </em>(1952), 343 U.S. 790, 794-96, 72 S. Ct. 1002, 1006, 96 L. Ed. 1302, 1306-1307, in which the United States Supreme Court upheld the defendant\u2019s burden in regard to an affirmative defense so long as the instructions given to the jury made it clear that the burden of proof of guilt, and all the necessary elements of guilt, were placed squarely on the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b629  In the final analysis, we conclude that the jury was properly instructed on the law of justifiable use of force, and that Longstreth was not denied her right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u00b630 Did the District Court err when it denied Longstreth\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\u00b631 At the close of the State\u2019s case, Longstreth moved for a directed verdict, arguing that the State failed to prove the necessary elements of deliberate homicide, which was the only crime for which she was charged. Longstreth asserts that the State failed to introduce evidence necessary to establish that she possessed the mental state of purpose or knowledge to cause the death of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\u00b632 In support of her argument, Longstreth again cites to \u00a7 45-5-112, MCA. Longstreth argues that the State was required to prove its case circumstantially through the inference allowed by \u00a7 45-5-112, MCA, which provides that, in a deliberate homicide case, an accused\u2019s mental state can be inferred only when there is no evidence of mitigation, excuse, or justification. Since the State\u2019s case-in-chief established proof of the abuse Longstreth suffered, the danger she faced, and her justification for killing Tudor, Longstreth argues that her mental state could not have been inferred and that the jury should not have been able to consider any of the other circumstantial evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">\u00b633 The State responds that although the evidence it presented could have supported Longstreth\u2019s justification defense, \u00a7 45-5-112, MCA, does not preclude the jury from considering other circumstantial evidence that bears on the issue of Longstreth\u2019s mental state. In support of its argument, the State cites \u00a7 45-2-103(3), MCA, which allows a jury to infer the existence of a mental state from the acts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>accused and the facts and circumstances connected with the offense. The State argues that \u00a7 45-5-112, MCA, does not render \u00a7 45-2-103(3), MCA, inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b634  Section 45-5-112, MCA, permits the jury in a deliberate homicide case to infer a defendant\u2019s mental state so long as two conditions are met: (1) the accused committed a homicide; and (2) no circumstances of mitigation, excuse, or justification appear. There is nothing in \u00a7 45-5-112, MCA, however, which suggests that knowledge or purpose may be inferred only in the absence of evidence of justification. Furthermore, we have held that the ultimate determination of mental state is left to the finder of fact. <em>See </em>Moore, 268 Mont. at 64, 885 P.2d at 484. As we previously have stated, \u201ccriminal intent, being a state of mind, is rarely susceptible of direct or positive proof and therefore must usually be inferred from the facts testified to by witnesses and the circumstances as developed by the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Ortega </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 285, 289, 679 P.2d 793, 795 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b635 We conclude that all the evidence the State presented, both direct and circumstantial, was properly considered by the jury. Therefore, the District Court did not err when it denied Longstreth\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
