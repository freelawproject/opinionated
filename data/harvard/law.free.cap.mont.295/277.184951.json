Lande, Kip H. Lande and Kande L. Lande (the Contestants) appeal from the Order for Attorneys Fees and Costs entered by the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Big Horn County. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in concluding that attorney fees and costs were not waived by the personal representatives\u2019 failure to file a timely memorandum under \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees when the fee issue was not included in the pretrial order?</p>\n<p id=\"b298-17\">\u00b65 3. Are the costs and attorney fees awarded by the District Court proper and reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b298-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b298-20\">\u00b66 This appeal arises from the Contestants\u2019 unsuccessful challenge to a will executed by their adoptive father, decedent Thor K. Lande (Cubby). The Contestants claimed that Cubby lacked testamentary capacity and was unduly influenced when he executed his December 30, 1996, will. The will contest was tried to a jury and the jury returned a special verdict finding that Cubby had testamentary capacity and was not unduly influenced when he executed the will. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>admitted Cubby\u2019s will to probate and confirmed the designated co- personal representatives. The Contestants appealed and we affirmed. <em>See Estate of Lande, </em>1999 MT 162, [295 Mont. 160], 983 P.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b67 The personal representatives subsequently claimed attorney fees and costs on behalf of Cubby\u2019s estate pursuant to \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA. The Contestants resisted the claim on several grounds. The District Court rejected the Contestants\u2019 arguments, concluding that the estate was statutorily entitled to attorney fees and costs. The court also concluded that, while \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, requires a party claiming costs to file a bill of costs within five days of the verdict or notice of the court\u2019s decision and the estate did not timely file such a bill of costs, \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, was not applicable in the present case. The court determined that the hourly rates charged were reasonable and \u201cthe hours, no doubt, were actually put into the trial and preparation of the case.\u201d The District Court ultimately ordered the Contestants to pay to the estate, out of any sum they ultimately might recover from the estate, the sum of $76,108.30 for attorney fees and costs. Notice of entry of judgment was filed and served and the Contestants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b68  We review a district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Hauck v. Seright, </em>1998 MT 198, \u00b6 43, 290 Mont. 309, \u00b6 43, 964 P.2d 749, \u00b6 43. We review a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Choteau Library Bd. v. Teton County Bd. </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 87, 90, 938 P.2d 1357, 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b69 1. Did the District Court err in concluding that attorney fees and costs were not waived by the personal representatives\u2019 failure to file a timely memorandum under \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">\u00b610 On appeal, the Contestants reassert their argument that the personal representatives were required to follow the procedure set forth in \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, to recover fees and costs under \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, for successfully defending the validity of Cubby\u2019s will. As a result of the personal representatives\u2019 failure to comply with the statute, the Contestants contend that the right to fees and costs was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">\u00b6 11 The Contestants focus first on attorney fees and rely on <em>Craver v. Waste Mgt. Partners of Bozeman </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 37, 874 P.2d 1. There, as the Contestants point out, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">As provided by statute, claimants in whose favor a judgment is rendered may recover or tax costs, <em>including attorney fees, </em>by deliv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ering a copy of the memorandum of costs to the court and to the adverse party within five days of the judgment. Section 25-10-501, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><em>Craver, </em>265 Mont. at 46, 874 P.2d at 6 (emphasis added). Thus, according to the Contestants, we clearly included memoranda regarding attorney fees within the five-day filing requirement set forth in \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, and application of that statute here requires a conclusion that the personal representatives \u2014 who did not file their claim for attorney fees within five days \u2014 waived their right to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b6 12 In revisiting <em>Craver, </em>however, we determine it was incorrectly decided. Section 25-10-501, MCA, is captioned \u201cBill of costs.\u201d It provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">[t]he party in whose favor judgment is rendered and who claims his costs must deliver to the clerk and serve upon the adverse party, within 5 days after the verdict or notice of the decision of the court... a memorandum of the items of his costs and necessary disbursements in the action or proceeding ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Section 25-10-501, MCA. As its caption and plain language indicate, the statute addresses memoranda of costs only; it does not address claims for attorney fees or require that such claims be submitted within five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\u00b613 <em>Craver </em>also departed from our prior cases holding that the requirements of \u00a7 25-10- 501, MCA, do not apply to claims for attorney fees. In <em>Cook v. Harrington </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 479, 482, 661 P.2d 1287, 1288, we reasoned that \u201cTitle 25, Chapter 10 of the Montana Code Annotated deals with the imposition and allowance of costs\u201d recoverable under \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA. We observed that, with certain limited exceptions not including attorney fees, the \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, list of recoverable costs was exclusive. <em>Cook, </em>203 Mont. at 482, 661 P.2d at 1288 (citation omitted). As a result, we held that \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, which requires that a bill of costs be delivered within five days, \u201cdoes not apply to attorney fees.\u201d Cook, 203 Mont. at 482, 661 P.2d at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"Asa\">\u00b614 We addressed a somewhat similar issue in <em>Schillinger v. Brewer </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 333, 697 P.2d 919, which involved whether attorney fees were \u201ccosts\u201d in a mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure case. We observed that \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, did not say that fees were costs and, citing again to \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, determined that costs generally allowable do not include attorney fees. <em>Schillinger, </em>215 Mont. at 337, 697 P.2d at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u00b615  On the basis of both the plain language of \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, and our prior cases, we conclude that our <em>Craver </em>determination that claims for attorney fees are within the scope of \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, was incorrect. Therefore, that portion of <em>Craver </em>is overruled. We further conclude that the five-day filing requirement set forth in \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, does not apply to attorney fees to which a party is entitled by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b616 The Contestants also argue that, even if attorney fees are not within the ambit of \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, the personal representatives did not timely file their bill of costs thereunder and, therefore, their right to costs was waived. According to the Contestants, the District Court erred in interpreting certain statutes to reach a contrary result. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b617 Section 72-12-206, MCA, mandates that costs incurred in successfully defending the validity of a will be paid by the party contesting the will\u2019s validity. The District Court concluded that a conflict existed between \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, and \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, and that, because \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, was a specific statute relating to probate actions, it controlled over \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, which generally requires that a bill of costs be filed within five days of the verdict or notice of the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b618 The problem with the District Court\u2019s analysis is that the two statutes do not conflict. Section 72-12-206, MCA, mandates that an unsuccessful will contestant pay the costs incurred in the will contest. It does not, however, provide a procedure via which the successful defender of the will\u2019s validity obtains those costs. Section 25-10-501, MCA, on the other hand, does provide such a procedure. Thus, while both statutes address costs, they do so in unrelated contexts and are not inconsistent with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b619 The District Court also concluded that a will contest is a special proceeding under \u00a7 27-1-102, MCA, and costs in special proceedings are allowed as a matter of course to the prevailing party pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-101(4), MCA. We conclude, however, that neither \u00a7 27-1-102, MCA, nor \u00a7 25-10-101(4), MCA, is relevant to the issue of whether the personal representatives were required to file their bill of costs within five days under \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u00b620 Part 1 of Chapter 10, Title 25 of the Montana Code Annotated addresses the imposition of costs. Section 25-10-101, MCA, addresses when costs are allowed as a matter of course to a plaintiff upon a judgment in his or her favor; such situations include, in subsection (3), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>costs in an action for the recovery of money or damages when the plaintiff recovers over $50 and, in subsection (4), on which the District Court relied, costs in a special proceeding. Section 25-10-102, MCA, provides for costs as a matter of course to a prevailing defendant in the situations set forth in \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA. Section 25-10-103, MCA, addresses when costs are discretionary. Given their placement in the part of Title 25 addressing imposition of costs, it is not surprising that none of these statutes provides the means or manner in which costs are to be claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b621 Part 2 of Chapter 10, Title 25 of the Montana Code Annotated addresses which costs generally are allowable to a party claiming costs. <em>See, </em>e.g., \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA. Again, and not surprisingly, nothing in that part of Title 25 provides for the manner in which costs must be claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b622 Part 5 of Chapter 10, Title 25 of the Montana Code Annotated is captioned \u201cClaiming Costs.\u201d By its caption, and by the terms of the statutes contained therein, Part 5 provides the means and manner in which costs are to be claimed. Nothing in those statutes makes a distinction or exception for costs being claimed in different types of actions. Indeed, as set forth above, \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, mandates that a prevailing party who \u201cclaims his costs\u201d must file an itemized memorandum of claimed costs within five days of the verdict or notice of the court\u2019s decision. The language of the statute is plain and unequivocal in encompassing all claims for costs. Thus, the District Court\u2019s implicit conclusion that costs incurred in a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d need not be claimed within the five-day period required by \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, is incorrect. Nor could it be otherwise. Carrying the court\u2019s determination to its logical conclusion, all costs allowed as a matter of course under \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA, to prevailing plaintiffs \u2014 and presumably all costs allowed to prevailing defendants under \u00a7 25-10-102, MCA \u2014 would be exempt from the \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, time requirement and the exemptions would swallow the clear five-day requirement of \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b623  We hold, therefore, that the District Court correctly concluded that the \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, five-day requirement for filing a memorandum of costs does not include memoranda or affidavits relating to attorney fees sought pursuant to \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA. We further hold, however, that the District Court erred in concluding that the \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, requirement for memoranda of costs was not applicable to the personal representatives\u2019 claim for costs. As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the personal representatives are not entitled to an award of costs and this case must be remanded for modification of the judgment to delete costs awarded in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b624 2. Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees when the fee issue was not included in the pretrial order?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b625 It is undisputed that no request for attorney fees was included in the pretrial order in this case. In the District Court, the Contestants relied on a number of Montana cases in arguing that the absence of an attorney fee issue in the pretrial order precluded the personal representatives from raising the issue after trial. The District Court observed that the Contestants were correct in asserting that the issue was not raised in the pretrial order, but concluded that \u201c\u00a7 72-12-206 M.C.A. seems to provide for attorney fees ... anyway.\u201d The Contestants contend that the court erred. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b626 The purposes of pretrial orders are to \u201cprevent surprise, simplify the issues, and permit the parties to prepare for <em>trial.\u201dNentwig v. United Industry, Inc. </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 134, 138-39, 845 P.2d 99, 102. Requiring inclusion in the pretrial order of a request for attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, which mandates such fees in the event a party successfully defends the validity of a will, would not further those purposes. Indeed, where attorney fees are a straightforward statutory entitlement in the event a party prevails in the action, no surprise could result from a posttrial claim by such a successful party for the statutorily-mandated fees. In addition, inclusion in the pretrial order of the subject of attorney fees which become an entitlement only after the prevailing party has been determined at trial could neither simplify trial issues nor allow for better trial preparation, since no evidence need be presented on the question and no legal determinations are required before or during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b627 The Contestants rely, however, on <em>Simmons Oil Corp. v. Wells Fargo Bank, </em>1998 MT 129, 289 Mont. 119, 960 P.2d 291, and <em>Naftco Leasing Ltd. v. Finalco, Inc. </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 89, 835 P.2d 728, in support of their argument that failure to raise the issue of attorney fees in the pretrial order waives the right to recover fees. Those cases are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">\u00b628 In <em>Naftco Leasing, </em>the plaintiffs sued to reform certain lease agreements based on mistake. <em>Naftco Leasing, </em>254 Mont. at 91, 835 P.2d at 730. The district court concluded that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations and awarded attorney fees to the defendant even though the fee issue was not contained in the pretrial order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>Naftco Leasing, </em>254 Mont. at 92-93, 835 P.2d at 730-31. On appeal, we affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that the statute of limitations barred the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, but concluded that the court improperly awarded attorney fees to the defendant. <em>Naftco Leasing, </em>254 Mont. at 93-95, 835 P.2d at 731-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b629 With regard to fees, we noted that both parties had included attorney fee claims in the pleadings, but neither party did so in the pretrial order. The defendant attempted to rely on <em>Bell v. Richards </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 215, 741 P.2d 788, where we allowed attorney fees even though the defendants had not mentioned the issue in the pretrial order. <em>Naftco Leasing, </em>254 Mont. at 93-94, 835 P.2d at 731. Our holding in <em>Bell, </em>however, was based on the plaintiffs having claimed the right to fees in the pretrial order pursuant to contractual language, and on the existence of the \u201creciprocal attorney fee\u201d provision in \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA. <em>Bell, </em>228 Mont. at 219, 741 P.2d at 791. We distinguished <em>Bell </em>on several grounds in <em>Naftco Leasing, </em>however, including that the lease agreements did not include an attorney fees provision raised by one of the parties in the pretrial order. Instead, in <em>Naftco Leasing, </em>the defendant belatedly attempted to obtain attorney fees solely under the \u201creciprocal fees\u201d statute absent any mention in the pretrial order or any ability to recover fees under the lease agreements themselves. Under those circumstances, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s failure to include the attorney fees issue in the pretrial order waived the right to raise it at a later time. <em>Naftco Leasing, </em>254 Mont. at 95, 835 P.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b630 We addressed a similar attorney fees issue in <em>Simmons Oil. </em>There, the defendant bank had requested attorney fees in its pleadings, but neither party referenced the issue in the pretrial order. Simmons Oil then requested attorney fees posttrial, relying on the bank\u2019s request for fees in its pleadings, and the district court denied the request. <em>Simmons Oil, </em>\u00b6 16. On appeal, Simmons Oil relied on the \u201creciprocal fees\u201d statute in arguing that attorney fees should be reciprocal and awarded, while the bank advanced <em>Naftco Leasing </em>as controlling when attorney fees are neither explicit nor implicit in the pretrial order. We affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of attorney fees with little discussion, stating only that we \u201ccannot find the District Court abused its discretion by denying the request since it was not contained in the Pretrial Order, and, thus, not before the court.\u201d <em>Simmons Oil, </em>\u00b6 41 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\u00b631 The circumstances before us in the present case are dissimilar to those in <em>Naftco Leasing </em>and <em>Simmons Oil, </em>neither of which involved a stand-alone, statutorily-mandated award of fees to the party prevailing at trial. Here, \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, entitled the successful defenders against a will contest to attorney fees as a matter of law. Hence, <em>Naftco Leasing </em>and <em>Simmons Oil </em>are inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b632  We conclude that the District Court did not err in concluding that the attorney fees mandated by \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, were available to the personal representatives notwithstanding their failure to include the issue in the pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b633 3. Are the costs and attorney fees awarded by the District Court proper and reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b634 The Contestants\u2019 first assertion of error with regard to the amount of costs and attorney fees awarded is that certain of the costs were not authorized by statute or otherwise. In light of our conclusion above that the personal representatives waived their right to recover costs by their failure to timely file a bill of costs as required by \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, we need not address this assertion of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b635  With regard to the amount of attorney fees awarded, the Contestants concede that the hourly rates were reasonable and that the itemized hours undoubtedly were put into the trial and preparation. Their first contention in this regard is that the number of hours submitted was unreasonable primarily because two separate law firms \u2014 a total of three lawyers \u2014 worked on the case for the personal representatives, resulting in extra billing for some hours spent on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\u00b636 The problem with the Contestants\u2019 argument that the number of hours submitted was unreasonable is that it is not supported by the record. The lead lawyer for the personal representatives testified at the hearing on the motion for costs and attorney fees that she felt additional counsel would be helpful and needed, and hired an attorney outside her firm who was familiar with the types of matters involved in the will contest. Moreover, the personal representatives presented an attorney witness experienced in probate matters who testified that it is not unusual to associate other counsel with cases and that, under such circumstances, \u201ceverybody charges for their time.\u201d The witness further testified that she had reviewed the time submitted for all the attorneys involved in the personal representatives\u2019 case and that the time appeared to be reasonable. The Contestants did not present a witness to controvert or dispute this testimony. On this re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>cord, we conclude that the attorney fees awarded by the District Court were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b637 The Contestants\u2019 remaining arguments on this issue are less than clear. They seem to posit that, because the personal representatives had some interest in the estate, the personal representatives\u2019 actions in defending against the Contestants\u2019 challenge to Cubby\u2019s will did not comport with the requirement contained in \u00a7 72-3-606(2), MCA, that personal representatives take steps \u201creasonably necessary for the management, protection, and preservation of the estate ....\u201d In other words, the Contestants theorize that, absent their own interest in the estate, the personal representatives would not have incurred such significant legal fees in defending against the will contest. Under these circumstances, the Contestants urge that the legal services for which the attorney fees were incurred were not reasonable because they were not \u201cbeneficial to the estate\u201d as required by <em>Matter of Estate of Stone </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 1, 4, 768 P.2d 334, 336.</p>\n<p id=\"ACh\">\u00b638 The primary problem with the Contestants\u2019 argument is that it is premised on the purely speculative theory that the personal representatives\u2019 defense against the challenge to Cubby\u2019s will was motivated by their personal interest in the estate, rather than intended to meet their statutory obligation under \u00a7 72-3-606(2), MCA, to \u201ctake all steps reasonably necessary for the ... protection, and preservation of the estate ...\u201d We will not address this speculative theory. Moreover, superimposing \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, which mandates legal fees to the successful defender against a will contest, onto \u00a7 72-3-606(2), MCA, appears to reflect a legislative determination that defending against a will contest constitutes a reasonably necessary step for the protection of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b639 Finally, the Contestants\u2019 reliance on <em>Estate of Stone </em>is far from clear. In any event, however, the case is distinguishable on both the facts and the law. <em>Estate of Stone </em>involved a personal representative, removed for cause pursuant to a petition by devisees, including in his final account a disbursement for legal fees for the lawyer hired to defend him against the petition for removal. The disbursement was claimed under \u00a7 72-3-632, MCA, which entitles a personal representative who defends or prosecutes any proceeding in good faith to receive from the estate necessary expenses and disbursements, including reasonable attorney fees incurred. <em>Estate of Stone, </em>236 Mont. at 3, 768 P.2d at 335. Those facts are entirely different from the facts before us in the present case. Furthermore, the statute at issue in <em>Estate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>of Stone </em>is not only not at issue here, it is of an entirely different nature and scope than \u00a7 72-12- 206, MCA. The <em>Estate of Stone </em>statute entitles a personal representative to recover disbursements \u2014 including reasonable attorney fees \u2014 from the estate upon a showing that a proceeding was prosecuted or defended in good faith. Section 72-12-206, MCA, on the other hand, requires an unsuccessful contestant of the validity of a will to pay attorney fees incurred in successfully defending the will. Given these factual and legal distinctions betweenNstafe <em>of Stone </em>and the present case, we will not address that case or the Contestants\u2019 argument thereunder further.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b640 We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion with regard to the award or amount of attorney fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b641 Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for modification of the judgment to delete the costs awarded to the personal representatives.</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
