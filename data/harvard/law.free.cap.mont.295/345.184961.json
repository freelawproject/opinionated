The District Court granted summary judgment to Dr. Schweitzer on the basis that Gilkey failed to establish a prima facie case. She appeals from that order and judgment. We reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it relied on the Daubert<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rule to exclude opinion evidence offered by Gilkey to prove that the defendant breached the applicable standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">\u00b63 The following facts were before the District Court by deposition or affidavit. Because Gilkey\u2019s claim was resolved by summary judgment, we set forth the facts most favorable to her claim. However, we note these facts are controverted and factual issues have not been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">\u00b64 Joseph Gilkey was afflicted with cancer of the colon and rectum which, despite treatment, spread to his left lung. On June 4,1991, he underwent a pneumonectomy to remove part of the lung. In order to remove the lung, the procedure required that a large incision be made from approximately the middle of Joseph\u2019s back to the middle of his chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">\u00b65 Anesthesiologist Mike Schweitzer, M.D. discussed with Joseph the significant pain that he would probably experience following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>surgery and recommended that he be allowed to insert a \u201cthoracic spinal epidural catheter\u201d between the vertebrae of Joseph\u2019s thoracic spine and alongside his spinal cord. From the catheter, anesthetic drugs could then be delivered directly to the area of the spinal cord nearest the pain source. The purpose of this procedure was to significantly reduce Joseph\u2019s postsurgical pain without administration of postoperative narcotics in a manner that would disburse them throughout his entire body. Joseph consented to the procedure as described to him. Dr. Schweitzer later admitted that, during his discussion with Joseph about the procedure, he did not differentiate the risks of administering an epidural catheter while a patient is asleep under general anesthesia as opposed to while a patient is awake.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b66 Dr. Schweitzer\u2019s first attempt to insert the catheter failed, but on the second attempt, Joseph\u2019s medical chart indicates that the catheter was inserted \u201cwithout complications.\u201d However, after the surgery Joseph\u2019s left leg was paralyzed. By the time he left the hospital a few days later he was able to walk with a cane, but according to one of Gilkey\u2019s medical experts, he continued to manifest objective signs of upper motor neuron injury until his death from cancer approximately two and one-half years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b67 Gilkey retained Eric Grigsby, M.D. as an expert. It was his opinion that Dr. Schweitzer violated the standard of care when he failed to inform Joseph that a greater risk was posed by the catheterization procedure if it was administered while Joseph was under general anesthesia, as opposed to while he was awake. Dr. Grigsby opined in his deposition that Dr. Schweitzer breached the standard of care \u201cwith regard to ... informed consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b68 Dr. Schweitzer moved for summary judgment on the basis that there was no medical or scientific basis to support Dr. Grigsby\u2019s conclusion that placement of a thoracic spinal epidural catheter while a patient is anesthetized increases the risk of injury. The District Court agreed and concluded that Dr. Grigsby\u2019s opinion regarding the standard of care was inadmissible because it was not based on scientific evidence supported by reliable methodology or research. The District Court awarded summary judgment on the basis that without a qualified medical opinion, Gilkey could not prove medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b69 Our standard of review on appeal from summary judgment orders is de novo. <em>See Motarle v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156; <em>Mead v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>M.S.B., Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 465, 470, 872 P.2d 782, 785. We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment to determine whether it was correctly decided pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., which provides that summary judgment is only appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b6 10 Did the District Court err when it relied on the <em>Daubert </em>rule to exclude Dr. Grigsby\u2019s opinion regarding the proper standard of care?</p>\n<p id=\"AIcV\">\u00b611 The District Court concluded that Gilkey\u2019s efforts to establish a standard of care for informed consent through expert witness testimony were efforts to introduce novel scientific evidence of the type contemplated by this court <em>in Hulse v. State of Montana, </em>1998 MT 108, 289 Mont. 94, 961 P.2d 75, and by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469. The District Court further concluded that Dr. Grigsby was not qualified pursuant to Rule 702, M.R.Evid., to testify concerning the applicable standard of care in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b612 Gilkey contends that she sought to offer, through Dr. Grigsby, medical opinion testimony that Dr. Schweitzer deviated from the appropriate standard of care as a result of his failure to obtain Joseph\u2019s implied consent. She argues that Dr. Grigsby\u2019s testimony was not offered to establish that placing the catheter during sleep deviates from the standard of care, but to establish that a reasonable medical doctor would have informed his patient of the difference in potential risks involved if the procedure is performed while the patient is asleep rather than awake, and that without that advice, informed consent could not be given. She contends that Dr. Grigsby\u2019s credentials as a Board Certified Anaesthesiologist, qualified him to express that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u00b613 Gilkey contends that Dr. Grigsby\u2019s opinion does not introduce the type of novel scientific evidence contemplated by <em>Hulse </em>and <em>Daubert, </em>but simply the opinion of another medical professional as to what information a doctor should provide to his patient so that the patient may give his informed consent to a medical procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u00b614 Dr. Schweitzer contends that Dr. Grigsby\u2019s testimony articulates a novel theory, which is that there is an increased risk from placing the catheter while asleep, rather than while awake. He contends that because Dr. Grigsby\u2019s opinion relies on this theory to support his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>conclusion that it was necessary for Dr. Schweitzer to inform Joseph of the difference in levels of risk, Dr. Grigsby was required to show that his opinion was arrived at by reliable scientific methods or that there was some medical literature or other objective evidence supporting his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b615 The District Court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible, and absent a showing of abuse of discretion, the trial court\u2019s determination will not be overturned. <em>See Burlingham v. Mintz </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 277, 279, 891 P.2d 527, 529. \u00b616 Rule 702, M.R.Evid. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b617  In Montana, the threshold obligation of a plaintiff in a medical malpractice case is twofold: first, evidence must be presented to establish the standard of professional care in the type of case involved; second, it must be shown that the doctor negligently departed from this recognized standard in his treatment of the plaintiff. This is typically established through expert testimony because the conduct complained of is usually not readily ascertainable by a layman. <em>See Montana Deaconess Hosp. v. Gratton </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 185, 189, 545 P.2d 670, 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b6 18 \u201c[T]he <em>Daubert </em>test should be used only to determine the admissibility of novel scientific evidence.\u201d <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b657, <em>reaffirming State v. Cline </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 46, 909 P.2d 1171. The issue in <em>Daubert </em>was the admissibility of a novel scientific theory that the ingestion of the antinausea drug Bendectin by pregnant women caused birth defects in their children. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at <em>passim, </em>113 S. Ct. at <em>passim, </em>125 L. Ed. 2d at <em>passim. </em>Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority in <em>Daubert, </em>noted that in addition to scientific expert testimony, \u201cRule 702 also applies to \u2018technical, or other specialized knowledge.\u2019 [The Court\u2019s] discussion is limited to the scientific context because that is the nature of the expertise offered here.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 590 n.8, 113 S. Ct. at 2795 n.8, 125 L. Ed. 2d at 481 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\u00b619 The issue in <em>Hulse </em>was the admissibility of opinion testimony from a police officer that a person\u2019s failure of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) field sobriety test accurately predicted intoxication. <em>See Hulse, </em>\u00b643. The defendant argued that the HGN test was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>novel scientific evidence to which the <em>Daubert </em>test must be applied. We disagreed that <em>Daubert </em>applied to the facts in that case. It is equally important to note what was said about <em>Daubert\u2019s </em>application to circumstances such as these. Citing with approval, decisions from other jurisdictions that involved medical opinion testimony, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">Other jurisdictions have similarly held that <em>Daubert </em>is limited to novel scientific evidence. Recently, a federal district court concluded that \u201cFed.R.Evid. 702 is still viable and the principles enunciated in <em>Daubert </em>should be narrowly limited to controversial and novel scientific evidence.\u201d <em>Thornton v. Caterpillar, Inc. </em>(D.S.C. 1997), 951 F.Supp. 575, 578 (holding that mechanical engineer\u2019s testimony concerning design defect and lack of adequate warning fell within technical and specialized knowledge, \u201cnot within the narrowly limited area of unique, untested and novel scientific evidence as enunciated in <em>Daubert\"). See Waitek v. Daikon Shield Claimants Trust </em>(N.D. Iowa 1996), 934 F.Supp. 1068, 1087-89 n.10 (providing an extensive list of federal courts so holding) (concluding in the case <em>subjudice that Daubert did not apply to a gynecologist\u2019s expert testimony because his opinions \u201dwere not based on a novel scientific test or a unique, controversial methodology or technique; rather, he based his opinions on his experience and training as both a gynecologist and as a doctor experienced in the use of and medical problems associated with the Daikon Shield\"). See also Williams v. Hedican </em>(Iowa 1997), 561 N.W.2d 817, 825-27 (concluding, in dicta, that the approach taken in <em>Thornton </em>and other federal courts restricting <em>Daubert </em>in favor of a conventional Rule 702 analysis was reasonable); <em>Collins v. Commonwealth </em>(Ky. 1997), 951 S.W.2d 569, 574-75 (concluding that although the court previously adopted the <em>Daubert </em>analysis, <em>Daubert </em>was not triggered because the doctor\u2019s expert testimony concerned basic female anatomical findings that \u201cdid not involve any novel scientific techniques or theories\u201d); and <em>State v. Hodgson </em>(Minn. 1994), 512 N.W.2d 95, 98 (acknowledging that Minnesota follows the Frye test and declining to address the impact of <em>Daubert </em>because the issue <em>sub judice </em>involved the expert testimony of a forensic odontologist concerning bite mark analysis which was not a novel or emerging type of scientific evidence).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><em>See Hulse, </em>\u00b658 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u00b620 In this case, Gilkey sought to establish through Dr. Grigsby\u2019s testimony the amount of information an anesthesiologist should provide to his patient in order to obtain the patient\u2019s informed consent prior to performing a procedure to insert a thoracic spinal epidural catheter. Dr. Grigsby\u2019s opinion required the specialized knowledge of a medical professional. It did not involve novel scientific evidence. Therefore, we conclude that it was not subject to the <em>Daubert </em>foundational requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b621 Dr. Schweitzer has argued that there is no scientific evidence that there is an increased risk to the patient when the catheter is placed during sleep. Gilkey responds that a patient\u2019s simple ability to experience and report pain, if awake, makes the procedure safer while awake and that this common sense observation does not require scientific support. These arguments go to the weight of Dr. Grigsby\u2019s opinion, rather than to the admissibility of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AWL\">\u00b622  We conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it decided that Dr. Grigsby was not qualified to testify to the applicable standard of care in this case and that his testimony was not admissible. We reverse the decision of the District Court to exclude Dr. Grigsby\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b623 The District Court\u2019s award of summary judgment was based on its conclusion that without expert testimony which established a standard of care, Gilkey could not establish the existence of a legal duty as part of her prima facie case. Because we conclude that the District Court erred when it excluded Dr. Grigsby\u2019s opinion testimony, we reverse the order which granted summary judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with our decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and GRAY concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-13\">. <em>Daubert v.
