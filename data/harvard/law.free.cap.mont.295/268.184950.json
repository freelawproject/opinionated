Bird Power Plant in Billings, Montana. As part of the agreement between the parties, Moon executed two promissory notes in favor of Environmental. The first note was made in the principal amount of $100,000, payable by an initial installment of $50,000 on or before January 1,1997, and a final installment of $50,000 on or before June 1,1997. Moon failed to pay either installment, and on March 11,1997, the parties agreed to extend the payment date on the entire note to May 17,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b67 The second note was made in the principal amount of $55,000, payable by cashier\u2019s check on or before May 13,1997, and accruing interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum from September 5, 1996, until payment of the note. The note recites that the instrument was executed by Moon in exchange for Environmental\u2019s promise to forego immediate collection action on a dishonored check on which Moon had wrongfully stopped payment. Moon had issued the check to Environmental for the purpose of obtaining additional bonding on the salvage project.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b68 Environmental filed the present action to collect the amounts due under the two promissory notes, along with a separate action alleging breach of contract on the salvage project. Moon acknowledged in his pleadings before the District Court that he executed the promissory notes, but asserted, among other things, that the amounts due on the notes had been paid from other sources, or in the alternative, that the notes were not enforceable for lack of consideration. Moon also filed a motion before the District Court requesting that this action be consolidated with Environmental\u2019s breach of contract claim. The District Court denied Moon\u2019s motion to consolidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b69 Environmental filed a motion for summary judgment for the amounts of the promissory notes, along with supporting affidavits stating that both notes were in default. The District Court initially scheduled a hearing on the summary judgment motion for October 14,1998, but subsequently moved the hearing back by one week due to a conflict in attorney schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b610 Moon filed a motion pursuant to Rule 55(f), M.R.Civ.P, seeking to have the summary judgment hearing further continued so that additional discovery could be performed. The District Court effectively denied this motion when it conducted the summary judgment hearing and granted summary judgment in favor of Environmental.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u00b611 Moon appeals the denial of his motion to consolidate, the <em>de facto </em>denial of his motion to continue, and the grant of summary judgment in favor of Environmental. Environmental raises the additional issue of whether Moon\u2019s conduct during the mandatory mediation process of Rule 54, M.R.App.R, warrants the dismissal of Moon\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b6 12 1. Is this appeal subject to dismissal for Moon\u2019s failure to comply with the mandatory mediation requirements of Rule 54, M.R.App.R?</p>\n<p id=\"AL-\">\u00b613 In its appellate brief, Environmental urges this Court to sanction Moon for his uncooperative behavior during the appellate mediation process mandated by Rule 54, M.R.App.R, by dismissing this appeal. In particular, Environmental argues that Rule 54(e)(3), M.R.App.P, requires the mediation conference to be held in person except where impractical due to time, distance or other considerations, and that Moon\u2019s failure to appear in person at the mediation conference constitutes grounds for sanctions under the Rule. As support for its request for sanctions, Environmental relies on a letter by the mediator in which Moon\u2019s participation in the mediation is summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">At the appointed time for mediation, namely, 9:00 a.m., May 3, 1999, Mr. Moon did not appear. Mr. Frank Kolendick, on behalf of Respondent, did appear in person. Mr. Jeffs, counsel for Mr. Moon, did appear and indicated that Mr. Moon was unable to obtain a plane from Salt Lake City Sunday afternoon and evening or early Monday morning. He explained that he was on the waiting list for three planes on Sunday and one Monday morning but that he was not able to get on any of the airplanes. At my suggestion, we made phone contact with Mr. Moon and asked him to explain further. At that time, and in front of the other persons at the mediation, he indicated that he did not obtain a reservation in advance and made no effort to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">Notwithstanding his absence, at my request we made some effort to determine the position of the parties and to engage in some meaningful mediation with Mr. Moon participating by phone. The mediation was not successful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b6 14 Moon responds that his failure to personally attend the mediation conference did not violate Rule 54, because the Rule expressly provides that a party may participate in a mediation conference via a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>representative, provided that representative has full authority to engage in settlement negotiations. Although Moon was unable to attend the conference, his counsel, Mr. Jeffs, was in attendance and had full authority to negotiate on Moon\u2019s behalf. Moreover, Moon argues, Rule 54 makes no provision for the imposition of sanctions against a party who declines to participate in mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b615  Although Environmental is correct that under Rule 54(e)(3), M.R.App.R, in-person meetings are the preferred medium of communication for mediation conferences, this Rule addresses only the means by which the conference may be conducted, not who is required to attend. That requirement is addressed in Rule 54(e)(8), M.R.App.R, which expressly provides that \u201c[e]ach party, or a representative of each party with authority to participate in settlement negotiations and effect a complete compromise of the case, shall be required to participate in the mediation conference.\u201d Based on the record before us, we hold that Moon\u2019s participation in the mediation process was within the bounds permitted by Rule 54, M.R.App.R, notwithstanding his failure to appear in person at the mediation conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b6 16 Because we hold that Moon\u2019s conduct during the settlement negotiations did not violate the parameters of Rule 54, M.R.App.P., we decline at this time to address whether a party may be sanctioned under Rule 54 for failure to participate in mandatory alternative dispute resolution on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b617 2. Did the District Court err when it ruled on the motion for summary judgment without allowing Moon the opportunity to conduct further discovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b618 Moon contends that Environmental\u2019s motionfor summaryjudgment was premature because of an inadequate opportunity to depose various persons or obtain documents which might demonstrate whether payment on the notes was made, and if so, in what manner.</p>\n<p id=\"AoNf\">\u00b619 Rule 56(f), M.R.Civ.P., provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party\u2019s opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">District courts have inherent discretionary power to control discovery. <em>J.L. v. Kienenberger </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 113, 119, 848 P.2d 472, 476. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>This discretionary power extends to deciding whether to deny or to continue a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56(f), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Howell v. Glacier General Assur. Co. </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 383, 386, 785 P.2d 1018, 1019. A district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a Rule 56(f), M.R.Civ.P., motion where the party opposing a motion for summary judgment does not establish how the proposed discovery could preclude summary judgment. <em>Howell, </em>240 Mont. at 386, 785 P.2d at 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b620 In his Memorandum of Points and Authorities In Support of Defendant\u2019s Motion for Rule 56(f) Continuance, Moon listed the names of a number of persons whom he wished to depose prior to the summary judgment hearing. These depositions were necessary, Moon asserted, because \u201c[e]ach of these parties have knowledge or information which are relevant to the allegations set forth by the Plaintiffs in the Complaint as well as the defenses and allegations set forth by the Defendant in his Answer and Counterclaim.\u201d Moon also submitted the affidavit of his counsel, in which counsel again states that the deposition of these persons is necessary in order for Moon to properly respond to Environmental\u2019s motion for summary judgment because these parties \u201chave knowledge of the facts and circumstances of the case, including allegations made by the Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b621  Neither Moon\u2019s briefs nor the supporting affidavit of counsel establish how the proposed discovery could preclude summary judgment. It was Moon\u2019s burden to explain what new facts could have been obtained through further discovery which could defeat Environmental\u2019s motion, and this he failed to do. We hold therefore that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in conducting the summary judgment hearing and ruling on Environmental\u2019s motion without allowing Moon the opportunity to conduct further discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b622 3. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Environmental?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b623 Our standard of review of the grant of summary judgment by the district court is the same as that used by the district court under Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Matter of Estate of Lien </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 295, 298, 892 P.2d 530, 532. Summary judgment may be granted where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. In a motion for summary judgment the moving party has the initial burden of showing an absence of material fact, upon which the burden shifts to the opponent to affirmatively demonstrate that an issue of mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>rial fact exists. <em>Owen v. Ostrum </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 249, 255-56, 855 P.2d 1015, 1019. Mere denial or speculations will not suffice; the nonmovant must show facts sufficient to raise a genuine issue. <em>Taylor v. Koslosky </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 215, 217, 814 P.2d 985, 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b624 In its Order and Memorandum granting Environmental\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the District Court concluded that no genuine issues of material fact existed with regard to whether the notes had been paid. The District Court based this conclusion on the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">the only actual evidence the Court has concerning payment is that payment, according to the terms of the notes, has not been made. Defendant could have easily rebutted this assertion by submitting an Affidavit of his own stating that he has paid the notes. Defendant has not done this, however, and the Court is left with only one conclusion; that the notes have not been paid according to their terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b625 In his appellate brief, Moon argues that his failure to submit an affidavit stating that payment on the notes had been made was due in part to the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for continuance and his resulting inability to perform proper discovery in this case. \u201cIt is unjust and unreasonable,\u201d Moon argues, \u201cfor the District Court to criticize the Plaintiff\u2019s [sic] failure to submit evidence, when the Court itself improperly restricted Defendant\u2019s access to said evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u00b626 As discussed above, the District Court\u2019s denial of Moon\u2019s motion for continuance of the summary judgment hearing so that additional discovery could be performed was a proper exercise of that court\u2019s discretion based upon Moon\u2019s failure to provide the District Court with an adequate explanation of what additional discovery was likely to produce. We therefore reject Moon\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment based on the evidence before it at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u00b627 Moon also argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment on the promissory notes because there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the notes were unenforceable for lack of consideration. The District Court found that this fact was not in dispute because \u201cthe notes clearly state that the consideration Defendant received was the Plaintiff\u2019s forbearance on collecting the underlying debts for the dishonored check and the failure to pay the original note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u00b628 Section 26-1-602(21), MCA, creates a rebuttable presumption arising from the fact of the note itself that the note was given for sufficient consideration. Rule 301(b)(2), M.R.Evid., states that a disputable presumption may be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence contrary to the presumption; otherwise, the trier of fact is bound to find the assumed fact in accordance with the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"Agi\">\u00b629 The introduction of the notes into evidence before the District Court created a rebuttable presumption that proper consideration was given in exchange for the notes. It was Moon\u2019s burden to show that an issue of material fact existed regarding whether such consideration in fact existed. Although Moon asserted in his pleadings that, if deposed, Lee Alt, the architectural engineer hired by Moon to oversee the dismantling of the power plant and arrange payment to Environmental, would likely testify that the notes were not supported by any consideration, this assertion was contradicted by Alt\u2019s own affidavit, filed in support of Environmental\u2019s motion for summary judgment, in which Alt testified that both notes were supported by adequate consideration at the time of their execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\u00b630  Moon\u2019s other conclusory and speculative statements in his pleadings, briefs, and the affidavit of counsel submitted with his motion to continue do not constitute sufficient factual evidence to carry Moon\u2019s burden of demonstrating that a genuine issue of material fact existed contrary to the presumption of valid consideration accorded to these notes under the law. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the notes were not unenforceable for lack of consideration and its award of summary judgment in favor of Environmental.</p>\n<p id=\"Atg\">\u00b631 4. Did the District Court err in denying Moon\u2019s motion to consolidate this matter with a separate action filed by Environmental for breach of contract?</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b632 Rule 42(a), M.R.Civ.R, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a j oint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to consolidate for an abuse of discretion. <em>Tribby v. Northwestern Bank of Great Falls </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 196, 208, 704 P.2d 409, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u00b633 Moon argues that the District Court abused its discretion in denying its motion to consolidate this action with Environmental\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>breach of contract claim because both actions involved common questions of law and fact; it would have been more cost efficient for the parties to have the actions consolidated; and the court\u2019s refusal to consolidate the actions creates the possibility of conflicting and duplicative judgments against Moon. Environmental responds that the two actions do not involve common issues of fact and law because the contract on the salvage project was entirely independent and apart from Moon\u2019s obligations on the promissory notes, and the fact that the two actions involve the same parties is not sufficient grounds to justify consolidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b634  After reviewing the promissory notes at issue and the complaints filed in both actions, the District Court determined that the salvage contract and the promissory notes constituted separate and independent obligations, neither referencing or incorporating the terms of the other. Additionally, the District Court determined that the amounts in controversy in each action were different and independent of one another. Finally, the District Court determined that while the action on the salvage contract involved issues of law regarding contract interpretation, the primary issues in this action were simply questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b635 Our review of the record supports the District Court\u2019s denial of Moon\u2019s motion to consolidate the actions between these parties based on the reasons given by the court. We find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s ruling and therefore affirm that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-8\">JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, LEAPHART and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
