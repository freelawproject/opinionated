The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, however, found that medical benefits payable to a claimant are not subject to an attorney fee lien and that the fee must be paid by the claimants out of other funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">\u00b62 The issue raised on appeal is whether the attorney\u2019s fee lien codified at \u00a7 37-61-420, MCA, applies to medical benefits recovered due to the efforts of the attorney in a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b63 <em>Lockhart v. New Hampshire Insurance Company</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6f\">\u00b64 On October 3,1996, Doug Lockhart suffered an industrial injury to his right wrist while working as a construction laborer. The insurer, New Hampshire Insurance Company, denied liability for Lockhart\u2019s claim and the matter proceeded to a hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court on September 16,1997. The court found the insurer liable for Lockhart\u2019s industrial injury and ordered payment of temporary total disability and medical benefits. The insurer did not appeal the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and began payment of the court-ordered benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b65 On December 16,1997, Lockhart motioned the lower court for an order directing the insurer to pay attorney fees of twenty-five percent of the medical benefits directly to Lockhart\u2019s attorney. The insurer objected to Lockhart\u2019s motion, and by order dated March 4, 1998, the court invited amicus curiae briefs on whether a twenty-five percent fee can and should be deducted from medical benefits being paid due to the efforts of the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b66 <em>Liberty Northwest Insurance Corporation v. Petak</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_V\">\u00b67 On October 19, 1994, Nancy Petak injured her left hand while moving tables as an activities aid at a rest home. The injury developed an abscess that required brief hospitalization and surgery. The treatment was effective and Petak made a complete recovery and returned to her job in a matter of days.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b68 Notwithstanding a letter from Petak\u2019s treating surgeon and a letter from her treating infectious disease specialist recommending coverage, the insurer, Liberty Northwest, denied liability for Petak\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b69 On August 7,1995, Petak filed a petition for hearing in her case, and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court set the trial for the week of October 23, 1995. On August 22, 1995, Liberty Northwest filed its response in which it denied liability for Petak\u2019s care once again. However, on September 7,1995, Liberty Northwest orally accepted liability for Petak\u2019s medical care and gave written notice of the acceptance by letter dated September 11, 1995. According to \u00a7 39-71-612(2), MCA, the timing of the acceptance (over thirty days before the date of the hearing) protected Liberty Northwest from paying Petak\u2019s attorney fees incurred to collect her compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u00b610 Since identical issues were raised in the <em>Lockhart </em>and <em>Petak </em>cases, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court joined the two cases for purposes of supplemental briefing and oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b611 Thematterwas argued on July 22,1998, with all parties participating. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that an attorney fee which becomes due as a result of payment of disputed medical benefits by the insurer cannot be paid out of the medical benefits directly, but must be paid by the claimant from other benefits or resources. The court arrived at this conclusion by determining that medical benefits are not benefits received by the claimant and, thus, no attorney fee lien can attach. According to the court, medical benefits are not \u201cbenefits,\u201d but an imposition of liability imposed on the insurer. Therefore, since an award of medical benefits does not entitle the claimant to receipt of money, there is no property against which an attorney fee lien can attach. Thus, the court held that where a claim has been denied and later found compensable by the court without a separate award of attorney fees, a contingent attorney fee may be computed based upon medical benefits but the amount computed may not be deducted from the compensation payable to the medical providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b612 The issue presented on appeal is whether the attorney\u2019s lien statute codified at \u00a7 37-61-420, MCA, applies to medical benefits recovered due to the efforts of the attorney in a workers\u2019 compensation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u00b6 13 The scope of our review of a decision from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is whether or not the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly interpreted the law as it applies to the facts of this case. <em>See Pinyerd v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 115, 119, 894 P.2d 932, 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u00b614 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that medical benefits are not the property of the claimant and thus no attorney fee lien can attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">\u00b6 15 The attorney retainer agreement, drafted by the Department of Labor and Industry pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-613, MCA, allows for an attorney\u2019s contingency fee to be taken from \u201cthe amount of additional compensation payments the claimant receives due to the efforts of the attorney.\u201d The Department of Labor and Industry expressly included in the attorney retainer agreement, disputed medical benefits in the calculation of \u201cadditional compensation\u201d pursuant to ARM 24.29.3802(5)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u00b616 Additionally, we have held that the term \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d includes medical benefits. In <em>Carlson v. Cain </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 129, 136, 700 P.2d 607, 612, we were asked to decide whether a penalty could be assessed for unreasonable delay in the payment of medical benefits. Before determining whether a penalty could be assessed, we first concluded that medical benefits were included in the term \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d as used in the penalty statute codified at \u00a7 39-71-702, MCA (1979). After reviewing various statutory provisions, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">There should be no argument that the compensation benefits which an injured worker receives under the Act includes compensation for time off the job, for disability and for medical payments. The Act itself makes the term \u201ccompensation\u201d universally applicable to all of the sections of the Act. Section 39-71-103, MCA, provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">39-71-103. Compensation provisions. The compensation provisions of this chapter, whenever referred to, shall be held to include the provisions of compensation plan no. 1, 2, or 3, and all other sections of this chapter are applicable to the same or any part thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\"><em>Carlson, </em>216 Mont. at 136-37, 700 P.2d at 612 (this statute has not been amended since 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b617 As in this case, the insurer in <em>Carlson </em>argued that since the claimant did not receive the medical benefit payments herself, the benefits could not be considered \u201ccompensation.\u201d We found this argument specious, and agreed with the reasoning of the Kansas court in <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company v. Commercial Standard Insurance Company </em>(Kan. App. 1980), 612 P.2d 1265:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">[T]he fact that the payment is made directly to the provider of services does not affect its status as compensation. KSA 1979 Supp. 44-504(b) permits subrogation for compensation paid by the employer regardless of who receives the actual payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\"><em>Carlson, </em>216 Mont. at 139, 700 P.2d at 614. Considering Montana\u2019s similar subrogation provision, we then held that since:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">[M]edical payments under the act for the purposes of subrogation are treated as a compensation benefit; for the same reason, medical payments should be treated as a compensation benefit when a penalty is considered for wrongful refusal or delay in payment.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdU\"><em>See Carlson, </em>216 Mont. at 139, 700 P.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u00b6 18 We used similar reasoning in <em>Billings Deaconess Hospital, Inc. v. Angel </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 490, 712 P.2d 1323. In that case, we addressed the question of whether hospital services were considered to be \u201cbenefits payable to a claimant\u201d for purposes of jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. We found that such benefits were \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and thus within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b619 Finally, we note that in the case of <em>Cheetham v. Liberty Northwest Insurance Corporation, </em>(dec\u2019d July 16, 1997), WCC No. 9612-7675, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court itself addressed the exact issue on appeal herein, and concluded the exact opposite as it concluded in this case. Contrary to its decision in this case, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court in <em>Cheetham </em>held that attorney fee liens attach as a matter of law to disputed medical benefits. The court relied on the language of the attorney retainer agreement and our decision in <em>Carlson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b620 Based on the foregoing analysis, Lockhart and Petak maintain on appeal that medical benefits constitute \u201ccompensation\u201d to the claimant and thus the attorney fee lien can attach pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-420, MCA, the attorney fee lien statute, regardless of whether the claimant actually receives the benefits in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b621 The respondents contend, on the other hand, that medical benefits are either an entitlement of the medical provider, or a debt owed by the insurer. Therefore, they argue, we should affirm the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and require claimants to pay their attorney fees out of other assets. They cite \u00a7 39-71-743(3) and ARM 24.29.1401(2), for the proposition that after a workers\u2019 compensation claim has been accepted or determined to be compensable by an insurer, the obligation to pay for medical services passes from the claim - ant to the insurer, and therefore cannot constitute the claimant\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d against which a lien could be attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b622 The health care providers argue that of the three parties (the claimant, the attorney, or the medical provider) who potentially have to suffer the loss associated with payment or nonpayment of the attorney fees or medical benefits, it would be most unfair to impose such a burden on the medical providers. This is so, they maintain, because medical providers are already being paid less than full price for their services and thus \u201csubsidizing\u201d the workers\u2019 compensation system. The health care providers claim that a decision adverse to them may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>result in their refusal to provide medical service to claimants. Thus, they conclude that in the circumstances presented here, where there is no agreement expressed or implied, between the claimant\u2019s attorney and the hospital or other medical provider, a contractual obligation is not created or imposed on the hospital or medical provider to pay for the attorney\u2019s services. Moreover, they contend, in the context of the medical payments made to medical providers to reimburse them for services provided to injured workers, there is no judgment or settlement to which an attorney lien can attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b623 Appellants maintain that the medical providers are the only party whose payments have not appreciably declined since 1993. Both claimants and claimants\u2019 attorneys are receiving comparatively significantly less in benefits and fees than are health care providers. In light of this, appellants maintain that it is disingenuous for the health care providers to argue that it would be \u201cunfair\u201d to the medical providers to have attorney fees deducted from medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b624  We agree with Lockhart and Petak that medical benefits are not the property of the medical providers simply because the medical providers are the actual recipients of the money. Nor do we believe that the medical benefits are simply an obligation of the insurer. The benefits are the individual claimant\u2019s and as such, the claimant should be allowed to pay the attorney fees out of his or her medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b625 There is no question that an attorney representing an injured claimant is entitled to collect an attorney fee based upon the amount of disputed medical benefits ultimately paid by the insurer. The approved attorney retainer agreement, drafted by the Department of Labor and Industry, so provides. Furthermore, this Court has expressly held that medical benefits are included in the term \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d for the purpose of assessing a penalty. <em>See Carlson, </em>216 Mont. at 136, 700 P.2d at 612. The attorney\u2019s fee lien statute, Section 37-61-420(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">From the commencement of an action or the service of an answer containing a counterclaim, the attorney who appears for a party has a lien upon his client\u2019s cause of action, or counterclaim which attaches to a verdict, report, decision, or judgment in his client\u2019s favor <em>and the proceeds thereof in whose hands they may come. </em>Such lien cannot be affected by any settlement between the parties before or after judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u00b626  In the context of workers\u2019 compensation cases, it is well settled that attorney fee liens attach to all compensation upon the filing of an attorney retainer agreement with the Department of Labor and Industry. <em>See Kelleher Law Office v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 412, 416, 691 P.2d 823, 825. A proper and timely retainer agreement was filed in these cases and thus, an attorney fee lien has attached as a matter of law to all medical benefits paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b627  Finally, we note that the fundamental purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation laws is to provide a fund which replaces an injured worker\u2019s lost earnings and lost earning capacity. Given this purpose, it would be unfair for the claimant to have to pay a disproportionate amount of his or her attorney fees from his or her own personal resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b628 The judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b494-9\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"A18\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">\u00b629 I specially concur in the Court\u2019s opinion, agreeing with the result reached but not with the entirety of the Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">\u00b630 It is clear to me that, whatever term is used for the medical services payments at issue in these cases, those payments were part of the claimants\u2019 \u201ccauses of action\u201d against the insurers. It is equally clear that the ultimate payments for medical services in these cases arose from the efforts of the claimants\u2019 attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">\u00b631 I am not altogether convinced, however, that medical benefits are \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d under the current statutory language in \u00a7 39-71-704, MCA, which differs from the version of that statute at issue in <em>Carlson. </em>Specifically, \u00a7 39-71-704, MCA, currently provides for payment for medical, hospital and related services under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as an \u201cadditional benefit\u201d separate and apart from \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d provided. It is my view that the proper application of that plain language mandates a conclusion that medical services payments are not \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d as that term currently is used in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">\u00b632 In light of the clear language in \u00a7 37-61-420(2), MCA, the attorney lien statute, however, it is my view that the question of whether medical services payments are \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d is not particularly relevant to the issue before us which, unlike <em>Carlson, </em>does not concern whether the payments are \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d under the language of the penalty statute at issue in <em>Carlson. </em>Here, neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the attorney retainer agreement drafted by the Department, the statute pursuant to which the agreement was drafted, nor the related administrative regulation uses the term \u201ccompensation benefits.\u201d Thus, the issue before us is simply whether the attorney lien statute applies to medical benefits recovered due to the efforts of a claimant\u2019s attorney in a worker\u2019s compensation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b633 Section 37-61-420(2), MCA, provides that an attorney who appears for a party \u201chas a lien upon his client\u2019s cause of action... which attaches to a... judgment in his client\u2019s favor and <em>the proceeds thereof in whose hands they may come.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 37-61-420(2), MCA, further provides that the lien cannot be affected by any settlement between the parties before or after judgment. Applying \u00a7 37-61-420(2), MCA, to the cases before us, it is my opinion that the medical services payments were part of these claimants\u2019 causes of action in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and, upon either that court\u2019s judgment (in <em>Lockhart) </em>or a prejudgment \u201csettlement\u201d of that issue by the insurer (in <em>Petak), </em>the statutory attorney lien attached to the medical benefits proceeds of the causes of action without regard to the fact that the \u201cproceeds\u201d go to the medical providers rather than to the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b634 In addition, the \u201cfairness\u201d arguments advanced by the medical providers in these cases are more properly addressed to the Montana Legislature. It is the Legislature which is responsible for maintaining an appropriate balance between the obligations of the various parties to \u2014 and entities interested in \u2014 workers\u2019 compensation disputes. Furthermore, it is the Legislature which enacted the attorney lien statute, closely regulates attorney fees in the workers\u2019 compensation arena and either sets or authorizes the Department to establish discounted fees and rates for medical services provided to workers\u2019 compensation claimants. Our duty is to apply the law as the Legislature enacts it. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b635 For these reasons, I agree that the attorney lien codified at \u00a7 37-61-420, MCA, applies to medical benefits recovered due to the efforts of an attorney in a worker\u2019s compensation case and that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
