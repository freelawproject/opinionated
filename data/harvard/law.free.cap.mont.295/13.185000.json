(Balyeat).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\u00b62 We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">\u00b63 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">\u00b64 1. Whether Balyeat is a proper party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">\u00b65 2. Whether the District Court erred in denying the Harrisons\u2019 request for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-13\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b34-14\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-15\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b34-16\">\u00b67 In 1994, Balyeat, acting as a trustee, filed a Complaint against the Harrisons in the Justice of Peace Court in Missoula County. In March, 1995 the case was heard in Justice Court without a jury. Balyeat sought payment for medical care provided to the Harrisons\u2019 children by Missoula Community Hospital, Missoula Radiology, and Western Montana Pathology Consultants. The Justice of the Peace granted the Harrisons\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-17\">\u00b68 Balyeat filed a notice of appeal in April, 1995. In May, 1995 the Harrisons submitted a motion for Rule 16 schedule and demand for jury trial. Balyeat objected to the demand for jury trial; the District Court denied the Harrisons\u2019 request for jury trial. The District Court reasoned that under \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, the District Court trial must be based on the pleadings filed in Justice Court. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Harrisons failed to request a jury trial in Justice Court, the District Court concluded that the Harrisons also waived their right to trial by jury in District Court. In November, 1997 the District Court held a one-day trial. In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the District Court ruled in favor of Balyeat and ordered that the Harrisons pay Balyeat $1056.76 and costs of the action. The Harrisons appeal that judgment and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b69 1. Whether Balyeat is a proper party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b610 The Harrisons argue that Balyeat is not a proper party to this suit and that Balyeat has acquired an interest in claims for the purpose of bringing suit \u201cunder certain contingencies,\u201d in violation of \u00a7 37-61-408, MCA. The Harrisons argue further that the District Court erred in admitting Balyeat\u2019s exhibit seven and the testimony of a financial officer for Missoula Community Hospital, Cheryl Hall (Hall).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b6 11 Balyeat responds that it never acquired a beneficial interest in the accounts at issue and that it has not violated \u00a7 37-61-408, MCA. Section 37-61-408, MCA, prohibits attorneys from buying claims or demands for the purpose of bringing actions. Further, Balyeat argues that there was undisputed testimony that Balyeat was a trustee of the claims and had no beneficial interest in them. Finally, Balyeat argues that its conduct is consistent with Montana State Bar Ethics Opinion 910529.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\u00b612  We conclude that the Harrisons\u2019 contention that Balyeat is not a proper party lacks merit. The Harrisons raise a particular challenge only to the trust agreement between Balyeat and Missoula Community Hospital. That trust agreement was admitted as Balyeat\u2019s exhibit 7, and provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">The beneficiary hereby transfers, sets over and assigns unto Balyeat Law Offices, P.C., as trustee, all right, title, and interest to claims arising from all accounts to be assigned for collection with full power to collect, sue, compromise, endorse remittence or settle said claims in the name of Balyeat Law Offices, P.C., as trustee, provided however that no claims will be sued upon nor compromised without beneficiary\u2019s consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">This trust agreement established that Missoula Community Hospital retained a beneficial interest in the claims that Balyeat might bring. We note that the Harrisons do not claim that Balyeat has violated this trust agreement. Moreover, the trust agreement also addressed an important concern in State Bar Ethics opinion 910529:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>As trustee capable of making decisions concerning the trust, and as attorney receiving a contingency fee, the attorney could face potential conflicts of interest. However, <em>the language of the trust agreement requiring beneficiary\u2019s consent to suit or compromising of claims removes a great deal of the conflict risk.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">State Bar Ethics Opinion 910529 at 72 (emphasis added). We agree that trust agreement language requiring a beneficiary\u2019s consent removes much of the risk of conflict. In the present case, the trust agreement expressly provides that \u201cno claims will be sued upon nor compromised without beneficiary\u2019s consent.\u201d The Harrisons have failed to show that the accounts at issue were not properly transferred to Balyeat, and they have also failed to show that the trust agreement between Missoula Community Hospital and Balyeat was not properly established. We conclude that the record establishes that Balyeat is a trustee of the accounts at issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b613 Moreover, the Harrisons do not claim that the admission of Balyeat\u2019s exhibit 7 and Hall\u2019s testimony prejudiced their substantive rights. Thus, to the extent that the District Court may have abused its discretion in admitting that evidence, the error was harmless. <em>See </em>Rule 61, M.R.Civ.P. (providing in part that \u201c[t]he court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties\u201d). We hold that the District Court did not err in determining that Balyeat is a proper party in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b614 The Harrisons also conclude that Balyeat has violated \u00a7 37-61-408, MCA, by becoming involved in litigation for its personal economic benefit. The Harrisons make no showing that they raised this objection in District Court. We conclude that the Harrisons have failed to preserve this issue for our review. <em>See Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15 (concluding \u201c[t]he general rule in Montana is that this Court will not address either an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b615 2. Whether the District Court erred in denying the Harrisons\u2019 request for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">\u00b616 The Harrisons contend that when they waived their right to trial by jury injustice court, they did not waive their right to trial by jury on appeal in a trial <em>de novo </em>in district court. Relying <em>on Ex Parte Graye </em>(1907), 36 Mont. 394, 93 P. 266, the Harrisons argue that in appeals from justice court, the same procedures should be followed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>criminal and civil cases. Further, the Harrisons rely on <em>State v. Bender </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 424, 756 P.2d 1157, to argue that a waiver of jury trial injustice court does not waive the right to jury trial on appeal in a trial <em>de novo </em>in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b617 Balyeat does not dispute that the Harrisons had a right to a trial by jury in district court but argues that under \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, the Harrisons\u2019 waiver of their right to jury trial in justice court also waived their right to trial by jury in a trial <em>de novo </em>in district court. Balyeat contends that under Rule 81, M.R.Civ.P., \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, supersedes Rule 38, M.R.Civ.P. Balyeat also argues that the same procedure need not be followed in civil and criminal cases, citing \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA, which allows a jury trial on appeal of a criminal case only if the defendant did not have a jury trial in the lower court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, Balyeat relies on <em>White v. McGinnis </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 903 F.2d 699, to argue that the Harrisons waived their right to a jury trial in district court by participating in the trial without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b618 In the present case, we determine whether the District Court erred in concluding that the Harrisons\u2019 waiver of their right to trial by jury injustice court waived their right to trial by jury in district court. Whether the Harrisons waived their right to trial by jury in district court is a question of law. We review a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they are correct. <em>Zimmerman v. Connor, </em>1998 MT 131, 289 Mont. 148, 958 P.2d 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b6 19 This Court has previously affirmed the right to trial by jury in appeals from lower court proceedings. <em>Bender, </em>the Court concluded that a criminal defendant who waived a trial by jury injustice court had a right on appeal to a trial by jury in district court. In <em>Woirhaye v. Fourth Judicial Dist. Ct., </em>1998 MT 320, 292 Mont. 185, 972 P.2d 800, the Court examined \u00a7 46-17-201(3), MCA, which allowed a misdemeanor criminal defendant to exercise his right to a jury trial once, either injustice court or in district court on trial <em>de novo. </em>The <em>Woirhaye </em>Court concluded that \u201cit is undisputable that \u00a7 46-17-201(3), MCA, acts, in effect, as a forced waiver of the right to a jury trial either at the justice court level or the district court level.\u201d <em>Woirhaye, </em>\u00b6 22. The <em>Woirhaye </em>Court concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 46-17-201(3), 46-7-102(l)(g) and 46-17-311(1), MCA, impermissibly infringed on the right to a jury trial and struck them. <em>Woirhaye, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u00b620 Moreover, <em>in North Central Services, Inc. v. Hafdahl </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 440, 625 P.2d 56, the Court considered a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 25-35-403(2), MCA, which provided that in appeals from small claims court, \u201c[t]here shall not be a trial de novo in the District Court. The appeal shall be limited to questions of law.\u201d <em>Hafdahl, </em>191 Mont. at 443, 625 P.2d at 58. The defendant in <em>Hafdahl </em>argued that the small claims procedure unconstitutionally deprived the defendant of the right to a trial by jury. The <em>Hafdahl </em>Court agreed and struck \u00a7 25-35-403(2), MCA, because \u201cit effectively denies the right to trial by jury at all levels.\u201d <em>Hafdahl, </em>191 Mont. at 444-45, 625 P.2d at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b621 In the present case, we begin with the pertinent statutory provisions. Section \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">Trial de novo \u2014 pleadings, conduct of trial. (1) All appeals from justices\u2019 or city courts must be tried anew in the district court on the papers filed in the justice\u2019s or city court unless the court, for good cause shown and on such terms as may be just, allow other or amended pleadings to be filed in such action. The court may allow new or amended pleadings to be filed. Each party has the benefit of all legal objections made in the justice\u2019s or city court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">(2) When the action is tried anew on appeal, the trial must be conducted in all respects as other trials in the district court. The provisions of this code as to trials in the district courts are applicable to trials on appeal in the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Section 25-33-301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b622 Rule 38(a), M.R.Civ.P., provides that \u201c[t]he right of trial by jury as declared by The Constitution of the State of Montana or as given by a statute of the state of Montana shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.\u201d Rule 38(b), M.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">Demand. Any party may demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by serving upon the other parties a demand therefor in writing at any time after the commencement of the action and not later than 10 days after the service of the last pleading directed to such issue. Such demand may be endorsed upon a pleading of the party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Rule 38(b), M.R.Civ.P. Finally, Rule 81 provides that \u201c[t'Jhese rules do not supersede the provisions of statutes relating to appeals to or review by the district courts, but shall govern procedure and practice relating thereto insofar as these rules are not inconsistent with such statutes.\u201d Rule 81(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u00b623  We conclude that the District Court erred in determining that under \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, a waiver of the right to trial by jury in justice court waives the right to trial by jury in a <em>de novo </em>trial on appeal in district court. The District Court did not clearly specify the conflict between \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, and Rule 38 but determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">The Defendants have waived their right to a jury trial in district court based upon the failure to demand a jury trial pursuant to the requirements of Rule 15(B), M.J.C.C.R.Civ.P. The Defendants cannot now demand a jury trial pursuant to Rule 38, M.R.Civ.P. That rule requires that the demand be made: (1) at the commencement of the action; or (2) within 10 days of the last pleading. Because this Court\u2019s trial is based upon the pleading filed injustice court, [Rule 38] is inconsistent with \u00a7 25-33-301, M.C.A., and pursuant to Rule 81, M.R.Civ.P, the statutory provision supersedes Rule 38, M.R.Civ.P. for purposes of this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Thus, relying on Rule 81, the District Court concluded that for purposes of jury trial demands in <em>de novo </em>trials in district court, \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, supersedes Rule 38, M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b624 The District Court erred in disregarding the interplay of Rule 3, M.R.Civ.P, with Rule 38, M.R.Civ.P, and \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA. Rule 3, M.R.Civ.P, provides that a civil action commences when a complaint is filed. When Rule 38 is read with Rule 3, jury trial demands must be made \u201cat any time after the [filing of a complaint, but] not later than 10 days after the service of the last pleading directed [to an issue triable of right by a jury].\u201d Rule 38, M.R.Civ.P. Thus, although \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, is silent about jury trials, Rules 38 and 3 together provide in essence that jury trial demands must be made in justice court or the right to trial by jury will be effectively waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b625  Under the District Court\u2019s attempted harmonization of \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, with Rules 3 and 38, M.R.Civ.P, \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, impermissibly infringes upon the right to trial by jury by providing in effect that jury trial demands are waived unless they are made first in justice court. We decline to insert a meaning into \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, that would render this statute violative of the right to trial by jury. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (providing \u201c[i]n the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted\u201d). We conclude that the plain meaning of Rule 81(b), M.R.Civ.P, requires that Rules 3 and 38 be given meanings that are consistent with \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the right to trial by jury. Accordingly, we hold that when a party makes a jury trial demand under Rule 38 for a <em>de novo </em>trial on appeal in district court, the action commences when the party serves and files notice of appeal pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-33-102 and -103, MCA. We hold further that in appeals from justice court, jury trial demands shall be made within ten days of the filing of notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b626 In reaching these holdings, we conclude that \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA\u2019s limitation of appeals from justice court to the pleadings filed in justice court does not limit jury trial demands in appeals from justice court, because jury trial demands are not pleadings. Rule 38, M.R.Civ.P., expressly distinguishes demands for jury trials from pleadings, providing that jury trial demands may be filed no later than \u201c10 days <em>after the service of the last pleading </em>directed to such issue.\u201d Rule 38(b), M.R.Civ.P (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Rule 7, M.R.Civ.P. (recognizing only specific, limited forms of pleadings); 8 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00a7 38.50[3][b][iii] (Matthew Bender 3d ed.) (concluding that \u201c[t]he \u2018last pleading\u2019 within the meaning of [Rule 38] will generally be an answer or reply, and is determined on a case-by-case basis\u201d). Thus, Rule 38 jury trial demands made in appeals from justice court lie outside \u00a7 25-33-301, MCA\u2019s requirement that appeals from justice court be limited to pleadings filed in justice court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b627 We turn to the last argument raised by Balyeat. Relying on <em>White, </em>Balyeat argues that by participating in the <em>de novo </em>district court trial, the Harrisons waived their right to a jury trial. Balyeat\u2019s reliance on <em>White </em>is mistaken. In <em>White, </em>appellant White, an Arizona state prison inmate, brought an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. White made a timely jury trial demand. However, the district court notified the parties that the case would have a trial to the bench. White never \u201cbrought his prior jury demand to the district court\u2019s attention during the five and one-half month period between the bench trial notice and the trial.\u201d <em>White, </em>903 F.2d at 700. The <em>White </em>court concluded that White\u2019s participation without objection in his bench trial showed that he \u201cclearly consented to a bench trial.\u201d <em>White, </em>903 F.2d at 703. The <em>White </em>court held that \u201cknowing participation in a bench trial without objection is sufficient to constitute a jury waiver.\u201d <em>White, </em>903 F.2d at 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b628 We decline to follow <em>White. </em>In <em>Woirhaye, </em>we determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4G\">when interpreting our own State Constitution, we have refused to \u201cmarch lock-step\u201d with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of corresponding provisions in the federal constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>This is especially true where, as here, the language of the Montana Constitution setting forth the rights guaranteed is not identical to the language used in the federal Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-6\"><em>Woirhaye, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted). Moreover, in <em>United States v. California Mobile Home Park Management Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1997), 107 F.3d 1374, the plaintiff, Cohen-Strong, moved several times for a jury trial before the commencement of the bench trial but participated in the bench trial without objection. The court in <em>California Mobile Home Park </em>concluded that \u201cCohen-Strong sufficiently contested the issue of her right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>California Mobile Home Park, </em>107 F.3d at 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\u00b629 In the present case, we hold that the Harrisons did not waive their right to trial by jury when they participated in the District Court\u2019s bench trial without objection. By making a timely jury trial demand in district court, the Harrisons \u201csufficiently contested the issue of [their] right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>California Mobile Home Park, </em>107 F.3d at 1380. Because our holdings are dispositive, we do not reach the Harrisons\u2019 argument that the District Court abused its discretion in asking questions of witnesses and Balyeat\u2019s claim that the Harrisons did not present adequate evidence in support of their counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\u00b630 We reverse and remand for a <em>de novo </em>trial by jury in district court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b41-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\">.
