Garnaas to recover damages for professional negligence. The case was subsequently moved to the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, following a stipulation for a change of venue. Garnaas thereafter moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Joyce\u2019s suit was barred by the ten-year statute of repose applicable to actions for legal malpractice. The District Court granted Garnaas\u2019s motion on December 2,1997, and Joyce appeals. We affirm. \u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it granted Garnaas\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u00b63 On July 4,1978, Joyce was involved in a traffic accident in which the motorcycle he was driving collided with a vehicle driven by Edward John Glenn. Joyce\u2019s attorney, H.L. Garnaas, filed a negligence action against Glenn on Joyce\u2019s behalf on July 2,1981, just prior to the expiration of the applicable three-year statute of limitations. The District Court issued a summons on July 2, 1981, the same day that Garnaas filed the complaint. It is undisputed that Garnaas never served the summons and complaint upon the defendant, and thereby failed to comply with the provisions of Rule 41(e), M.R.Civ.P, which mandate that a defendant be served with a summons within three years of its issuance. On January 13,1993, the District Court issued an order advising that Joyce\u2019s action would \u201cbe dismissed without prejudice twenty (20) days from the date of this Order unless farther pleadings are filed with the Clerk of Court.\u201d Garnaas filed no further pleadings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">\u00b64 Joyce filed the present suit on October 24,1995, alleging professional negligence on Garnaas\u2019s part in connection with the dismissal of his personal injury action against Glenn. In his complaint, Joyce asserted that Garnaas never told him \u201cof his failure to serve the defendant,\u201d and instead \u201crepresented to Joyce that the case was pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ceeding and was being defended by the Garlington firm of Missoula, Montana.\u201d Joyce alleged he was damaged because Garnaas\u2019s negligence in the underlying suit has \u201cforever precluded\u201d him \u201cfrom recovering damages for the injuries [he] suffered in the July 4, 1978 wreck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b65 Garnaas filed his answer on September 10,1996. He later moved for permission to file an amended answer, asking that he be permitted to plead \u201cas affirmative defenses the statute of limitations and the statute of repose applicable to allegations of attorney negligence.\u201d The District Court granted Garnaas\u2019s motion, and Garnaas filed an amended answer on March 18,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b66 On March 24,1997, Garnaas filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the ten-year statute of repose for legal malpractice actions, codified at \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, barred Joyce\u2019s suit. On December 2, 1997, the District Court issued an order granting Garnaas\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The District Court entered a judgment in Garnaas\u2019s favor on December 16, 1997, and ordered that Joyce\u2019s action be dismissed. Joyce filed his notice of appeal on December 31,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b67 This Court\u2019s standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. See Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 280 Mont. 443, 446, 930 P.2d 661, <em>663 (citingMotarie v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d <em>154, 156; Mead v. M.S.B., Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 465, 470, 872 P.2d 782, 785). This Court reviews a summary judgment order entered pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P, based on the same criteria applied by the district court. <em>See Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 446, 930 P.2d at 663 (citing Bruner <em>v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">In proving that summary judgment is appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist.

[This Court] reviews the legal determinations made by the district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-10\"><em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264-65, 900 P.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u00b68 The \u201cmoving party has the burden of showing a complete absence of any genuine issue as to all facts considered material in light of the substantive principles that entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Kolar v. Bergo </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 262, 266, 929 P.2d 867, 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b69 The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it granted Garnaas\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Joyce assigns error to the District Court based on two theories. First, that the District Court erred when it concluded that the statute of repose for legal malpractice requires a dismissal of this action. Second, that the District Court erred when it determined that equity does not act to extend the statute of repose. We will address each theory accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Did the District Court err when it concluded that the statute of repose for legal malpractice requires a dismissal of this </em>action?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b610 On December 2, 1997, the District Court granted summary judgment in Garnaas\u2019s favor on the grounds that the ten-year statute of repose which governs actions for legal malpractice bars his action. The court recognized that Rule 41(e), M.R.Civ.P, requires that a summons be served upon a defendant within three years of the date the summons was issued, and observed that a summons had been issued in Joyce\u2019s personal injury suit on July 2, 1981. The court noted that Garnaas had failed to serve the summons upon Glenn within that three-year time period. Because Garnaas failed to serve the summons on or before July 2, 1984, the court reasoned, it was then that Joyce lost his cause of action against Glenn and \u201cthe statutes of limitation and repose, as set forth in MCA \u00a7 27-2-206, began to accrue as of July 3,1984.\u201d The District Court determined that \u201c[t]he present legal malpractice action was filed on October 24, 1995, which was eleven and one[-]third years after the legal malpractice action accrued based on the failure to timely serve the summons.\u201d The court thus concluded that Joyce\u2019s legal malpractice action had accrued on July 3, 1984, more than eleven years before he filed his complaint on October 24, 1995. Because more than ten years had passed between the time Joyce\u2019s cause of action had accrued and the filing of his complaint, the District Court concluded that the absolute bar imposed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ten-year statute of repose contained in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, precluded Joyce from maintaining an action against Garnaas.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b611 On appeal, Joyce argues that the District Court erred when it granted Garnaas\u2019s motion for summary judgment because he claims he acquired a second cause of action against Garnaas on July 4,1994. Because of this second cause of action against Garnaas, Joyce claims that the District Court erred when it concluded that he failed to initiate his malpractice suit within the periods of limitation set forth in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. More specifically, Joyce asserts that he lost his personal injury cause of action against Glenn on July 2,1984, and that his original cause of action against Garnaas for malpractice thus accrued on July 3, 1984. From that point forward, Joyce argues, Garnaas had a further duty, based on their fiduciary relationship, to inform Joyce that his cause of action against Glenn had been lost. Joyce contends that Garnaas breached that duty, however, and never told him of his failure to serve the summons. Joyce maintains that Garnaas affirmatively concealed his own negligence from Joyce because he \u201cinquired of Garnaas on numerous occasions as to the progress of his lawsuit against Glenn,\u201d but Garnaas simply assured him his suit was ongoing and that further proceedings were pending. In short, Joyce claims that he has three distinct causes of action in his favor; one against Glenn and two against Garnaas.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b612 The time within which an action for professional negligence against an attorney must be brought is set forth in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">An action against an attorney licensed to practice law in Montana or a paralegal assistant or a legal intern employed by an attorney based upon the person\u2019s alleged professional negligent act or for error or omission in the person\u2019s practice must be commenced within 3 years after the plaintiff discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the act, error, or omission, whichever occurs last, but in no case may the action be commenced after 10 years from the date of the act, error, or omission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The last phrase of the statute articulates the unconditional ten-year statute of repose. The act, error, or omission of which Joyce complains is that which \u201cprecluded [Joyce] from recovering damages for the injuries suffered in the July 4,1978 wreck.\u201d The only act, error, or omission by Garnaas which could be said to have precluded Joyce from recovering damages was the failure to serve the summons and complaint within the three years allowed by Rule 41(e), M.R.Civ.R, on or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>before July 2,1984. Therefore, we agree with the District Court that the statutes of limitations and of repose began to run on July 3,1984. The ten years allowed by the statute of repose expired on July 3,1994, over a year before the action was filed. Because the statute of repose provides \u201cin no case may the action be commenced after 10 years,\u201d the time bar is absolute. Moreover, a failure to discover the alleged negligent act until after the statute of repose had run would not toll the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b613 As we stated in <em>Blackburn v. Blue Mountain Women\u2019s Clinic </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 60, 951 P.2d 1, after considering the statute of repose, \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, applicable in medical malpractice cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-o\">In the absence of specific statutory language to the contrary, a statute of repose such as the one codified in \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, is not subject to tolling. <em>See First United Methodist Church of Hyattsville v. United States Gypsum Co. </em>(4th Cir. 1989), 882 F.2d 862, 866, <em>cert. denied </em>(1990), 493 U.S. 1070, 110 S.Ct. 1113, 107 L.Ed.2d 1020.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><em>Blackburn, </em>286 Mont. at 73, 951 P.2d at 9. Because \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, has no tolling provision related to the statute of repose it, unlike the statute of repose applicable to medical malpractice cases, is not subject to tolling. <em>See Blackburn, </em>286 Mont. at 73, 951 P.2d at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b614 In <em>Blackburn, </em>we relied upon the Fourth Circuit case of <em>First United Methodist Church of Hyattsville v. United States Gypsum Co. </em>(4th Cir. 1989), 882 F.2d 862, 866, <em>cert. denied </em>(1990), 493 U.S. 1070, 110 S. Ct. 1113, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1020. The court inFirsi <em>United Methodist Church </em>discussed the rationale behind statutes of repose. After noting that a statute of limitations is a procedural device which operates as a defense to limit the remedy available from an existing cause of action, the court described statutes of repose as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">A statute of repose creates a substantive right in those protected to be free from liability after a legislatively-determined period of time. Statutes of limitations are motivated by considerations of fairness to defendants and are intended to encourage prompt resolution of disputes by providing a simple procedural mechanism to dispose of stale claims. Statutes of repose are based on considerations of the economic best interests of the public as a whole and are substantive grants of immunity based on a legislative balance of the respective rights of potential plaintiffs and defendants struck by determining a time limit beyond which liability no longer exists. <em>Thus, as a general rule, a statute of limitations is tolled by a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>defendant\u2019s fraudulent concealment of a plaintiffs injury because it would be inequitable to allow a defendant to use a statute intended as a device of fairness to perpetrate a fraud. Conversely, a statute of repose is typically an absolute time limit beyond which liability no longer exists and is not tolled for any reason because to do so would upset the economic balance struck by the legislative body.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ava\"><em>First United Methodist Church, </em>882 F.2d at 866 (citations omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b615  The three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions contains a built-in tolling mechanism for a defendant\u2019s fraudulent concealment of a plaintiff\u2019s injury. That is, a statute of limitations does not begin to run until the plaintiff discovers, or with reasonable diligence should have discovered, the act, error, or omission. As the court in <em>First United Methodist Church </em>noted, not to provide some tolling for a statute of limitations in those circumstances would inequitably allow the defendant to use the statute, intended as a device of fairness, to perpetrate a fraud. On the other hand, the ten-year statute of repose is the \u201cabsolute time limit beyond which liability no longer exists.\u201d <em>First United Methodist Church, </em>882 F.2d at 866. Not even fraudulent concealment can toll the statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b616 We have examined statutes of repose in different contexts in Montana. In <em>Association of Unit Owners v. Big Sky of Montana, Inc. </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 64, 80, 798 P.2d 1018, 1027, we considered \u00a7 27-2-208, MCA, which deals with commencement of actions for improvements to real property and the applicable ten-year statute of repose. We stated that even if late discovery of the facts caused an extension of the time for commencement of the action, \u201cin no event\u201d could the action be commenced longer than ten years after the date of the injury. <em>See Association of Unit Owners, </em>245 Mont. at 80, 798 P.2d at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\u00b617 In apparent recognition of the clear mandatory nature of the statute of repose in this case, Joyce seeks to avoid its strictures by asserting a basis for recovery apart from Garnaas\u2019s failure to timely serve the summons in the underlying action. Originally, Joyce asserted that Garnaas did not tell him of his failure to serve the defendant and represented to Joyce that the case was proceeding. Joyce now describes a second cause of action against Garnaas as being for the subsequent failure of Garnaas to inform Joyce of the true status of his injury case and, therefore, depriving him of recovery against Garnaas for malpractice. The essence of Joyce\u2019s \u201csecond cause of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>tion\u201d theory is that if an attorney conceals a potential claim against him for some negligent act, a second action arises for breach of a duty to disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b6 18 However, as the District Court correctly found, the omission giving rise to the claim of legal malpractice against Garnaas was the failure to have the summons served within the three-year limitation. It is from this \u201comission\u201d that both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose are measured. The statute of limitations does not commence until the plaintiff discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the \u201comission.\u201d We agree with Garnaas that the \u201cdiscovery\u201d aspect of this statute thus takes into account the precise circumstances which extend the time for filing that Joyce relies upon in his \u201csecond cause of action\u201d; the failure to inform or concealment from Joyce that the summons was not served. Joyce argues that the concealment of a claim is a separate tort which resets the start date for purposes of the statutes of limitations and repose, rather than being a circumstance in itself which tolls the statute of limitations. However, to accept Joyce\u2019s argument concerning when the statute starts to run in these kinds of cases would mean that the statutes of limitations and repose would be essentially eliminated. A claimant would simply have to claim that he or she was not told of the negligence of the attorney in order to overcome the untimeliness of his or her action.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b6 19 Garnaas\u2019s breach of his responsibility to tell Joyce of the failure to serve the summons occurred at the time the underlying action was lost for failure to serve the summons, and not years later. Therefore, the accrual of any action for failure to notify Joyce that his legal malpractice claim had accrued was July 3, 1984. There is no separate claim for the failure to disclose the effect of not serving the summons within three years which is in addition to the claim for the alleged malpractice; any such claim is subsumed within the initial malpractice. Accordingly, we conclude that because of the passing of the statute of repose, Joyce\u2019s claim against Garnaas has been lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\n<em>Did the District Court err when it determined that equity does not act to extend the statute of repose?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b620 Joyce alternatively argues that an attorney who intentionally misleads a client about the status of that client\u2019s cas\u00e9is not entitled to the protection afforded by the statute of repose, and asks this Court to afford him equitable relief from the otherwise absolute ten-year stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ute of repose codified at \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. Asserting that Garnaas purposely misled him regarding the status of his personal injury suit against Glenn, Joyce urges this Court to consider two possible equitable remedies. First, Joyce suggests that an attorney who intentionally misleads his or her client about the true status of the case is not entitled to claim the benefit of the statute of repose because \u201cno one can take advantage of his wrong\u201d according to \u00a7 1-3-208, MCA. Second, Joyce suggests that we should rule that Garnaas is equitably estopped from asserting the statute of repose. Joyce cites <em>Billings Post No. 1634 v. Department of Revenue </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 84, 90, 943 P.2d 517, 520, to support his proposition that equitable estoppel is invoked to \u201cpromote justice, honesty, and fair dealing; the purpose of the doctrine ... is to prevent a party from taking unconscionable advantage of his or her wrong while asserting a strict legal right.\u201d Joyce urges us to apply the statute of limitations fraudulent concealment doctrine found at \u00a7 27-2-102(3)(b), MCA, to toll the ten-year statute of repose so that Garnaas cannot take advantage of his wrong (concealment) while asserting a strict legal right (statute of repose).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b621 The District Court considered this equitable argument and concluded that it must fail because the ten-year statute of repose is absolute. Joyce suggests that \u00a7 27-2-102(3)(b), MCA, which allows for a tolling of the statute of limitations for fraudulent concealment should apply to this case to toll the statutes of limitations and repose because of Garnaas\u2019s alleged fraudulent concealment of the facts of Joyce\u2019s second cause of action against him. Joyce urges us to conclude that a defendant cannot fraudulently conceal a matter for a sufficient time to exceed the statute of repose and thereby take advantage of his or her own wrong. However, \u00a7 27-2-102(3)(b), MCA, does not apply to legal malpractice actions. Actions for legal malpractice are covered in part two of the statute of limitations chapter of the Montana Code Annotated, and are governed by \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. Section 27-2-206, MCA, incorporates the tolling principle that an action for legal malpractice must be commenced within three years after the plaintiff discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the act, error, or omission, regardless of whether it was actually concealed. But in no case does the statute allow an action to commence after ten years from the date of the act, error, or omission.</p>\n<p id=\"A4Q\">\u00b622 As we discussed previously, there is no provision in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, which allows fraudulent concealment to be a cause for the tolling of the statutes of limitations or repose. As we stated in <em>Blackburn, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>286 Mont. at 73, 951 P.2d at 9, a statute of repose is not tolled without the presence of modifying or limiting language. There is no such language in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. Although the Legislature specifically adopted the fraudulent concealment tolling provision with regard to the statute of repose in medical malpractice cases (see \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA), it specifically did not adopt that provision with regard to the statute of repose for legal malpractice. Aside from incorporating a tolling provision for discovery by reasonable diligence of the act, error, or omission, the Legislature specifically stated that \u201cin no case may the action be commenced after ten years from the date of the act, error, or omission.\u201d Section \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b623  We agree with the District Court that the omission in this case which gives rise to a claim for legal malpractice was Garnaas\u2019s failure to have the summons served within the three-year time limitation. Even Joyce\u2019s allegations of continuing fraudulent concealment on the part of Garnaas cannot be remedied by the statutory language of \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. Moreover, we have previously rejected a similar argument in <em>Schneider v. Leaphart(</em>1987), 228 Mont. 483, 743 P.2d 613. Joyce\u2019s argument that Garnaas\u2019s acts of concealment continued as late as January 13, 1993, must fail because Joyce\u2019s claims for damages against Garnaas for not informing him of the legal malpractice relate back to the date the summons was not served. Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that principles of equity do not extend the statute of repose because Joyce cannot claim any actual damages separate and apart from Garnaas\u2019s original omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b624 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b227-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AIZ\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\u00b625 I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">\u00b626 The basis for my disagreement with the majority is its conclusion in \u00b612 of its opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">The only act, error, or omission by Garnaas which could be said to have precluded Joyce from recovering damages was the failure to serve the summons and complaint within the three years allowed by Rule 41(2)(e), M.R.Civ.P, on or before July 2,1984.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">\u00b627 If the Joyce and Garnaas attorney-client relationship had ended on July 2, 1984,1 would agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Garnaas\u2019 failure to advise Joyce of his negligent omission did not give rise to a separate cause of action, but was simply a basis for toll<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ing the three-year statute of limitations for up to ten years pursuant to \u00a7 27-2-106, MCA. However, the attorney-client relationship at issue did not end on July 2,1984. Garnaas continued to represent Joyce and according to Joyce\u2019s testimony, not only withheld information from him regarding the true status of his case, but made actual representations to him regarding that case. This course of conduct was a breach of Garnaas\u2019 fiduciary duty to Joyce which was, itself, actionable and caused Joyce damage by concealing from him the need or basis for filing a malpractice action against Garnaas until more than ten years after Garnaas\u2019 original act of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b628 First, I must point out that I am assuming those facts to be true which are most favorable to Joyce, because he is the party against whom summary judgment was entered. Furthermore, while Joyce\u2019s deposition has not been filed with this Court, a summary of his testimony with references to page numbers is provided in the appellant\u2019s brief, and I assume that summary to be correct because it is not controverted in the respondent\u2019s brief. In fact, the respondent concedes in his brief that there is a factual dispute about what was said by Garnaas to Joyce and what information was withheld by Garnaas from Joyce during the years following Garnaas\u2019 failure to serve Joyce\u2019s summons and complaint on the defendant in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b629 The facts I assume to be true for purposes of the summary judgment proceeding are: that Garnaas continued to represent Joyce following his failure to serve the summons and complaint; over the years Joyce asked Garnaas about the progress of his lawsuit against Glenn and was repeatedly assured by Garnaas that the suit was ongoing and that further proceedings were pending; and that these misrepresentations continued into 1993. In fact, it is Joyce\u2019s contention that Garnaas failed to tell him about the January 13,1993 order which finally dismissed his lawsuit for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b630 In <em>Morse v. Espeland </em>(1984), 215 Mont. 148, 696 P.2d 428, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">Unquestionably, an attorney has a fiduciary relationship with a client on most matters pertaining to the representation. <em>In the Matter of Bretz </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 23, 56, 542 P.2d 1227, 1245.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">Likewise, as an attorney, respondent owed his client the obligation to deal fairly and in good faith when negotiating a fee and when ultimately charging and collecting the fee.... If the facts al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>leged by appellant are true, the fact-finder could determine there was a breach of the obligation owed to deal fairly and in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_-\"><em>Morse, </em>215 Mont. at 151-52, 696 P.2d at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b631 While Montana case law provides no extensive discussion of breach of the fiduciary duty as the basis for a professional liability claim or the exact conduct for which recovery is permitted based upon breach of that duty, a thorough discussion is provided in the Utah case of <em>Kilpatrick v. Wiley, Rein, &amp; Fielding </em>(Utah App. 1996), 909 P.2d 1283. In that case, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant law firm had committed professional malpractice by failing to disclose a conflict of interest from which plaintiffs allege they were ultimately damaged. In discussing the potential forms in which a malpractice action can be presented that court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">Legal malpractice is a generic term for at least three distinct causes of action available to clients who suffer damages because of their lawyers\u2019 misbehavior. Clients wronged by their lawyers may sue for damages based on breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, or negligence. <em>See </em>Roy R. Anderson and Walter W. Steele, Jr., <em>Fiduciary Duty, Tort &amp; Contract: A Primer on the Legal Malpractice Puzzle, 41 </em>SMU L.Rev. 235 (1994) (arguing for careful distinctions between contract, tort, and fiduciary duty causes of action for legal malpractice);... Regardless of whether the cause of action is based on negligence, breach of contract, or breach of fiduciary duty, the central purpose of the law of legal malpractice is to guard against and to remedy exploitation of the power lawyers possess over their clients\u2019 lives and property. <em>See </em>Anderson &amp; Steele, <em>supra, </em>at 236.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\"><em>Kilpatrick, </em>909 P.2d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b632 In <em>Kilpatrick </em>the Utah court distinguished claims based on breach of fiduciary duty from those based on negligence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbN\">While legal malpractice actions based on breach of contract are conceptually distinct, legal malpractice actions based on negligence and breach of fiduciary duty are more difficult to differentiate. As fiduciaries, attorneys have a legal duty \u201cto represent the client with undivided loyalty, to preserve the client\u2019s confidences, <em>and to disclose any material matters bearing upon the representation [of the client].\u201d </em>1 Ronald E. Mallen &amp; Jeffrey M. Smith, <em>Legal Malpractice </em>\u00a7 11.1, at 631 (3d ed. 1989).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\"><em>Kilpatrick, </em>909 P.2d at 1290 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Legal malpractice based on negligence concerns violations of a standard of care; whereas, legal malpractice based on breach of fiduciary duty concerns violations of a standard of conduct. <em>See id. </em>at 249.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><em>Kilpatrick, </em>909 P.2d at 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b633 Quoting from <em>Smoot v. Lund, </em>13 Utah 2d 168, 172, 369 P.2d 933, 936 (1962), the court described the obligations owed to a client based on the fiduciary relationship as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">It is also true that because of his professional responsibility and the confidence and trust which his client may legitimately repose in him, he must adhere to a high standard of honesty, integrity[,] and good faith in dealing with his client. He is not permitted to take advantage of his position or superior knowledge to impose upon the client; nor to conceal facts or law, nor in any way deceive him without being held responsible therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\"><em>Kilpatrick, </em>909 P.2d at 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b634 Finally, the Utah court described the elements of legal malpractice based on fiduciary duty as: (1) an attorney-client relationship; (2) breach of the fiduciary duty to the client; and (3) causation of damages. <em>Kilpatrick, </em>909 P.2d at 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u00b635 In this case, Joyce alleged two claims against Garnaas: (1) he alleged that Garnaas was negligent by failing to serve the defendant in the underlying personal injury action with the summons that had been issued; and (2) he alleged that Garnaas breached his duty of disclosing to him, honestly, the status of his case. I conclude that the alleged failure to disclose gave rise to a second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty; and that all elements of the second cause of action accrued on or about July 3,1994 when Joyce was barred by the statute of repose found at \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, from bringing an action against Garnaas to recover compensation for his original act of professional negligence. Because Joyce\u2019s action for breach of that fiduciary duty was filed on October 24, 1995, it was filed within three years from the date on which the action accrued and was timely. Therefore, I conclude that the District Court erred when it dismissed Joyce\u2019s claim for breach of fiduciary duty by summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AKK\">\u00b636 Nor do I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that to acknowledge a second cause of action for breach of the fiduciary duty would eliminate statutes of repose. As set forth previously, the elements of the action for breach of fiduciary duty require an ongoing attorney-client relationship and a further affirmative act or omission such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>as a misrepresentation, or concealment, or failure to inform regarding the subject of the representation. This does not represent the typical situation in claims of professional negligence. In the most common situation, when an act of negligence occurs, the client\u2019s rights are somehow affected and the attorney-client relationship ends. Under those circumstances, there may be an ethical obligation on the part of the attorney to advise his former client of his negligent act or omission, but there is no fiduciary obligation which would give rise to a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b637 For these reasons, I dissent from the majority opinion. I would reverse the District Court and remand for further proceedings related to Joyce\u2019s claim that during his attorney-client relationship with H. L. Garnaas, that Garnaas breached his fiduciary duty to Joyce by failing to disclose to him the true status of his claim against Edward John Glenn.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
