Christian (Dana) appeals from the Sixth Judicial District Court, Park County restraining order dated January 21, 1999, and from the February 4,1999 order denying his motion for amendment. We reverse and vacate the court\u2019s January 21,1999 order and remand this case to the District Court for farther proceedings on Dana\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\u00b62 The parties\u2019 marriage was dissolved in California in 1987. On December 30, 1998, Dana, a licensed attorney appearing <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u201cMotion to Modify Child Custody and Related Issues\u201d along with a supporting brief and affidavit. Among other things, Dana\u2019s motion requested a restraining order against his former wife, Nancy Mueller f/n/a Nancy Christian (Nancy). Dana\u2019s motion arose out of an ongoing dispute between the parties concerning custody and visitation of the parties\u2019 minor child. The alleged facts surrounding the incidents precipitating Dana\u2019s motion are not material to our disposition of the legal question at issue. Nancy, by counsel, filed her response, brief and affidavit on January 12,1999. She objected to Dana\u2019s motion on both procedural and substantive grounds. Nancy did not request a restraining order against Dana, however. Dana filed his reply affidavit on January 20,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\u00b63 On January 21, 1999, without notice or hearing, the District Court entered an order requiring each party to stay 1500 feet away from the other party\u2019s residence and place of work. This order also designated where the parties would transfer custody of the child for visitation purposes and established a telephone contact protocol and visitation schedule. The court directed that its order \u201cremain in effect until further order of the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\u00b64 On the same date that the court issued this order, Dana filed his \u201cMotion for Amendment-Clarification\u201d objecting to the court\u2019s mutual restraining orders. Dana argued that \u00a7 40-15-202(3), MCA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, precluded issuance of a restraining order against him where only he had requested that relief against Nancy. This section of the code pertains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>to the issuance of orders of protection and is located in that chapter of the code dealing with partner and family member assault; sexual assault; and stalking; and the safety and protection of victims. <em>See </em>Title 40, chapter 15, Montana Code Annotated. On February 4, 1999, the District Court denied Dana\u2019s motion stating that it had not issued the restraining order under the authority of \u00a7 40-15-202(3), MCA, but rather, had issued its order under \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in issuing a mutual restraining order under \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA, for an indefinite period of time and without notice and hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b66 Typically, we review a trial court\u2019s grant of injunctive relief for \u201cmanifest abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Van Loan v. Van Loan </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 176, 178-79, 895 P.2d 614, 615 (citation omitted). However, where, as here, the court grounds its decision to issue such relief upon its interpretation of a particular statute, we review <em>de novo </em>the court\u2019s legal conclusion as to its jurisdiction \u2014 i.e., simply to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>See State v. Asmundson </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 141, 145-46, 940 P.2d 104, 106-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u00b67 Section 40-4-121(2)(c), MCA, allows either party, by independent motion supported by affidavit, to request the court to issue a temporary injunction enjoining a party from molesting or disturbing the peace of the other party or of any family member. Subsection (2)(d) permits the court to exclude a party from the family home or from the home of the other party upon showing that physical or emotional harm would otherwise result. The trial court referenced both of these subsections in its February 4,1999 order as the authority for its issuance of its January 21, 1999 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">\u00b68 Section 40-4-121(4), MCA, however, provides in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ny temporary injunction entered under this subsection [2] must be for a fixed period of time, not to exceed 1 year ...\u201d Furthermore, \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA, requires in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">(5) The court may issue a temporary restraining order for a period not to exceed 20 days without requiring notice to the other party only if it finds on the basis of the moving affidavit or other evidence that irreparable injury will result to the moving party if an order is not issued until the time for responding has elapsed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>(6) A response may be filed within 20 days after service of notice of motion or at the time specified in the temporary restraining order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">(7) At the time of the hearing, the court shall determine whether good cause exists for the injunction to continue for 1 year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b69  In the case at bar, the District Court\u2019s January 21,1999 restraining order fails the requirements of subsections (2), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA. First, the court\u2019s order was not entered for \u201ca fixed period of time, not to exceed 1 year.\u201d Rather, the court directed that its order was to \u201cremain in effect until further order of the Court.\u201d This frame of reference is neither for a \u201cfixed period\u201d nor does it preclude the order from exceeding the 1-year statutory time limit. Thus, \u00a7 40-4-121(4), MCA, is violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\u00b610  Second, the court\u2019s January 21, 1999 order was issued as against Dana without request from Nancy (contrary to \u00a7 40-4-121(2), MCA) and also without notice to either party, proper findings, or a hearing. Section 40-4-121(5), MCA, read together with \u00a7 40-4-121(6) and (7), MCA, unambiguously requires notice and hearing before a restraining order under \u00a7 40-4-121(2), MCA, is issued. <em>Asmundson, </em>283 Mont. at 145-46, 940 P.2d at 106-07. If, as it was here, the restraining order is issued without notice, subsection (5) limits the duration of the order to 20 days, and this subsection also requires the court to make certain prescribed findings. These statutory findings are not included in either the court\u2019s January 21, 1999, or February 4, 1999, orders. Moreover, the court\u2019s January 21, 1999 order was issued without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\u00b611 Nancy argues that because \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA, directs the clerk of the district court to issue a restraining order without notice or hearing, the District Court doing the same thing was, thus, proper. Nancy\u2019s argument is without merit. Section 40-4-121(3), MCA, directs the clerk of the district court to issue a temporary restraining order in conjunction with the issuance of a summons pursuant to Title 40, chapter 4, Montana Code Annotated. No summons was issued in this case. Rather, Dana applied for a restraining order by independent motion accompanied by affidavit under \u00a7 40-4-121(2), MCA. Moreover, the temporary restraining order issued by the clerk under \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA, is limited statutorily to matters involving property. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-121(3)(a) and (b), MCA. Section 40-4-121(3), MCA, is clearly inapplicable in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u00b612 When interpreting a statute, we look first to the plain meaning of its words. When the statute is plain, unambiguous, direct and certain, the statute speaks for itself and there is no need to resort to extrinsic means of interpretation. <em>Asmundson, </em>283 Mont. at 146, 940 P.2d at 107 (citing <em>State v. Gould </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 207, 219, 902 P.2d 532, 540). Based upon our plain reading of the unambiguous requirements of \u00a7 40-4-121(2), (4), (5), (6) and (7), MCA, the District Court\u2019s January 21, 1999 restraining order failed to comply with these subsections and was, accordingly, improperly issued as a matter of law. <em>See Asmundson, </em>283 Mont. at 146, 940 P.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b6 13 While we gather from Dana\u2019s brief that he believes the restraining order against Nancy should remain in effect, it is invalid as against her as well for the reasons set forth above. Moreover, while the court\u2019s January 21, 1999 order covers matters arguably not involving keeping the parties away from each other\u2019s homes and businesses, it appears from our reading of the court\u2019s order that these latter matters were part and parcel of the injunctive relief granted by the court. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the court revisit all of these matters on remand after proper notice is given to the parties and after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b6 14 The court\u2019s issuance of its January 21,1999 mutual restraining order is reversed and the order is vacated. We remand this case to the District Court for further proceedings on Dana\u2019s motion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-6\">JUSTICES HUNT, LEAPHART, TRIEWEILER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\">.
