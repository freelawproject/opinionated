Following a two-week trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Torgerson. Benjamin appeals from the District Court\u2019s judgment in favor of Torgerson and Torgerson cross appeals. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it excluded evidence of Torgerson\u2019s prior acts?</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by allowing testimony regarding Benjamin\u2019s credibility?</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b549-16\">\u00b65 Eric Torgerson is the former husband of Mark Benjamin\u2019s aunt. Torgerson\u2019s children are close in age to Benjamin and the two families spent a great deal of time together during Benjamin\u2019s childhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">\u00b66 In 1987, Benjamin\u2019s parents learned that he had sexually abused younger family members and relatives. As a result, Benjamin was enrolled in and participated in extensive counseling and therapy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Benjamin\u2019s counselors suspected that he may have been the victim of sexual abuse himself, however Benjamin repeatedly denied that he had been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b67 At the age of 19, Benjamin was charged with felony theft. His parents told the County Attorney Benjamin\u2019s prior problems, and as part of a deferred prosecution agreement, Benjamin was required to enter a sex offender treatment program in Utah. As part of the program, he was administered a polygraph examination, during which he was asked whether or not he had ever been the victim of sexual abuse. (This fact is only noteworthy because Torgerson sought to admit the test results at trial.) Benjamin did not complete the program and returned to Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b68 Sometime thereafter, while Benjamin was in jail because of another felony theft charge, he alleged that he had been a victim of sexual abuse. Benjamin claimed that Torgerson sexually abused him over a 10-year period from the age of 5 to the age of 15. This suit followed that disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b69 During the discovery phase of litigation, Benjamin deposed an aunt, Sylvia Moran, who is the sister of Torgerson\u2019s ex-wife. Moran testified that Torgerson had sexually abused her from 1972, when she was approximately 14 years old, until approximately 1976, when she graduated from high school. Benjamin also informed Torgerson that he intended to call Darcy Larson, a former school mate of Torgerson to testify that in the late 1960s, when she was 11 years old, Torgerson had sexually assaulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u00b610 In response to pretrial motions, the District Court excluded the evidence of alleged sexual assaults on the two women from Benjamin\u2019s case in chief, and excluded the results of polygraph examinations that Benjamin had taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u00b611 At trial, Benjamin requested that the District Court allow him to use this evidence of Torgerson\u2019s prior conduct to impeach one of Torgerson\u2019s expert witnesses. That motion was denied. Torgerson requested that one of his expert witnesses be permitted to testify to the results of the polygraph examination, and this motion was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\u00b612 Following a two-week trial, the jury returned a verdict for Torgerson. Benjamin appeals from that result. Torgerson cross appeals from the refusal to admit the results of Benjamin\u2019s polygraph exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b6 13 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it excluded evidence of Torgerson\u2019s conduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b614 Benjamin intended to introduce evidence in his case that Torgerson sexually assaulted Moran and Larson. Torgerson sought a preliminary ruling excluding the evidence, which the District Court granted on the basis that the evidence of other acts lacked sufficient similarity and proximity in time to qualify for admission pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., and the modified <em>Just </em>rule established in <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. Trial courts are vested with broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible, and this court will not overturn an evidentiary determination in the absence of an abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Link, </em>1999 MT 4, \u00b620, 293 Mont. 23, \u00b6 20, 974 P.2d 1124, \u00b620. The fact that discretion is permitted, infers that there may be more than one permissable way to resolve an evidentiary issue and that the District Court is in the best position to make that decision. In other words, there is not a purely correct or incorrect answer to every evidentiary issue. This is particularly true regarding evidence of prior acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u00b616 Rule 404, M.R.Evid., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">(a) Character evidence generally. Evidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">(b) Other crimes, wrongs, acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">\u00b617 In <em>Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assurance </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 1, 914 P.2d 976, this Court applied the <em>State v. Matt </em>criteria and Rule 404(b) in the context of a civil action. Those criteria require that: \u201c(1) the other acts must be similar; (2) the other acts must not be remote in time; (3) the other acts may be admitted for one of the permissible purposes provided in Rule 404(b); and (4) the probative value of the other act must not be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Cartwright, </em>276 Mont. at 21, 914 P.2d at 989. In this case, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Court considered the <em>Matt </em>criteria and our prior case law which applies those criteria to the facts of various cases. The vast majority of our prior cases are criminal cases in which the defendant appealed the admission of prior acts evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b618 With respect to the exclusion of Larson\u2019s testimony, Torgerson contends that because no offer of proof was made at trial, Benjamin\u2019s objection to the exclusion of her testimony is not properly before this Court. However, Rule 103, M.R.Evid. provides that where a ruling excludes evidence, the substance of the evidence must be made known to the court through an offer of proof, <em>unless </em>the substance was apparent from the context within which questions were asked. <em>See also In Re Marriage of Johansen </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 451, 457-58, 863 P.2d 407, 411-12. Although no offer of proof was made at trial, nor was any testimony from Larson made part of the record, the substance of Larson\u2019s proffered testimony was set forth in pretrial briefs and discussed during the hearing on the motion to exclude. Therefore, we conclude that the substance of Larson\u2019s testimony was made known to the District Court prior to its ruling and was properly preserved in the record for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>Admissibility as Part of Benjamin\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b619 The District Court concluded that the evidence proferred by Benjamin did not meet the first <em>Matt </em>requirement of similarity. Benjamin contends that this was an abuse of discretion, because Torgerson\u2019s alleged abuse of Moran was sufficiently similar to his alleged abuse of Benjamin and cites various similarities. He argues that the alleged assault on Larson was also similar by virtue of her age at the time she was allegedly assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b620 Torgerson contends that the acts to which Moran would have testified were not sufficiently similar to those alleged by Benjamin and lists a number of dissimilarities. He does not address Larson\u2019s testimony in his brief to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u00b621 The District Court determined that the prior acts were too remote and too dissimilar to be admissible pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">\u00b622  The first prong of the <em>Matt </em>test does not require that the prior acts be identical to the crime alleged, but they must be sufficiently similar. <em>See State v. Whitlow </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 430, 438, 949 P.2d 239, 245. We have upheld the admission of other crimes where the prior act was the touching of breasts and genitals with attempted penetration of the defendant\u2019s young daughter, and the act com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>plained of was touching and actual penetration of another young girl. <em>See Whitlow, </em>285 Mont. at 438, 949 P.2d at 245. We have also concluded that the similarity prong was satisfied where the prior act was the touching of the outer and inner thighs in an attempt to touch the vaginal areas of a 13-year-old girl, and the act complained of was actual touching of the vaginal areas of 8-, 9-, and 14-year-old girls. <em>See State v. Crist, </em>253 Mont. 442, 446, 833 P.2d 1052, 1055. However, the State in <em>Crist, </em>also offered prior act evidence that the defendant showed a minor a pornographic magazine, offered her an alcoholic beverage and joked that he would \u201ctake advantage\u201d of her. We concluded that these acts were innuendos that were too broad to meet the standards of similarity, and could not properly be characterized as sexual abuse. <em>See Crist, </em>253 Mont. at 446-47, 833 P.2d at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b623 In <em>State v. Long </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 502, 726 P.2d 1364, this Court held that allegedly rubbing the clothed bottom of a five-year-old was sufficiently similar to the complained of facts that the defendant had rubbed the unclothed vaginas of two, four-year-old children, although the defendant argued that the alleged prior bad act \u201chad no sexual connotation and that it took on evil connotations only when coupled with the charges of sexual assault.\u201d <em>Long, </em>223 Mont. at 507, 726 P.2d at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u00b624 In this case, both parties presented the District Court with lengthy argument about the admissibility of the prior acts. From our review of the record, we conclude that the Court did not abuse its discretion when it reviewed the authorities and concluded that the proffered evidence should not be admitted at trial. Despite the fact that both the act complained of and the alleged prior acts were instances of sexual assaults of minors, there are nonetheless significant distinguishing characteristics in the conduct complained of, from which the District Court could have concluded that the acts were too dissimilar to warrant their admission. In particular, we note that in each of our prior cases cited here, the prior conduct admitted by the District Court was similar in very specific details to the conduct complained of. While we do not conclude that such detail is a necessity in every case, we conclude that the District Court could properly have distinguished the prior conduct in this case on that basis. Accordingly, we defer to the District Court\u2019s broad discretion and conclude that that discretion was not abused when the District Court excluded the prior acts testimony of both women during Benjamin\u2019s proof of his case because the acts were not sufficiently similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u00b625 The District Court also concluded that the acts complained of were too remote. We have previously refused to establish an arbitrary time limit for remoteness of prior acts. <em>See Crist, </em>253 Mont. at 446, 833 P.2d at 1055; State <em>v. Medina </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 25, 30, 798 P.2d 1032, 1036, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Olson </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 364, 951 P.2d 571. More recently, we have stated that remoteness of a prior act affects its weight, not its admissibility. <em>See Whitlow, </em>285 Mont. at 438, 949 P.2d at 245; <em>State v. Ramstead </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 162, 167, 793 P.2d 802, 805 (citing <em>State v. Eiler </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 38, 49, 762 P.2d 210, 217). However, because we affirm the District Court\u2019s exclusion of the prior acts evidence on the basis of dissimilarity, we need not address whether it was too remote in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<em>Admissibility for Impeachment of Torgerson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u00b626 Benjamin contends that the prior acts evidence should have been admitted to impeach Torgerson. Benjamin argues that Torgerson testified on direct examination, in effect, that he did not have the opportunity to sexually abuse Benjamin in the basement bedroom of the Whitefish condominium and that Moran\u2019s testimony of her own abuse there should have been allowed for impeachment of, and to rebut, this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u00b627 Benjamin testified during proof of his case that Torgerson attempted anal intercourse with him in the basement of the Whitefish condominium, and that he cried out in pain. Torgerson subsequently testified, during the presentation of his case, that there were no doors at the head or foot of the stairs between the basement and ground floors, and that a person upstairs in the condominium could hear a television playing downstairs. During cross-examination, Benjamin asked Torgerson whether it was his testimony that a child in the bedroom with his face in a pillow could still be heard upstairs if he cried out, to which Torgerson responded that if a child screamed, it could be heard through the floors, because they were not insulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\u00b628 Benjamin contends that he should have been permitted to impeach these statements during cross-examination, pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-302, MCA, and to rebut Torgerson\u2019s statement, using the prior acts evidence, to show that Torgerson\u2019s insinuation that the basement could not be used as a place to abuse children was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\u00b629 Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible. See Rule 402, M.R.Evid. Rule 401, M.R.Evid., defines relevant evidence as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ble than it would be without the evidence, including credibility evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b630 Moran\u2019s deposition does not indicate that she ever struggled or cried out while she was allegedly sexually abused in the Whitefish condominium. Therefore, her testimony would not be relevant impeachment evidence because it would do nothing to establish whether or not the lack of sound barriers in the condominium would prevent Torgerson from sexually abusing Benjamin in the basement bedroom or whether or not Torgerson truthfully testified about the characteristics of the condominium. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it held that Moran\u2019s testimony was inadmissible for impeachment of Torgerson.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>Admissibility for Impeachment of Dr. Cannell</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\u00b631 Benjamin also contends that the prior acts evidence should have been admitted to impeach Dr. John Cannell, who testified that there was no reliable, third party documentation that Benjamin was abused and that as a result, he doubted the \u201cscientific validity\u201d of Benjamin\u2019s claim. Benjamin asked the District Court to allow him to impeach Dr. Cannell with the prior acts evidence in order to rebut Cannell\u2019s testimony that there was no third party documentation of the abuse, but the District Court refused to admit the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\u00b632  A witness is presumed to speak the truth. However, this presumption may be controverted or overcome by any matter that has a tendency to prove or disprove the truthfulness of the witness\u2019s testimony, including other evidence which contradicts the witness\u2019s testimony. <em>See </em>\u00a7 26-1-302(9), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">\u00b633 Dr. Cannell testified that the best evidence supporting a claim of child sexual abuse are contemporaneous medical records of the victim which document the physical effects of the abuse. He further testified that third party documentation is by far the most important information when evaluating the credibility of such a claim. He then testified that in his opinion there was little, if any, scientific validity to Benjamin\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">\u00b634 During cross-examination, Benjamin was able to challenge Dr. Cannell about the types of corroborating evidence which would be valuable for assessing the scientific validity of the claim. \u201cAccording to Dr. Cannell, these include third party documentation such as police reports, medical reports and reports from social workers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">\u00b635 Benjamin argued to the District Court that Moran\u2019s and Larson\u2019s proffered testimony was third party documentation of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>claim which provided scientific evidence of abuse. On appeal, he contends that the defendant\u2019s \u201cpropensity to molest children is a factor a psychiatrist would deem important corroborating evidence,\u201d and that as a result of the District Court\u2019s ruling, he was unable to cross-examine Dr. Cannell about the types of corroborating evidence which might be pertinent, and whether such evidence existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b636  However, the prior acts evidence which Benjamin sought to use to attack Dr. Cannell was not the type of evidence which Dr. Cannell said would provide third party documentation of Benjamin\u2019s abuse. Evidence tending to establish Torgerson\u2019s propensity to molest children is evidence of Torgerson\u2019s character, rather than of his actions with respect to Benjamin. It was corroborating evidence of Benjamin\u2019s abuse, rather than additional evidence about his abuser, which Dr. Cannell testified Benjamin lacked. Therefore the prior acts evidence would not have tended to impeach Dr. Cannell\u2019s testimony and was properly excluded by the District Court when offered for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u00b637 Did the District Court err by allowing testimony regarding Benjamin\u2019s credibility?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">\u00b638 Benjamin contends that Drs. John Cannell and William Stratford presented improper credibility testimony, substituting their judgment for the finder of fact as to whether Benjamin was credible. Both experts testified to the fact that Benjamin had made untruthful statements during several of his psychiatric evaluations and therapy sessions. Torgerson contends that Benjamin\u2019s objections to this evidence were properly overruled by the District Court, because the experts did not testify whether they found Benjamin to be credible, but simply related the results of psychological tests, which were administered to assess whether he was falsifying symptoms of a mental disease. He also contends that Benjamin had previously opened the door to the issue of his own credibility by presenting testimony that his test results were \u201cvalid,\u201d i.e., \u201ccredible,\u201d and by presenting testimony concerning events in the past about which Benjamin had lied to his therapists.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">\u00b639 By education, training, and experience, both Drs. Cannell and Stratford were qualified as psychiatric experts. Pursuant to Rule 702, M.R.Evid., they were qualified to provide diagnoses of psychiatric conditions and testify to the objective signs or subjective symptoms which are associated with various injuries, and which they have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>gleaned from their examination of a person or review of the appropriate sources, for the purpose of assisting the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine the fact in issue. They are no more qualified than the jury, however, and therefore not permitted to speculate to the jury about Benjamin\u2019s possible motivation for making his claim. <em>See Linden v. Huestis </em>(1991) 247 Mont. 383, 388, 807 P.2d 185, 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b640  The credibility of a witness lies exclusively within the province of the trier of fact, and expert testimony regarding the credibility of a witness improperly invades the jury\u2019s function by placing a stamp of scientific legitimacy on a victim\u2019s allegations, or by dismissing the validity of the allegations. <em>See State v. </em>Hensley, 250 Mont. 478, 481, 821 P.2d 1029, 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u00b641 At the same time, this Court has continued to allow physicians to assist the trier of fact to understand evidence of potential malingering. <em>See EBI/Orion Group v. Blythe, </em>1998 MT 90, 288 Mont. 356, 957 P.2d 1134; State <em>v. Race </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 177, 946 P.2d 641; State <em>v. Santos </em>(1995) 273 Mont. 125, 902 P.2d 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u00b642 Testimony from psychiatric experts often charts a dangerous course through the waters of admissible evidence and the shoals of improper credibility testimony because of its very nature. Unlike other fields of medicine, the psychiatric or psychological expert relies, for his or her diagnosis, on a patient\u2019s description of the way he interacts with the world around him, and observation of his behavior to see if it conforms with that description. Therefore, there are half a dozen tests which can be administered to a psychiatric patient that contain a reliability scale, i.e., a component for measuring the probability that the patient is telling the truth about his symptoms. Such tests are important diagnostic tools for both psychiatric treatment and for the expert witness; however, testimony about the conclusions drawn from the test results can potentially invade the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\u00b643 In <em>Linden, </em>the defendant against a claim for injuries arising from an automobile accident, presented expert medical testimony that the plaintiff\u2019s present complaints were a result of \u201cchronic pain syndrome,\u201d which he explained was a continuation of pain, associated with an opportunity for secondary gain, where the pain is no longer explainable by any physical trauma. We concluded that testimony regarding secondary gain prejudiced the jury and affected the plaintiff\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>See Linden, </em>247 Mont. at 389, 807 P.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u00b644 In <em>Hensley, </em>the defendant was charged with sexual intercourse without consent for the alleged molestation of his teenage daughter. In his defense he presented testimony from other family members that it would have been virtually impossible to commit the offense. The district court admitted rebuttal testimony from a social worker, to the effect that in her professional judgment the victim was truthful. We held that this was reversible error and stated that \u201c\u2019[n]o witness, expert or otherwise, should be permitted to give an opinion that another mentally and physically competent witness is telling the truth\u2019.... A jury is capable of assessing the credibility of such a witness.\u201d <em>See Hensley, </em>250 Mont. at 482, 821 P.2d at 1031, (citing <em>Wisconsin v. Haseltine </em>(Wis. App. 1984), 352 N.W.2d 673, 676).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b645 In this case, Dr. Cannell testified extensively about the necessity of treating skeptically (although he did not use those words) any claims of child sexual abuse that could not be corroborated by third party documentation. He testified that a \u201ccredibility assessment\u201d of Benjamin\u2019s claims was necessary, and he testified that in his opinion, there was no scientific evidence which supported Benjamin\u2019s claims. He further testified under cross-examination that when there is a question of secondary gain, one must be more careful in assessing the diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b646 Dr. Stratford testified about documentation that he had reviewed from other psychiatrists and counselors concerning a number of untrue statements made by Benjamin. He also testified that, in his opinion, Benjamin\u2019s psychiatric experts should have looked for malingered or falsified posttraumatic stress disorder, based upon Benjamin\u2019s psychiatric history.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b647 A review of the record shows that prior to Dr. Cannell\u2019s and Dr. Stratford\u2019s testimony, Benjamin\u2019s own experts had testified that he was a person who lied to make things easier for himself, had a lack of conscience and had trouble distinguishing right from wrong. Neither defense expert testified that Benjamin was actually malingering or pursuing secondary gain. The District Court concluded that Benjamin had previously opened the door to the reliability scales results from the psychiatric tests when his own experts testified to the results during Benjamin\u2019s case in chief. It overruled Benjamin\u2019s objections to testimony about specific instances of Benjamin\u2019s dishonesty that the jury had already heard about from other witnesses. However, in some cases the District Court sustained Benjamin\u2019s ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>jections to Stratford\u2019s testimony about specific untrue statements made by Benjamin.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b648 In sum, Torgerson\u2019s experts testified that credibility of the complaining witness is very important where there is no third party corroboration of sexual abuse. They testified about prior untrue statements by Benjamin which were documented in his psychiatric history; they testified to the results of his psychiatric testing; and they each gave the opinion that he has Associative Personality Disorder. They testified to their interpretations of the evidence, which did not support Benjamin\u2019s claims. No doubt the point of such testimony was to \u201cassist\u201d the jury to reach the conclusion that Benjamin was not being truthful about the alleged abuse by Torgerson, but they did not invade the province of the jury by testifying that Benjamin was or was not truthful, or was or was not motivated by secondary gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b649  We conclude, therefore, that the District Court did not err by admitting testimony regarding Benjamin\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b650 Because we affirm the judgment of the District Court, we do not address the respondent\u2019s cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b651 We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT, REGNIER, LEAPHART and DISTRICT JUDGE PURCELL, sitting for JUSTICE NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
