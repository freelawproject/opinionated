Whether the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">\u00b65 2. Whether DOC\u2019s request that Lake County comply with \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, was an unfunded mandate in violation of \u00a7 1-2-116, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-15\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b67-16\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-17\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b67-18\">\u00b67 In June, 1997 the District Youth Court found that J.A. was a delinquent youth. Upon the recommendation of DOC\u2019s youth placement committee, the District Court committed J.A. to DOC for placement at the San Marcos Treatment Center in Texas. The District Court also ordered that DOC pay the cost of transporting J.A. The District Court subsequently filed an order directing that DOC designate a place for it to receive custody of J.A. When DOC refused to pay J.A.\u2019s transportation costs, Lake County paid the cost of transporting J.A. to Texas, rather than have J.A. remain in detention while the issue of who should pay his costs was determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-19\">\u00b68 In July, 1997 the District Court issued a citation and order to DOC to show cause why it should not be ordered to pay the transportation costs for J.A. In August, 1997 the District Court held a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>and, in September, 1997 the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b69 The District Court determined that the portion of \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, directing the District Court to arrange for the transportation of a youth committed to DOC is unconstitutional. The District Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">The placement power is administrative power placed with the executive branch as determined by the Legislature through statute. Having given that power to the Department of Corrections, the legislative branch can not require the judicial branch to perform executive actions in support of the administrative. This is clearly a blurring of the separation of powers.... This statute completely reverses the roles of the executive and judicial branches in conflict with Article III, Section 1 of the Montana State Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The District Court further concluded that a \u201cplain reading of [\u00a7 52-5-109, MCA] would dictate that a place designated to receive custody was intended to refer to a location within [Montana].\u201d The District Court determined that in attempting to shift to Lake County the cost of transporting J.A. to Texas, DOC violated \u00a7 l-2-116(2)(a), MCA. The District Court ordered that DOC reimburse Lake County for the money it expended in transporting J.A. to Texas. DOC appeals from the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b610 1. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">\u00b611 Section 52-5-109, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-11\">Commitment expenses \u2014 arrangement for transportation. The expenses of committing a youth to the Pine Hills youth correctional facility or the department of corrections and transporting the youth to the Pine Hills youth correctional facility or the place designated by the department for it to receive custody, as well as the expense of returning the youth to the county of residence, must be borne by the county of residence. The district judge shall arrange for transportation of the youth to the place where the department has directed that it will receive custody of the youth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4S\">Section 52-5-109, MCA. Article III, Section 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-12\">Section 1. Separation of powers. The power of the government of this state is divided into three distinct branches \u2014 legislative, executive, and judicial. No person or persons charged with the exercise of power properly belonging to one branch shall exercise any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>power properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this constitution expressly directed or permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Article III, Section 1, Mont. Const.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b612 DOC argues that the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, is unconstitutional. Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Coate v. Omholt </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 488, 662 P.2d 591, DOC contends that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, does not interfere with the internal operations of a district court. Rather, DOC argues that arranging the transportation of youths is an administrative task performed by probation officers whom the District Court appoints. Relying on <em>Clark v. Dussault </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 479, 878 P.2d 239, DOC argues that \u201cseparation of powers only means \u2018that the powers properly belonging to one department shall not be exercised by either of the others.\u2019 \u201d DOC contends that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA\u2019s requirement that district courts arrange transportation for committed youths neither takes power from the judiciary nor gives the judiciary power.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b613 Lake County responds that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, is unconstitutional. Lake County asserts that the legislature has given all responsibility for placement to DOC; thus, \u201c[h]aving given that power to the Department, the legislative branch can not require the judicial branch to perform executive actions in support of the executive.\u201d Lake County argues that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, creates in essence a reversal of roles, with the judiciary performing administrative functions and acting \u201cas the Department\u2019s bus driver on the placement they develop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b6 14 A statute is presumed constitutional. <em>City of Billings v. Laedeke </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 151, 154, 805 P.2d 1348, 1349 (citation omitted). Further, a party challenging the constitutionality of a statute must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional. <em>Davis v. Union Pacific R. Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 233, 239, 937 P.2d 27, 30 (citation omitted). Courts have a duty to construe statutes \u201cnarrowly to avoid an unconstitutional interpretation if possible.\u201d <em>State v. Nye </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 505, 510, 943 P.2d 96, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b615 In previous decisions, this Court has recognized violations of the constitutional requirement of separation of powers in statutes that impair judicial authority and the integrity of judicial functions. In <em>Harlen v. City of Helena </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 45, 676 P.2d 191, this Court held that a city ordinance that provided for the licensing of attorneys \u201cwas invalid with respect to attorneys because it infringes upon this Court\u2019s constitutional authority to supervise and regulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>attorneys and the practice of <em>law.\u201d Harlen, </em>208 Mont. at 48, 676 P.2d at 193. The <em>Harlen </em>Court further concluded that \u201c[a]ny attempt by another branch of government to interfere with this constitutional prerogative interferes with the doctrine of separation of powers.\u201d <em>Harlen, </em>208 Mont. at 48, 676 P.2d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b616 In <em>Coate v. Omholt </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 488, 662 P.2d 591, this Court struck two statutes that imposed sanctions on district judges and Supreme Court justices when judicial decisions were not reached within time limits fixed by statute. The Court in <em>Coate </em>concluded that these statues violated Montana\u2019s constitutional separation of powers requirement because their effect</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">is to interfere with the internal operations of the judiciary in the same manner as if the judiciary would impose limitations on the legislature as to its internal operations, such as the number of committees, the time within which a committee must act, the time each legislator must attend the sessions, limiting the time of discussion, limiting the time one bill must pass from one house to the other and the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\"><em>Coate, </em>203 Mont. at 498, 662 P.2d at 596-97. The Court in <em>Coate </em>determined, however, that \u201cby [the constitutional separation of powers provision,] we do not mean absolute independence because \u2018absolute independence\u2019 cannot exist in our form of government.\u201d <em>Coate, </em>203 Mont. at 492,662 P.2d at 594. The <em>Coate </em>Court concluded that separation of powers requires \u201cthat the powers properly belonging to one department shall not be exercised by either of the others.\u201d <em>Coate, </em>203 Mont. at 492, 662 P.2d at 594 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b617 Further, in <em>State ex rel. Morales v. City Com\u2019n, Etc. </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 237, 570 P.2d 887, the Court struck a statute that allowed the termination of a police judge at the will of the city commission. The Court in <em>Morales </em>concluded that the statute was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">a clear violation of the mandate of the doctrine of separation of powers. The city commissioners, acting as the legislative branch of city government, may not infringe upon the duties of the judicial branch. The power to remove the police judge following a ruling adverse to the city commission is an impermissible infringement upon the duty of each and every judge to render a fair and impartial decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-9\"><em>Morales, </em>174 Mont. at 241, 570 P.2d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\u00b618  In the present case, we hold that the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, is unconstitutional. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>52-5-109, MCA\u2019s requirement that a district court \u201carrange the transportation\u201d of youth does not encroach upon judicial authority, require the judiciary to exercise executive power, or interfere with internal judicial operations. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s conclusion, there is no \u201ccomplete reversal\u201d of executive and judicial roles under \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA. A district court may sentence a delinquent youth to the custody of DOC pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1513, MCA; DOC then places a committed youth pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1522, MCA, et seq. Within this statutory scheme, the arrangement of transportation is an administrative detail. <em>Compare Application of Peterson </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 313, 316, 767 P.2d 319, 321 (concluding \u201c[t]he power of the Youth Court is not diminished through granting the Department placement power[;]... [t]he court has the exclusive power to sentence the youth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AiY\">\u00b619 2. Whether DOC\u2019s request that Lake County comply with \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, was an unfunded mandate in violation of \u00a7 1-2-116, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b620 Section 1-2-116, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">State agencies not to shift cost to local governments. (1) A state agency may not take any action prohibited by subsection (2) without authorization in state law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">(2) A state agency may not demand, bill, request, or otherwise require a local government to take any of the following actions or make the provision of a service to a local government that is required by state law to be provided to that government contingent on the local government taking any of the following actions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">(a) pay for all or part of the administrative costs of a program, activity, or undertaking required by state law to be carried out primarily by a state agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Section 1-2-116, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">\u00b621 DOC argues that the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA\u2019s requirement that counties pay for the transportation of youth is an unfunded mandate that violates \u00a7 1-2-116, MCA. DOC argues that \u00a7 1-2-116(1), MCA, which provides that \u201c[a] state agency may not take action prohibited by subsection (2) without authorization in state law,\u201d has not been violated because \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, specifically requires that Lake County pay for the transportation of youth. Thus, DOC is authorized under \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, to require that Lake County pay for the transportation of J.A. DOC also argues that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA\u2019s requirement that counties pay transportation costs is not an unfunded mandate because \u00a7 7-6-2511, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>allows counties to levy taxes to pay district court expenses. Further, DOC argues that \u00a7 41-5-104, MCA, requires that counties \u201cprovide the necessary funds [and] make all needful appropriations to carry out the provisions of [the Youth Court Act].\u201d Section 41-5-104(1), MCA. DOC argues that funds for transportation are necessary to carry out the provisions of the Youth Court Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b622 DOC contends that the District Court further erred in concluding that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, requires that counties pay for the transportation costs of youths only within the state of Montana. DOC argues that had the legislature intended that counties pay only for transportation within Montana, the legislature could have inserted such language in \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA. In the absence of such language, DOC argues that there are no restrictions on the places that it may designate \u201cto receive custody.\u201d Section 52-5-109, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b623 Lake County responds that \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA\u2019s requirement that counties pay for the out-of-state transportation of committed youths passes fiscal responsibility to counties as an unfunded mandate. Lake County argues further that in light of \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA\u2019s mention of two instate placement facilities, a reasonable reading of \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, is that the legislature only intended that counties pay for instate transportation of youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b624  We conclude that the plain meaning of \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, is that counties pay for the transportation of committed youth only within the state of Montana. DOC is itself a Montana agency. In the context of \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, it is only logical to assume that the legislature contemplated that a Montana agency would \u201creceive custody\u201d of the youth in the state of Montana, not Texas or Maine. Further, \u00a7 52-5-101, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">Establishment of state youth correctional facilities \u2014 prohibitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">(1) The department of corrections, within the annual or biennial budgetary appropriation, may establish, maintain, and operate facilities to properly provide custody, assessment, care, supervision, treatment, education.... The facilities include but are not limited to the Pine Hills youth correctional facility in Miles City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Section 52-5-101, MCA, makes no mention of out-of-state facilities. Moreover, \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, also makes no mention of out-of-state facilities. The plain language of \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, does not support DOC\u2019s expansive interpretation of this statute, and we decline to insert what has been omitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (providing \u201cthe office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted\u201d). We hold that under \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, a county is only required to pay the transportation costs of a committed youth within the state of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b625 Because this holding is dispositive, we do not address whether \u00a7 52-5-109, MCA, is an unfunded mandate under \u00a7 1-2-116, MCA. The order of the District Court requiring that DOC reimburse Lake County for its costs incurred transporting J.A. to the San Marcos facility in Texas is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b73-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER, GRAY and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
