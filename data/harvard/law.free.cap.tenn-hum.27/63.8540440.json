B. Campbell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the presiding judge. It was proved that the defendants were not married, that they lived together in the same house; that there was but one bed and they were seen to sleep together, and there were other proofs of cohabitation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">These proofs having been heard, the attorney general asked the witness whether it was not notoriously known and talked of in the neighborhood in which the defendants lived that they did live together, openly, notoriously and publicly as man and wife and in adultery. The attorneys for the defendant objected to the admission of this testimony. The objection was overruled. The witness then stated that it was rumored, talked of and known that they lived there in adultery and publicly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">The j\u00fary found the defendants guilty, and the judge sentenced them to be lined $50, and to be confined in the common jail of White county in separate apartments for the space of six months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-7\">From this judgment the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-8\"><em>S.

Thomas Johnson, a witness was then introduced for the State, and was asked by the attorney general, whether it \u201cwas not notoriously known, and talked of in the neighborhood in which the defendants lived, that they did live together openly, notoriously and pub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>licly as man and wife, and in adultery. To the answering of this question, the defendant\u2019s counsel objected, which objection was overruled and the witness permitted to answer the question. When the witness answered, that it was rumored, talked of, and known, in the neighborhoo'd, that they lived there in adultery, not being married, and publicly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The jury found the defendants guilty, and they appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The only question in this record, is, whether the evidence of Johnson was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">It was competent for the attorney general to have proved, that the parties lived together as man and wife, openly and notoriously \u2014 but this fact, like every other fact, must be proved by competent testimony. But in this case, the attorney general enquires \u201cwhether it was hot notoriously known, and talked of in the neighborhood\u201d &amp;c., and the witness replied that, \u201cit was rumored, talked of, and known that they lived in adultery\u201d &amp;c. Now this is proving the adultery, by proof of the rumor, and talk in the neighborhood, that it existed. This cannot be done. The witness should have been asked whether the parties lived together openly and notoriously, as husband and wife? and his affirmative response would have proved the fact, and would have been competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">It is true, that there is other evidence, sufficient, in our opinion to have authorized a verdict of guilty \u2014 but we cannot tell how much influence this illegal evidence had upon the minds of the jury, and, therefore, we feel constrained, reluctantly, to reverse the judgment and order a new trial. Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
