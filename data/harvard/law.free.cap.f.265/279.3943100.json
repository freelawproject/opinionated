The combination with a V-shaped radius rod, for motor vehicles, the ci'Otch of said radius rod having a swivel connection with the transmission ease of the motor vehicle, <em>and </em>having its legs connected to the top of the front axle, of a V-shaped subradius rod having an attachable and detachable connection with the crotch of the radius rod and having its legs connected to the bottom of said front axle.\u201d ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-19\">\u201c4. The combination with a V-shaped radius rod for motor vehicles, the crotch of the radius rod having a swivel connection with a fixed part of the motor vehicle <em>and </em>having its <em>logs </em>connected to the top of the front axle, of a V-shaped subra(lilts rod connected at one end to said radius rod near its crotch and at its other end to said axle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-20\">The patentee clearly made known the object of his invention when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>\u201cThe object of my invention is to re-inforce and strengthen said front radius rods, so that they will resist the violent jar imparted to them on the road and yet maintain their original shape thereby successfully serving to keep the front axle in alinement and facilitate safety and the easy steering qualities of the automobile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In other words, the applicant sought and secured a patent upon-a brace that supported the V-shaped radius rods of the Ford automobile. Appellee denied infringement, and also attacked the validity of all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Claims 1 and 2 provide for the attachment of the brace to the radius rod \u201cat the crotch.\u201d The importance of the place of attachment is emphasized by examining the third and fourth claims, both of which provide for the attachment \u201cnear its crotch.\u201d The infringing structure is not attached at the crotch, and we therefore dismiss these claims without further consideration, on the ground that their infringement does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">This defense does not exist as to claims 3 and 4, but as to them appellee insists that both are invalid for want of invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The problem which patentee attacked was certainly not a difficult one. When he found that-the radius rods were insufficient to support the strain which hard usage entailed, he sought to strengthen them. Not only was the strengthening of the radius rods the obvious remedy, but a brace was' the means which even a layman would have adopted to accomplish the end. To fasten one end of the brace to the lower side of the axle and to attach the other end to the radius rod was not only the obvious way, but it was practically the only way. Such attachment might be either at the end of the radius rod \u2014 that is, at the crotch \u2014 or between the crotch and the axle, or it might be nearer to the crotch than to the axle. Certainly to describe it as being \u201cnear the crotch\u201d does not suggest, nor has the counsel furnished us with any reason for attributing, genius to patentee in selecting his place of attachment. With the location of the place of attachment eliminated, we find nothing in the patent but a brace for a rod. We are unable to agree with the patent office that this constitutes invention. Crouch v.
