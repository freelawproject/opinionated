One of the defendants has pleaded guilty. They are both charged with having caused the transportation of liquor from Illinois into Indiana, giving the time and the place. One of the defendants, Dennis, has pleaded guilty and has become a witness for the government. The other defendant has pleaded not guilty, and the only question for you to decide is whether or not the defendant Grogs is guilty. As Mr. Dailey said to you in his discussion, there is no question that liquor was brought into indiana unlawfully. The only question is whether or not Gross was connected with it. As I have said to you, the defendant Gross is entitled to the ordinary presumptions and rules of law that are applicable to any other defendant on trial. He is presumed to be innocent until the government proves him guilty by evidence sufficient to convince you of his guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. * * <em>~</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-6\">\u201c \u2018When a defendant is charged with a crime and avails himself of the privilege of testifying, as he may under the law, the interest that he has in the result of the suit should be taken into consideration by you in determining how far, if at all, his testimony is to be believed. That is true, also, with reference to a defendant who has pleaded guilty. What interest has he in the result of this case?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-7\">\u201c \u2018Now, let us look at this just a minute. Lot us look the field over, and see just what are the proiier inferences to be drawn from this, if we can. It is for you to determine, gentlemen of the jury, and not for me; and what I may say about the evidence in the case, and what has been testified- to, and what has been proved, or what deductions should be drawn from.it \u2014 whatever I say is simply to enlighten your judgment and aid you in coming to a right conclusion, and not to bind your judgment. You have a right to disregard what I say as to facts in the case. Xou are only bound by what I say as to the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-8\">\u201c \u2018Let us look at this a moment. Mr. Dailey said, when liquor was brought into Indiana, a crime was committed. We will start with that. Then we have this question: Did Dennis do it for himself, or did he do it for the defendant Gross? And when you come to consider that question, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>bills \u2014 tbe transaction as it was carried out \u2014 the bills being made out to this defendant Gross at Gary, Ind.; the written orders which he gave to Dennis to enable him to get the liquor; the card which has been introduced in evidence; the piece of paper which has been testified about; the circumstances that Gross himself testifies to, ordering in advance the particular kind of liquor, and paying for it with his own personal check, and that thereafter, somewhere on the road, I believe it was, this lowly creature, that is not to be believed, pulled out of his pocket $179 in money and paid him \u2014 these are thing's that you should consider in determining where the truth as to this is; and it is for you to decide; not me. The responsibility is on you; not on me. But you should apply to the decision of a question like this your ordinary experience as men and the ordinary way in which business is done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-4\">\u201c \u2018Now, let us look a little bit farther. As I understand the defendant\u2019s contention \u2014 and it must be one way or the other, I think; I may be wrong about it; you should decide \u2014 as I understand the defendant\u2019s contention, it is that he secured this liquor for Dennis; secured it for Mm over in Illinois; yet, as I remember the evidence, Dennis lived in Gary, Ind.; his family was there, and he did his business there. It is for you to decide whether or not, under the circumstances, this defendant would have gone to the pains and the trouble to order this liquor, to pay for it, to go to Chicago and meet this dray-man to get it-i-all in order that the drayman might sell it; where? Had he any place to sell it in Chicago? Those are things you should take into consideration, and after you have deliberated upon this case, and given the defendant the benefit of the presumption of innocence and of reasonable doubt, as has been stated to you, it is for you to determine where the truth is.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-5\">\u25a0 \u201cThat at the close of said instructions, while the jury was still at the bar, Mr. Dailey made the following statement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-6\">\u201c \u2018The defendant wants to object and except to the court\u2019s remarks, not as a summary of the facts, but an argument from the facts, when the court said that this lowly creature, unworthy of belief, pulled out $179,\u2019 etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-7\">\u201cWhereupon the court said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-8\">\u201c \u2018Upon your objection, I will amend that by withdrawing it. Gentlemen of the jury, what I said to you about <em>the tacts, or any </em>inference I might draw from them, you are not bound by it. It is exclusively your province to determine that.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b626-9\">Henry W.

Counsel was asking the jury to credit Gross and discredit Dennis, because the latter was a bootlegger. But inasmuch as Dennis\u2019s only bootlegging was shown by Gross to have been done as the servant of Gross, it was not improper for the court to call counsel\u2019s attention to the fact that he could not fairly attack Dennis without including Gross in the same denunciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If for the characterization \u201cthis lowly creature, that is not to be believed,\u201d the name of the witness Dennis be substituted, we can only assume, in the absence of the evidence, that the judge gave the jury a fair and accurate summation of the evidence and of the contentions of the parties therefrom. In federal practice this has alwa3^s been recognized as commendable. Indeed, the judge may go beyond a \u201csumming up,\u201d and may \u201cexpress his opinion upon the facts,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>provided only that he clearly admonishes the jurors that the ultimate determination of the facts is their exclusive province. Lovejoy v. United States, 128 U. S. 171, 9 Sup. Ct. 57, 32 L. Ed. 389; Vicksburg &amp; M. R. Co. v. Putnam, 118 u. S. 545, 7 Sup. Ct. 1, 30 L. Ed. 257. This admonition was given repeatedly in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">If the expression \u201cthis lowly creature, that is not to be believed,\u201d was the judge\u2019s own portrayal of Dennis to the jury, it might be to Gross\u2019s advantage rather than his detriment. If it was a quotation from Gross\u2019s counsel\u2019s picture of Dennis, as we might well infer from the context, then counsel is responsible for the appearance of that term in the case. In either view, the expression was withdrawn, and the jury admonished to pay no attention to it. Under the statute (volume 40, pt. 1, U. S. Stat. p. 1181 [Comp. St Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 1246]) we are unable to say that the record affirmatively discloses prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
