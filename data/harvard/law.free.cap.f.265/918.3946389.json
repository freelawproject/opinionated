Action to recover for death by wrongful act, pursuant to General Laws of Vermont, \u00a7\u00a7 3814 and 3315. Plaintiff\u2019s decedent was a member of the bar, who died September 10, 1918, as a result of a collision between two trains on the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad. He was at the time of his death, and for years had been, the clerk of the United States court in Vermont. Liability was not contested, the jury liad no other function than to assess the damages, and the exceptions relate only to that subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b937-6\">By the statute above referred to tile personal representative of the deceased may bring suit and recover \u201csuch damages as are just, with reference to the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death.\u201d The amount recovered is by statute \u201cfor the benefit of [the surviving wife or husband] and next of kin, \u00ed= who shall receive the same proportions as in the distribution of 1he personal estate of persons dying intestate.\u201d Section 3315. After Mr. Piatt's death, and before the trial of this cause, the act of February 28, 1919 (40 Stat. 1182 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7\u00a7 1385a-lS85i]), became operative. By it all clerks of United. Slates courts are to be paid salaries from and after duly .1, 11)18, which salaries are to be established by the Attorney General \u201cat not less than $2,500 nor more than $5,000, based in each instance upon the amount of business transacted by the court and the fees and the emoluments received by the clerks in the four years last preceding.\u201d Section 1385b. Down to and including the date of trial the Attorney General had not fixed the salary to be received by the clerk of the District Court of Vermont.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b937-8\">At trial plaintiff proved what for several years prior to his decease Mr. Platt's income had been from the fees and emoluments of Ids clerkship, and also showed in some detail the manner and scale of expenditure of his domestic establishment. This latter evidence tended to prove that decedent devoted his earnings very largely (to say the least) to the comfortable, if not generous, maintenance of his wife, and to the advancement of the affairs of his children, who were at the time of his death of mature years. Exceptions were overruled, the jury returned a verdict which may be said substantially to represent the present value of the income shown to have been that of Mr. Platt, having regard to his expectation of life. To judgment on the verdict tins writ was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b937-9\">Stickney, Sargent &amp; Skeels, of Eudlow, Vt., for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b937-10\">Charles A.

The fact that at the time of trial the Attorney General had not fixed the salary of the office was properly laid before the jury as a circumstance for their consideration; hut, since by the statute the Attorney General\u2019s discretion in the matter was to be guided by what the office had been worth during substantially the time for which plaintiff showed its pecuniary value, the importance of the act of Congress in this case was not great.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>Damages, especially in causes like the present, are not -assessable with mathematical certainty; there is always a wide margin of discretion left for the jury, and the duty of the plaintiff is performed when the best evidence under the circumstances is produced, and that was done in the case at bar. It happens at times that even the best evidence affords no reasonable basis for damages. Concerning this no absolute rule need be, or perhaps can be, laid down; it is sufficient to hold here that the jury were reasonably warranted in finding (as the verdict shows) that what a man of Mr. Platt\u2019s professional reputation, personal character, and general repute had annually made during the latest years of his life, he would continue to gain during the balance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Objection to the second class of evidence denies that it was lawful to show, in addition to how much the decedent had gained, what he did with it. Under the Vermont statute decedent\u2019s personal representative was entitled to recover 'for the surviving wife and children \u201csuch damages as are just with reference to the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death.\u201d It is in our opinion obvious that under this language the recovery of or for the widow and children of a man industrious and thrifty, yet generous, should be larger than if the decedent had spent an income of the same amount in dissipation or purely selfish indulgence. Consequently the objection thereto is held unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Exactly the foregoing distinction between the recovery appropriate upon the death of a \u201chusband who maintained and cared for his wife\u201d and that of one \u201cindolent or thriftless\u201d is taken in Lazelle v. Newfane, 70 Vt. 444, 41 Atl. 511. In Memphis, etc., Co. v. Letson, 135 Fed. 974, 68 C. C. A. 453, plaintiff was unable to prove the income of decedent, hut he proved \u201chis mode of life (and what) he was in the habit of spending on his family.\u201d This was sufficient evidence upon which to base a recovery. This decision was approved in The Saginaw (D. C.) 139 Fed. 909, affirmed 146 Fed. 724, 77 C. C. A. 150,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where may be found numerous citations to the effect that in measuring damages the assessment is not to be governed solely by the earnings or income of the deceased, \u201cbut by what portion of the gross earnings or income the [widow] would probably have received from the deceased as his wife, if he had lived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Finding no error-in the admission of evidence, the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-7\"> The further affirmance in 207 U. S. 398, 28 Sup. Ct. 133, 52 L. Ed. 264, does not touch this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
