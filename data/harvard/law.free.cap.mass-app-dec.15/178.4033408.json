Except as otherwise stated herein, from on or before March 1, 1953 until the close of business on September 14, 1953, the defendant as a tenant at will of the plaintiff paying a monthly rent of $ 6,470.79 in advance on the first day of each calendar month used and occupied the parcel of land in the City of Boston bounded by Milk, Congress, Franklin and Pearl Streets and containing 67,899 square feet, more or less, which the plaintiff had theretofore acquired in fee by eminent domain for public off-street parking facility purposes under St. 1946, c. 474, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">2. By a writing served on the defendant on September 9, 1953, the plaintiff notified the defendant as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u201cYou are hereby notified to quit and vacate the premises occupied by you for Off-Street Parking purposes, located at Post Office Square, Boston, bounded by Milk, Congress, Franklin and Pearl Streets, by the close of business September 14, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u201cWill you kindly forward to this office your check for occupancy of the premises, based upon its use for Off-Street Parking purposes for fourteen days, commencing September 1, 1953.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">3. On September 14, 1953, but before the close of business on said day, the plaintiff, by a written lease duly made in accordance with St. 1946, c. 474, \u00a73, as amended, leased the aforesaid parcel to the First Franklin Parking Corporation for a term of forty years commencing September 15, 1953; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>on September 14, 1953, but before the close of business on said day, the defendant was notified of said lease by the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">4. At the close of business on September 14, 1953, the defendant by reason of said lease quit the aforesaid parcel and the plaintiff resumed constructive possession thereof until the First Franklin Parking Corporation entered thereon on September 15, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">5. The defendant has never paid the 14/30 of $5,470.79 which the plaintiff by this action seeks to recover for the defendant\u2019s use and occupancy of the aforesaid parcel during the period commencing with September 1, 1953 and ending with the close of business on September 14, 1953.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Upon the submission of the case stated and before final arguments the plaintiff filed requests for rulings of law, two in number, which the trial judge acted upon by the denial of each. Apparently he did this through an abundance of precaution because ordinarily on a true case stated requests for rulings of law are surplusage. The rulings were both denied, however, instead of being ignored. <em>Antoun v. Commonwealth, </em>303 Mass. 80; <em>Pillsley v. Allen, </em>297 Mass. 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The trial judge ordered judgment for the defendant and the plaintiff claiming to be aggrieved, the judge has reported his action to this Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The contention set forth in paragraph 2 of the case stated relative to a notice given by the plaintiff to the defendant on September 9, 1953 to quit and vacate the premises by the close of business on September 14, 1953 and returning the defendant\u2019s check for the September rent and requesting a check for the fourteen days use and occupation, has fallen of its own weight as counsel for the plaintiff has not seen fit to argue or stress it as being a good statutory notice. <em>Boston v. Dolan, </em>298 Mass. 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The sequence of events recited in paragraph 3 of the case stated, \u201cOn September 14, 1953 but before the close of business . . . written lease was duly-made.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u201cOn September 14, 1953, but before the close of business . . . the defendant was notified of said lease . . ., and in paragraph 4,</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\"At the close of business on September 14, 1953 the defendant by reason of said lease quit the aforesaid parcel . . ., clearly show that the defendant quit upon learning of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">A lease executed to a third person terminates a tenancy at will the moment it is executed irrespective of the commencement of the term recited in the lease. <em>Lash v. </em>Ames, 171 Mass. 487, 490; <em>Fratt v. Farrar, 10 </em>Allen 519; <em>Twombley v. Monroe, </em>136 Mass. 464; <em>Michael Chevrolet Inc. v. Inst. for Savings, </em>321 Mass. 215, 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The execution ends the tenancy at will and all that a tenant is entitled to is a reasonable time to get out after learning of the existence of the lease. There being no prescribed notice required, he may learn of it in a most informal way, \u2014 even by word of mouth. <em>Mizner v. Munroe, 10 </em>Gray 290, 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The other contention of the plaintiff that it is entitled to recover a proportional part of the rent from a tenant at will whose tenancy has been terminated between two rent days by the execution of a lease to a third party, undoubtedly was predicated on its primary contention that the quitting of the premises upon learning of the lease constituted a surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">As there was no surrender, G. L. c. <em>186, </em>\u00a78, relied upon by the plaintiff, affords it no comfort as this statute does not apply. <em>Emmes v. Feeley, </em>132 Mass. <em>346; Hammond v. Thompson, 168 </em>Mass. 531.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b189-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>Hector F. Cicchetti and William H. Kerr, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b189-7\"><em>Maguire &amp; Rotch and Robert J. Sherrer </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Ordering judgment for the defendant on the case stated was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>Report dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
