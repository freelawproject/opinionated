Derbyshire, and with a view to effect a sale to said Derbyshire of the alleged interest of said Simonton in the business and fixtures hereinafter mentioned as sold to said Derbyshire, did then and there unlawfully, knowingly and designedly, falsely pretend and represent to said Derbyshire that\u201d certain alleged facts as to said business and interest were true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-5\">\u201c And the said Derbyshire then and there believing the said false pretences and representations so made as aforesaid by said Hooper and said Simonton, and being deceived thereby, was induced, by reason of the false pretences and representations so made as aforesaid, to purchase and receive, and did then and there purchase and receive of the said Simonton said Simon-ton\u2019s pretended right of ownership in, and the right to receive the prospective profits in, an undivided half of said \u201d business, \u201c and to pay and deliver, and did pay and deliver therefor, and as the price thereof,\u201d a certain sum, <em>\u201c </em>of the property, goods, merchandise, chattels and effects of said Derbyshire.\u201d \"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-6\"><em>\" </em>And the said Simonton did then and there sell and deliver to said Derbyshire said right, and said Hooper and said Simon-ton did then and there receive and obtain the said goods, merchandise, chattels, effects and property of the said Derbyshire, from said Derbyshire, by means of the false pretences and representations aforesaid, and with intent to cheat and defraud the said Derbyshire of the same goods and merchandise, chattels, effects and property; whereas, in truth and in fact,\u201d said alleged facts as to said business and interest were not true, \u201c all of which said Hooper and said Simonton then and there well knew<em>.\u201d </em>And so the jurors aforesaid, upon their oaths aforesaid, do say that the said Hooper and said Simonton, by means of the false pretences aforesaid, on the said sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, at Boston aforesaid, unlawfully, knowingly and designedly did receive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>obtain from said Derbyshire the said goods, merchandise, chattels and effects so alleged to have been obtained of the property, ^ goods, merchandise, chattels and effects of the said Derbyshire, with intent to defraud him of the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-5\">At the trial in the superior court, before Putnam, J., the defendants moved to quash the indictment: 1. Because it did not charge that Derbyshire was induced, by any false pretence, \u201c to pay or deliver\u201d anything, or that he \u201cdid pay or deliver\u201d anything, by reason of any false pretence; nor was there \u201c any allegation of time or venue, when or where he was induced to pay anything, nor when or where he paid or delivered, nor to whom.\u201d 2. Because it did not charge that the defendants unlawfully, knowingly, designedly or fraudulently obtained the goods of Derbyshire. The judge overruled the motion, and the defendants were convicted, and alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b559-6\"><em>A. W. Boardman, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-4\">The Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>161, \u00a7 54, provide that \u201c whoever designedly, by a false pretence, or by a privy or false token, and with intent to defraud, obtains from another person any property,\u201d shall be punished; See. The indictment is bad for failing to aver that the goods were designedly obtained. <em>Gatewood </em>v. <em>State, </em>4 Ohio, 386. 1 Chit. Crim.

Allen, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b559-10\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATq\">The position of the defendants\u2019 counsel is correct that a good indictment must show, not only a false pretence and an intent to defraud, but also that the goods obtained thereby were designedly received by the defendants. The principal objection made to this indictment is that the allegation that the defendants \u201c did then and there receive and obtain the said goods \u201d is not thus qualified. It is not necessary that the qualifying term should be grammatically connected with the allegation of receipt. It is sufficient if there be, in any form, a distinct charge that the goods so received were knowingly and intentionally received in pursuance of the purpose to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">This indictment alleges that the defendants did receive and obtain the goods by means of false pretences, \u201c and with intent to cheat and defraud the said Derbyshire of the same \u201d goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>and property. The intent, thus alleged, relates back to the previous allegation of a receipt of the goods; and as it is not set forth as an intent merely to defraud, but as an intent to defraud Derbyshire of the same goods, it necessarily involves the qualification of design in the receipt thereof. We think it is thus sufficiently made to appear, by the allegations of the indictment, that the goods were received by the defendants designedly.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The other objection to the indictment does not appear to us <em>to </em>have any foundation for its support.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
