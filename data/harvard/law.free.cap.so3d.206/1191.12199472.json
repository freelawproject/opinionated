Contact with the turning vehicle was avoided. However, the driver of a vehicle being towed by the lead truck could not stop, resulting in an accident between those two vehicles. The passenger of the lead truck and the driver of the towed vehicle alleged injury as a result of the impact. Both the driver of the turning vehicle and the driver of the lead truck were named as defendants, as were their insurers. Following a bench trial, the trial court assessed 95% of the fault for the accident to the driver of the turning vehicle and 5% of the fault to the driver of the lead truck. It awarded general damages and past medical expenses to both plaintiffs. The insurer of the driver of the turning vehicle appealed. For the following reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"Ajke\">On November 8, 2013, David Sampson was traveling on the Marksville Highway in Avoyelles Parish, with Mario Jacobs as a passenger in his Ford truck. A second truck, a Chevrolet owned and occupied by Sandalon Jacobs, was attached by tow rope. Sandalon explained that the tow was necessary in order to relocate his truck from Hessmer to his home in Marksville due to a faulty fuel pump and a lack of insurance on the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">The record indicates that as the trucks were northbound on the highway, a Buick driven by Florence Decuir was traveling on Lemoine Street toward its intersection with the highway. Ms. Decuir explained that she saw the trucks approaching and that, as she thought she saw a turn signal, she turned onto the l2highway in order to give the trucks more room for the turn. Mr. Sampson, Mario, and Sandalon testified that Ms. Decuir turned onto the highway without stopping at the stop sign at the Lemoine Street intersection.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Sampson explained that, upon her turn, he \u201cslowed\u201d his truck to avoid hitting the Decuir vehicle. He denied \u201cmashing\u201d the brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">While Mr. Sampson avoided contact with Ms. Decuir, Sandalon explained that he applied the brakes in his truck in tow, but that it struck the rear of Mr. Sampson\u2019s truck. Sandalon further explained that his truck \u201cdropped\u201d as a result of the tire<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> flying off of the truck. Ms. Decuir, who proceeded on the highway, denied that she saw a collision, but explained that, when she looked behind her after turning, she saw a tire rolling to the side of the truck. She explained that she did not think that an accident occurred, but that she \u201cthought maybe the tire had just blown out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-12\">Thereafter, Mario and Sandalon filed suit, alleging personal injury as a result of the accident. They named Mr. Sampson and his insurer, Automobile Club Inter-Insurance Exchange, as defendants, as well as Ms. Decuir and her insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. State Farm was further named as a defendant in its capacity as Mario\u2019s uninsured motorist insurance provider. In pretrial proceedings, the plaintiffs dismissed Ms. Decuir from the proceedings, but proceeded against State Farm as her insurer. By the time of the subject bench trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>only remaining defendant was State Farm, as insurer of Ms. Decuir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">|sThe trial court ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, apportioning 95% of fault to Ms. Decuir and the remaining 5% to Mr. Sampson. The trial court determined that both plaintiffs sustained soft tissue injuries. It awarded Sandalon $46,500.00 in general damages and $5,397.81 in past medical expenses. The trial court awarded Mario $35,200.00 in general damages and $7,377.73 in past medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">State Farm appeals, asserting that the trial court erred in: 1) failing to apply La.R.S. 32:866 to Sandalon\u2019s claim as he was operating his vehicle without insurance; 2) its apportionment of fault; 3) awarding Mario pharmacy bills for certain medications that had been prescribed before the accident; 4) awarding excessive general damages to Sandalon for soft tissue injuries; and in 5) awarding general damages to Mario in light of prior accidents. We address these assignments out of order for purposes of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">\n<em>Fault</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-8\">Challenging the 95% apportionment of fault to Ms. Decuir, State Farm asserts that the trial court erred in failing to apportion at least some fault to Sandalon as the operator of the towed truck. It argues that although Ms. Decuir executed her turn onto the highway ahead of the two trucks, the trial court erred in its failure to apportion a larger percentage fault to Mr. Sampson, as he failed to safely regulate his speed as the driver of the lead truck. It also argues that the trial court erred in failing to apportion any fault to Sandalon, as he was unable to avoid contact with Mr. Sampson\u2019s vehicle, despite the fact that he was a following vehicle being towed only one car length behind Mr. Sampson while traveling at speeds of fifty-five miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">14We first address State Farm\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in its determination that Sandalon was not, to any degree, at fault for the accident. Louisiana Civil Code Article 2315 provides generally that: \u201cEvery act whatever of man that causes damage to another obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it.\u201d Additionally, La.Civ.Code art. 2316 provides that: \u201cEvery person is responsible for the damage he occasions not merely by his act, but by his negligence, his imprudence, or his want of skill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">Pursuant to the attendant duty-risk analysis, a finding of fault under the facts of a particular case requires proof that: 1) the actor had a duty to conform his or her conduct to a specific standard of care; 2) the actor failed to conform his or her conduct to that standard of care; 3) the substandard conduct was a cause-in-fact of the alleged injury; 4) the substandard conduct was a legal cause of the alleged injuries; and that 5) actual damages were sustained. <em>S.J. v. Lafayette Par. Sch. Bd., </em>09-2195 (La. 7/6/10), 41 So.3d 1119. For review purposes, we are mindful that a determination as to whether a duty is owed is a question of law. <em>Brewer v. J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., </em>09-1408 (La. 3/16/10), 35 So.3d 230. However, a finding regarding whether a duty has been breached is a question of fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-11\">With regard to State Farm\u2019s characterization of Sandalon as a following driver, La.R.S. 32:81(A) provides that \u201c[t]he driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.\u201d Additionally, jurisprudence reflects a presumption of negligence when a following motorist is involved in a rear-end collision. <em>See Brewer, </em>35 So.3d 230. However, that presumption is rebuttable. <em>Id. </em>The following motorist may establish that the unpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>dictable operation of the preceding vehicle created a situation which |5the following motorist could not reasonably have anticipated. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Cheairs v. State, Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>03-0680 (La. 12/3/03), 861 So.2d 536).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">Assuming the applicability of La. R.S. 32:81(A) to Sandalon as a following driver for discussion purposes, we find no manifest error in the trial court\u2019s determination that he did not breach the duty provided by the statute. In ruling, the trial court remarked upon Mr. Sampson\u2019s speed in driving the lead vehicle, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-6\">It is apparent that any reasonable man would not have driven this fast[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] at the location in the city limits of Marksville where the accident occurred which the, the rate of the speed apparently did not give Mr. [Sandalon] Jacobs who was being towed sufficient time to brake his vehicle and resulted as a [ ] contributing factor this accident [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">Thus, the trial court considered the unique circumstance that Sandalon\u2019s vehicle was tethered to that driven by Mr. Sampson. Certainly, it is apparent that Sandalon had only limited control over the speed of his own, towed vehicle. Furthermore, it is apparent that the distance between the vehicles was dictated, at least in part, by the length of the tow rope. However, we find error in the trial court\u2019s determination that the inquiry as to any duty owed by Sandal-on is resolved by that consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">Rather, those very circumstances reveal the perilous nat\u00fcre of the task undertaken by both Mr. Sampson and Sandalon. Undoubtedly, Sandalon was a participant in the towing operation that resulted in the accident. <em>See, e.g., LeBlanc v. Stevenson, </em>00-0157 (La. 10/17/00), 770 So.2d 766 (a matter in which the plaintiff was observed to be \u201can actor in [an] accident\u201d that occurred when a 'tow line between his stationary vehicle and a lead vehicle caused injury to his hand). Both men agreed to undertake a towing venture that necessarily left Sandalon at|fithe steering wheel, but unable to independently control the speed of his own vehicle. He was instead subject to the speed of the lead vehicle. Neither could he control the maximum distance of his truck from- Mr. Sampson\u2019s truck as that distance was dictated by the length of the tow rope the men used in the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">Further, it is unquestioned that Mr. Sampson\u2019s participation was at Sandalon\u2019s request. As explained above, Sandalon felt that his truck was not suitable for driving on the highway due to a faulty fuel pump and lack of insurance. Thus, and notwithstanding Mr. Sampson\u2019s fault, it is apparent that Sandalon was an actor in the towing operation and, in turn, owed a duty to act reasonably and prudently in performing that duty. <em>See, e.g., Bates v. Lagars, </em>193 So.2d 375, 379 (La.App. 2 Cir. 1966) (wherein the second circuit explained that the owner of a car being removed by a tow rope from a roadside ditch \u201chad the right to direct and control the operation of removing his car from the ditch; he was present and actively assisting in the effort\u201d and, thus, the acts of negligence of the tow driver were \u201cimputable to\u201d the owner), <em>writ refused, </em>250 La. 267, 195 So.2d 146 (1967). As executed, however, the joint undertaking resulted in Sandalon being unable to timely stop his vehicle or independently fulfill the duty required of a following vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>La.R.S. 32:81(A). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>this regard, we find that the trial court was manifestly erroneous in failing to determine that Sandalon, too, breached a duty owed by him. Given the immediacy of the accident and Sandalon\u2019s allegations regarding the causation of his injuries, the presence of the legal cause and cause-in-fact elements of the duty-risk analysis are readily apparent..</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">[^Finally, and as explained above, we are mindful that the driver of a following vehicle may rebut a presumption of negligence in a rear-end accident by demonstrating that the unpredictable operation of the preceding vehicle created a situation which the following motorist could not have anticipated. <em>Brewer, </em>35 So.3d 230. However, in this instance, it is clear that Sandalon could have anticipated that the lead vehicle would travel at speeds beyond which he could safely stop given the distance dictated by the tow rope and his limited operational control of the vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the record demonstrates that Sandalon failed to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">The finding that the trial court was manifestly erroneous in failing to assign any fault to Sandalon requires adjustment of the allocation of fault. <em>See, e.g., Brewer, </em>35 So.3d 230. Additionally, State Farm questions the trial court\u2019s apportionment of the greater percentage of fault (95%) to its insured, Ms. Deeuir, in comparison to the minimal percentage (5%) attributed to Mr. Sampson. In particular, State Farm suggests that \u201cthe primary cause of the accident was the decision to tow the Jacobs truck at 55 mph, for which David Sampson and Sandalon Jacobs are equally at fault.\u201d It suggests that Ms. Decuir\u2019s fault, if any, was minimal and asserts that \u201c[s]he may have mistaken the emergency flashers for a right turn signal, but [ ] when she pulled out onto the highway, there was still sufficient time and space for the Sampson truck to avoid hitting her without taking extraordinary measures other than to apply his brakes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">Louisiana Civil Code Article 2323(A) provides for comparative fault and requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-12\">| sIn any action for damages where a person suffers injury, death, or loss, the degree or percentage of fault of all persons causing or contributing to the injury, death, or loss shall be determined, regardless of whether the person is a party to the action or a nonparty, and regardless of the person\u2019s insolvency, ability to pay, immunity by statute, including but not limited to the provisions of R.S. 23:1032, or that the other person\u2019s identity is not known or reasonably ascertainable. If a person suffers injury, death, or loss as the result partly of his own negligence and partly as a result of the fault of another person or persons, the amount of damages recoverable shall be reduced in proportion to the degree or percentage of negligence attributable to the person suffering the injury, death, or loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-13\">The supreme court has explained that allocation of fault is evaluated under the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-14\">(1) whether the conduct resulted from inadvertence or involved an awareness of the danger; (2) how great a risk was created by the conduct; (3) the significance of what was sought by the conduct; (4) the capacities of the actor, whether superior or inferior, and, (5) any extenuating circumstances which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>might require the actor to proceed in haste without proper thought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\"><em>Thompson v. Winn-Dixie Montgomery, Inc., </em>15-0477, p. 14 (La. 10/14/15), 181 So.3d 656, 666-67 (citing <em>Watson v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>469 So.2d 967 (La.1985)). As a trial court\u2019s \u201cfindings regarding percentages of fault are factual,\u201d those findings \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Purvis v. Grant Par. Sch. Bd., </em>13-1424, p. 4 (La. 2/14/14), 144 So.3d 922, 926. However, after an appellate court finds clear error in the apportionment of fault, \u201cit should adjust the award, but only to the extent of lowering or raising it to the highest or lowest point respectively which is reasonably within the trier of fact\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Brewer, </em>35 So.3d at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">Having reviewed the record in light of the factors of apportionment above, we conclude that the trial court was clearly wrong both in its failure to apportion fault to Sandalon and in its apportionment of 95% of the fault to Ms. Decuir. However, the record does support the trial court\u2019s finding of fault on the part of |sMs. Decuir. In ruling, the trial court determined that, although Ms. Decuir felt that Mr. Sampson\u2019s vehicle was turning upon seeking a blinking light, \u201cit was the flasher\u2019s [sic] that Mr. Sampson had turned on as he had indicated in his deposition - and is supported] by the testimony of both plaintiffs today.\u201d The trial court noted testimony indicating that all four of Mr, Sampson\u2019s hazard lights were working and additionally noted testimony that the trucks were proceeding straight ahead without intention of turning. The trial court further found that Ms. Decuir \u201cdidn\u2019t yield at that stop sign and without determining that this right turn could be \u25a0 made safely.\u201d Thus, the trial court determined that she \u201cwas careless in- her [ ] - operation of her vehicle at that time.\u201d That maneuver, the trial court found, \u201ccaused David Sampson to brake the towing vehicle that he was driving.\u201d As addressed above, it further \u201cset out a series of events that require[d] Mr. [Sandalon] Jacobs to have to stop the vehicle[.]\u201d Again, the trial court rejected a finding of fault by Sandalon, finding that \u201cthe lead or turning vehicle in this case driven by Ms. Decuir ... created a hazardous situation which the following vehicle that is coming along and it had preempted the right of way ... the Sampson vehicle and his vehicle in tow could not avoid.\u201d In particular, the trial court found that \u201cthe acts of negligence for Ms. De-cuir\u201d included disregarding the stop sign and faffing to yield the right of way. <em>See </em>La.R.S. 32:123.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court then addressed Mr. Sampson\u2019s fault, | mdetermining, as previously set forth, that he was traveling at an excessive rate of speed for the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">While State Farm suggests in its brief that Ms. Decuir \u201ctestified that she came to a complete stop at the stop sign and saw the Sampson vehicle\u201d before proceeding onto the highway, review of Ms. Decuir\u2019s deposition testimony does not support that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>assertion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, Ms. Decuir did not testify as to whether or not she stopped at the stop sign and, furthermore, testified that she saw the \u201cvehicles coming.\u201d In any event, however, the trial court credited the version of events offered by Mr. Sampson, Mario, and Sandalon, who each explained that they saw Ms. Decuir approach the intersection, but that she failed to stop. Their testimony further supported the finding that Mr. Sampson\u2019s \u201cflashers,\u201d rather than his turn signal, were engaged. As these assessments of credibility were within the trial court\u2019s province and are owed great deference, we leave those findings undisturbed and maintain the determination that Ms. Decuir was at fault in the accident. <em>See Hebert v. Rapides Par. Police Jury, </em>06-2001 (La. 4/11/07), 974 So.2d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">Yet, having addressed Ms. Decuir\u2019s fault, the record does not support a finding that she was responsible for the majority of fault as found by the trial court. Certainly, Ms. Decuir\u2019s actions created a significant risk and, in this case, resulted in an accident. <em>See Thompson, </em>181 So.3d 656. And, despite Mr. Sampson\u2019s apparent speed, Ms. Decuir was the only driver faced with a control signal at that intersection. She was, at least arguably, in a superior position to prevent the Inaccident, which we address below. <em>Id. </em>Further, the trial court determined that Ms. Decuir created a significant risk by turning into a lane of travel without ensuring that the vehicles, one of which was being towed, were turning as she mistakenly expected. <em>Id,. </em>Neither does the record indicate that there were extenuating circumstances that would have required Ms. Decuir to proceed in haste without proper thought. <em>Id. </em>While Ms. Decuir explained that she was providing the turning vehicles with additional room, there was no testimony that additional room would have been required in the event of such a turn. Finally, however, it appears that Ms. Decuir\u2019s actions resulted from inadvertence as her turn was apparently predicated upon her failure to recognize that Mr. - Sampson\u2019s hazard lights were engaged rather than his turn signal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">Contrarily, Mr. Sampson and Sandalon intentionally undertook the towing operation, subjecting the towed vehicle, with Sandalon at the wheel, to the highway speeds driven by the lead vehicle. <em>See Thompson, </em>181 So.3d 656. Like the actions of Ms. Decuir, the towing of a vehicle at speeds beyond which the towed vehicle could possibly stop obviously created a significant risk. The third comparative fault inquiry of \u201cthe significance of what was sought by the conduct\u201d of the actor does not fall in favor' of Mr. Sampson and Sandalon. <em>Id. </em>at 667. While Sandalon\u2019s truck may have required a tow to his home in Marksville, a towing service could have been engaged for the transfer. The pair instead employed this self-help measure. Further, the record contains no extenuating circumstances that required their actions. <em>Id. </em>As the various factors are largely applicable to some extent to all of the actors, it is the remaining element regarding the respective capacities of the actors that is determinative in this case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">|!\u00a1Above, we observed that Ms. Decuir was arguably in a superior position to avoid the accident as she turned onto a highway without yielding and doing so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>with the two vehicles approaching at a high rate of speed. Despite her negligence in doing so, however, recall that Mr. Sampson was, in fact, able to stop his vehicle without striking her. Thus, while Ms. De-cuir\u2019s action of turning ahead of the vehicles was a contributing factor, the injuries here would not have occurred absent the conditions surrounding the towed vehicle. In short, had Mr. Sampson not been towing Sandalon in his vehicle and doing so at such a high rate of speed, there would have been no accident between the lead and towed trucks. Thus, we conclude that the record dictates that Mr. Sampson and Sandalon must bear the greater percentage of fault. Accordingly, we increase the fault attributable to Mr. Sampson to 30% and further apportion a corresponding 30% of the fault to Sandalon, amounts that we find are the lowest amount the trial court could have reasonably allocated to them. <em>Breiuer, </em>35 So.3d 230. In turn, we decrease Ms. Decuir\u2019s apportionment of fault to the remaining 40%, the highest point that was reasonably within the trial court\u2019s discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Finding merit in this argument, we below include language in the decree reflecting the apportionment of fault between the three drivers. We further remand this matter to the trial court to amend the award of damages in light of that apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">\n<em>Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">State Farm also challenges the trial court\u2019s damages award, suggesting that the measure of general damages found due to both Sandalon ($46,500.00) and to Mario ($35,200.00) is excessive. State Farm separately contests the award of 11scertain prescription drugs to Mario as he was previously prescribed those medications for preexisting injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-8\">With regard to review of damages, La.Civ.Code art. 2324.1 provides that: \u201cIn the assessment of damages in cases of offenses, quasi offenses, and quasi contracts, much discretion must be left to the judge or jury.\u201d Additionally, a trial court\u2019s determination of the appropriate quantum of damages is also entitled to great deference by an appellate court. <em>Guillory v. Lee, </em>09-0075 (La. 6/26/09), 16 So.3d 1104. Because that discretion \u201cis so great, and even vast, an appellate court should rarely disturb an award on review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-10\">As for general damages, which the supreme court observed may not be fixed with \u201cpecuniary exactitude,\u201d an appellate court is not to decide what it considers to be an appropriate award. <em>Guillory, </em>16 So.3d at 1117. Rather, the appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion. <em>Id. </em>Further, in review of a trier of fact\u2019s award of special damages such as medical expenses, which \u201ctheoretically may be determined with relative certainty,\u201d an appellate court considers: 1) whether a reasonable basis exists for a trial court\u2019s conclusions and 2) whether that finding was clearly wrong. <em>Id. </em>at 1117. With this standard in mind, we consider State Farm\u2019s assignments regarding damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-11\">General Damages\u2014Sandalon Jacobs</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-12\">Noting that Sandalon testified that he suffered neck and back injury as a result of the accident, State Farm asserts that he otherwise offered \u201cvery little testimony regarding the severity of his pain or injury.\u201d It further notes that he was able to continue in his position as a grass cutter for Avoyelles Parish. This evidence, State Farm argues, does not support the $46,500.00 general damages award. It instead argues that the trial court\u2019s reasons for ruling indicate an_]_yexcessive reliance on the number of months that Sandalon received treatment rather than evidence of his limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-13\">On review, we do not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling. Sandalon explained at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>that he sustained injury to his low back and neck and that he began treatment with Dr. Darron McCann eleven days following the accident. Sandalon confirmed that he saw Dr. McCann a total of sixteen times over the course of approximately eighteen months. Reference to exhibits introduced regarding Dr. McCann\u2019s care reveals a diagnosis of neck strain, back strain and insomnia related to that discomfort. Dr. McCann indicated in his narrative report that Sandalon\u2019s treatment included: \u201ccortisone injections, pain medications, muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatory medication, and sleep medication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-3\">The records also indicate that Sandalon was prescribed physical therapy, which he completed after seven visits. Although Sandalon testified that the physical therapy exacerbated his pain, Dr. McCann reported that it \u201cdid help some.\u201d Noting that Sandalon\u2019s symptoms diminished over the course of the treatment, Dr. McCann reported that Sandalon\u2019s medication was adjusted accordingly. Dr. McCann\u2019s narrative report indicates that Sandalon\u2019s neck complaints resolved by July 2014 and that his back complaints resolved by March 2015. Sandalon\u2019s testimony confirmed the improvement in his pain. By the time of the March 2016 trial, he explained that he occasionally has aches and pains in his lower back and a burning sensation in his neck, but that he \u201c\u00a3j]ust deal[s] with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">In light of this evidence, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s award to Sandalon. While Sandalon spoke only generally regarding the pain he experienced and his ability to continue his physically demanding job, the |,,-'documentary evidence of his medical care corroborates his complaints, providing further support for the quantum of the award. Dr. McCann employed a multi-fac-eted approach to the soft tissue injuries relying not only upon various medications, but cortisone injections and physical therapy as well;</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">Finally, we find no merit in State Farm\u2019s assertion that the trial court placed undue reliance on the number of months for which Sandalon received treatment. First, we note that an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s judgment, not its reasons for ruling. <em>Wooley v. Lucksinger, </em>09-571 (La. 4/1/11), 61 So.3d 507. Rather, a trial court\u2019s oral or written ruling is a mere explanation of a trial court\u2019s determinations. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, State Farm cites no jurisprudence indicating that the length of Sandalon\u2019s treatment may not be considered as a factor in shaping the damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">This assignment lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">General Damages\u2014Mario Jacobs</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">In its assignments regarding the trial court\u2019s award of damages to Mario, State Farm observes that Mario had a work-related back condition prior to the subject accident, had undergone two back surgeries, and was an ongoing pain management patient of Dr. Michael Dole. With regard to general damages, State Farm suggests that Mario did not inform Dr. Dole of the subject car accident, which \u201cestablishes that [he] did not have any significant pain because of this accident.\u201d It argues that, at most, the trial court should have compensated Mario for a six-month increase in pain. It suggests that jurisprudence indicates that the highest reasonable award would be approximately $18,000.00 rather than the $32,500.00 awarded by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">I mWe find no merit in State Farm\u2019s argument as to the award of general damages. Undoubtedly, the record establishes that Mario was a pre-existing pain patient.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Dr. Dole testified that when he be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>gan treating Mario in April 2012, his impression of Mario\u2019s condition was low back pain with radiculopathy. He explained that he felt that Mario suffered from chronic pain syndrome with opioid dependence. He prescribed narcotics for management of the associated pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">After the present accident, however, Mario began treatment with Dr. Dixie Clement, upon referral from Mario\u2019s attorney. Dr. Clement, qualified as an expert in family practice, explained that she first treated Mario on November 30, 2013 and that he reported neck pain, left leg pain, upper, mid and low back pain. She noted that he was in mild distress and that he had an abnormal gait. Dr, Clement testified that she identified spasm in both the neck and back, as well as \u201ctenderness palpation mid-line in his lower lumbar and his bi-lateral sacral iliac joints.\u201d Dr. Clement confirmed that Mario reported his earlier surgeries to her as well as Dr. Dole\u2019s involvement. Dr. Clement explained that she felt that Mario had suffered an aggravation or exacerbation of the pre-existing injuries. Additionally, because of Dr. Dole\u2019s involvement, she explained that she felt that her role was to treat injuries from the subject accident, whereas Dr. Dole treated Mario for the chronic pre-existing low back pain. Dr. Clement explained that her office immediately notified Dr. Dole\u2019s office, via fax, of her treatment of Mario and that he was thereafter kept apprized. During the course of her treatment, through September 2015, Dr. Clement continued to note objective findings, including spasm and decreased range of motion. She treated Mario\u2019s complaints, in part, with cortisone 117inj ections. She maintained her diagnosis of a \u201cneck pain/whiplash injury\u201d and \u201cmid-back pain as well or thoracic pain.\u201d She related those injuries to the subject accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">Mario also testified as to an aggravation of his pre-existing injuries for which he was seeking treatment from Dr. Dole. He explained that, before the accident, his condition had been improving. However, since the accident, he explained that he \u201cfeel[s] it now\u201d and that he \u201cfelt it then too after that impact.\u201d He further testified that the neck and shoulder injuries were new.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">Acknowledging the continuation of pain management treatment by Dr. Dole, Mario explained that he felt that Dr. Dole and Dr. Clement worked together. He stated that: \u201cShe treated me with [sic] for my neck and Dr. Dole continued with the back and she gave Cortisone shot[s] when I needed it.\u201d Mario explained that, at the time of trial, he was \u201cstill dealing\u201d with the pain in his neck and shoulders. He described the pain as \u201ca burning, burning sensation.\u201d When asked whether it was similar to the pre-existing back pain, Mario stated that it \u201cis a hurting pain but it burns.\u201d He noted that the pain is more intense at night and that it disturbs his sleep. Mario confirmed that the injury to his neck and shoulder, as well as the aggravation of his back injury had disrupted his daily life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">In ruling, the trial court noted Dr. Clement\u2019s attempted coordination of care with Dr. Dole and recognized that she testified regarding her treatment of areas \u201crelevant to this accident,\u201d including an exacerbation of prior lower back and leg pain. The trial court further\u2019 pointed to Dr. Dole\u2019s deposition wherein he explained that he did not have any reports from Mario regarding neck complaints that pre-existed the November 2013 accident as corroboration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>Mario\u2019s assertion that the neck and shoulder pain began at that time. The trial court determined that, in all, |1sMario treated with Dr. Clement for twenty-two months in fashioning its award of $35,200.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">After review, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s award in that regard. Rather, Mario plainly explained the difference in his injuries before and after this accident. In addition to the aggravation of back symptoms that he described, he further began treatment for a new onset of both neck and shoulder pain. Dr. Clement identified objective signs of associated injury and provided repeated injections for those conditions. Despite those treatments, and despite the almost two years of treatment recognized by the trial court, Mario explained at trial that he continued to have pain from the accident-related injuries. We find that these circumstances, credited by the trial court, provide a reasonable basis for the trial court\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">This assignment lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">Medical Expenses\u2014Mario Jacobs</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">Again noting Dr. Dole\u2019s prior treatment of Mario, State Farm also challenges the trial court\u2019s award of $4,170.73 for pharmacy bills. State Farm notes that Dr. Dole had prescribed both oxycodone and Percocet before the November 2013 accident. Due to this pre-existing need, State Farm asserts that Mario did not establish that \u201cthe pharmacy bills would not have been incurred \u2018but fox-\u2019 the accident of November 8, 2013.\u201d It argues that, \u201c[t]o the contrary, Dr. Dole\u2019s testimony undisputedly shows the pharmacy bills would have been incurred regardless of whether or not plaintiff was involved in the accident with Ms. Decuir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-8\">After review, we find a reasonable basis for the trial court\u2019s award of those prescription charges. Simply, as referenced above, the trial court credited Dr. | mClement\u2019s explanation that she coordinated her care with that offered by Dr. Dole. As the latter physician had an ongoing relationship with Mario for pain management and that pain medications were administered through him, Dr. Clement explained that she did not separately address the need for pain medication. However, her testimony was clear that the subject accident aggravated/exacerbated the underlying injuries and, additionally, produced separate injuries for which she provided treatment. While State Farm suggests that Mario\u2019s pharmacy needs would have remained the same without the new injuries, there is no testimony to that x-egard. As such, State Farm\u2019s argument is conclusory and assumes facts not in evidence. Rather, the record reflects that he had pre-existing injuries, he suffered an aggravation of those injuries as well as new injuries which Dr. Clement attributed to this accident, and that he incurred medication costs at that time. Notably, Dr. Dole explained that his records indicated that Mario had not complained of neck pain before the subject accident, but that he did complain of neck pain during his December 2013 visit. Given this factual basis, we find no clear error in the trial court\u2019s assessment of special damages for Mario\u2019s prescription costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-10\">This assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AYIY\">\n<em>Uninsured Motorist</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-11\">As a final matter, we address State Farm's assertion that the tx-ial court erred in failing to reduce Sandalon\u2019s recovery by operation of La.R.S. 32:866 as he acknowledged that he did not carry liability insurance on his truck involved in the accident. The trial court denied State Farm\u2019s request in this regard, first finding that the track \u201cwas not a functioning vehicle at the time that this [ ] happened.\u201d It further explained that: \u201cThe ignition key was turned on but that was I think to Unmake the steering and the brakes oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>ate. It was being [sic] it did have a driver, Plaintiff, Sandalon Jacobs.\u201d In turn,.the trial court referenced jurisprudence determining the inapplicability of La.R.S. 32:866 to parked vehicles and found the present matter analogous. <em>See, e.g., Rogers v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>01-443 (La.App. 3 Cir. 10/3/01), 796 So.2d 862; <em>Gibbs v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>99-1242 (La. App. 4 Cir. 10/13/99), 746 So.2d 685, <em>writ denied, </em>99-3234 (La. 1/14/00), 753 So.2d 220. The trial court explained that La.R.S. 32:866 \u201cwas not intended to deprive the owners of vehicles who were [sic] that are not operational of the right to recover damages especially under these limited facts and circumstances.\u201d On review, however, we find error in the trial court\u2019s interpretation in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">Louisiana Revised Statutes 32:866 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-6\">A. (1) There shall be no recovery for the first fifteen thousand dollars of bodily injury and no recovery for the first twenty-five thousand dollars of property damage based on any cause or right of action arising out of a motor vehicle accident, <em>for such injury or damages occasioned by an owner or operator of a motor vehicle involved in such accident idho fails to own or maintain compulsory motor vehicle liability security. \u25a0</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOh\">(Emphasis added.) By its wording, La.R.S. 32:866 references damages \u201coccasioned\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by an \u201cowner or operator of a motor vehicle involved in such accident.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Louisiana Revised Statutes 32:851 defines these separate terms as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-7\">(8) \u201cOperator\u201d means every person who is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-8\">12t(9) \u201cOwner\u201d means every person who holds the legal title to a motor vehicle or in the event a motor vehicle is the subject of an agreement for the conditional sale, lease, or transfer of the possession, however, thereof, with the right of purchase upon performance of the condition stated in the agreement and with an immediate right of possession vested in the conditional vendee, lessee, possessor, or in the event such or similar transaction is had by means of a mortgage, and the mortgagor of a vehicle is entitled to possession, then such conditional vendee, lessee, possessor, or mortgagor shall be deemed the owner for the purpose of this Chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1275-11\">We first note that La.R.S. 32:866 applies to \u201can owner <em>or </em>operator of a motor vehicle[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) The record indicates that Sandalon \u201cowned\u201d the truck that he was occupying as he testified that he held the title. <em>See </em>La.R.S. 32:851(9). Thus, applying the clear and unambiguous wording of the statute, the limitation of recovery provisions of La.R.S. 32:866(A)(1) are applicable in this case. <em>See </em>La.R.S. 1:4 (\u201cWhen the wording of a Section is clear and free of ambiguity, the letter of it shall not be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d). <em>See also </em>La.Civ.Code art. 9 (\u2018When a law is clear and unambiguous and its application does not lead to absurd consequences, the law shall be applied as written and no further interpretation may be made in search of the intent of the legislature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-12\">Further, Sandalon\u2019s testimony suggests that he was also the \u2018\u2018operator\u201d of the truck as, at least to some extent, he exercised \u201cactual physical control\u201d of the vehicle. <em>See </em>La.R.S. 32:851(9). Despite the fact that it was attached by tow rope to Mr. Sampson\u2019s vehicle and the engine was not engaged, Sandalon explained that he had turned \u201cthe key on\u201d \u201c[t]o get brakes.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>further testified that throughout the trip, he applied the brakes to slow the vehicle and that he was able to stop at stop signs along the way. Although he applied his brakes, he was not, of course, able to avoid the accident at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">[.^Additionally, Sandalon\u2019s control of the vehicle must be viewed differently from those \u25a0 cases involving parked vehicles where the courts have found that the legislative intent of La.R.S. 32:866 would not be carried out by its application to the particular circumstances before them. <em>See Rogers, 796 </em>So.2d <em>862 </em>(wherein a panel of this court considered a case in which an uninsured, but unoccupied vehicle was hit by another car while parked inside of a private parking lot); <em>Gibbs, </em>746 So.2d 686 (a writ ruling wherein the fourth circuit maintained a trial court\u2019s refusal to apply La.R.S. 32:866 to limit an uninsured owner\u2019s claim for 'damage sustained to an unoccupied, parked vehicle). Obviously, both unoccupied vehicle cases involved only property damages, not bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">Furthermore, neither <em>Rogers </em>nor <em>Gibbs </em>involved factual situations in which the owner was also an \u201coperator,\u201d at least to some extent, as they were both unoccupied. In <em>Rogers, </em>796 So.2d at 866, the panel reasoned that the purpose of La.R.S. 32:866 is \u201cto discourage the <em>operation </em>of uninsured vehicles\u201d and, therefore, the application of the statute \u201cto parked vehicles would not accomplish the purpose. Likewise, the statute- is not intended to deprive owners of parked vehicles of the right to recover property damage.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">The present case is not analogous. Rather, Sandalon was an owner, and he exercised at least some actual control over the vehicle so as to be viewed as-its operator in some limited sense. Additionally, San-dalon does not present a claim for property damages sustained by an unoccupied vehicle. Rather, he seeks damages for bodily injury sustained while occupying the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">| MGiven the facts of this case and the clear and unambiguous wording of La.R.S. 32:866, we find that the trial court erred in its determination that La.R.S. 32:866 was inapplicable to the present case. Accordingly, we reverse that aspect of the trial court\u2019s ruling and, on remand, instruct the trial court to amend the judgment to reflect Sandalon\u2019s inability to recover \u201cfor the first fifteen thousand dollars of bodily injury\u201d per La.R.S. 32:866(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">DECREE</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed to the extent it found fault on the part of Florence Decuir and David Sampson. Although the judgment is further affirmed as to the measure of damages incurred by Sandalon Jacobs and Mario Jacobs, the judgment is reversed to the extent it cast Ms. Decuir and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company in judgment for sums previously reduced by the erroneous allocation of fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-14\">Judgment is hereby rendered, allocating fault for causing the accident of November 8, 2013 as- follows: Florence Decuir (40%); David' Sampson (30%); and Sandalon Jacobs (30%). This matter is remanded to the trial court with instructions to reform the judgment to cast Florence Decuir and State Farm in judgment for sums reflecting the amended apportionment of fault and the application of La.R.S. 32:866(A)(1) to limit Sandalon Jacob\u2019s recovery \u201cfor the first fifteen thousand dollars of bodily injury[.]\u201d Costs of this proceeding are assessed equally to plaintiff-appellee Sandalon Ja<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>cobs and defendant-appellant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"Acq2\">Conery, J., concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">.
