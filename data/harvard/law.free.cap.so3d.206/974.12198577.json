The juvenile, W.B.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals his adjudication as a delinquent and his disposition. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the adjudication but vacate the disposition and remand for a disposition hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"ATxI\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AH7W\">On or about October 16, 2015, Aimee Keife\u2019s residence in New Orleans, Louisi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>ana was burglarized. Immediately thereafter, she reported the burglary to the New Orleans Police Department (\u201cNOPD\u201d). By the time she needed to leave for work, the police had not arrived; thus, she canceled the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">Thereafter, Ms. Keife\u2019s home surveillance camera recorded two individuals attempting to break into her home. On October 21, 2015, Ms. Keife was leaving her home when she saw one of the individuals from the surveillance video\u2014later 1 identified as W.B.\u2014entering her neighbor\u2019s house, using a key. Ms. Keife immediately called the NOPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">NOPD Detectives Serife Davis and Daniel Hyatt promptly were dispatched to Ms. Keife\u2019s residence. Ms. Keife provided the detectives with the surveillance video, and she identified W.B. as one of the individuals in the surveillance video.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The detectives apprehended W.B., handcuffed him, and placed him in the back of their patrol car. After W.B. was placed in the patrol car, his father, W.B., Sr., approached the car and explained to his son that the detectives had photographs showing W.B. looking through Ms. Keife\u2019s door.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Meanwhile, one of the detectives asked W.B. if they were going to find any of the stolen items in his bedroom in W.B., Sr.\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> W.B., Sr., instructed the detectives to show the photograph to W.B. After being shown the photograph and confronted again by his father, W.B. admitted that he was one of the individuals in the photograph. Shortly after the confession, one of the detectives asked W.B. if the clothes he was wearing in the photograph were in his bedroom. W.B. responded that the clothes were at his sister\u2019s house, which was where he was primarily residing.</p>\n<p id=\"AW2S\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"AP8M\">lsOn November 4, 2015, the State filed a petition charging W.B. with simple burglary, in violation of La. R.S. 14:62. According to the State\u2019s petition, on October 21, 2015, W.B. entered Ms. Keife\u2019s house without authorization with the intent to commit a theft or felony therein. W.B. pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">On November 10, 2015, W.B. filed an \u201cOmnibus Motion for Discovery; Motion to Preserve Evidence; and Motion for Suppression of Statements, Evidence, and Identifications.\u201d The district court set the motion to suppress and the adjudication hearing for February 2, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">After several continuances, the adjudication hearing occurred on May 3, 2016.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the adjudication hearing, four witnesses testified\u2014Ms. Keife; Detective Davis; W.B., Sr.; and Detective Hyatt. At the conclusion of the hearing, W.B. was adjudicated delinquent as a result of having committed attempted simple burglary, a violation of La. R.S. 14:27 and 14:62.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court ordered W.B. to serve six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>months, suspended, with active supervised probation for one year with the following special conditions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"A0TX\">TERROR PATENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Recently, this court adopted a practice of conducting an error patent review in juvenile delinquency cases. <em>See State in the Interest of S.J., </em>13-1025, p. 4 (La.App. 4 Cir. 11/6/13), 129 So.3d 676, 679 (citing <em>State in the Interest of A.H., </em>10-1673, p. 9 (La.App. 4 Cir. 4/20/11), 65 So.3d 679, 685). A review of the record for errors patent in this case reveals one. The district court failed to conduct a disposition hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">Louisiana Children\u2019s Code Article 892 provides, \u201c[p]rior to entering a judgment of disposition, the court shall conduct a disposition hearing. The disposition hearing may be conducted immediately after the adjudication and shall be conducted within thirty days after the adjudication. Such period may be extended for good cause.\u201d Furthermore, La. Ch.C. art. 893 provides in pertinent part as follows: ' \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-6\">A. At the disposition hearing, unless the child waives the presentation, the court shall hear evidence as to whether the child is in need of treatment or rehabilitation and shall make and file its findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-7\">B. All evidence helpful in determining the proper disposition, including oral and written reports, the report of the predisposition investigation, any reports of mental evaluation, and all other evidence offered by the child or the state shall be received by the court and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative value even though not | ^admissible at the adjudication hearing. Upon motion of the district attorney or the child, the court may hear testimony from the victim of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-14\">C.Counsel for the state and for the child shall be afforded an opportunity to present evidence and to examine and controvert written reports so received and to cross-examine individuals preparing the reports or other witnesses who give testimony at the hearing. Sources of confidential information need not be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\">This court has held that \u201c[t]he purpose of a disposition hearing is to allow the court to hear evidence which will aid it in determining whether the juvenile is in need of treatment or rehabilitation.\u201d <em>State in Interest of T.E., </em>11-1172, p. 2 (La.App. 4 Cir. 9/19/12), 100 So.3d 963, 964 (citing <em>State ex rel. K.H., </em>98-632 (La.App. 5 Cir. 12/16/98), 725 So.2d 583). \u201cAbsent a waiver by the juvenile, the court must conduct a hearing prior to entering a judgment of disposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State ex rel. K.G., </em>34,535 (La.App. 2 Cir. 1/24/01), 778 So.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>716; <em>State in Interest of O.R., </em>96-890, p. 6 (La.App. 5 Cir. 2/25/97), 690 So.2d 200, 202). Counsel\u2019s silence and failure to object does not amount to a waiver of a juvenile\u2019s right to a disposition hearing or his right to present evidence. <em>State in Interest of O.R., </em>96-890 (La.App. 5 Cir. 2/25/97), 690 So.2d 200; and <em>K.G., </em>34,535 at p. 15, 778 So.2d at 726; see <em>also State in Interest of T.H., </em>14-179 (La.App. 3 Cir. 6/4/14, 18), 140 So.3d 911, 923 (finding that \u201cthere was no objection or waiver of the objection, and there was no waiver of the disposition hearing\u201d by the juvenile; thus the matter was remanded).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">After W.B. was adjudicated a delinquent, the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and the district court judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-5\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-6\">| f,Regardless of any of that I am adjudicating you delinquent of that offense, okay. I don\u2019t know if you want to waive delays.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-7\">MS. FELIX [DEFENDANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-8\">No, I\u2019m just asking if you can identify him when you say this one doesn\u2019t look like him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-9\">\u2021 \u2021 \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-10\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-11\">... So do we want me to give his disposition? Do you waive delays?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-12\">MS. FELIX:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-13\">Note my objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-14\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-19\">Okay, I\u2019ll note your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-20\">MS. FELIX:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-21\">To the adjudication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-22\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-23\">Ok, I will note your objection. It is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that [W.B.] is a juvenile for proper placement with the Office of Juvenile Justice. You are hereby placed with the Office of Juvenile Justice for six months. Execution of this commitment is suspended. You are going to be on one year of active probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-24\">Accordingly, defense counsel did not waive W.B.\u2019s right to present evidence at a disposition hearing. Consequently, we find that the disposition must be vacated and the matter remanded for a disposition hearing in accordance with La. Ch.C. arts. 892 and 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-25\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-26\">|7W.B. raises several issues on appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For ease of discussion, we divide the issues presented into the following four parts: (i) admissibility of W.B.\u2019s statements; (ii) harmless error; (iii) motion to suppress; and (iv) judgment of disposition. We address each part separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-27\">\n<em>Admissibility of W.B.\u2019s statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7r\">W.B. contends that the district court erred in admitting WJB.\u2019s statements into evidence because the State failed to establish his statements were made freely and voluntarily in compliance with La. Ch.C. art. 881.1.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> W.B. asserts, and the |sState <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>does not dispute, that he was not advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> before making inculpatory statements. W.B. further contends that the detectives arranged the situation between W.B. and his father in order to elicit the confession. W.B. argues that his admission was obtained after an unconstitutional, custodial interrogation by the detectives. Thus, he contends that his confession was erroneously admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">In Louisiana, the admissibility of a juvenile\u2019s confession is governed by La. Ch.C. art. 881.1. A child\u2019s confession is inadmissible unless the State proves the free and voluntary nature of the statement beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State in Interest of J.J.M., </em>16-347, p. 4 (La.App. 3 Cir. 11/9/16), 207 So.3d 609, 611, 2016 WL 6610375, p. *2. Louisiana jurisprudence further provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-6\">| \u00a1/\u2018[Louisiana Constitution Article] I, \u00a7 13 incorporates the prophylactic rules of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), which require that a prosecutor, before using an accused\u2019s confession at trial, establish that the accused was informed of his or her rights against self-incrimination and to have an attorney present at any interrogation; that the accused fully understood the consequences of waiving those rights; and that the accused in fact voluntarily waived those rights without coercion.\u201d The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and the constitutional right to counsel apply to juveniles as well as to adults. <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967); <em>State ex rel. Coco, </em>363 So.2d 207, 208 (La.1978) (recognizing that juveniles are entitled to same constitutional protections as adults).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-17\"><em>J.J.M., </em>16-347 at p. 4, 207 So.3d at 611, 2016 WL 6610375 at p. *2 (quoting <em>State v. Fernandez, </em>96-2719, pp. 3-6 (La. 4/14/98), 712 So.2d 485, 486-87); <em>see State in Interest of S.L., </em>11-883, pp. 17-18 (La.App. 5 Cir. 4/24/12), 94 So.3d 822, 835 (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>that <em>Miranda, supra, </em>held that the prosecution may not use a statement, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of a defendant unless the prosecution demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">The Louisiana Supreme Court in <em>Fernandez, supra, </em>further stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-5\">Under the federal constitution, the determination of whether a juvenile\u2019s incriminating statements are admissible, as based on a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right against self-incrimination and the right to assistance of counsel, is made on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. <em>Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979); <em>Gallegos v. Colorado, </em>370 U.S. 49, 82 S.Ct. 1209, 8 L.Ed.2d 325 (1962).... [T]he totality of the circumstances approach mandates inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, including \u201cevaluation of the juvenile\u2019s age, experience, education, background, and intelligence, and into whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of his Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights.\u201d <em>[Fare,] </em>442 U.S. at 725, 99 S.Ct. at 2572.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-6\">| -ipThe Louisiana Constitution requires no more. The confession of an accused of any age is valid only if it was given knowingly and voluntarily. The age of the accused, although an extremely important and extremely relevant factor in determining knowingness and voluntariness, is not absolutely determinative, and the rigid invalidation of an otherwise valid confession because the accused has not quite reached the age of seventeen has no federal or state constitutional basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">96-2719 at pp. 5-6, 712 So.2d at 487; <em>see also State in Interest of S.L., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">W.B., Sr., testified that the detectives showed him a photograph from the surveillance video and that he identified his son, W.B., as one of the individuals depicted in the photograph. On cross-examination, he testified that he was angry and started threatening W.B. before he knew why W.B. was arrested. W.B., Sr., explained that, at that time, he only glanced at the photograph, which was on the detective\u2019s cellphone, and assumed that W.B. was involved. When presented with the photograph in court, W.B., Sr., claimed that he did not recognize anyone. Also on cross-examination, the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and W.B., Sr.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-10\">Q. You glanced at the photograph and you agreed with the officer that that was your son?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-11\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-12\">Q. What did [W.B.] say about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ9h\">A. He just put his head down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-14\">Q. Did [W.B.] agree that that was him in the photograph?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-15\">A. He didn\u2019t say a thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-16\">Q. What was [W.B.] saying prior to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-17\">A. He said he wasn\u2019t down there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-18\">Q. You heard [W.B.] saying that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-19\">I i.i A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-20\">During rebuttal, the State introduced and played the detective\u2019s body camera video in order to impeachment W.B., Sr. In the video, W.B., Sr., approached the patrol car and yelled into the backseat \u201c[tjhey got your picture looking through the door.... Stop saying what you didn\u2019t do; they got you.\u201d At this time in the video, one of the detectives explains that they are about to search his bedroom and asks W.B. if they are going to find any of the stolen items in his room or at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>sister\u2019s residence. W.B., Sr., then told one of the detectives to show W.B. the photograph. As W.B. viewed the photograph, W.B., Sr., asked his son if that is him in the photograph. Simultaneously, one of the detectives said to W.B. \u201cthat\u2019s you.\u201d W.B. then admitted that he was one of the individuals in the photograph. Thereafter, one of the detectives asked W.B. if the clothes he was wearing in the photograph are in his room. W.B. responded that he believed the clothes were at his sister\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">According to La. Ch.C. art. 881.1, the State carries the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a juvenile\u2019s confession was given freely and voluntarily. The State correctly points out that <em>Miranda </em>only applies if the defendant, while in custody, is interrogated by a law enforcement officer or agent. <em>State v. Bernard, </em>09-1178, p. 5 (La. 3/16/10), 31 So.3d 1025, 1029. As noted above, it is undisputed that W.B. was not advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The State, however, counters that <em>Miranda </em>is inapplicable. The State claims that it is arguable whether W.B. was in custody and that W.B.\u2019s statements were made in response to his father\u2019s questioning, not police interrogation. The State contends that the body | ^camera video supports its contention that W.B.\u2019s admission was not the result of police interrogation. Therefore, the State contends that W.B.\u2019s statements were admissible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">A suspect is \u201cin custody\u201d when placed under formal arrest or when a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood the situation to constitute a restraint of freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest. <em>State v. Stewart, </em>13-0779, p. 10 (La.App. 4 Cir. 1/22/14), 133 So.3d 166; <em>see also State v. Shirley, </em>08-2106, pp. 7-8 (La. 5/5/09), 10 So.3d 224, 229; <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>see also State v. Fisher, </em>97-1133, p. 6 (La. 9/9/98), 720 So.2d 1179, 1183 (noting that \u201c[a] prime characteristic of any Fourth Amendment seizure of a person is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would not consider himself or herself free to leave.\u201d). Furthermore, courts have found that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are \u201cnot required when officers conduct preliminary, non-custodial, on-the-scene questioning to determine whether a crime has been committed, unless the accused is subjected to arrest or a significant restraint short of formal arrest.\u201d <em>State v. Riley, </em>15-0309 (La.App. 4 Cir. 9/30/15) <em>(unpub.), </em>2015 WL 5771996 (citing <em>Shirley, </em>supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">11sAt the time the statements were made, the detectives had physically removed W.B. from his parents\u2019 residence, handcuffed him, and placed him in the back of their patrol car. Although the State contends that W.B. was briefly detained pending an ongoing investigation, the circumstances suggest that a reasonable person would have associated the restraint as placing him in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>Having made that determination, we now turn to whether W.B. was interrogated by a law enforcement officer or agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>\u201cInterrogation\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>includes express questioning by law enforcement as well as \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>S.L., </em>11-883 at p. 18, 94 So.3d at 836. \u201cPolice officers are not obliged to ignore spontaneous and unsolicited statements by someone in custody, as long as the statements do not result from police-initiated custodial interrogation or questioning \u2018reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u2019\u201d <em>S.L., </em>11-883 at p. 19, 94 So.3d at 836 (citing <em>State v. Ross, </em>95-1798 (La. 3/8/96), 669 So.2d 384, 386).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Contrary to the State\u2019s contentions, the body camera video shows the detectives asking W.B. questions while W.B., Sr., confronts his son. Specifically, the video shows one of the detectives attempting to elicit a confession by using the consent to search form. One of the detectives explained to W.B. that his father is about to sign a consent to search form, which is akin to a search warrant, for W.B.\u2019s bedroom. The detective further states, \u201cNothing\u2019s in there? You sure? You | plunder stand that a judge is going to know that you\u2019re lying if there is something in there.\u201d The detectives also ask W.B. where the clothes worn during the crime were located. Furthermore, W.B., Sr., testified that during this confrontation, he was yelling and cursing at his son and threatening him with bodily harm. Therefore, W.B. was subjected to custodial interrogation, which required a <em>Miranda </em>warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Considering all the evidence presented, we find that the State did not carry its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that W.B.\u2019s confession was freely and voluntarily given as required by La. Ch.C. art. 881.1. The circumstances demonstrate that W.B. was in custody and his statements were obtained pursuant to the compelling influence of the detectives and his father, - W.B., Sr. Therefore, the district court erred in admitting W.B.\u2019s statements into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">\n<em>Harmless error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">Nevertheless, the erroneous admission of a defendant\u2019s involuntary confession is subject to harmless error analysis. <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 285, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991). In <em>Fulminante, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the admission into evidence of an involuntary confession during trial is a \u201ctrial error.\u201d <em>Id., </em>499 U.S. at 307, 111 S.Ct. 1246. \u201cTrial error may be \u2018quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>11-0941, pp. 19-20 (La.App. 4 Cir. 8/2/12), 98 So.3d 903, 917 (quoting <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 307-08, 111 S.Ct. 1246). In other words, an appellate court must review the remaining evidence against the defendant to ^determine whether the admission of the involuntary confession at trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246; <em>Harris, </em>11-0941 at p. 20, 98 So.3d at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">We find the evidence at trial, exclusive of W.B.\u2019s statements to detectives, was sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that W.B. was guilty of attempted burglary. The still-photographs from the surveillance video were identified by Ms. Keife, Detective Davis, and Detective \u25a0 Hyatt. As discussed elsewhere, Ms. Keife testified that W.B. was one of the individuals in the surveill\u00e1nce video attempting to burglarize her home. Detective Davis testified that on the day of the incident, Ms. Keife recognized W.B. in the back of the patrol car and identified him as one of the perpetrators in the video. Detective Hyatt testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>that he showed W.B., Sr., a photograph from the surveillance video and that W.B., Sr., identified his son. W.B., Sr., recanted his identification of his son at trial; however, he testified that on the day of the incident he identified his son as being in the surveillance video from Ms. Keife\u2019s residence. Taken together, the evidence presented was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that W.B. was guilty of attempted burglary; thus, any alleged error in the admission of W.B.\u2019s statements was harmless. This assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">\n<em>Motion to suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">W.B. contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements without conducting a hearing on the motion. He argues that the motion 11Bwas timely filed and that it is the customary practice in Orleans Parish Juvenile Court to consider motions to suppress during the adjudication hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">During the adjudication hearing, Detective Davis testified that W.B. admitted to being one of the individuals in the surveillance video. Defense counsel objected and stated that she \u201cfiled a motion to suppress any statements ... made because I do not believe that he [W.B.] was <em>Mirandized </em>at any point.\u201d The district court responded, \u201cYou did not request to have the motion heard. That motion is denied.\u201d Detective Davis further testified that W.B. did not admit that he attempted to burglarize Ms. Keife\u2019s home but that W.B. admitted to being in the surveillance video. He also testified that W.B. informed him that the clothes W.B. was wearing in the video were at his sister\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">In delinquency proceedings, the juvenile may move to suppress evidence obtained in violation of the United States Constitution or the Louisiana Constitution. La. Ch.C. art. 872. \u201cA motion may be granted without a contradictory hearing when mover is clearly entitled thereto without supporting proof. A motion shall not be denied without a contradictory hearing unless, assuming the facts alleged to be true, mover is not entitled to relief.\u201d La.' Ch.C. Art. 865(C); <em>see also </em>La. C.Cr.P. art. 703.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Louisiana jurisprudence has held that a hearing is not 117required when a motion to suppress fails to allege any constitutional issues. <em>State v. Tapp, </em>08-1262, p. 3 (La. App. 3 Cir. 4/1/09), 8 So.3d 804, 806-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">In the present case, defense counsel\u2019s motion to suppress statements fails to allege any specific facts that demonstrate that W.B. is entitled to relief. Rather, W.B.\u2019s motion states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-12\">Suppression is requested pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) and its progeny under both the state and federal constitutions; the Due Process clause, <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973); the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>(1964); the Fourth Amendment, <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 486, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); and all other applicable constitutional and statutory provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">Furthermore, the jurisprudence has recognized that \u201cwhen a defendant proceeds to trial without raising an issue which was the subject of a pending pretrial motion, he waives his right to have the motion heard or ruled upon.\u201d <em>State v. Cooper, </em>45,568, p. 20 (La.App. 2 Cir. 12/8/10), 55 So.3d 873, 884 (citing <em>State v. Fletcher, </em>02-707, p. 5 (La.App. 5 Cir.12/30/02), 836 So.2d 557, 559; <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>State v. Washington, </em>98-69, p. 5 (La.App. 5 Cir.1/26/99), 727 So.2d 673, 676).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Given |]Sthat defense counsel proceeded to trial without raising that W.B.\u2019s motion was outstanding, this assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"A60L\">\n<em>Ineffective assistance of counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">W.B contends that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to demand a hearing on the motion to suppress before the beginning of the adjudication hearing. As a result, he contends that he was denied the right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Juvenile defendants are entitled to effective assistance of counsel. <em>See State in Interest of D. McK., </em>589 So.2d 1139, 1142 (La. App. 5th Cir. 1991) (citing <em>State in Interest of Jones, </em>372 So.2d 779 (La. App. 4th 1979)). In <em>State in Interest of J.D., </em>14-0551, pp. 7-8 (La.App. 4 Cir. 12/3/14), 154 So.3d 726, 731-32, this court outlined the jurisprudence on ineffective assistance of counsel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-7\">The general rule is that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is more appropriately raised in an application for post-conviction relief than on appeal. <em>State v. Brown, </em>2012-0626, p. 12 (La. App. 4 Cir. 4/10/13), 115 So.3d 564, 572, 573 (citing <em>State v. Leger, </em>2005-0011, p. 44 (La. 7/10/06), 936 So.2d 108, 142). The exception is when the record on appeal contains sufficient evidence to permit the appellate court to decide the issue, and the issue properly is raised by an assignment of error. <em>Id. </em>Under these circumstances, an appellate court may consider the issue in the interest of judicial economy. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-9\">To support a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that he was prejudiced by the deficiency. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>State v. Brooks, </em>94-2438, p. 6 (La. 10/16/95), 661 So.2d 1333, 1337 on rehearing). The defendant must prove both elements to establish that his attorney was so ineffective as to require reversal. <em>State v. Hongo, </em>96-2060, p. 5 La. (12/2/97), 706 So.2d 419, 422. Counsel\u2019s performance is ineffective when it is shown that he made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Strickland </em>at 686, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-10\">h <em>Jd. </em>Furthermore, \u201cthe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance the result of the proceeding would have been different; \u2018[a] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number><em>Quezada, </em>13-1318, p. 11 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/21/14), 141 So.3d 906, 915 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2068; and <em>State v. Guy, </em>97-1387, p. 7 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/19/99), 737 So.2d 231, 236).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">In the present case, W.B. failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by any deficiency or that the result of his adjudication hearing would have been different. At the adjudication hearing, Ms. Keife testified \u201cI watched two boys trying to, with a hammer and a screwdriver, I guess, some kind of tools, like, trying to get the bolts out of the door and then go into the lock on the door and peeking in through the window.\u201d Ms. Keife acknowledged that she did not have a video of the burglary. She testified that \u201c[a]s far as I know he [W.B.] only tried to break and enter my house.\u201d She, however, believed that W.B. \u201cis the same person who broke into my house before and took things.\u201d Ms. Keife also testified that she was unaware that W.B. lived next door to her, and she later learned that W.B. primarily resided with his sister rather than his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">It is well-settled that a positive identification by one witness is sufficient to support a conviction. <em>State v. Carter, </em>15-99, p. 15 (La.App. 5 Cir. 7/29/15), 171 So.3d 1265, 1276, <em>writ denied, </em>15-1618 (La. 10/17/16), 207 So.3d 1068, 2016 WL 6302189; <em>State v. Cameron, </em>14-0168, p. (La. App. 4 Cir. 10/15/14), 152 So.3d 196, 198. Given the evidence presented coupled with Ms. Keife\u2019s positive identification of W.B. as one of the perpetrators, we do not find that defense counsel\u2019s error, if any, undermines confidence in the outcome of the adjudication hearing. This assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-13\">\n<em>Judgment of disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-14\">W.B, contends that the trial judge erred in imposing a curfew as a condition of probation in the written judgment of disposition that was not articulated at the disposition hearing. W.B. contends that La. Ch.C. arts. 902<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and <em>903</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>mandate 121that the trial judge announce the judgment of disposition in open court in the presence of the parties. W.B. further con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>tends that when the disposition hearing transcript differs from the written judgment, the transcript prevails. <em>See State in Interest of D.D., </em>11-1384 (La.App. 3 Cir. 3/7/12), 86 So.3d 171. W.B. contends that because transcript from the disposition hearing fails to include curfew, the district court should be ordered to amend the judgment to conform to the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">In <em>D.D., supra, </em>the transcript prevailed over the minute entry where the minute entry failed to include that the juvenile\u2019s confinement was to be served \u201cwithout benefit of parole, probation, suspension of imposition or execution of sentence, or modification of sentence.\u201d <em>D.D., </em>11-1384 at p.5, 86 So.3d at 175. The appellate court remanded the matter to the trial court for amendment of the minute entry to accurately reflect the transcript. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">This court, however, has recognized that the district court has the authority to impose \u201c[b]y written judgment, additional conditions of probation, including a curfew.\u201d <em>State in Interest of S.P., </em>11-1598, p. 2 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/2/12), 90 So.3d 528, 531; <em>see also State In Interest of A.D., </em>16-0439, p. 13 (La.App. 4 Cir. 9/28/16, 13), \u2014 So.3d \u2014, \u2014, 2016 WL 5416351, p. *7. Accordingly, we find that the inclusion in the written disposition of curfew as a special condition of W.B.\u2019s probation does not warrant a reversal or a remand for clarification. This assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">_[jgDE CRE E</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the juvenile\u2019s delinquency adjudication is affirmed, but the- disposition is vacated and remanded for a disposition hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">ADJUDICATION AFFIRMED; DISPOSITION VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">.

When the error was realized, Ms. Keife attempted to obtain a new copy of the video. The video, however, was no longer preserved on her surveillance system. The video, therefore, was not introduced at the adjudication hearing; rather, still-photographs taken from the video were admitted by defense counsel. On cross-examination, Ms. Keife identified the photographs as those taken from the surveillance video.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">.
