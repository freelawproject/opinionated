For the reasons that follow, we vacate defendant\u2019s sentences and remand the matter with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">On November 10, 2015, a unanimous twelve-person jury convicted defendant of attempted aggravated rape<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sexual battery of a victim under the age of thirteen, violations of La. R.S. 14:27:42 and La. R.S. 14:43.1, respectively. Defendant filed a motion for new trial on November 13, 2015; yet, the court neglected to grant or deny relief on this motion in its ruling of November 19, 2015: \u201cIn consideration of the foregoing motion, it is HEREBY ORDERED that Noe-Aguliar<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Benitez December 10th 2015.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">This defective ruling was not corrected and the court imposed sentence on December 10, 2015. For his conviction of attempted aggravated rape, defendant was sentenced to fifty years at hard labor without benefits. And for his conviction of sexual battery, defendant was sentenced to ninety-nine years at hard labor without benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">On December 12, 2015, defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence, refiled his motion for new trial, and filed a motion for appeal. On December 21, 2015, the court ordered a rule to show cause on the motion to reconsider, setting the matter for hearing on February 4, 2016. On January 19, 2016, the court ruled 12that defendant\u2019s refiled motion for new trial was \u201cmoot,\u201d noting \u201cRTSC 2/4/16.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And on January 28, 2016, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">Following several continuances, the rule to show cause was heard on May 16, 2016. At the conclusion of this hearing, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion for new trial and his motion to reconsider sentence. On May 22, 2016, defendant filed a motion to appeal these rulings, which the court granted on May 25, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">This case presents several procedural irregularities. For ease of correction, we address only the initial defect: the district court\u2019s failure to dispose of defendant\u2019s motion for new trial before sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">Generally, a motion for new trial must be filed and disposed of before sentencing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> La. C.Cr.P. art. 853(A). Since the court\u2019s November 19, 2015 ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for new trial neither granted nor denied relief, we find defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, timely filed on November 13, 2015, was not disposed of before sentence was imposed on December 10, 2015. This Court has routinely held that a trial court\u2019s failure to rule on the merits of a motion for new trial prior to sentencing constitutes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>error patent on the face of the record, requiring that the sentence be vacated and the case be remanded for a ruling on the motion. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>14-453 (La.App. 5 Cir. 12/23/14), 167 So.3d 793, 799-800 (citing <em>State v. Williams, </em>11-65 (La.App. 5 Cir. 12/13/11), 81 So.3d 908, 909; <em>State v. Munson, </em>11-54 (La.App. 5 Cir. 11/15/11), 78 So.3d 290, 292; <em>State v. Morgan, </em>06-529 (La.App. 5 Cir. 12/12/06), 948 So.2d 199, 207; <em>State v. Stee, </em>99-633 (La.App. 5 Cir. 11/30/99), 749 So.2d 784, 790; <em>State v. Pineyro, </em>93-765 (La. App. 5 Cir. 1/25/94), 631 So.2d 1203, 1206). Accordingly, we must vacate defendant\u2019s sentences and remand the matter for the district court to rule on defendant\u2019s motion for new trial filed on November 13, 2015. In addition, though |swe see no need to expressly rule, for the sake of clarity, we choose to vacate all of the district court\u2019s rulings after December 10, 2015. So that upon remand, this matter will be in the same procedural posture as it was when defendant filed his motion for new trial on November 13, 2015,</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">DECREE</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">For the foregoing reasons, defendant\u2019s sentences and all district court rulings after December 10, 2015 are vacated. This matter is remanded for the district court to rule on the motion for new trial filed by defendant on November 13, 2015, and, if denied, to resentence defendant. In the event that defendant\u2019s motion for new trial is denied, upon resentencing, defendant\u2019s right to appeal his convictions and sentences is reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">SENTENCES VACATED; REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\">.In 2015, the offense defined in La. R.S. 14:42 as \"aggravated rape\u201d was redesignated as \"first degree rape,\u201d <em>See </em>Acts 2015, No. 184 \u00a7 1, eff. Aug. 1, 2015. La. R.S. 14:42(E) offers the following clarification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">For all purposes, \"aggravated rape\u201d and \"first degree rape\u201d mean the offense defined by the provisions of this Section and any reference to the crime of aggravated rape is the same as a reference to the crime of first degree rape. Any act in violation of the provisions of this Section committed on or after August 1, 2015, shall be referred to as \"first degree rape.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-16\">. As reflected in the caption of this case, defendant's surname is alternatively spelled \"Aguilar\u201d and \u201cAguliar\u201d throughout the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-17\">. It appears \"RTSC 2/4/16\u201d refers to the Rule <em>To </em>Show Cause hearing set for February 4, 2016.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b543-18\">. The exceptions to this general rule in La. C.Cr.P. art. 853(B) and (C) are not pertinent here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
