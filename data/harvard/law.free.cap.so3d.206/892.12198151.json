This case comes before this court pursuant to remand from the Louisiana Supreme Court. Plaintiff/Relator, Attorney James E. Boren (Boren), initially applied for supervisory writs with this court to reverse the judgment of the trial court denying his Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Review following the denial- of his public records request to the St. Landry Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office. After this court denied Boren\u2019s writ, he applied for a writ of review with the Louisiana Supreme Court. Boren\u2019s writ to the supreme court was granted, and the c\u00e1se was remanded to us for briefing, argument, and a full opinion. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-21\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b963-23\">The instant civil action arises from an underlying criminal matter. Boren was retained by Mr. Stephan Bergeron (Berger-on) to challenge his criminal convictions by filing an application for post-conviction re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>lief. Boren made a written request for public records to the St. Landry Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office, asking to inspect and copy any public record pertaining to the 2013 convictions of Bergeron. Earl B. Taylor, made defendant her\u00e9in and the District Attorney for St. Landry Parish (Taylor), responded to Boren\u2019s records request by asking him to state the nature of his relationship to Bergeron, the grounds for post-conviction relief, and to establish that such grounds were not raised on appeal. Boren\u2019s response to Taylor was that he was unable to determine whether any grounds for post-conviction relief existed without first being given access to the requested files. He did not list any of the information requested by Taylor. Taylor denied Boren\u2019s request on July 24, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Boren filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Review in the trial court on August 10, 2015, which was denied on August 13, 2015. He then filed a 12supervisory writ with this court seeking review of the trial court\u2019s ruling. This court denied Boren\u2019s writ, finding no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>Boren v. Taylor, </em>15-911 (La.App. 3 Cir. 11/18/15) (unpublished writ).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, Boren filed a writ of review with, the supreme court, which granted the writ and remanded the matter for briefing, oral argument, and a full opinion. <em>Boren v. Taylor, </em>15-2322 (La. 3/14/16) (unpublished writ).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Boren contends that the trial court erred in denying his application for writ of mandamus and in denying his requests for costs, attorney fees, and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">LAW AND DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Louisiana Constitution Article 12, \u00a7 3, provides, \u201cNo person shall be denied the right to observe the deliberations of public bodies and examine public documents, except in cases established by law.\u201d To effect this constitutional provision, La.R.S. 44:31 was enacted and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-11\">A. Providing access to public records is a responsibility and duty of the appointive or elective office of a custodian and his employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-12\">B. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter or as otherwise specifically provided by law, and in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, any person of the age of majority may inspect, copy, or reproduce any public record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-13\">(2) Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter or as otherwise specifically provided by law, and in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, any person may obtain a copy or reproduction of any public record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-14\">(3) The burden of proving that a public record is not subject to inspection, copying, or reproduction shall rest with the custodian.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-15\">The foregoing provisions recognize the public\u2019s right of access to public records. This constitutional and statutory right is, however, not absolute. Both provisions expressly acknowledge that there are exceptions to the right of access. |sThe issue before this court is whether Boren\u2019s request falls within the exception to the public records act found in La.R.S. 44:31.1. The tidal court concluded that it did, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-16\">Louisiana Revised Statutes 44:31.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-17\">For the purposes of this Chapter, person does not include an individual in custody after sentence following a felony conviction who has exhausted his appellate remedies when the request for public records is not limited to grounds upon which the individual could file for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>post conviction relief under Code of Criminal Procedure Article 930.3. Notwithstanding the provisions contained in R.S. 44:32, the custodian may make an inquiry of any individual who applies for a public record to determine if such individual is in custody after sentence following a felony conviction who has exhausted his appellate remedies and the custodian may make any inquiry necessary to determine if the request of any such individual in custody for a felony conviction is limited to grounds upon which such individual may file for post conviction relief under Code of Criminal Procedure Article 930.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">This statutory provision, enacted subsequent to the general provisions of the public records law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is a more specific provision which was enacted to address matters of post conviction relief. To limit the \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d of individuals who had exhausted all other remedies, the statute set limiting parameters applicable to certain requests. The statute did so by limiting the definition of \u201cperson\u201d so as to exclude \u201can individual in custody after sentence following a felony conviction who has exhausted his appellate remedies when the request for public records is not limited to grounds upon which the individual could file for post conviction relief under Code of Criminal Procedure Article 930.3.\u201d La.R.S. 44:31.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Notably, the exclusion of certain \u201cindividual[s] in custody\u201d does not provide a bl\u00e1nket prohibition against these individuals having access to public records; rather, such persons\u2019 request is limited to particular grounds for post conviction |4relief. Accordingly, when a public records request is made, La,R.S. 44:32(A)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allows the custodian of the public record to make inquiry to determine if the restrictive parameters of La.R.S. 44:31 are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">In the instant matter, there is no dispute that the requested records are public records. Additionally, there is no dispute that the records being \"requested are for purposes of exploring post conviction relief. Admittedly, Boren is requesting the public records of Bergeron, whose conviction is final and was affirmed on appeal, to investigate potential remedies available to Bergeron by way of post conviction relief. Clearly, Bergeron is an individual whose public records requests would be limited by La.R.S. 44:31.1. What remains in dispute is whether the exception found in La.R.S 44:31.1 also applies to Boren. If applicable, Taylor had the authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>withhold the records due to Boren\u2019s failure to list the grounds for post conviction relief delineated in La.Code Crim.P. Art. 930.3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If inapplicable, Boren] s has the right of access, and Taylor\u2019s failure to produce the records may entitle Boren to costs, attorney fees, and damages, as he requested. La.R.S. 44:35.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Boren maintains that La.R.S. 44:31.1 does not apply to him as he is not an incarcerated individual, in prison with a felony conviction, who has exhausted his appellate remedies. Taylor counters that Boren, an attorney representing Bergeron, is acting in a representative capacity and is not allowed to \u201cwear two hats.\u201d Narrowly stated, we must therefore decide whether La.R.S, 44:31.1 applies to an attorney seeking public records on behalf of his client who is not considered a \u201cperson\u201d per La.R.S. 44:31.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">In support of his position, Boren argued in the trial court that if Taylor\u2019s argument would prevail, it would produce the absurd consequence that an individual in custody who is seeking post conviction relief would not have the right to retain counsel and get full discovery. The trial court disagreed and recognized that such an interpretation did not preclude retained counsel from obtaining the records. Instead, the court explained that such an individual can retain counsel, \u201c[i]t just means that they need to articulate what grounds they are seeking post-conviction on.\u201d- In denying Boren\u2019s petition, the trial court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxHA\">[T]he statute was designed to stop a fishing expedition by people who are in custody. I think the statute is designed\u2014I mean they could | shave clearly said it does not apply to an attorney representing such. It doesn\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other way for me ... to understand how to interpret that, other than to say it applies, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s burdensome for an attorney to set forth a ground for post-conviction relief that he\u2019s interested in. Now, to say, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any grounds until I look at the file, you have the entire record to determine whether or not there\u2019s potential grounds. It is clear that the June 30[th] letter of Mr. Boren, when he requested records, was that he was requesting on behalf of someone in custody. I believe [La.R.S,] 44:31.1 applies. I believe Mr. Boren should have set forth grounds for post-conviction relief once the District Attorney requested that he do so, and as a result, I am going to deny the Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">In reaching its conclusion, the trial court noted that there is no jurisprudence directly addressing this issue. We agree. This court has considered the jurisprudence cited by both parties and finds that none are dispositive of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>Notably, none of the cases relied upon by Boren directly address the issue of whether an attorney can request public records on behalf of an incarcerated client under La.R.S. 44:31.1 without first setting forth grounds for seeking post-conviction relief. Simply because an attorney was allowed access to public records in a district attorney\u2019s file does not alone support Boren\u2019s argument herein. There is no indication in the cited cases whether the attorney was required to state a reason for his request and to identify the grounds for an application for post-conviction relief. Further, in some instances, the opinions, in fact, predate La.R.S. 44:31.1 and are not instructive for that reason as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">Taylor, likewise, acknowledges an inability to direct this court to jurisprudence that directly addresses the issue before this court. Discussed in brief is <em>Revere v. Canulette, </em>97-552 (La.App. 1 Cir. 5/15/98), 715 So.2d 47, <em>writ granted in part, denied in part, </em>98-1493 (La. 1/29/99), 730 So.2d 870,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> wherein the court |7found that La. R.S. 44:31.1 does not violate the rights provided by the constitution. Primarily, Taylor directs this court to the following language of Judge Guidry, in his dissent, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-5\">I respectfully disagree with the portion of the decision which concludes that LSA\u2014R.S. 44:31.1 is procedural in nature. The right of access to the public records is a fundamental right guaranteed by La. Const, art. XII, \u00a7 3. <em>Elliott v. District Attorney of Baton Rouge, </em>94-1804, p. 3 (La.App. 1 Cir. 9/14/95), 664 So.2d 122, 124, <em>writ denied, </em>95-2509 (La. 12/15/95), 664 So.2d 440. LSA-R.S. 44:1 et seq. sets forth the means by which a person may obtain access to the public records. LSA-R.S. 44:31.1 restricts an inmate\u2019s access to public records to situations when the inmate\u2019s request is limited to grounds upon which the inmate may file for post-conviction relief. <em>State ex rel. Leonard v. State, </em>96-1889 (La. 6/13/97), 695 So.2d 1325.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-9\">Prior to the enactment of LSA-R.S. 44:31.1, courts interpreted the Public Records Act as allowing inmates the right of access to public records without limiting the access for a particular purpose. <em>See, e.g., Elliott v. District Attorney of Baton Rouge, </em>664 So.2d 122. Now, LSA-R.S. 44:31.1 does away with a prisoner\u2019s right of access to the public records \u201cwho has exhausted his appellate remedies when the request for public records is not limited to grounds upon which the individual could file for post conviction relief under Code of Criminal Procedure Article 930.3.\u201d There is nothing in the statute that would allow an inmate, by mail or by representative, to escape the inquiry and denial by the custodian based on the grounds for which he seeks the records. Accordingly, I believe LSA-R.S. 44:31.1 is substantive in nature and must be applied prospectively only. For this reason, I respectfully dissent from the portion of the opinion that concludes that LSA-R.S. 44:31.1 should be applied retroactively and would conclude that the trial court erred in applying LSA-R.S. 44:31.1 retroactively to the actions filed prior to August 15,1995.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-10\"><em>Revere, </em>715 So.2d at 57 (emphasis added). While certainly not dispositive, this language provides some instructional value in its discussion of La.R.S. 44:31.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Boren argues that by the terms of the statute, it is inapplicable to him since he is not \u201can individual in custody after sentence following a felony conviction who has exhausted his appellate remedies[.]\u201d Although this statement is accurate, as Bergeron\u2019s legal counsel, Boren is appearing in his representative capacity, and the relationship is one of principal and agent. <em>Smart Document Solutions, LLC v. Miller, </em>07-670 (La.App. 3 Cir. 10/31/07), 970 So.2d 49, <em>writ denied, </em>08-210 (La. 3/28/08), 978 So.2d 308. Indeed, the relationship between an attorney and a client is a unique agency relationship in that the attorney/agent acts more so in the capacity of the principal in matters of litigation. <em>Id. </em>Certainly, in the criminal context, the United States Supreme Court has stated \u2018\u201cthe attorney is the [defendant\u2019s] agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thomas, </em>10-528, 10-303, 10-529, p. 38 (La.App. 4 Cir. 7/15/10), 54 So.3d 1, 22 (quoting <em>Vermont v. Brillon, </em>556 U.S. 81, 90, 129 S.Ct. 1283, 173 L.Ed.2d 231, quoting <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 753, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\">In this case, Boren, in requesting the public records as legal counsel for Berger-on, was acting in his representative capacity as an agent. As such, he has no greater rights than those of Bergeron. Louisiana Revised Statutes 44:31.1 applies to Berger-on and requires that he identify grounds for post conviction relief in making a request for public records; thus, the same requirements must be satisfied by Boren. Retaining counsel should not enable a defendant to circumvent the provisions of La.R.S. 44:31.1. This would yield an inequitable result in that those individuals who could afford to retain counsel would be treated differently and would be allowed freer access to the public records sought for purposes of post conviction relief than the individuals who did not have the same financial means. Additionally, such an interpretation would negate the purpose for the enactment of La.R.S. 44:31.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">For the foregoing reasons, based upon our de novo review of the record,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we find that the trial court did not err in denying Boren\u2019s Petition for Writ of |flMandamus and Review. Boren is the attorney for Bergeron, and, as his legal representative, the statutory requirements restricting Beregon\u2019s access to public records are applicable to Boren. Boren may request the public records in the custody of Taylor, but he must comply with La.R.S. 44:31.1 and identify the post conviction relief grounds for which the records are sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">Given our conclusion, Boren\u2019s remaining issue relative to costs, attorney fees, and damages is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">DECREE</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the trial court denying the Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Review on behalf of James E. Boren, and we assess him with the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Cooks, J., dissents and assigns written reasons.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-9\">.

Boren (Boren) made a written request for public records to the St. Landry Parish District Attor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>ne/s Office asking to inspect and copy any public record pertaining to the.2013 convictions of Stephan Bergeron (Bergeron). The parties do not dispute the fact that Bergeron\u2019s conviction is final. Thus, Ber-geron\u2019s only avenue to further challenge his conviction is by filing an application for post-conviction relief. The District Attorney responded to Boren\u2019s request by asking him to state the nature of his relationship to Bergeron, the grounds for post-conviction relief, and to establish that such grounds were not raised on appeal. Boren responded he could not determine whether any grounds for post-conviction relief existed without first being given access to the requested files.. He did not list any of the information requested by the District Attorney. The District Attorney denied Boren\u2019s request on July 24, 2015. Boren filed a petition for writ of mandamus and review on August 10, 2015, which was denied on August 13, 2015. Boren filed a writ with this court seeking review of the trial court\u2019s ruling. This court denied Boren\u2019s writ, finding no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling. I dissented with written reasons. <em>See, James E. Boren v. Earl B. Taylor, </em>15-911(La. App. 3 Cir. 11/18/15). Boren filed a writ of review with the Louisiana Instate Supreme Court which granted the writ and remanded the matter for briefing, oral argument and a full opinion. <em>See James E. Boren v. Earl B. Taylor, </em>15-2322 (La. 3/14/16). I now urge the same reasoning as I did in my previous dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">I first note the illogical consequence of upholding the trial court\u2019s and majority\u2019s decision in this instance. While the majority holds the attorney could not demand access to these public records because he stands as the legal representative of a convicted felon serving out his sentence, there is no question under the constitutional and statutory provisions applicable herein, a family member of this felon, or anyone else for that matter, could make such a request. But more important than this absurd consequence is the fact that the Louisiana legislature did not express any intent to extend the limitation found in La.R.S. 44:31.1 to attorneys representing incarcerated inmates. Louisiana Constitution Article 12, \u00a7 3, provides, \u201cNo person shall be denied the right to observe the deliberations of public bodies and examine public documents, except in cases established by law.\u201d In <em>Title Research Corp. v. Rausch, </em>450 So.2d 933, 936 (La.1984) (emphasis added) the Louisiana State Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-7\">The right of the public to have access to the public records is a fundamental right, and is guaranteed by the constitution. La. Const, art, 12, \u00a7 3. The provision of the constitution must be construed liberally in favor of free and unrestricted access to the records, and that access can be denied only when a law, specifically and unequivocally, provides otherwise. <em>Id. Whenever there is doubt as to whether the public has the right of access to certain records, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the public\u2019s right to see. To allow otherwise would be an improper and arbitrary restriction on the public\u2019s constitutional rights.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">Louisiana Revised Statutes 44:31.1 restricts access to public records. Therefore, under the holding in <em>Title Research, </em>this restriction must be strictly construed and any doubt as to its meaning \u201cmust be resolved in favor\u201d of access. |aThe majority ignores this mandate and under its liberal interpretation of La.R.S. 44:31.1 judicially creates an exception to the public\u2019s right to access information. The statute clearly, and with painstaking precision, limits the exception to \u201can individual in custody after sentence following a felony conviction who has exhausted his appellate remedies.\u201d La.R.S. 44:31.1. The language in this statute does not extend its limitation to a <em>representative </em>of such \u201can individual in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>custody[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The legislature could easily have done so, but it did not. This court does not enjoy the authority to legislate. The statute expressly and exclusively applies only to the <em>\u201cindividual in custody.\u201d Id. </em>Thus, because Boren is not \u201can individual in custody after sentence following a felony conviction who has exhausted his appellate remedies,\u201d <em>Id. </em>the District Attorney acted improperly by failing to provide the requested documents and demanding the information it sought from Boren. The trial court legally erred in denying the writ of mandamus and the majority errs in usurping legislative authority to create an exception to a constitutional right of Louisiana citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Further, the facts in this case caution against this court\u2019s decision to burden the fundamental right to access public records by nothing more than judicial modification of the clear legislative language. At the hearing below, Boren, represented by counsel, asserted he is an attorney in Baton Rouge who frequently does post-conviction work. He argued he must first acquire public records pursuant to the public records act to do post-conviction relief work. Next, he directed the court to his response to the District Attorney on July 21, 2015, wherein he indicated he was retained by Bergeron and could not know the grounds for post-conviction relief until he obtained all the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">l/The state and the majority maintain there is no jurisprudence which construes La.R.S. 44:31.1 to give an attorney representing a defendant any kind of right outside of the statute! That may be true but it is an irrelevant observation. More relevant is the fact that neither the state nor the majority can cite to any jurisprudence which applies the statutory limitation to a representative.of the individual defined in the statute. The state maintains Boren is before the court in his representative capacity and is not allowed to \u201cwear two hats.\u201d It further argues that pursuant to La.R.S. 44:31.1, a defendant must have a new issue that falls under La.R.S. 44:31.1, and his representative must articulate that issue. The state further complains the statute does not allow Boren, as Bergeron\u2019s representative, to go on a fishing expedition in the District Attorney\u2019s file. The hat trick here is not being performed by Boren. Boren\u2019s counsel contends if the state\u2019s argument stands it would produce an absurd consequence\u2014a person in custody seeking post-conviction relief would not have the right to retain counsel unless that convicted felon could establish \u00e1 basis for post-conviction relief so his retained attorney could satisfy the state\u2019s demands based on its interpretation of La.R.S. 44:31.1. The trial court disagreed with Boren\u2019s suggestion, stating the state\u2019s interpretation of La.R.S. 44:31.1 did not mean that at all. Instead, the trial court suggested, it simply means counsel must articulate the grounds upon which the defendant is seeking post-conviction relief. Boren urges it is the standard practice of counsel to obtain the district attorney\u2019s file, and the file of the arresting agency, to allow a skilled attorney to look through the documents to determine whether grounds for post-conviction relief exist. This, he urges, benefits the system of justice because it reduces baseless, frivolous applications for post-conviction relief. The majority embraces the state\u2019s and trial court\u2019s rationale and rejects Boren\u2019s arguments. I | \u00a1\u00a1believe the majority\u2019s reasoning is flawed and ignores the state supreme court\u2019s mandate requiring strict construction of La.R.S. 44:31.1, and indeed leads to absurd consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Moreover, there are many more reasons why applying the majority\u2019s rationale in this case to exclude a lawyer\u2019s access to the record and the state\u2019s file in a given case may keep secret the 'conduct and evidence that may prove to be material in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>advancing an incarcerated individual\u2019s post-conviction plea. One of the compelling reasons we should not blindly embrace the District Attorney\u2019s position now was recently highlighted by the United \u2022 States Supreme Court in <em>Foster v. Chatman, </em>578 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1737, 195 L.Ed.2d 1 (2016). In that case, the high court addressed a claim thirty years in the making. Foster was convicted of capital murder and the Georgia court sentenced him to death. His repeated attempts to attack racial bias in jury selection were rebuffed by the state. Through the Georgia Open Records Act his lawyers obtained copies of the prosecution\u2019s file which contained damning evidence proving his sentence to death was obtained by excluding black jurors on the basis of their race. The prosecution\u2019s file contained evidence which belied its claims and protestations that the state had not engaged in any racial bias during jury selection. The prosecutor\u2019s file contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-6\">(1)Four copies of the jury venire list. On each copy, the names of the black prospective jurors were highlighted in bright green. A legend in the upper right corner of the lists indicated that the green highlighting \u201crepresents Blacks.\u201d See, <em>e.g., </em>App. 253. The letter \u201cB\u201d also appeared next to each black prospective juror\u2019s name. See, <em>e.g., ibid. </em>According to the testimony of Clayton Lundy, an investigator who assisted the prosecution during jury selection, these highlighted venire lists were circulated in the district attorney\u2019s office during jury selection.

Under the name of one of those jurors, Lundy had written: \u201cIf it comes , down to having to pick one of the black jurors, [this one] might be okay. This is solely my. opinion.... Upon picking of the jury after listening to all of the jurors we had to pick, if we had to pick a black juror I recommend that [this juror] be one of the jurors.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 345 (paragraph break omitted) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-10\">(3) Three handwritten notes on black prospective jurors Eddie Hood, Louise Wilson, and Corrie Hinds. Annotations denoted those individuals as \u201cB # 1,\u201d \u201cB# 2,\u201d and \u201cB# 3,\u201d respectively. App. 295-297. Lundy testified that these were examples of the type of \u201cnotes that the team\u2014the State would take down during voir dire to help select the jury in Mr. Foster\u2019s case.\u201d Tr. 208-210.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-11\">(4) A typed list of the qualified jurors remaining after <em>voir dire. </em>App. 287-290.

Chatman, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1737, 1744, 195 L.Ed.2d 1 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">17Louisiana has elevated the right to access public records to a Constitutional right which should be zealously guarded by the judiciary. Any legislation purporting to limit or take away the right from a particular class of citizens must be strictly construed and narrowly tailored to safeguard or further a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">In oral argument the state argues applying the limitation in Louisiana is not overly burdensome in this case because the attorney simply needed to articulate some ground, albeit contrived, upon which to base an application for post-conviction relief even without the District Attorney\u2019s file in hand. This simple gesture, the state submitted, would satisfy its inquiry. I believe the state\u2019s suggestion must be rejected outright. Not even the state legislature has the authority to compel a lawyer to breach the code of ethics governing his role as an officer of the court. \u201cThou shall not lie\u201d is a rule which forms the cornerstone of a lawyer\u2019s ethical obligation and serves as a moral imperative even in his or her personal dealings.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Boren indicates he has practiced criminal law, exclusively, for forty years and has filed about one hundred applications for post-conviction relief. He maintains this is the first time in forty years he has been denied access to public records in connection with an application for post-conviction relief. He urges under La.R.S. 44:32, a custodian shall make no inquiry of 'any person who applies for a public record, except an inquiry as to' the age and identification of the person. Boren acknowledges if a custodian believes records are being sought for post-conviction litigation, then La.R.S. 44:31.1 permits a custodian of records <em>to determine only if the person seeking the records is an individual in custody. </em>I believe this is a correct interpretation <em>of the </em>law.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">|sIn. support of his argument, Boren cites <em>Innocence Project New Orleans v. New Orleans Police Dep\u2019t, </em>13-921 (La.App. 4 Cir. 11/6/13), 129 So.3d 668. In that case the Innocence Project of New Orleans (IPNO), a non-profit law firm which seeks to exonerate persons who have been wrongfully convicted, submitted a public records request to the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD). The request for records pertained to the police investigation and arrest of Bennie Brown whose conviction had been final for almost twenty years prior to the request. The NOPD did not respond to the written request within the three-day statutory period or after IPNO\u2019s several attempts to follow up on the request during the following three months. Sixty-five days after the initial written request, the NOPD denied the request, except for the initial police report, on the basis that the requested records were exempt under La. R.S. 44:3(A)(1), but actually quoting La.R.S. 44:3(A)(4)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>The IPNO subsequently filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and sought attorney\u2019s fees, the costs of litigation, and statutory penalties for the custodian\u2019s untimely response to the request. Following a hearing at which the custodian did not testify, the trial court made the writ peremptory and ordered the production of the records. The trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees, eosts, and penalties. On appeal, the custodian sought review of the award of attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and penalties, not the issuance of the writ of mandamus. The appellate court held that the trial court was correct in awarding the mandated costs of litigation and attorney\u2019s fees and that the discretionary imposition of civil penalties on the custodian was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Boren also relies on the decision in <em>Trenticosta v. Mamoulides, </em>93-621 (La. App. 5 Cir. 2/23/94), 633 So.2d 786, <em>writ denied, </em>94-1296 (La. 9/2/94), 643 So.2d 147, wherein counsel for a death row inmate sent a request to the district attorney to inspect and copy the public records in his custody regarding the investigation, arrest, and prosecution of his client. The district attorney allowed counsel to examine and copy certain files but withheld two folders on the basis of work product. Counsel subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandamus pursuant to La. R.S. 44:35, requesting the trial court compel the district attorney to disclose the records. The trial court denied relief. On appeal, the court noted \u201cthat the finality of a conviction does not warrant open season on every item in the district attorney\u2019s files.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 787). Further, the appellate court found the district attorney was entitled to the protection of the Work Product Rule and that several items listed as being retained were not subject to disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Boren notes the district attorney in <em>Innocence Project New Orleans </em>and <em>Trenti-costa </em>did not raise the issue of whether an attorney can request public records on behalf of an incarcerated client without setting forth a reason for seeking post-conviction relief. The state\u2019s appeals in essence concede this point by urging only the work product exception to full disclosure. The majority rejects this reasoning and maintains there is no jurisprudence directly on point with regard to the issue presented here and says \u201cnone of the cases relied upon by Boren directly address the issue of whether an attorney can request public records on behalf of an incarcerated client under La.R.S. 44:31.1, without setting forth a reason for seeking post-conviction relief.\u201d Instead, the majority finds the decision in <em>Revere v. Canulette, </em>97-552 (La. App. 1 Cir. 1998), 715 So.2d 47, <em>writ granted in part, denied in part, </em>98-1493 (La. 1/29/99), 730 So.2d 870, though admittedly not dispositive of the issue herein, \u201cprovides some instructional value.\u201d In <em>Revere </em>the court found that La.R.S. 44:31.1 does not violate the rights provided by the | inLouisiana or United States Constitutions. The majority looks to Judge Gui-dry\u2019s dissent, which reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-8\">Prior to the enactment of LSA-R.S. 44:31.1, courts interpreted the Public Records Act as allowing inmates the right of access to public records without limiting the access for a particular purpose. <em>See, e.g., Elliott v. District Attorney of Baton Rouge, </em>[94-1804 (La.App. 1 Cir. 9/14/95),] 664 So.2d 122. Now, LSA-R.S. 44:31.1 does away with a prisoner\u2019s right of access to the public records \u201cwho has exhausted his appellate remedies when the request for public records is.not limited to grounds upon which the individual could file for post conviction relief under Code of Criminal Procedure Article 930.3.\u201d There is nothing in the statute that would allow an inmate, by mail or by representative, to escape the inquiry and denial by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>custodian based on the grounds for which he seeks the records. Accordingly, I believe LSA-R.S. 44:31.1 is substantive in nature and must be applied prospectively only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 57 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">On wiits to the state supreme court, the majority opinion was reversed on the issue of retroactivity finding La.R.S. 44:31.1 is substantive and is a fundamental break from prior law on access to public records. The matter was remanded to the trial court to determine if the defendant was entitled to access the police photographs and radio logs. The decision in that case has no bearing on the case now under consideration. The state supreme court in reversing the lower court did not address the issue presented here. More importantly, the jurisprudence is clear regarding the constitutional right of Louisiana citizens to access public records and is clear that any law seeking to limit that access must be strictly construed. The majority fails to follow this mandate, and, based on its notion of agency, expands the statutory exception to include Boren as Bergeron\u2019s agent standing in his shoes. I believe this is error. The majority says to interpret the statute otherwise \u201cwould negate the purpose for the enactment of La.R.S. 44:31.1.\u201d Respectfully, the purpose of the statute seems quite clear to me, i.e. to limit the constitutional right of the public\u2019s access to information only when the \u201cindividual\u201d seeking the information is \u201can individual in custody after sentence following a felony conviction who has exhausted his appellate remedies.\u201d La.R.S. 44:31.1. (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">| nits aim, I am convinced, was to prevent repeated public records requests by incarcerated individuals who routinely bombard the courts with frivolous post-conviction filings, and who unnecessarily tax the resources of the public by placing an unwarranted burden on the custodians of public records. Nothing in the statute limits Boren\u2019s right as a Louisiana citizen to access the requested information free of any constraints. As stated by Boren, allowing him access to the public record actually advances the interest the legislature sought to protect by enacting La.R.S. 44:31.1. Boren is entitled to attorney fees, costs and damages pursuant to La.R.S. 44:35, and the case should be remanded to the trial court for determination of those amounts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
