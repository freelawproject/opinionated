The trial court did not err in summarily dismissing relator\u2019s motion for a new trial, because it was untimely. <em>See </em>La.C.Cr.P. art. 853(B). Relator\u2019s motion is properly construed as an application for post-conviction relief pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 924, <em>et seq. Cf. Smith v. Cajun Insulation, </em>392 So.2d 398, 402 n.2 (\u201ccourts should look through the caption of the pleadings ... to ascertain their substance and do substantial justice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">The substantive claim underlying relator\u2019s requests for an evidentiary hearing, a new trial, and to vacate his conviction and sentence\u2014that he was denied due process and the effective assistance of counsel because he did not review the victim\u2019s statements before pleading guilty\u2014is imper-missibly repetitive. <em>Cf. </em>La.C.Cr,P. art. 930.4(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-18\">Relator has exhausted his right to state collateral review. <em>See State ex rel. Jackson v. State, </em>15-1731 (La. 10/10/16), 201 So.3d 879.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
