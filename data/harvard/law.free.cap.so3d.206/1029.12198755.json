BONIN, JUDGE</author>\n<p id=\"b1101-27\">11 Construction Diva, L.L.C., responded to an Invitation to Bid on a publicly bid contract, issued by the City of New Orleans on behalf of the New Orleans Aviation Board, to provide landscaping maintenance services for properties owned by the Aviation Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The contract called for, among other things, forty percent participation by certified disadvantaged business entities. Although it had been certified by the City as a disadvantaged business entity, and had made the numerically lowest bid for the landscaping contract, Construction Diva\u2019s bid was rejected because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>not certified as a disadvantaged business in the field of landscaping, but rather in residential/industrial construction and renovation. Construction Diva, to no avail, protested the City\u2019s rejection of its bid. It then filed suit against the City, alleging that it improperly denied its bid in violation of the Louisiana Public Bid Law. <em>See </em>La. R.S. 38:2212, <em>et seq. </em>Construction Diva, accordingly, asked the trial court to either enjoin the City from awarding the contract to any entity other than it, or issue a writ of mandamus compelling the |zCity to award it the contract. The trial court denied Construction Diva\u2019s request for both a preliminary injunction and a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Construction Diva appealed the judgment denying its request for a preliminary injunction, which appeal is specially authorized by law! <em>See </em>La. C.C.P. arts. 1841, 2083 C, 3612 B. The denial of a request for a writ of mandamus is likewise an appealable judgment. <em>See, e.g., Clothesline Laundromat, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, </em>11-1578 (La. App. 4 Cir. 8/1/12), 98 So. 3d 901. Having reviewed the record and the applicable law, we cannot say that the trial judge abused her discretion in denying Construction Diva\u2019s request for either a preliminary injunction or a writ of mandamus. We explain our decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">We first discuss this matter\u2019s factual and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">On August 7, 2015, the City published an invitation to bid upon a contract entitled \u201cAirport Property Landscaping Annual Maintenance,\u201d in which the winning bidder would provide landscaping services to maintain specified \u201clandscape areas throughout the airport site on a full time basis, as well as installation of supplemental plant materials.\u201d Significantly, the bidding documents mandate a forty percent participation in the contract by a certified State/Local Disadvantaged Business Enterprise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">[{\u00a1Construction Diva, which the City certified as a disadvantaged business on April 25, 2014, submitted a bid and averred that it satisfied the project\u2019s forty percent disadvantaged business requirement. The City received several other bids, all of which it opened on October 20, 2015. The lowest numerical bid was submitted by Construction Diva, while the next lowest bid was submitted by Little Computer Solutions, L.L.C. However, on November 16, 2015, the City, by way of correspondence, informed Construction Diva that its bid was non-responsive: \u201cBidder failed to satisfy the SLDBE requirement. Construction Diva, LLC is not a certified SLDBE in the area of landscaping. We are unable to count Construction Diva, LLC\u2019s participation toward the SLDBE goal. As such, the attainment is 0% and does not comply with the SLDBE requirement for the project.\u201d The City accordingly, awarded the contract to Little Computer Solutions. Construction Diva timely filed a bid protest, which the City denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">Shortly thereafter, Construction Diva filed suit against the City and the Aviation Board. It alleged that the City improperly denied its bid because the bid documents do not mandate that the responsive bidder have landscaping specified as a provided service on its disadvantaged business application. Construction Diva, accordingly, asserted that the City\u2019s rejection of its bid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>conflicts with the Louisiana Public Bid Law. <em>See </em>La. R.S. 38:2212, <em>et seq. </em>Contending that the City\u2019s actions violated a prohibitory law, Construction Diva asked the trial court to issue a temporary restraining order prohibiting the City from awarding the contract at issue to any bidder other than Construction Diva, or to commence work under the | contract pending the results of the subsequent hearing on its request for a preliminary injunction. Construction Diva alternatively prayed for the issuance of a writ of mandamus ordering the City to award the landscaping contract to Construction Diva. The trial judge granted the temporary restraining order and set a show-cause hearing on Construction Diva\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">The City subsequently filed an opposition to Construction Diva\u2019s petition. Little Computer Solutions filed a petition of intervention in which it adopted the positions set out by the City. The parties appeared before the trial court on March 8, 2016, to argue the merits of Construction Diva\u2019s request for injunctive relief. After receiving exhibits and listening to the parties\u2019 resp\u00e9etive arguments, the trial court at the close of the hearing orally denied Construction Diva\u2019s requests for both a preliminary injunction and a writ of mandamus. The trial judge signed a written judgment to this effect on March 14, 2016. Construction Diva timely sought appellate review, and is now before us devolutively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">We turn now to analyze Construction Diva\u2019s arguments on appeal. Specifically, Construction Diva asks this Court to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment, thereby compelling the City to award it the landscaping contract. In ^support, it argues that the trial court erred when it failed to conclude that the City acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it rejected its bid because it did not have landscaping listed on its disadvantaged business certification. The City\u2019s actions were arbitrary and capricious, Construction Diva claims, because its insistence that Construction Diva be certified in landscaping effected an impermissible deviation from the bid documents and the public bid law. Having reviewed the record, however, we conclude that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in denying Construction Diva\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction because it failed to prove that it will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief given that it failed to establish that the City impermissibly deviated from the bid documents or violated the dictates of the public bid law. We also conclude that the trial court did not abuse her discretion in denying the request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">We first analyze Construction Diva\u2019s arguments regarding the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant its request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">\u201cA preliminary injunction is an interlocutory procedural device designed to preserve the status quo as it exists between the parties, pending trial on the merits.\u201d <em>Smith v. Brumfield, </em>13-1171, p, 5 (La.App. 4 Cir. 1/15/14), 133 So.3d 70, 74. Injunctive relief is an equitable, remedy, which is ordinarily only available when a party has no adequate legal remedy. <em>Cf. West v. Town of Winnsboro, </em>252 La. 605, 211 So. 2d 665, 670 (La. 1967) (on rehearing) (\u201cBy adequate remedy at law is | \u00bfmeant one which is as speedy, efficient, and complete as the remedy in equity.\u201d). <em>See also C. Napco, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, </em>06-0603, p. 6 (La.App. 4 Cir. 3/7/07), 955 So.2d 155, 160 (\u201cAn injunction is a harsh, drastic remedy that should only issue where the petitioner is threatened with irreparable harm and has no adequate remedy at law,\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">A \u201ccourt may hear an application for a preliminary injunction ... upon the verified pleadings or supporting affidavits, or may take proof as in ordinary cases.\u201d La. C.C.P. art. 3609. \u201cA preliminary injunction shall not issue unless notice is given to the adverse party and an opportunity had for a hearing.\u201d La. C.C.P. art. 3602. Ordinarily, to prevail in the district court on a petition for preliminary injunction, the petitioner is required to establish by <em>prima facie </em>evidence that: 1) he will suffer irreparable injury, loss, or damage if the motion for preliminary injunction is not granted; and 2) he is entitled to a preliminary injunction through at least a showing that he will likely prevail on the merits of the case. <em>See Historic Restoration, Inc. v. RSUI Indem. Co., </em>06-1178, p. 11 (La.App. 4 Cir. 3/21/07), 955 So.2d 200, 208; La, C.C.P. art. 3601. The <em>prima facie </em>standard of proof to obtain a preliminary injunction is less than that required for a permanent injunction. <em>See Smith, </em>13-1171 at p. 6, 133 So.3d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-3\">\u201cA trial court has broad discretion in the granting or denial of a preliminary injunction, and will not be disturbed on review absent a clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d Yo<em>kum v. Pat O\u2019Brien\u2019s Bar, Inc., </em>12-0217, p. 6 (La.App. 4 Cir. 8/15/12), 99 So.3d 74, 80 (citing <em>Smith v. West Virginia Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>373 So. 2d 488, 493 (La. 1979)) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cThis broad standard is, of course, based upon the conclusion that the trial court committed no error of law and was not manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong in making a factual finding that was necessary to the proper exercise of its discretion.\u201d <em>Yokum, </em>12-0217 at p. 7, 99 So.3d at 80 (citing <em>South East Auto Dealers Rental Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EZ Rent to Own, Inc., </em>07-0599, pp. 4-5 (La.App. 4 Cir. 2/27/08), 980 So.2d 89, 93). Absent a clear abuse of discretion, the denial of a preliminary injunction will not be overturned on appeal. <em>See Oestreicher v. Hackett, </em>94-2573, p. 3 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/16/95), 660 So.2d 29, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">to</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-1\">We now explain why Construction Diva failed to establish through evidence that it will suffer irreparable harm. In order :to prove that irreparable harm will befall a party from the non-issuance of a preliminary injunction,, the petitioning party must show that \u201cmoney damages cannot adequately compensate for the injuries suffered and the injuries \u2018cannot be measured by pecuniary standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Historic Restoration, </em>06-1178 at p. 11, 955 So.2d at 208 (quoting <em>Saunders v. Stafford, </em>05-0205, p. 6 (La.App. 4 Cir. 1/11/06), 923 So.2d 751, 754). \u201c[M]ere inconvenience is not enough to show irreparable injury needed for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>Hobbs v. Gorman, </em>595 So.2d 1264, 1266 (La. App. 4th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-2\">Here, however, Construction Diva did not offer proof of irreparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>harm, but instead sought to take advantage of a jurisprudential exception to the 1 ^irreparable harm requirement. Specifically, in <em>Jurisich v. Jenkins, </em>99-0076 (La. 10/19/99), 749 So.2d 597, the Supreme Court established- an exception to the irreparable harm requirement for instances when the plaintiff asks for a prohibitory injunction that seeks only to order compliance with a prohibitory law. The requisite showing of irreparable injury is dispensed with \u201cwhen the conduct sought to be restrained is unconstitutional or unlawful, <em>ie., </em>when the conduct sought to be enjoined constitutes a direct violation of a prohibitory law and/or a violation of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Jurisich, </em>99-0076, p. 4, 749 So.2d at 599, citing to <em>South Cent. Bell Tel. Co. v. Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>555 So.2d 1370 (La. 1990). Thus, under <em>Jurisich, </em>\u201c[o]nce a plaintiff has made a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the conduct to be enjoined is reprobated by law, the petitioner is entitled to injunctive relief without the necessity of showing that no other adequate legal remedy exists.\u201d 99-0076, p. 4, 749 So.2d at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\">This jurisprudential rule, however, requires three findings by the court before a plaintiff can circumvent the irreparable harm requirement: first, that the conduct that is sought to be enjoined violates a prohibitory law (whether an ordinance or a statute or the constitution); second, that the injunction seeks to restrain conduct, not order it;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and third, that the petitioner has met the low burden of making a <em>prima facie </em>showing that he is entitled to the relief sought. <em>See</em> <em>Faubourg Marigny Imp. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, </em>15-1308, p. 15-16 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/25/16), 195 So.3d 606, 616-617.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">In this case, Construction Diva asserts that the City\u2019s rejection of its bid on the grounds that it did not have landscaping listed under its disadvantaged business certification resulted in an impermissible deviation from the bidding documents, none of which required the successful bidder to be certified as a landscaper on its disadvantaged business certification. The City\u2019s deviation, Contract Diva contends, violated the clear, prohibitory dictates of Louisiana\u2019s Public Bid Law, thus relieving it of the burden of proving irreparable harm. <em>See </em>La. R.S. 38:2212, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">Specifically, the Public Bid Law \u201cwas enacted with in the interest of the taxpaying citizens and has for its purpose their protection against contracts of public officials entered into because of favoritism and involving exorbitant and extortionate <em>prices.\u201d Enmon Enterprises, L.L.C. v. City of New Orleans ex rel. New Orleans Aviation Bd., </em>11-0459, p. 6 (La.App. 4 Cir. 9/28/11), 76 So.3d 548, 552, citing <em>Haughton Elevator Div. v. State, Div. of Admin., </em>367 So.2d 1161, 1164 (La. 1979). Louisiana\u2019s Public Bid Law provides that all public work contracts \u201cshall be advertised and let by contract to the lowest responsible bidder who had bid according to the contract, plans, and specifications as advertised.\u201d La. R.S. 38:2212 A(l)(a). It also mandates that \u201c[t]he provisions and requirements of this Section and those stated in the bidding documents shall not be waived by any entity.\u201d La. R.S. 38:2212 B(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">ImSince its initial passage, the Louisiana Legislature has repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>amended the law \u201cto narrow the ability of a public entity to waive aspects of the law or the bidding documents themselves as mere formalities or errors of form.\u201d <em>See Enmon Enterprises, </em>11-0459, p. 8, 76 So.3d at 553. The Louisiana Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized these restrictions on deviations from the public bidding laws. <em>See, e.g., Broadmoor L.L.C. v. Ernest N. Morial New Orleans Exhibition Hall Authority, </em>04-0211, 04-0211, p. 8 (La. 3/18/04), 867 So.2d 651, 657; <em>Hamps Construction, L.L.C. v. City of New Orleans, </em>05-0489, p. 9 (La. 2/22/06), 924 So.2d 104, 110. Therefore, \u201ca public entity cannot deviate in any manner from the requirements it sets forth in its bid documents and the requirements set forth in any aspect of the Public Bid Law.\u201d <em>Enmon Enterprises, </em>11-0459, p. 10, 76 So.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Having reviewed the record, however, we cannot say that the trial court was wrong in refusing to conclude that City deviated from the bid documents or violated the public bid law. The trial judge, therefore, did not abuse her discretion when she concluded that Construction Diva failed to establish entitlement to the jurisprudential exception to the irreparable harm requirement. Simply put, Construction Diva failed to establish that in rejecting its bid the City deviated from those requirements set out in the bidding documents. Construction Diva, therefore, failed to prove that the City\u2019s actions violated a prohibitory law, the first element of the exception. We first observe that the evidence indicates clearly that Construction Diva was never certified as a disadvantaged business in the area of | ^landscaping. As noted, Construction Diva applied for a disadvantaged business certification. On its application, Construction Diva described itself as a \u201cgeneral contractor.\u201d The application also required Construction Diva to identify the types of services and products it provided. It selected: 1) new single-family housing construction; 2) residential remodelers; 3) commercial and institutional building construction. Construction Diva also specified the types of general construction services it provided, and, when asked, indicated that it desired \u201cto become certified\u201d in \u201chazardous material &amp; asbestos abatement.\u201d On April 25, 2014, the City wrote to Construction Diva, noting that it had been \u201capproved for certification as a State &amp; Local Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (SLDBE) for the following categories: Building Construction (Commercial &amp; Institutional), Residential Remodeler, New Single Family Housing Construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">We next observe that the invitation to bid at issue clearly states that it is for \u201cAirport Property Landscaping Annual Maintenance.\u201d The Bid Specifications document, which was attached to the Invitation to Bid, indicates that the contract is for the \u201c[mjaintenance of landscape areas throughout the airport site on a full time basis, as well as installation of supplemental plant material,\u201d and then goes on to detail the manner in which the contractor is to, among other things, install new plants, remove old plants, replace annual plants, and maintain the grounds of several different properties in the municipal area owned by the Aviation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">The Invitation to Bid, therefore, indicated clearly that the project at hand was one for landscaping services. Equally clear is the fact that Construction Diva |12was not certified as a disadvantaged business in the area of landscaping at the time it submitted its bid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given the nature of the contract up for bid, and Construction Diva\u2019s lack of disadvantaged business certification in landscaping, we cannot say that the trial judge was wrong when she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>concluded that' the City did not deviate from the bid requirements in rejecting Construction Diva\u2019s bid. Construction Diva, therefore, did not establish that the City\u2019s rejection of its bid was a violation of a prohibitory law. Accordingly, it failed to meet its burden of proving entitlement to the irreparable harm exception. <em>See Faubourg Marigny Imp. Ass\u2019n, </em>15-1308, p. 20, 195 So.3d at 619. Further, the record shows clearly that Construction Diva offered no evidence of any other type of irreparable harm' at the hearing on its request for a preliminary injunction. The trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion when it denied Construction Diva\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">We next analyze Construction Diva\u2019s arguments with regards to the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant its request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">A writ of mandamus may be issued in all cases where the law provides no relief by ordinary means or where the delay involved in obtaining ordinary relief may cause injustice. <em>See </em>La. C.C.P. art. 3862. A writ of mandamus may be directed to a public officer to compel the performance of a ministerial duty required by law. <em>See </em>La. C.C.P. art. 3863. A \u201c \u2018ministerial duty<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is one in which | lsno element of discretion is left to the public officer, in other words, a simple, definite duty, arising under conditions admitted or proved to exist, and imposed by law.\u201d <em>Landis Const. Co., LLC v. Reg\u2019l Transit Auth., </em>15-0854, p. 10 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/25/16), 195 So.3d 598, 605, quoting <em>Newman Marchive P\u2019ship, Inc. v. City of Shreveport, </em>07-1890, p. 5 (La. 4/8/08), 979 So.2d 1262, 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is to be used sparingly. <em>Id., </em>00-1146, p. 11, 798 So.2d at 1175. A writ of mandamus, therefore, may not be issued to compel a public official to exercise discretionary authority. <em>Id., </em>p. 11, 798 So.2d at 1175-1176. It never issues in doubtful cases. <em>City of Hammond v. Parish of Tangipahoa, </em>07-0574, p. 11 (La.App. 1 Cir. 3/26/08), 985 So.2d 171, 181. Louisiana\u2019s jurisprudence, however, has shown that in the realm of public bid law, mandamus has been an appropriate remedy to award publicly bid contracts when the law requires. <em>See, e.g., Concrete Busters of Louisiana, Inc. v. The Board of Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans, </em>10-1172, p. 10 (La. App. 4 Cir. 2/2/11), 69 So.3d 484, 489-490.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">We review a trial court\u2019s decision to deny a request for a writ of mandamus under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See A.M.E. Disaster Recovery Services, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, </em>10-1755, p. 9 (La.App. 4 Cir. 8/24/11), 72 So.3d 454, 460.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cAn appellate court will grant a writ of mandamus only when there is a 1 usurpation of judicial power or clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Wallace C. Drennan, Inc. v. Sewerage &amp; Water Board of New Orleans, </em>00-1146, pp. 3-4 (La.App. 4 Cir. 10/3/01), 798 So.2d 1167, 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-12\">We now explain why Construction Diva failed to establish that a writ of mandamus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>should have been issued in this ease. The writ of mandamus, as noted, can only be issued against a public entity to compel the performance of a ministerial, non-discretionary, duty. Because we have concluded that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion when she denied Construction Diva\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction we must in this case affirm her denial of Construction Diva\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus. Simply put, in rejecting Construction Diva\u2019s claim, the trial judge concluded that the City complied with its clear ministerial duties by not deviating from the bid documents or the public bid law. Issuance of the writ under these circumstances would, in effect, compel the City to engage in an impermissible deviation from both the bid documents and the non-discretionary provisions of the public bid law and its interpretive jurisprudence. We, accordingly, conclude that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion when she denied Construction Diva\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">JjjDECREE</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment of March 14, 2016, which denied Construction Diva, .L.L.C.\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction and a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1101-18\">.

On March 15, 2016, Construction Diva filed a notice of intent to seek supervisory writs. The trial judge gave Construction Diva until April 8, 2016, to file its writ application with this Court. On March 21, 2016, however, Construction Diva filed a motion for suspensive appeal. The trial judge granted this motion and set the appeal bond at $175,000. Construction Diva, ultimately, chose not to file the bond or pursue its suspensive appeal. It, instead, elected to pursue its application for supervisory writs. On April 27, 2016, this Court granted Construction Diva\u2019s writ application \"for the sole purpose of remanding the matter to the trial court to consider the notice of intent as a motion for appeal and to promptly enter an order of appeal.\u201d <em>Construction Diva, L.L.C. v.

A petitioner is entitled to this exception only when the injunction sought is prohibitory, not mandatory. A prohibitory injunction is one that seeks to restrain conduct. <em>See Jurisich, </em>99-0076, p. 4, 749 So.2d at 599. A mandatory injunction, on the other hand, \"commands the doing of some action\u201d and \"cannot be issued without a hearing on the merits.\u201d <em>Concerned Citizens for Proper Planning, LLC v.

Although we reviewed a trial court\u2019s denial of a writ of mandamus under the manifest error standard in <em>Clothesline Laundromat, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, </em>11-1578, p. 1 (La.App. 4 Cir. 8/1/12), 98 So.3d 901, 902, we conclude that the abuse of discretion standard is the appropriate benchmark by which to review the judgment in this case. The judgment in <em>Clothesline, </em>unlike the one in the present case, turned upon a factual finding. Findings of fact regarding whether to issue a writ of mandamus are subject to the manifest error standard of review. <em>See Hess v. M &amp; C, Inc., </em>14-962, p. 3 (La.App. 3 Cir. 2/11/15), 157 So.3d 1200, 1203.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1108-7\">JENKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFb3\">DISSENTS WITH REASONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">hi respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the City did not violate the Public Bid Law when it rejected Construction Diva\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">Here, the City rejected Construction Diva\u2019s bid on the grounds that it was \u201cnon-responsive.\u201d According to the City:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq60\">Bidder failed to satisfy the SLDBE requirement. Construction Diva, LLC is not a. certified SLDBE in the area of landscaping. \u25a0 We are unable to count Construction Diva, LLC\u2019s participation toward the SLDBE goal. As such, the attainment is <em>0% </em>and does not comply with the SLDBE requirement for this project. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">After Construction Diva protested the rejection of its bid, the City stated that it was denying the bid protest because \u201cthe airport DBE rules do in fact require that a DBE firm be certified in the field of work or services to be provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-13\">Under Louisiana\u2019s Public Bid Law, contracts for public works projects exceeding $150,000 \u201cshall be advertised and let by contract to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder who ha[s] bid according to the bidding documents as advertised.\u201d La. R.S. 38:2212(A)(1) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201cprovisions and requirements\u201d in the bid documents and in La. R.S. 38:2212 \u201cshall not be waived by any entity.\u201d La. R.S. 38:2212(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-14\">|2The requirement that a bidder be \u201cresponsive\u201d in order to be awarded a public contract is a recent requirement added to the Public Bid Law during the 2014 legislative session. <em>See </em>2014 La. Acts 759. Although the terms \u201cresponsive\u201d and \u201cresponsive bidder\u201d are not defined by the statute, they generally refer to whether a particular bid or bidder complies with the bid law\u2019s statutory requirements and the requirements stated in ffhe bid documents as advertised by the public entity. <em>See </em>La. Atty. Gen. Op. No. 15-0052, 2015 WL 4128654 (June 3, 2015).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>Thus, to determine whether Construction Diva was the lowest \u201cresponsive bidder\u201d to whom the contract must be awarded, we must examine the requirements of the Public Bid law and those requirements set forth in the City\u2019s bid documents for this project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">As for the Public Bid Law, there are no provisions requiring that bidders be SLDBE-certified in the specific work set forth in the bid documents. Likewise, although the bid documents establish the City\u2019s commitment to participation by SLDBEs on this project,' nowhere in the bid documents is there a requirement that the successful bidder be SLDBE-certified in the field of landscaping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">The following bid documents refer to the City\u2019s SLDBE requirements for this contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-7\">\u2022 The \u201cInvitation to Bid\u201d (\u201cITB\u201d) states that \u201c[tjhere is a 40.00% SL/ DBE goal percentage for this contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-8\">\u2022 The \u201cAdditional Contract Terms and Conditions\u201d found as Attachment \u201cB\u201d to the ITB state that \u201c[i]t is the policy of the City and NOAB in conjunction with its State Local Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (SLDBE) program to encourage maximum utilization of firms, owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons. Firms participating as SLDBE firms must be currently listed as SLDE firms by one of the certifying agencies of the SLDBE program. The certifying agencies for the SLDBE program are the City of New Orleans (CNO), Sewerage &amp; Water | aBoard of New Orleans (S &amp; WB), New Orleans Aviation Board (NOAB), and Harrah\u2019s Jazz Casino.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-11\">\u2022 Attachment \u201cF\u201d to the ITB is the \u201cSchedule of Contract Participation,\u201d which states that \u201c[fjirms must be (AC)DBE- or SLDBE-certified at the time of bid submission in order to count their participation towards that specific goal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-12\">The bid 'documents, therefore, require only that a bidder seeking work under City\u2019s SLDBE program for airport contracts be DBE-certified by the City of New Orleans or the NOAB at the time of bid submission. It is undisputed that when Construction Diva submitted its bid for this contract, it was certified by the City of New Orleans as an SLDBE. Whether the airport has \u201crules\u201d in\u2019 place which require that \u201ca DB\u00c9 firm be certified in the field or work or services to be provided\u201d in order to meet its DBE goals is immaterial, given that these \u201crules\u201d are not included in the bid documents. I disagree with the majority\u2019s finding that the mere \u201cnature of the contract up for bid,\u201d which is described in the Invitation to Bid as \u201clandscaping services,\u201d mandates that all responsive bidders be SLDBE-certified in landscaping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-13\">The issue raised in this appeal implicates one of the important purposes of the Public Bid Law, which is to \u201cinsure fundamental fairness to the bidders in the [public bid] process by setting forth specific requirements' for \" particular bids.\u201d La. Atty. Gen. Op. No. 03-1401, 2003 WL 22683704 (Oct. 29, 2003). \u201cInherent in the bidding process is the requirement that the public body shall prescribe a common standard on all matters that are material to the proposals. To that end the interested person may bid intelligently and will be induced to bid by the promise of impartiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is in the best interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>taxpayers of Louisiana to award contracts in favor of a bidder such as Construction Diva who has complied with the bidding requirements in all respects. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">\u201cIn enacting the Public Bid Law, the legislature has specifically prescribed the conditions upon which it will permit work to be done on its behalf or on behalf 14of its political subdivisions.\u201d <em>Concrete Busters of Louisiana, Inc. v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs of Port of New Orleans, </em>10-1172, p. 4 (La.App. 4 Cir. 2/2/11), 69 So.3d 484, 486-87. Given the nature of the legislative mandate, a political entity such as the City \u201chas no authority to take any action which is inconsistent with the Public Bid Law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>10-1172 at pp. 4-5, 69 So.3d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">In this case, neither the bidding documents nor the bid laws require bidders to be SLDBE-certified in landscaping. <em>See Durr Heavy Constr., LLC v. City of New Orleans, </em>15-0915 (La.App. 4 Cir. 3/16/16), \u2014 So.3d \u2014, 2016 WL 1061384 (Jenkins, J., dissenting), <em>writ granted, </em>16-609 (La. 4/15/16), 189 So.3d 384 (finding bid responsive where bid documents did not require proposal number on outside of sealed bid envelope). Therefore, I find that the City was required by law to award the contract to Construction Diva, which was the. lowest numerical bidder whose bid complied with the requirements set forth in the bid documents and the Public Bid Law. Because I find that the City contravened the Public Bid Law by rejecting Construction Diva\u2019s responsive bid, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and order the City to award the landscaping contract to Construction Diva.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1108-10\">. \"Bidding documents\u201d are defined in the Public Bid Law as \"the bid notice, plans and specifications, bid form, bidding instructions, addenda, special provisions, and all other written instruments prepared by or on behalf of a public entity for use by prospective bidders.\u201d La.
