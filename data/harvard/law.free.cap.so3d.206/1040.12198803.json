The plaintiff, Marion Vincent, appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment affirming the revocations her certificate of public necessity and convenience (\u201cCPNC\u201d) and permit to operate a taxicab by the Director of the Department of Safety and Permits (\u201cthe Director\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-12\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">After Ms. Vincent began operating under her CPNC and permit, she received multiple notices of violations of the New Orleans City Code (\u201cthe City Code\u201d) from the Taxicab and For Hire Vehicles Bureau (\u201cthe Bureau\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-14\">\u2022 A notice dated October 20, 2014 for violating City Code Section 162-659 (\u201ccredit/debit card acceptance machines; alternative systems\u201d);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-15\">|\u215e* A notice dated June 1, 2015 for violating City Code Sections 162-659; 162-89 (\u201cpossession of valid permit\u201d); 162-446 (\u201cdriver\u2019s good conduct\u201d); and 162-380 (\u201ccriteria and regulation of inspection standards\u201d).

The notice stated these violations occurred on May 20, 2015 and that a hearing would be held on August 13, 2015.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">At the August 13, 2015 hearing, three witnesses\u2014Ms. Skinner<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Ms. Anderson, both investigators for the Bureau, and Ms. Vincent\u2014testified. Ms. Skinner testified that she issued Ms. Vincent a citation in 2014 for violating the credit/debit card machine requirement. Ms. Anderson testified that she issued Ms. Vincent the May 20, 2015 citation for multiple City Code violations. On August 19, 2015, the Bureau revoked Ms. Vincent\u2019s CPNC and permit due to violations of City Code Sections 162-89 (\u201cpossession of valid permit\u201d), 162-380 (\u201ccriteria and regulation of inspection standards\u201d), and 162-659 (\u201ccrediVdebit card acceptance machines; alternative systems\u201d). On September 18, 2015, Ms. Vincent filed a petition for judicial review and for injunctive relief in Orleans Parish Civil District Court (\u201cCDC\u201d). On December 22, 2015, she filed a separate Complaint for Injunction to prohibit the Director from revoking her CPNC and permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">|sOn January 6, 2016, following a hearing, the trial court denied Ms. Vincent\u2019s injunction. On January 12, 2016, the trial court heard Ms. Vincent\u2019s petition for the judicial review of the administrative adjudication. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court affirmed the Director\u2019s decision to revoke her CPNC and permit. The trial court stated that the Director\u2019s \u201cfinding was not arbitrary or capricious or characterized by an abuse of discretion or clearly a warranted exercise of its discretion.\u201d The trial court specifically noted that Ms. Vincent testified at the administrative hearing that she \u201cdid not use the VeriFone machine, as required, which shows a violation.\u201d Ms. Vincent appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">The Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) provides for review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>La. R.S. 49:964, This court summarized the standard of review under the APA in <em>Clark v. Louisiana State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>12-1049, pp. 9-10 (La.App. 4 Cir. 12/12/12), 104 So.3d 820, 826-27, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-11\">A party aggrieved by a final agency decision in an adjudication proceeding is entitled to have that decision reviewed initially by the district court of the parish in which the agency is located. La. R.S. 49:964(A)(1) and (B). The district court acts in the capacity of an intermediate appellate court. A party aggrieved by the district court\u2019s decision is entitled to appeal to the appropriate appellate court as in other civil cases. La. R.S. 49:965. When an appellate court reviews the district court\u2019s judgment, no deference is owed by the appellate court to the district court\u2019s fact findings or legal conclusions, \u201c\u2018just as no deference is owed by the Louisiana Supreme Court to factual findings or legal conclusions of the court of appeal. Thus, an appellate court sitting in review of an administrative agency reviews the findings and decision of the administrative agency and not the decision of the district court.\u2019\u201d <em>Bourgeois v. Louisiana State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>10-0573, p. 7 (La.App. 4 Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>11/12/10), 51 So.3d 851, 856 (quoting <em>Smith v.

Louisiana Bd. of Med. Examiners, </em>02-0906, p. 3 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/21/03), 850 So.2d 723, 726. The exclusive grounds upon which an administrative agency\u2019s decision may be reversed or modified on appeal are enumerated in La.

She claims that the evidence establishes that she complied with the City Code requirements to the extent possible given that the Bureau attempted to prevent her from remaining in compliance. She further contends that the revocations were excessive punishment and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-17\">Although Ms. Vincent raises several issues on appeal,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we organize our analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>around the following four issues: (i) driver\u2019s permit; (ii) inspection; (iii) credit/debit card system; and (iv) statutory requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\">1 <em>R(i) Driver\u2019s permit</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_An\">Vehicles for hire in the City of New Orleans are governed by Chapter 162 of the City Code. According to the City Code, the Director is authorized to suspend, for a period not exceeding ninety days, or to revoke a driver\u2019s permit and a CPNC. <em>See </em>City Code Sections 162-243(a), 162-248, and 162-249. A driver\u2019s permit or CPNC may be suspended or revoked when, after an administrative hearing, the director finds \u201cthat the holder of the permit or CPNC has failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter [Chapter 162].\u201d City Code Section 162-243(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">City Code Section 162-89 requires that a driver of a for hire vehicle shall carry a driver\u2019s permit at all times while operating the vehicle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 162-89 further provides that \u201c[f|or the purpose of this article, every permit which is under suspension or which has been revoked as provided in this chapter shall be considered invalid, unless and until the same is reinstated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">At the administrative hearing, Ms. Vincent testified that she was allowed to operate a taxicab based on a handwritten note on the side of an outstanding citation |7that stated \u201callowed to operate 2/26/15.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ms, Vincent further testified that although she timely applied to renew her driver\u2019s permit, the Bureau refused to release her permit until a decision was made on the October 2014 citation. Citing La. R.S. 49:961(B),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ms. Vincent contends that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>application for renewal of her CPNC and permit preserved her \u201clicensed status\u201d until the application was officially determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Ms. Anderson testified that when she approached Ms. Vincent\u2019s taxicab on May 20, 2015, Ms. Vincent was irate and refused to cooperate; Ms. Anderson had to call for assistance. Ms. Anderson acknowledged that Ms. Vincent presented the citation with the handwritten note but stated that Ms. Vincent lacked a valid permit. The record contains a photograph that depicts that her permit expired on February 22, 2015. The record also contains a receipt for the renewal of a driver\u2019s permit and a for-hire permit application both dated February 23, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">Given that Ms. Vincent applied for renewal of her permit the day after it expired, she did not submit a timely application as required by La. R.S. 49:961(B). The evidence thus supports a finding that Ms. Vincent lacked a valid driver\u2019s permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">| <em>n(ii) Inspection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">City Code Section 162-380(6)(i)(d) requires that \u201c[a]ll motor vehicles must have a current and valid safety inspection sticker (brake tag).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">At the administrative hearing, Ms. Anderson testified that on May 20, 2015, Ms. Vincent failed to have a valid inspection sticker. Ms. Anderson also identified photographs that she took of the taxiqab in question depicting the absence of an inspection sticker. Ms. Vincent testified that although it was not visible in Ms. Anderson\u2019s photograph, she had an inspection sticker inside the taxicab.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ms. Vincent testified that she paid the necessary fees, but due to a pending decision from a citation in October 2014, the Bureau withheld her CPNC, which prevented her from participating in an inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-11\">An inspection sheet in the record reveals that Ms. Vincent failed inspection on August 23, 2014, due to various issues with her taxicab and that she was required to return for re-inspection on September 7, 2014. Ms. Vincent subsequently appeared for re-inspection .and passed. The inspection sheet reveals that her driver\u2019s permit expired on February 22, 2015, and that her inspection sticker expired on March 20, 2015. The record further reflects that Ms. Vincent attempted to have her taxicab inspected on the day of the administrative hearing. According to the inspection sheet, Ms. Vincent was not allowed to operate her vehicle. On the inspection sheet, the following problems were listed: refusal to pay | delinquent fees, no valid permit, non-compliant credit card machine, and camera not connecting. The evidence thus supports a finding that Ms. Vincent did not have a valid inspection sticker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-14\">\n<em>(in) Credit/Debit Card System</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-15\">City Code Section 162-659(a) requires that \u201c[a]ll taxicabs shall be equipped with a bureau-approved and fully functioning credit/debit card acceptance machine.\u201d The City Code also requires that a passenger information monitor (PIM) to be installed in all taxicabs and connected directly to the taximeter via a hard wire. Section 162-659(a)(2). \u201cAny licensed CPNC holder may also petition the bureau for approval of any alternative credit/debit card acceptance systems. The Taxi Cab Bureau shall adopt rules establishing evaluation criteria for approval or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>denial; and procedures relative thereto.\u201d City Code Section 162-659(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">Ms. Vincent contends that the record is insufficient to support a finding that she failed to have the required credit/debit card system. She contends that Ms. Skinner issued a citation without observing the equipment in her taxicab. She further contends that although Ms. Anderson photographed the equipment, she failed to test whether it was working properly. Ms. Vincent contends that she passed inspection in September 2014; and that she maintained the required equipment in her taxicab at all times thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">At the administrative hearing, Ms. Skinner testified that a VeriFone representative advised the Bureau that Ms. Vincent was not using her credit/debit | lflcard machine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On cross-examination, Ms. Skinner testified that she did not speak to Veri-Fone regarding the 2014 violation; rather, Ms. Thibodeaux notified her. Ms. Skinner testified that she reviewed Ms. Vincent\u2019s VeriFone records before issuing the citation. Ms. Anderson also testified that Ms. Vincent failed to have a valid credit/debit card machine when Ms. Anderson issued the May 20, 2015 citation. Ms. Anderson identified photographs that she took of the taxicab in question depicting the lack of a proper credit/debit card machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Ms. Vincent testified that she had a credit card machine in her taxicab. She acknowledged that she used a handheld device that was not hardwired to her taxicab. On cross-examination, when asked about her credit card system, Ms. Vincent testified \u201cI don\u2019t use VeriFone, but I am not a cash cab. I am not a cash cab\u2014have never been\u2014-just an all cash cab.... I don\u2019t work with VeriFone and I\u2019m not going to incriminate myself. I plead the fifth on that.\u201d She also testified that she has maintained a credit card system with \u201cMerchant Accounts\u201d since around 1992.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> She further testified that she did not have a PIMs system, but she explained that the Bureau no longer gives monitoring systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">In Given her admission to failing to use a Bureau-approved credit/debit card system and a PIMs system, the reeord supports a finding that Ms. Vincent violated City Code.Section 162-659. The evidence thus supports a finding that Ms. Vincent failed to comply with the City Code. Accordingly, the Director\u2019s finding was not arbitrary or capricious. As noted earlier, the Director of the Department of Safety and Permits may revoke a driver\u2019s permit or CPNC if the holder has failed to comply with Chapter 162 of the City Code. Given Ms. Vincent\u2019s violations of the City Code, the Director did .not abuse his discretion by revoking Ms. Vincent\u2019s CPNC and permit. Ms. Vincent\u2019s assignments of error are thus without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">\n<em>(in) Statutory requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">Ms. Vincent contends that the revocations of her CPNC and permit should be reversed because the Bureau failed to follow certain statutory requirements. First, she contends that the Bureau violated La. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>R.S. 49:961(C) by failing to give her the opportunity to show compliance with lawful requirements.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In support she cites <em>Louisiana State Bd. of Medical Examiners v. Bertucci, </em>593 So.2d 798 (La. App. 4th Cir. 1992), in which this court reversed an agency\u2019s decision revoking a medical license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-3\">|iaIn <em>Bertucci, </em>we noted that \u201cit is apparent that [La. R.S. 49:961] Subsection (C) requires an additional step. That is, the agency must give the licensee an opportunity, prior to the institution of formal proceedings, to show that the actions complained of do not violate the law or agency rules.\u201d <em>Bertucci, </em>593 So.2d 798, 801 (footnote omitted). This court, however, also noted that the \u201cfailure to object constitutes a waiver of his right to the additional procedural step of R.S. 49:961(0).\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">In this case, Ms. Vincent did not object to the Bureau\u2019s failure to give her an opportunity to show compliance until the January 12, 2016 appeal hearing in CDC. She participated in the administrative hearing before the Director. Ms. Vincent also testified at the administrative hearing that she visited the Bureau\u2019s office nineteen times on a separate matter regarding the reissuance of her CPNC and five times regarding this matter. The record, however, is devoid of any evidence that Ms. Vincent attempted to show compliance at any of these visits. Furthermore, the record does not contain evidence that Ms. Vincent complied with the City Code | ^requirements regarding the driver\u2019s permit, inspection, and the credit/debit card machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">The other statutory requirement Ms. Vincent contends was violated is La. R.S. 49:994(A).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In support, she contends that Mr. Munster is not qualified to be an administrative law judge because he is neither licensed to practice law in Louisiana nor has he engaged in the practice of law for five years before his appointment as administrative law judge. Ms. Vincent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>however, fails to cite any authority in support of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">The City Code grants the Director of the Department of Safety and Permits the authority to \u201c[rjevoke, suspend, or cancel any permit which has been violated.\u201d Section 4-702(4). Furthermore, City Code Section 162-98(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-5\">The director of the department of safety and permits or a duly designated agent may deny or revoke the issuance of a driver\u2019s permit and/or a CPNC whenever... the director shall determine that the applicant or holder is in violation of this chapter. The director shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the provisions of R.S. 49:951 et seq.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\"><em>See also </em>Section 162-248(a) (noting that \u201c[t]he director shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the provisions of R.S. 49:951 et seq.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">When the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 was ratified, Home Rule Charters in effect remained in effect by virtue of La. Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under this 114constitutional provision, \u201call local governmental powers in effect under the home rule charters when the 1974 Constitution was adopted\u201d were retained. <em>Johnson v. Carter, </em>00-0029, p. 4 (La.App. 4 Cir. 6/28/00), 767 So.2d 790, 792 (citing <em>City of New Orleans v. Board of Comm\u2019rs of Orleans Levee Dist., </em>93-0690, p. 17 (La. 7/5/94), 640 So.2d 237, 248). This constitutional provision also grants pre-existing home rule charter cities the power to amend their charters, indicating that \u201cthose local governments may add powers and delete limitations upon their powers, except .as inconsistent with the 1974 Constitution.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>00-0029 at pp. 4-5, 767 So.2d at 792. According to the City Code, Mr. Munster has the authority to conduct administrative hearings regarding the revocation of permits and CPNCs. This assignment of error is thus without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">DECREE</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court affirming the Bureau\u2019s revocation of Ms. Vincent\u2019s CPNC and permit to operate a taxicab is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-13\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">.

Dr. Reaux did not object before the Board to the alleged lack of a \"961(c) meeting\" until shortly before the Board hearing, after the completion of substantial Board proceedings, at which point much of the apparent purpose of La.
