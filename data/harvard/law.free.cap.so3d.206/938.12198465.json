La. R.S. 9:2784 (prompt pay statute); La. R.S. 9:4814 (misapplication of funds statute).. Boes Iron Works, Inc. (\u201cBoes\u201d), the subcontractor, commenced this case against the following three related defendants: Gee Cee Group, Inc. (\u201cGee Cee Group\u201d); The Gee Cee Company of LA, Inc. (\u201cGee Cee LA\u201d); and Gibson Chigbu, the president of both Gee Cee Group and Gee Cee of LA (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d). Boes contends that Defendants are liable to it for failing to pay an amount due. Defendants responded by filing an exception of prescription, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Following a bench trial, the trial court found in Boes\u2019 favor on the principal amount due, awarded penalties under the prompt payment statute, denied penalties under the misapplication of funds statute, awarded legal interest from the date of judicial demand, and costs and attorneys\u2019 fees to be fixed at a later date. Following a subsequent hearing, the trial court awarded Boes $8,000.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees and | a$5,000.00 in costs. Both Boes and Defendants appealed. For the reasons that follow, we affirm. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">In 2001, Entergy contacted Gee Cee Group, a Louisiana commercial (nonresidential) construction company, regarding a project to repair and renovate Entergy\u2019s Gas Department Warehouse located on Perdido Street in New- Orleans, Louisiana (the \u201cProject\u201d). Entergy requested that Gee Cee Group present a proposal for the Project. To do so, Gee Cee Group contacted various subcontractors, including Boes, to obtain quotes to incorporate into its proposal. Entergy accepted Gee Cee Group\u2019s proposal. Thereafter, Gee Cee Group accepted Boes\u2019 quote to perform certain structural-steel and non work in connection with the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">On December 27, 2001, Boes completed its work on the Project and submitted two invoices to Gee Cee Group\u2014No. 026497 in the amount of $29,988.00; and No. 026498 in the amount of $3,332.00 (a total amount of $33,320.00) (the \u201cInvoices\u201d). The Invoices reflected that Boes, for internal record keeping and tracking purposes, assigned the Project the job number 1079. On the bottom of each invoice, in small print, was the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-10\">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided for herein, payment by the contractor and/or owner to Boes Iron Works, Inc. shall be due on or before the 20th day of the month following submission of invoices by Boes Iron Works, Inc. .Failure to pay said invoice(s) so submitted when due shall entitle Boes Iron Works, Inc. to recover from the contractor and/or owner interest at the rate of one and one-half (1 \u00bd) percent per month on the outstanding unpaid balance from due date until paid, all reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by Boes Iron Works, Inc. in connection with the collection with such past due balance, all in addition to the outstanding unpaid principle [sic] balance. Should job be discontinued, final billing shall not be determined by \u201cBill to Date\u201d amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">IsBased on the above language, the Invoices were due on January 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">At trial, Craig Boes, Boes\u2019 operations manager, testified that, while the Invoices state that the amounts were due on or before the 20th day following submission of the invoices, the contract between the parties for the Project included a \u201cpay-when-paid\u201d term.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on that term, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>the trial court noted, \u201cBoes expected payment from Mr. Chigbu once Entergy paid Mr. Chigbu for the work previous done by Boes.\u201d Thus, the payment due date hinged on the date that Entergy paid Gee Cee Group. The exact date on which Entergy paid Gee Cee Group, however, was never established at trial; instead, it was simply established that Entergy paid Gee Cee Group \u201csometime in 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">It is undisputed that Defendants made no payments to Boes for its work on the Project until 2010. As a result, in September 10, 2009, Mr. Boes\u2019 son, who was a manager of Boes, emailed Mr. Chigbu a copy of the Invoices, indicating a $33,320.00 outstanding balance. Sometime in April 2010, Mr. Boes and Mr. Chigbu met and discussed the Invoices. At this time, Mr. Boes and Mr. Chigbu had been doing business together for years and were personal friends. Mr. Boes testified that had Mr. Chigbu not personally guaranteed payment of the Invoices, Boes would have immediately filed suit in 2010. Mr. Boes also testified that.-he Lwas unaware at the time of his April 2010 meeting with, Mr. Chigbu of- the distinction between Gee Cee Group and Gee Cee LA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">On May 11, 2010, Mr. Chigbu sent a follow-up email to Mr. Boes, stating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai4p\">As I said while I visited last time, I would be back with you soon and it may take until Monday May 10 to get back with you. Sorry, it has taken a day more. I will send you a $5,000.00 check towards that account and will pay intermittent payments until all amount[s] are paid within the next 36 months or we are able to negotiate a one time or twice p\u00e1yoff amount. Got to figure out where and how to place this bill. Anyway, thanks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">On June 16, 2010, Gee Cee LA issued a check in the amount of $5,000.00; and, on September 3, 2010, Ge\u00e9 Cee LA issued a second check in the amount of $11,500.00. On both of the checks, .it was noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>the payments were being made to Boes for its Job No. 1079, which was the number that Boes assigned to the Entergy project. On June 7, 2011, Mr. Boes\u2019 son again emailed Gee Cee LA, through Mr. Chigbu, an invoice on Job No. 1079 for the remaining balance due of $16,820.00. No interest calculation was included on that invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">On November 28, 2012, Mr. Boes\u2019 son faxed an invoice to Gee Cee LA showing a balance of $82,739.80. This amount included not only the remaining | .\u00a1balance due of $16,820.00, but also interest calculated at 1\u215c% per month (18% per annum) (the rate set forth on the Invoices).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 27, 2012, Boes\u2019 attorney sent a formal written demand to Gee Cee Group setting forth the same amount due of $82,739.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">On February 19, 2013, Boes filed this suit against Defendants. In response, Defendants filed various exceptions, including a peremptory exception of prescription. On February 5, 2014, an evidentiary hearing was held on the prescription exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following the hearing, the trial court denied the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">On October 12, 2015, a bench trial was held in this matter. At trial, two witnesses testified\u2014Mr. Chigbu and Mr. Boes. Following trial, the trial court ruled in Boes\u2019 favor. In its written reasons for judgment, the trial court recapped its prior findings in denying Defendants\u2019 prescription exception as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-7\">This Court previously found that the April 2010 meeting and subsequent May 11, 2010 email from Mr. Chigbu served as a new promise by Gee Cee Company of LA to pay the debt of the closed Gee Cee Group, Inc. This Court previously found that Mr. Chigbu\u2019s meeting in April 2010 with Mr. Boes and Mr. Chig-bu\u2019s follow up email on May 11, 2010 served to interrupt prescription and essentially acknowledged or guaranteed payment of a debt owed. Further, Mr. Chigbu, on behalf of Gee Cee Group of LA, issued two payments totaling $16,500.00 for Boes\u2019 Job No. 1079. In the Court\u2019s April 4, 2015 judgment, this Court found that Mr. Chigbu, on behalf of the new company, Gee Cee Group of LA, had a pecuniary interest (and thus received a benefit) by making a new agreement and promising to pay the debt of his former company. Gee Cee Group, in light of his continued business relationship with Boes Iron Works.\u00ae</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">| BGiven those findings, the trial court summarized the remaining issues before it at trial as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-13\">1. Whether Mr. Boes contracted with Gee Cee Group or with Gee Cee LA, and whether Gee Cee LA was merely an alter ego of Gee Cee Group;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-14\">2. The terms of the April 2010 agreement between Mr. Chigbu and Mr. Boes regarding the debt, including whether the language in the Invoices entitled Boes to one and one half percent per month on outstanding un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>paid balances not paid by the due date was binding on Mr. Chigbu; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-5\">3. Whether Boes is entitled to penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">As to the alter ego issue, the trial court found that Gee Cee LA was an alter ego or a mere continuation of Gee Cee Group and thus responsible for its debts. As to the terms of the new April 2010 agreement, the trial court found that Defendants continued to owe Boes for the remaining unpaid balance of $16,820.00 and that \u201cit is clear that Boes is entitled to collect interest on the remaining unpaid balance.\u201d Finally, as to penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs, the trial court found that Boes was entitled to penalties under the prompt pay statute, La. R.S. 9:2784, but not under the misapplication of funds statute, La. R.S. 9:4814. The trial court thus rendered judgment in Boes\u2019 favor for the principal sum of $16,820.00, penalties of $4,998.00, and judicial interest as provided for by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">Following a separate hearing on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, the trial court rendered judgment awarding Boes $8,000.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees, $6,161.81 in costs, and legal interest on said amounts as provided by law. From the trial court\u2019s rulings, both Boes<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Defendants<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">JtDISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">For ease of discussion, we divide our analysis of the issues presented by the parties into the following eight categories: (i) standard of review; (ii) alter ego or continuation doctrine; (iii) open account versus contract claim; (iv) detrimental reliance claim; (v) prompt pay claim; (vi) misapplication of funds claim; (vii) interest; and (viii) attorneys\u2019 fees. We separately address each category</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>\n<em>Standard of review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Three different standards of review are applicable here\u2014abuse of discretion, manifest error, and de novo. An abuse of discretion standard applies to the attorneys\u2019 fees award issue. The jurisprudence has recognized that \u201c[t]he trial court |8is vested with great discretion in arriving at an award of attorney fees. The exercise of this discretion will not be reversed on appeal without a showing of clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Troth Corp. v. Deutsch, Kerri-gan &amp; Stiles, L.L.P., </em>06-0457, p. 3 (La. App. 4 Cir. 1/24/07), 951 So.2d 1162, 1165 (citing <em>Kem Search, Inc, v, Sheffield, </em>434 So.2d 1067,1070 (La. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">To the extent the issues presented on appeal involve fact questions or mixed questions of law and fact, the manifest error applies. To the extent the issues involve questions of law, the <em>de novo </em>standard applies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Summarizing the manifest error and <em>de novo </em>standards, this court noted in <em>Bates v. City of New Orleans, </em>13-1153,13-1587 (La. App. 4 Cir. 3/26/14), 137 So.3d 774, 780, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-6\">This court reviews a trial court\u2019s factual findings under a manifest error standard. The manifest error standard is one \u201cof great deference to the factual findings of the trier of fact.\u201d 1 Frank L. Maraist &amp; Harry T. Lemmon, La. Civ. L. Treatise, CIVIL PROCEDURE \u00a7 14:14 (1999). The phrase \u201cmanifestly erroneous,\u201d in its simplest terms, means \u201cclearly wrong.\u201d Id. (citing <em>Arceneaux v. Domingue, </em>365 So.2d 1330, 1333 (La. 1978)). \u201cMixed questions of law and fact are also reviewed under the manifest error standard.\u201d <em>Jones v. Capitol Enterprises, Inc., </em>11-0956, pp. 10-11 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/9/12), 89 So.3d 474, 483, <em>unit denied, </em>12-1634 (La. 10/26/12), 99 So.3d 651 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-9\">Pure questions of law are reviewed under a <em>de novo </em>standard \u201cwithout deference to the legal conclusions of the courts below.\u201d <em>Durio v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., </em>11-0084, p. 14 (La. 10/25/11), 74 So.3d 1159, 1168; <em>see also Burnette v, Stalder, </em>00-2167, p. 5 (La. 6/29/01), 789 So.2d 573, 577 (noting that a <em>de novo </em>review standard applies to issues of statutory construction); <em>Henderson v. Bige-low, </em>07-1441, p. 8 (La.App. 4 Cir. 4/9/08), 982 So.2d 941, 946. As to ^questions of law, \u201cthe standard of review of an appellate court is simply whether the court\u2019s interpretive decision is legally correct.\u201d <em>Ohm Lounge, L.L.C. v. Royal St. Charles Hotel, L.L.C., </em>10-1303, p. 4 (La. App. 4 Cir. 9/21/11), 75 So.3d 471, 474 (citing <em>Glass v. Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, </em>02-0412, p. 3 (La.App. 4 Cir. 11/6/02), 832 So.2d 403, 405).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">\n<em>Alter ego or continuation doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEN\">Defendants contend that the trial court legally erred in applying the continuation doctrine to find that Gee Cee Company LA was responsible for Gee Cee Group\u2019s debt given that a threshold requirement for applying the doctrine was not met. Defendants cite this court\u2019s holding in <em>Pich\u00f3n v. Asbestos Defendants, </em>10-0570, p. 6 (La.App. 4 Cir. 11/17/10), 52 So.3d 240, 244, that \u201c[a] threshold require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>ment to trigger a determination of whether successor liability is applicable under the \u2018continuation\u2019 exception is that one corporation must have purchased \u2018all\u2019 the assets of another.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendants note that it is undisputed no asset transfer occurred between Gee Cee Group and Gee Cee LA..<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Boes counters that an asset transfer is not absolutely required for Gee Cee LA to be found responsible for Gee Cee Group\u2019s debt to Boes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">|inThe trial court, agreeing with Boes,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> found that \u201cwhile Boes actually contracted with Gee Cee Group, Inc. and not Gee Cee Company of LA, Gee Cee Company of LA was merely a continuation of the old corporation and thus responsible for the debts and obligation of Gee Cee Group, Inc.\u201d In support, the trial court quoted this court\u2019s statement in <em>Biller v. Snug Harbor Jazz Bistro of Louisiana, L.L.C., </em>11-1784, p. 4 (La.App. 4 Cir. 9/5/12), 99 So.3d 730, 732, that \u201c[i]n <em>Wolff [v. Shreveport Gas, Electric Light &amp; Power Co., </em>138 La. 743, 759, 70 So. 789, 794 (1916)], the Louisiana Supreme Court held that a newly organized corporation would be liable as the successor of the old ... when the circumstances attending the creation of the new and its succession to the business and property of the old were of such a character as to warrant a finding the new corporation was merely a continuation of the old.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">In further support, the trial court cited the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-9\">Both Gee Cee Group, Inc. and Gee Cee Company of LA, Inc. were in existence from 1997 and 2006, at which time Gee Cee Group, Inc., was abandoned after Hurricane Katrina. At trial, Mr. Chigbu testified that they were two separate companies, but had the same mailing address, same phone and fax numbers and he served as the president of both. Mr. Chigbu testified that Gee Cee Group, Inc., was almost bankrupted because one of his clients, Harrah\u2019s Casino, filed for bankruptcy, causing financial hardship for Gee Cee Group, Inc. As a result, Mr. Chigbu no longer conducted business under that company anymore, but he formed Gee Cee Company of LA instead. Mr. Chigbu testified that Gee Cee Group, Inc., was already the approved vendor with Entergy when the job at issue [the Project] was awarded so he did not correct them to change it to Gee Cee Company because Gee Cee Group, Inc, was already on their approved list.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">We agree with Defendants that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the continuation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>doctrine is misplaced; the threshold requirement of an asset transfer is lacking here. <em>\\nPichon, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nonetheless, we find the single business enterprise doctrine (\u201cSBE\u201d)\u2014another veil piercing doctrine\u2014 applies and dictates the same legal result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Generally, the determination of whether the SBE doctrine applies is a question of fact for the trial court to decide. <em>Grayson v. R.B. Ammon &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>99-2597, pp. 20-21 (La.App. 1 Cir. 11/3/00), 778 So.2d 1, 15 (citing <em>Brorni v. Automotive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>93-2169, p. 8 (La.App. 1 Cir. 10/7/94), 644 So.2d 723, 728). Here, however, the trial court applied a different doctrine and thus did not apply the SBE doctrine. For this reason, we review this issue <em>de novo. Dishon v. Pon-thie, </em>05-659, p. 6 (La.App. 3 Cir. 12/30/05), 918 So.2d 1132, 1136 (noting that \u201c[a]s the trial court did not apply it [the SBE doctrine], we will perform a de novo review on this issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Simply stated, the SBE doctrine is invoked \u201cto break down corporate walls between affiliated corporations.\u201d Glenn G. Morris and Wendell H. Holmes, 8 La. Civ. L. Treatise, BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS \u00a7 32.15 (2016). The SBE applies when a corporation is found to be the \u201calter ego, agent, tool or instrumentality of another corporation.\u201d <em>Green v. Champion Ins. Co., </em>577 So.2d 249, 257 (La. App. 1st Cir. 1991). In <em>Green, </em>the First Circuit Court of Appeal adopted the SBE doctrine<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and enumerated a non-exclusive, eighteen-factor test to determine 11 \u00bfwhether a group of affiliated entities constitutes a SBE (the <em>\u201cGreen </em>factors\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The <em>Green </em>factors examine the substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>of the corporation\u2019s structure, as opposed to its form, to determine whether a group of affiliated entities constitutes a SBE. <em>Green, </em>577 So.2d at 257. The <em>Green </em>factors are similar to factors that have been used in Louisiana \u201cpiercing the veil\u201d cases. <em>Green, </em>577 So.2d at 258; <em>see also In re Gulf Fleet Holdings, Inc., </em>491 B.R. 747, 787 (Bankr. W.D. La. 2013) (noting that the SBE doctrine is \u201cgrounded on the same policies and doctrinal underpinnings as traditional veil-piercing theories such as the alter ego doctrine.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">| ^Considering the <em>Green </em>factors, which we note are substantially similar to those considered in applying the continuation doctrine,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we find that Gee Cee Group and Gee Cee LA are a SBE. In so finding, we note that equity, not fraud, dictates the application of the SBE doctrine here.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s finding that Gee Cee LA is liable for Gee Cee Group\u2019s debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">\n<em>Open account versus contract claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">As part of their exception of prescription, Defendants argued that Boes\u2019 claim is not based upon contract, subject to a ten-year prescriptive period, but based upon an open account, subject to a three-year prescriptive period.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On appeal, Defendants dispute not only the trial court\u2019s determination that the parties\u2019 relationship was contractual, but also the trial court\u2019s related determination that Mr. Chigbu acknowledged Gee Cee Group\u2019s debt to Boes, which started the ten-year prescription period anew in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-22\">| uAccording to Defendants, the relationship between Mr. Boes\u2019 and Mr. Chigbu\u2019s respective companies was sometimes contractual\u2014when there was a formal bid process, and a written subcontract\u2014and sometimes based on open account. Defendants\u2019 contends that the relationship, between the parties on the Project was based on an open account. Defendants emphasize that the Invoices were the only available written documentation the parties were able to produce regarding their relationship on the Project.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Defendants contend that the Invoices established an open account relationship, that Boes\u2019 cause of action on an open account has prescribed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>and that its cause of action could not be acknowledged by Mr. Chigbu in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">The issue of whether the relationship between the parties was based upon contract, as opposed to an opien account, presents a question of fact subject to a manifest error standard of review. Resolving the issue in Boes\u2019 favor, the trial court noted that there was a long-standing working relationship between the heads of both entities\u2014Mr. Chigbu and Mr. Boes. The trial court found Mr. Boes\u2019 testimony regarding the customary procedure the entities employed in entering into contracts for jobs to'be credible and that the parties used that customary procedure on the Project.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The trial court thus found there was valid contract between Gee |1fiCee Group and Boes. Under that original contract, Boes was to' provide iron work for the Project in exchange for a total payment' of $33,320.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Regardless, Defendants contend that Mr. Chigbu neither acknowledged nor promised to pay Gee Cee Group\u2019s debt to Boes. According to Defendants, Mr. Chig-bu\u2019s May 11, 2010 email was, at best, \u201ca new offer to pay and a new agreement;\u201d it was not an acknowledgement. Defendants point out that Mr. Chigbu testified he believed he and Mr. Boes reached a new agreement at their April 2010 meeting. Under that new agreement, Gee Cee LA would pay the face amount of the Invoices (a total of $33,000.00) within thirty-six months (three years). Defendants contend that Mr. Boes repudiated that understanding and denied that there was a new agreement between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">The trial court found that the April 2010 meeting between Mr. Boes and Mr. Chigbu, coupled with Mr. Chigbu\u2019s May 11, 2010 email and the checks subsequently issued through Gee Gee LA to Boes, constituted both an acknowledgement of the underlying debt sufficient to interrupt prescription and a new agreement to pay the remaining debt. The trial court noted that both the checks indicated that they were payments for Boes\u2019 Job No. 1079. The trial court thus concluded that \u201cMr. Chigbu, on behalf of [Gee Cee LA] ... had a pecuniary interest (and thus received a benefit)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> by making a new agreement and thus |1fipromising to pay the debts of his former company, Gee Cee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>Group, in light of his continued business relationship with Boes Iron Works as president of Gee Cee Company of LA.\u201d We find no manifest error in the trial court\u2019s findings. Moreover, as we determined above, Gee Cee Group and Gee Cee LA are a SBE; thus, Gee Cee LA is responsible for Gee Cee Group\u2019s debts and obligations for that reason as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">\n<em>Detrimental reliance claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1tl\">On appeal, Defendants raise a detrimental reliance claim.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To prevail on a detrimental reliance claim, a party must establish the following three elements: (i) a representation by conduct or word; (ii) justifiable reliance; and (iii) a change in position to one\u2019s detriment because of the reliance. <em>Louisiana Office of Risk Mgmt. v. Richard, </em>13-0890, p. 5 (La. 10/15/13), 125 So.3d 398, 402 (citing <em>Suire v. Lafayette City-Parish Consol. Government, </em>04-1459, p. 31 (La. 4/12/05), 907 So.2d 37, 59); <em>see </em>La. C.C. art. 1967.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The theory of detrimental reliance is intended to prevent injustice by precluding parties from taking a contrary position to their prior acts, admissions, representations, or silence. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, the 117Louisiana Supreme has cautioned that \u201cit is difficult to recover under the theory of detrimental reliance, because estoppel is not favored in Louisiana law.\u201d <em>Louisiana Office of Risk Mgmt., supra </em>(citing <em>Doss v. Cuevas, </em>07-1803, p. 4 (La.App. 1 Cir. 3/26/08), 985 So.2d 740, 743; <em>May v. Harris Management Corp., </em>04-2657, p. 6 (La.App. 1 Cir. 12/22/05), 928 So.2d 140,145).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">Defendants contend that all three elements necessary to give rise to detrimental reliance are present. According to Defendants, the three elements are satisfied for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-10\">\u2022 <em>Representation by conduct or </em>word\u2014Defendants contend that Mr. Boes\u2019 actions led Mr. Chigbu to believe they reached a new agreement at their April 2010 meeting. Although this new agreement was never memorialized in writing, Mr. Chigbu sent an email which served as a follow up. In addition, when Mr. Chigbu received new invoices after sending the first checks and saw that the balance due had been reduced in accordance with the new agreement he believed was made, he was entitled to believe that the amount due was what was reflected on the new invoices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-11\">\u2022 <em>Justifiable\u25a0 </em>reliance\u2014Assuming there was no new agreement, Boes, by depositing the \u2022 checks, reducing the balance due, and remaining silent when Mr. Chigbu mentioned a thir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>ty-sbc months\u2019 term in his email, conducted itself in such a way as to lead Mr. Chigbu reasonably to believe that there was such an agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-4\">\u2022 <em>A change in position to one\u2019s detriment because of the </em>reliance\u2014Mr. Chigbu would never have made any payments to Boes if he had known that Boes would claim thousands of dollars of interest. The only reason why Gee Gee LA made any payment to Boes was because Mr. Chigbu believed there was an agreement to pay only the face amount of the Invoices. Defendants thus contend that the payments they made were of a thing not due by Gee Cee LA, an entity not liable in any way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Boes counters that Defendants\u2019 detrimental reliance claim is based on Defendants\u2019 mistaken belief that during the parties\u2019 April 2010 meeting a new agreement was reached whereby Boes, without any financial consideration, agreed to waive interest and attorneys\u2019 fees under the Invoices and to provide Defendants 118an additional thirty-six months (three years) to pay the Invoices. Boes notes that Mr. Boes testified at trial that he did not make any such new agreement and that Mr. Chigbu testified to the contrary. Boes contends that the trial court weighed the testimony and obviously determined that no such agreement with those terms had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">The jurisprudence has recognized that \u201cdetrimental reliance usually comes into play when no written contract exists or the contract is found to be unenforceable.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Lare, </em>34,124, p. 7, n. 1 (La.App. 2 Cir. 11/1/00), 779 So.2d 808, 814. Such is not the case here. The trial court found there was both an original agreement and an enforceable new agreement entered into between the parties in April 2010 for Defendants to pay the remaining outstanding balance of $16,820.00 for the Project. The trial court, however, did not accept all of either party\u2019s position regarding the terms of the new agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">As the trial court noted, Mr. Boes testified at trial that \u201che never agreed to a thirty-six month term to pay the remaining debt at the April 2010 meeting with Mr. Chigbu;\u201d the trial court implicitly accepted Boes\u2019 position on that point. The trial court, however, rejected Boes\u2019 position that the 1\u215c % per month interest reflected on the Invoices applied; the trial court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-11\">Conflicting testimony was offered regarding the terms of the plan to repay the debt, and Boes failed to establish whether the parties agreed on any particular interest rate to be charged for the remaining debt. While Boes argued that it was owed 1.5 percent interest per month on the remaining balance due, Mr. Chigbu argued that he never agreed to that condition, nor signed anything agreeing to that amount. As late as 2011, the invoices sent from Boes to Gee Cee Group, Inc. contained no charges for interest. However, it is clear that Boes is entitled to collect interest on the remaining unpaid balance. As the 119amount of interest was not contractually agreed upon, Boes is entitled to judicial interest from the date of judicial demand.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvZ\">Given there is an enforceable contract, we find Defendants\u2019 detrimental reliance claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">\n<em>Prompt pay claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">Defendants contend the trial court erred in awarding penalties to Boes under the prompt pay statute, La. R.S. 9:2784.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>In making that award, the trial court noted that Mr. Chigbu admitted he was paid by Entergy for the work Boes performed sometime in 2003 and that he placed the funds in the company\u2019s general accounts, which was his standard practice. He, however, acknowledged that he failed to subsequently pay Boes. The trial court thus found Boes was entitled to a penalty under the prompt pay statute not to exceed fifteen percent of the outstanding balance owed, which the court calculated as $4,998.00\u2014fifteen percent of the original balance owed in 2003 of $33,320.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">On appeal, Defendants concede a violation of the prompt pay statute; however, they contend, as they did in the trial court,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> that Boes\u2019 prompt pay claim |2\u00bb\u215b prescribed. The prompt pay statute, R.S. 9:2784, contains no prescriptive period. Defendants argue that the one case considering whether a prompt pay claim was prescribed applied a one-year prescriptive period and held that prescription would run no later than two years from the date on which payment was received. <em>Specialty Construction, LLC v. Jim Meyers Const. Co., LLP., </em>10-1378 (La.App. 1 Cir. 2/11/11) <em>(unpub.), </em>2011 WL 846119.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Specialty Construction, </em>as Boes contends, is misplaced. In <em>Specialty Construction, </em>the appellate court expressly noted that the only issue before it was \u201cwhether the trial court erred in finding that the one-year period set forth in La. R.S. 9:4823(A)(2) for filing a lawsuit to enforce a claim and privilege granted by the Private Works Act begins to run on the date a statement of claim and privilege is filed into the mortgage records.\u201d 2011 WL 846119 at p,*2. <em>Specialty Construction </em>thus neither addressed nor held that actions filed pursuant to Louisiana\u2019s prompt pay statute, La, R.S. 9:2784, are subject to a one or two-year prescriptive period. Rather, the focus in <em>Specialty Construction </em>was the calculation of the deadline for filing suit to enforce a claim and privilege granted by the Private Works Act. As Boes points out, it did not file, and certainly did not sue to enforce, a Private Works Act claim. <em>Specialty Construction </em>is thus inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Given the Legislature failed to include a specific prescriptive period in La. R.S. 9:2784, Boes\u2019 prompt pay claim is subject to the ten year prescriptive period for personal actions under La. C.C. art. 3499.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The date on which the ten year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>prescriptive period commenced to run on Boes\u2019 prompt pay claim was fourteen 121 days after the date on which Gee Cee Group received payment from Entergy for the work. <em>See </em>La. R.S. 9:2784 C (providing that the prompt pay claims is based on the failure to pay fourteen days after the date \u201cof the receipt of payment from the owner for improvements to an immovable\u201d)- The date on which Entergy paid Gee Cee Group is not identified in Boes\u2019 petition. Boes\u2019 petition thus is not prescribed on its face. Defendants, as the parties raising the prescription exception, thus had the burden of proving the claim was prescribed.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\">At trial, the date on which Enter-gy paid Gee Cee Group for its work on the Project was never established; at best, it was established that Entergy paid Gee Cee Group \u201csometime in 2003.\u201d Given Boes\u2019 petition was filed in 2013 (on February 19, 2013), it cannot be said that Boes\u2019 petition is prescribed under the applicable ten year prescriptive period. Moreover, prescriptive periods are strictly construed against prescription and in favor of the obligation sought to be extinguished. <em>See Dugas v. Thompson, </em>11-0178, p. 4 (La. App. 4 Cir. 6/29/11), 71 So.3d 1059, 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Summarizing, we find the trial court did not err in awarding Boes penalties under the prompt pay statute. Moreover, we find that the prompt pay statute forms the basis for both the trial court\u2019s penalty award of $4,998.00 and its attorneys\u2019 fee award of $8,000.00 to Boes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">\n<em>Misapplication of funds claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">IggBoes contends that the trial court erred in rejecting its claim for penalties under the misapplication of funds statute, La. R.S. 9:4814.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Rejecting Boes\u2019 request for penalties under that statute, the trial court reasoned that it did \u201cnot find that the plaintiff proved at trial that Mr. Chigbu knowingly misapplied the funds owed to Boes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">On appeal, Boes contends that because Mr. Chigbu admitted that Gee Cee Group deposited Entergy\u2019s payments for Boes\u2019 work into its operating account and that it paid other business-related expenses instead of Boes, the trial court erred in failing to award penalties under the misapplication of funds statute. Noting the lack of jurisprudence interpreting the civil misapplication of funds statute, Boes cites in support of its contention a case construing the criminal misapplication of funds statute, La. R.S. 14:202.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>State v. Cohn, </em>00-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>0313 (La. 4/3/01), 783 So.2d 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">In <em>Cohn, </em>the defendant-contractor was convicted of criminal misapplication of funds, which the appellate court reversed. The Supreme Court granted the State\u2019s writ and reinstated the defendant\u2019s conviction. In so doing, the Supreme Court reasoned that the direct evidence in the record established that, the defendant I ^knowingly misapplied the funds.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Construing the criminal misapplication of funds statute, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzW7\">[T]he statute requires more than simply proof that a contractor has left unpaid claims for materials and labor at the end of a construction contract. The statute clearly does not criminalize a bad business deal made by a contractor who otherwise applies all of the funds received under the contract for legitimate expenses and claims for materials and labor in the course of the project, although he cannot pay all of them because, for one reason or another, the project has exceeded its estimated' costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-Iy\"><em>Cohn, </em>00-0313, p. 8, 783 So.2d at 1275-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Contrary to Boes\u2019 contention, the facts in this case are distinguishable from those in <em>Cohn. </em>Here, no direct evidence of a knowing misapplication of funds was presented. To the contrary, the only evidence in the record supporting Boes\u2019 misapplication of funds claim is Mr. Chigbu\u2019s testimony that his standard practice was to deposit funds into the general account and to use such funds to pay business-related expenses. The evidence presented in this case does not exclude the possibility that this was simply a- \u201cbad business deal.\u201d <em>Cohn, supra. </em>Boes\u2019 reliance on <em>Cohn </em>is thus misplaced. We thus find no error in the trial court\u2019s finding that Boes failed to prove Mr. Chigbu knowingly misapplied the funds owed to Boes. b/Thus, we find Boes\u2019 contention that it was entitled to penalties under La. R.S. 9:4814 is unpersuasive. \u2022 ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">\n<em>\u25a0Interest issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">Boes contends that the trial court erred in awarding interest from the date of judicial demand; it contends that it is entitled to interest on the amounts due and owing from the time the debts became due pursuant to La. C.C. art. 2000.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Boes also points out that the jurisprudence has held that contractors are entitled to interest from the date of substantial completion or when payment was du\u00e9 until paid, not from the date of judicial demand. <em>See ED AW, Inc. v.New Orleans East, Inc., </em>528 So.2d 168 (La. App. 4th Cir.-1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">In its written reasons, the trial court cited <em>Alexander v. Burroughs Corp., </em>359 So.2d 607, 613 (La. 1978), for the proposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>tion that Boes was only entitled to interest from the date of judicial demand. Quoting <em>Alexandria, the </em>trial court stated that \u201c \u2018all sums due on contracts bear interest from judicial demand, even where none has been stipulated, and the demand is unliquidated.\u2019\u201d 359 So.2d at 613 (quoting <em>Sullivan v. Williams, </em>2 La.Ann. 876, 878 (1947)). Given that the <em>Alexander </em>case was decided before La. C.C. art. 2000 was enacted, Boes contends the trial court\u2019s reliance on that case was misplaced. Because we find the trial court did not err in awarding interest from the date of judicial demand for a different reason, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>Alexander </em>was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">|2sAlthough the general rule in breach of contract cases is that judicial interest runs from the date of breach, the Louisiana Supreme Court recognized an exception to this rule in <em>Trans-Global Alloy Limited v. First National Bank of Jefferson Parish, </em>583 So.2d 443 (La. 1991), for \u201chighly complicated\u201d cases. The Supreme Court distinguished the simple ease in which the amount owed was both due and easily ascertainable on the date from which interest was awarded from the complicated case before it in which \u201cthree courts ... had difficulty in determining whether there was a breach meriting compensation, and what the consequential damages of that breach should be.\u201d <em>Trans-Global, 583 </em>So.2d at 459. The Supreme Court held that in such a \u201chighly complicated\u201d case interest runs from the date of judicial demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Invoking the \u201chighly complicated\u201d case exception, the court in <em>Ashy v. Trotter, </em>04-612, p. 21 (La.App. 3 Cir. 11/10/04), 888 So.2d 344, 357, reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-6\">While it is generally true that judicial interest should accumulate from the date of breach in contract cases, as opposed to the date of judicial demand, the supreme court in <em>Trans-Global Alloy ... </em>held that in \u201chighly complicated\u201d cases where the issues are whether a breach has occurred and the appropriate damage amount, it is appropriate to award interest from the date of judicial demand. We find this case falls into the \u201chighly complicated\u201d category. It involves issues of whether a contract even existed and to what extent the contract terms extended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">As in <em>Ashy, </em>we find this case falls into the \u201chighly complicated\u201d category. Complicating factors in this case included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-9\">\u2022 This is not a simple case in which the plaintiff is seeking to recover an undisputed amount due from a debtor as of a particular date. At trial, Mr. Boes acknowledged that the original agreement between the parties included a \u201cpay-when-paid\u201d term. The exact date on which Entergy paid Gee Cee Company was never established at trial. At best, it was established this occurred \u201csometime in 2003.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-10\">126\u00bb Mr. Boes also acknowledged that \u201cif Mr. Chigbu had timely paid Boes once he was paid by Entergy, no attorney fees or interest would have been due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-11\">\u2022 The original debtor, Gee Cee Company, is no longer in business. This suit involves an attempt to collect from a successor company, Gee Cee LA, and the president of both entities, Mr. Chigbu.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-12\">\u2022 A lapse of over a decade occurred between when the initial debt was incurred and suit was filed to collect it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-13\">\u2022 Whether Gee Cee LA is indebted for only the original principal balance or the principal balance plus interest was disputed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>\u2022 Finally, whether the applicable interest rate was the specific rate set forth on the Invoices or the judicial interest rate was disputed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">Given these complicating factors, we find the trial court did not err in finding that Boes was entitled to interest from the date of judicial demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">\n<em>Attorneys\u2019 fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Boes challenges the trial court\u2019s award of $8,000.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees as inadequate. In Louisiana, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees is not allowed except when authorized by statute or contract. <em>Rivet v. State, Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>96-0145, p. 10 (La. 9/5/96), 680 So.2d 1154, 1160 (citing <em>State, DOTD v. Williamson, </em>597 So.2d 439, 441 (La. 1992)). As noted earlier, the basis for the $8,000.00 attorneys\u2019 fee award to Boes is not the terms of the Invoices; rather, it is part of the penalty awarded to Boes under the prompt pay statute.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">The determination of a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee is determined on a case-by-case basis based on the facts of each individual case. <em>Filson, </em>07-0755 at p. 6, 990 So.2d at 67 (citing <em>Gottsegen v. Diagnostic Imaging Seros., </em>95-977, p. 7 (La.App. 5 Cir. 3/13/96), 672 So.2d 940, 943). Based on Rule 1.5(a) of the Rules of | ^Professional Conduct, the Louisiana Supreme Court in <em>State, Dep\u2019t of Transp. and Dev. v. Williamson, </em>597 So.2d 439 (La. 1992), enumerated a list of ten factors to be considered in making that determination.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-13\">At the hearing to fix attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, the trial court acknowledged on the record that Boes\u2019 counsel had done \u201ca lot of work\u201d on this case. Also at the hearing, Boes\u2019 counsel acknowledged that Boes\u2019 request for an attorneys\u2019 fee award of $35,132.00 was \u201cshocking on its face, given the amount of the judgment, $20,000.\u201d Boes\u2019 counsel, however, emphasized that Boes was requesting the actual amount of attorneys\u2019 fees that it incurred. Rejecting Boes\u2019 contention that it was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount Boes\u2019 actually incurred, the trial court orally reasoned as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-14\">The Court has specifically gone through all of the bills that were submitted by counsel for Boes Ironworks. There was, in fact, a lot of motion practice. There was, in fact, a lot of work done. However, the Court finds that even an award of attorneys\u2019 fees of $8,000 is nearly 50 percent of the [amount sued upon] ... I do believe that an 'extensive amount of work was, 'in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>fact, done, but I believe that it would not be equitable to award more than. $8,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq6J\">On appeal, Boes contends that the trial court erred in focusing on the amount sued upon in setting the attorneys\u2019 fee award. Boes emphasizes that the |2\u00a1jjurisprudence has recognized that, in appropriate circumstances, attorneys\u2019 fees at or above the principal amount claimed may be awarded. In support, Boes cites <em>Troth, supra-, </em>and <em>South Texas Pioneer Millwork v. Favalo-ra Constructors, Inc., </em>11-722 (La.App. 5 Cir. 3/13/12), 90 So.3d 1092. Boes contends that this court should find the trial court abused its discretion in limiting its attorneys\u2019 fees to $8,000.00 given the <em>Troth </em>and <em>South Texas Pioneer </em>cases, the ultimate outcome in Boes\u2019 favor, and the \u201cextensive\u201d work performed by its attorney, which the trial court acknowledged multiple times. Boes requests that this court reverse the award of $8,000.00 and amend the judgment to award attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $35,132.00\u2014the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees Boes actually incurred as evidenced by its attorney\u2019s unredacted fee statements.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Louisiana appellate courts, as Boes emphasizes, have affirmed attorneys\u2019 fee awards in excess of the amount sued upon.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In this case, however, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding $8,000.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees. Equity, as the trial court noted, was a factor in the determination of the appropriate attorneys\u2019 fee award. As noted above, the attorneys\u2019 fee award in this case is. a part of the penalty award under the prompt pay statute. The attorneys\u2019 fee award of $8,000.00, when compared to the penalty of $4,998.00, was clearly reasonable. Likewise, the attorneys\u2019 fee award, when compared to the total judgment amount ($16,820.00 in principal, $4,998.00 in penalties, and judicial interest) is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">| saFinally, the deference given the trial court judge on the issue of the reasonableness of an attorneys\u2019 fee award is \u201ca recognition of the trial judge\u2019s greater familiarity with the issues involved in the overall case and with the specific value of the services rendered by the attorney whose fee is under consideration.\u201d <em>Billieson v. City of New Orleans, </em>15-0858, p. 6 (La.App. 4 Cir. 1/27/16), 186 So.3d 786, 790.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Here, the trial court judge was aware of the nature of the case, the ultimate outcome, and the work that Boes\u2019 counsel had performed to achieve that outcome. Indeed, as Boes emphasizes, the trial court judge expressly stated multiple times on the record that Boes\u2019 counsel had done \u201ca lot of work.\u201d The trial court judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>thus factored all these considerations into her determination of an appropriate attorneys\u2019 fee award.

The relationship between the two corporate entities\u2014Gee Cee Group and Gee Cee LA\u2014 requires explanation. At the hearing on the prescription exception, Mr. Chigbu explained that Gee Cee Group was heavily involved with the Harrah\u2019s Casino project, which went bankrupt. As a result, Gee Cee Group suffered financial problems. Rather than file bankruptcy, Mr. Chigbu testified that he decided to form a new company. For this reason, he formed Gee Cee LA in 1997. The record reflects that from 1997 to 2006 Gee Cee Group and Gee Cee LA co-existed. In 2001, Entergy approached Gee Cee Group regarding the Project. Mr. Chigbu explained that the reason for this was because Gee Cee Group was \"the only entity that was in the Entergy system.\u201d At that time, Gee Cee Group was otherwise an inactive corporate entity. Mr. Chigbu explained that between 1997\u2014when Gee Cee LA was created\u2014and 2005\u2014when Hurricane Katrina struck.the area\u2014the only work that Gee Cee Group did was the Entergy job\u2014the Project. He testified that \"[t]here was no other business don[e by] Gee Cee Group after all the Harrah's difficulty except for the Entergy job, and that was only because that was the name in the Entergy system.\u201d Following Hurricane Katrina\u2014roughly in 2006\u2014Gee Cee Group was abandoned.

The trial court erred in limiting Boes\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees award to $8,000.00 when the record shows that the underlying matter required multiple court appearances, three depositions, over 200 written discovery requests were propounded to Boes, and defendants filed multiple exceptions and a motion for summary judgment, and routinely filed reply, sur-reply, and post-hearing memoranda to which Boes was required to respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-9\">2. The trial court erred by denying Boes\u2019 misapplication claim when Gibson Chig-bu, Gee Cee Group\u2019s principal, admitted the funds paid to Gee Cee Group by Entergy for Boes\u2019 work on the Perdido Street warehouse project were deposited into Gee Cee Group's general operating account, and used to pay other bills of the business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-10\">3. To the extent the trial court only awarded Boes interest from the date of judicial demand and not from the date payment was due, the trial court erred as Louisiana law provides that when the object of performance is a sum of money, damages for delay in performance are measured by the interest on that sum from the time it is due.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">.
