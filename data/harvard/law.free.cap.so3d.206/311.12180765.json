On March 18, 2014, he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>On August 17, 2015, Mr. Thomassie filed a motion to continue the trial, which the district court denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">|20n the next day, jury selection began. On August 19, 2015, before trial commenced, the district court conducted a hearing regarding the admissibility of certain text messages retrieved from Mr. Thomassie\u2019s cell phone. Over defense counsel\u2019s objections, the district court ruled that the text messages exchanged on August 17, 2015 between Mr. Thomassie and C.R., Mr. Thomassie and Anna Henry, and Mr. Thomassie and Sergeant Bruce Glaudi were admissible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On August 20, 2015, trial concluded. On that same day, the jury found Mr. Thomassie guilty of aggravated rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On December 15, 2015, the district court denied Mr. Thomassie\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal and new trial, and sentenced him to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AXh\">H.P., the victim, was born on June 7, 1996.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After her parents, D.C. (mother) and S.P., Sr. (father) divorced, her brothers, S.P., Jr., and B.P., went to live with their father, while H.P. stayed with her mother. About two years after the divorce, D.C. began dating Mr. Thomassie, who then was a NOPD officer. D.C. and H.P. I slater moved in with Mr. Thomassie in New Orleans, and in December 2003, D.C. and Mr. Thomassie had a child together\u2014 G.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">At trial, H.P. testified that on one occasion, when she was between seven and nine years old, she was sexually abused by Mr. Thomassie.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> H.P. testified that on the day of the incident, she came home after school, woke her sleeping mother, and asked if she could visit a friend who lived down the street. H.P. claimed that after D.C. refused to let her visit her friend, H.P. went into the living room and sat on the couch. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Thomas-sie approached her and asked why she was upset. H.P. explained that D.C. would not let her go to her friend\u2019s house, and Mr. Thomassie responded that he could make her feel better. H.P. testified that Mr. Thomassie then partially inserted his penis into her vagina; thereafter, he directed her to go into the dining room where he forced his penis into her mouth. H.P. stated that her mother walked into the room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>and witnessed Mr. Thomassie having oral sex with H.P.D.C. testified that when she entered the room, she observed Mr. Tho-massie with his penis in H,P.\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">While D.C. yelled at Mr. Thomassie, H.P. went back into the living room. D.C. testified that she threatened to report Mr. Thomassie to the police, although she failed to do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, D.C. confronted H.P. and informed her that she was not allowed to be alone with Mr. Tho-massie anymore. H.P. testified that |4she continued to live with her mother and Mr. Thomassie for about a year after the sexual abuse.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At some point between 2003 and 2005, H.P. went to live with her father.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">H.P. testified that she was about twelve or fourteen years old when she disclosed the abuse to V.L., her best friend at the time. At trial, V.L. testified that H.P. disclosed the incident with Mr. Thomassie, whom H.P. called her step-father and described as a \u201ccop.\u201d V.L. further testified that she did not report what H.P. revealed to her. Since H.P. had not reported the incident, V.L. felt that H.P. trusted her to not report it either.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">H.P. testified that in 2013, when she was about seventeen years old, the sexual abuse was first reported to law enforcement. She was helping her brother paint his newly purchased house when her mother, D.C., arrived at the house crying. H.P. testified that she got into the car with her mother, and her mother explained that Mr. Thomassie had a young girl living in his house and that she was worried about the girl being sexually abused. After H.P. explained to her mother that she did not want to report the abuse, H.P.\u2019s brother\u2019s girlfriend, C.R., joined them in the car. After she learned of the abuse, C.R. informed H.P. that she needed to report it. C.R. then went inside, informed H.P.\u2019s father and brother of the abuse, and the NOPD were called.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">I eNOPD Sergeant Lawrence Jones, who was assigned as lead investigator, testified that he was contacted by the Public Integrity Bureau to investigate a sexual assault involving a police officer and a nine year old girl. Sergeant Jones arrived at the scene and later obtained statements from H.P., H.P.\u2019s family members, Mr. Thomas-sie, and Mr. Thomassie\u2019s mother.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Sergeant Jones testified that the witnesses were confused as to the timeframe of the incident. Sergeant Jones stated that \u201csome [of the witnesses] said the victim was nine. It was later learned that the victim was actually seven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Sergeant Jones further testified that at the conclusion of his investigation he did not apply for an arrest warrant. Sergeant Jones explained his investigation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-12\">One of the things that we\u2019re required to do with a Child Abuse Investigation is to do a consultation, which we call a charge conference, with the District At<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>torney. In this particular investigation it was a delayed reporting. It happened a long time ago. So there was no physical evidence involved in this case. There were several inconsistencies involved in this investigation. So, I wanted to present that case to the charge conference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amvp\">Sergeant Jones testified that the District Attorney decided to bring the case before a grand jury, which subsequently returned an indictment of aggravated rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Assignment of Error Number Three<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">lr,In his third assignment of error, Mr. Thomassie contends that the district court erred in admitting into evidence two sets of text messages retrieved from his cell phone.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mr. Thomassie first contends that the text messages were not relevant and thus not admissible. He further contends that the texts messages were highly prejudicial and that the prejudice outweighed any probative value they might have. <em>Admissibility of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">All relevant evidence is admissible, and evidence that is not relevant is not admissible. La. C.E. art. 402. Relevant evidence is defined as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d La. C.E. art. 401. Evidence, although relevant, \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, or waste of time.\u201d La. C.E. art. 403. - \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Addressing the admissibility of evidence, this court noted in <em>State v. Dove, </em>15-0783, pp. 29-30 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/4/16), 194 So.3d 92, 112, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-13\">\u201cUnfair prejudice,\u201d as used in La. C.E. art. 403, means that \u201cthe offered evidence has \u2018an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.\u2019 \u201d Author\u2019s Note (3), La. C.E. art. 403, <em>Handbook on Louisiana Evidence Law, </em>Pugh, Force, Rault <em>&amp; </em>Triche, p. 380 (2011). A trial court is vested with much discretion in determining whether the probative value of relevant evidence is substantially outweighed by its ^prejudicial effect. <em>State v. Henry, </em>11-1137, p. 9 (La.App. 4 Cir. 10/24/12), 102 So.3d 1016, 1022.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-dH\">A trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility under La. C.E. art. 404 B(l) is renewable under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See State v. Henderson, </em>12-2422, pp. 3-4 (La. 1/4/13), 107 So.3d 566, 568; <em>State v. Barnes, </em>11-1421, p. 15 (La.App. 4 Cir. 9/19/12), 100 So.3d 926, 936. A trial court\u2019s ruling as to the relevancy of evidence will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Sanders, </em>12-0409, p. 14 (La.App. 4 Cir. 11/14/12), 104 So.3d 619, 630. \u201cA trial court is vested with much discretion in determining whether the probative value of relevant evidence is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Girard, </em>12-0790, p. 6 [(La. App. 4 Cir. 3/6/13], 110 So.3d [687,] 691.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). <em>See also State v. Ross, </em>15-1031, p. 17 (La.App. 4 Cir. 6/15/16), 195 So.3d 1210, 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">When determining the independent relevancy of evidence and balancing its probative value against its prejudicial effect, \u201c \u2018the court seeks to answer the question: Is this evidence so related to the crime on trial or a material issue or defense therein that, if admitted, its relevancy will outweigh the prejudicial effect, which the defendant will necessarily be burdened with?\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Altenberger, </em>13-2518, p. 8 (La. 4/11/14), 139 So.3d 510, 515 (quoting <em>State v. Garcia, </em>09-1578, p. 55 (La. 11/16/12), 108 So.3d 1, 39).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The August 17, 2015 text messages between Mr. Thomassie and Ms. Henry read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">MS. HENRY: Got a question when you get up my love</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">MR. THOMASSIE: Ask now. I\u2019m still up</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">MS. HENRY: It\u2019s a blushing question lol</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">MS. HENRY: Sooooooooo if I take a picture ... U got your stuff all shaved off ... Is that your preference on females too ? Lol</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">[SMR. THOMASSIE: I\u2019m not completely shaved. Trimmed and shaved, lol. Yes. No hair is best but as long as you\u2019re clean, I\u2019m good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">MS. HENRY: Yeah your [sic] trimmed.... I know....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">MR. THOMASSIE: [Red-cheeked, smiling emoji]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">MS. HENRY: Ok, just that\u2019s a pain ... Itches geeeezzz you would be difficult</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-14\">MS. HENRY: Ok I\u2019ll take care of you my baby.. Just feel not really a porn star ya know;)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-15\">MS. HENRY: No pimp suit right;)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-16\">MR. THOMASSIE: All shaved too [head-shot photo of Mr. Thomassie]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-17\">MS. HENRY: Oh well dang.You look good either way, but I think I prefer the bad boy goatee lol. But I know not for court;)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-19\">MR. THOMASSIE: It grows back quick</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-20\">During the pretrial hearing, the State contended that the text messages were relevant. The State argued the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-21\">THE PROSECUTOR: It is very relevant, the fact that he\u2019s going to be text-ing self\u00edes while picking a Jury on an aggravated rape, showing his hairless face to the woman he says I prefer\u2014or no hair is best. How could that not be relevant when you\u2019re talking about the rape of a seven year old girl, that that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to text within twenty-four hours of picking a jury on an aggravated rape, facing a life sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAFRJ\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-22\">That to us goes directly to what we are going to say is getting into his head a little bit, and we\u2019re talking about a man who is inclined to rape a child. That to us becomes extremely important when he\u2019s talking about wanting a female to be completely without hair down there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-23\">IsTHE COURT: So I mean. It appears to me that the State is trying to introduce this, allegedly, to show the defendant\u2019s alleged predisposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-24\">THE PROSECUTOR: Correct. It\u2019s guilt.... It\u2019s essentially evidence of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-25\">Moreover, the State referred to the text messages exchanged with Ms. Henry in its rebuttal argument at the close of trial. The State argued the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-26\">And you cannot stand up here and reasonably say to an intelligent group of ladies and gentlemen that it has no im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>pact on this case when he says he prefers a female to have no pubic hair at all. This isn\u2019t a narcotics ease, ladies and gentlemen. In that case I\u2019d say, [sic] it\u2019s not relevant. If this were a murder, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not relevant, but this is a man charged with raping a prepubescent girl, a seven year old girl, and he\u2019s taking selfies, telling his girlfriend he prefers women with no pubic hair. That should be very alarming to any person sitting on this Jury. That should be one of the most important things to give you an idea of just what kind of real good guy he is.... And I\u2019m going to take a selfie and talk about a prepubescent\u2014no public [sic] hair on a woman in the rape of a seven year old girl.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In its brief to this court, the State did not address the admissibility of the text messages. At oral argument before this court, the State conceded that the probative value of the text messages was low. The State also argued that the prejudicial effect was minimal and did not outweigh the probative value of the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In seeking to admit the text messages in question, the State offered no support for its claim that the text messages were relevant. The State simply argued that an adult male\u2019s sexual attraction to adult females with all pubic hair removed necessarily means that he is also sexually attracted to prepubescent females\u2014because they presumably have no pubic hair. The State, however, offered no expert | ^testimony from an expert in the field of human sexuality or some similar field of expertise to support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">On appeal, counsel for Mr. Thomassie argues that men preferring women without pubic hair is not indicative of a pedophiliac predisposition. Citing various scholarly and contemporary articles, Mr. Thomassie submits that adult men commonly prefer adult women without pubic hair and that many adult women also indulge in that preference. According to the State\u2019s arguments, Mr. Thomassie contends this preference would make most men and women pedophiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Given the lack of any supporting evidence, Mr. Thomassie\u2019s statements regarding his preference for no pubic hair on an adult female is not evidence supporting a finding of guilt of the aggravated rape of a prepubescent girl. Rather, the State\u2019s remarks constitute irrelevant, prejudicial appeals to emotion and inflammatory arguments going beyond the facts of the present case. <em>See State v. Miller, </em>98-0301, pp. 11-12 (La. 9/9/98), 718 So.2d 960, 966 (finding that although \u201cpatently prurient and highly inappropriate,\u201d the \u201cdefendant\u2019s statement to his neighbor\u2019s child that he had seen her naked in his bedroom with her arms and legs open [was] admissible to show his intent to molest the victim of the charged offense and to show that the molestation was not an accident.\u201d). The text messages neither relate to the crime of aggravated rape of H.P. nor a material issue here. Any probative value is outweighed by the prejudicial effect of the text messages. We thus find that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the text messages between Mr. Thomassie and Ms. Henry.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">| <em>^Harmless Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">The erroneous admission of evidence is subject to the harmless error analysis. <em>State v. Campbell, </em>15-0017, p. 27 (La.App. 4 Cir. 6/24/15), 171 So.3d 1176, 1192; <em>State v. Williams, </em>12-0252, p. 23 (La.App. 4 Cir. 4/17/13), 115 So.3d 600, 613; <em>State v. Hugle, </em>11-1121, p. 19 (La. App. 4 Cir. 11/7/12), 104 So.3d 598, 613. <em>See also </em>La. C.E. art. 103(A) (\u201cError may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u201c \u2018Harmless error analysis begins with the premise that the evidence is otherwise sufficient to sustain the conviction if viewed from the perspective of a rational fact finder .and asks whether beyond a reasonable doubt the error could not have contributed to the verdict actually returned by the defendant\u2019s jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell, </em>15-0017, p. 27, 171 So.3d at 1192 (quoting <em>State v. Gibbs, </em>41, 062, p. 8 (La.App. 2 Cir. 6/28/06), 935 So.2d 349, 354); <em>Dove, </em>15-0783 at p. 30, 194 So.3d at 112, n. 3. <em>See also Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993). Stated otherwise, harmless error exists when the guilty verdict actually rendered was \u201csurely unattributable\u201d to the error. <em>State v. Higginbotham, </em>11-0564, p. 3 (La. 5/6/11), 60 So.3d 621, 623. \u201cA trial error ... may \u2018be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>State v, Merwin, </em>15-0681, p. 18 (La.App. 4 Cir. 1/27/16), 186 So.3d 759, 769 (quoting <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 308-09, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">As noted above, the State failed to present any argument in its brief on appeal regarding the admissibility of Mr. Thomas-sie\u2019s text messages. The State both introduced the text messages into evidence at trial and continued to reference the text messages in closing arguments. The State implied to the jury that Mr. Thomassie was morally reprehensible for sending such text messages given the nature of the crime he was charged with committing. Additionally, the jury verdict was not unanimous\u2014it was a ten to two verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Considering all the facts and circumstances, we find that the erroneous admission of the texts messages was not harmless. Rather, the admittance of such evidence was prejudicial and affected substantial rights of the accused and was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. La. C.Cr.P. art. 921.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As Sergeant Jones testified, there were many inconsistencies in H.P.\u2019s and D.C.\u2019s statements regarding the details surrounding the commission of the crime. Furthermore, inconsistencies were also found between H.P.\u2019s and D.C.\u2019s trial testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This fact, coupled with the non-unanimous jury verdict, suggests that the evidence, as viewed by the jury, was not overwhelming. Accordingly, we cannot find that the |isguilty verdict was surely unattributable to the error in admitting the text messages. The error thus was not harmless and requires reversal of Mr. Th\u2019omassie\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">DECREE</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">BONIN, J., CONCURS WITH REASONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-10\">.

Mr. Thomassie contended that a <em>Dau-bert/Foret </em>hearing was required to determine the admissibility of testimony by the State\u2019s expert witness, Anne Troy, a nurse practitioner at the Audrey Hepburn CARE Center at Children\u2019s Hospital in New Orleans. Nurse Troy\u2019s testimony related to delayed disclosure in child abuse cases. <em>See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Foret, </em>628 So.2d 1116 (La. 1993). Mr. Tho-massie further claimed that the State disclosed its intent to call Nurse Troy as a witness only three days before trial. He thus argued that a continuance was required to allow him adequate time to prepare to a defense against her anticipated testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\">.

The indictment indicates that the incident occurred between October 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">. D.C. testified that she had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and that she knew it would be factored into whether the NOPD would believe her over Mr. Thomassie. At trial, D.C. confirmed that she was convicted in 2014 for possession of legend drugs and placed on probation for five years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\">. D.C. continued to live with Mr, Thomassie for about seven or eight years following the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b384-13\">. H.P. testified that she moved into to her father\u2019s house in in 2003 or 2004, when she was in the third grade. S.P., Sr., testified that H.P. came to live with him in 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b384-14\">. Sergeant Jones testified that there were inconsistencies in the witnesses' statements. The inconsistencies between the H.P.\u2019s and D.C.\u2019s statements related to the timeline, the position of H.P, when the abuse occurred, and the status of H.P.\u2019s clothing when the abuse occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">. Given our finding that Mr. Thomassie is entitled to a new trial based on the erroneous admittance of certain text messages, we pre-termit discussion of the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b385-10\">. Although three sets of text messages were admitted, Mr. Thomassie only appeals the admittance of two of them\u2014the text messages to and from Ms, Henry; and those between him and Sergeant Glaudi. Because we find the admission of the text messages between Mr. Thomassie and Ms. Henry constitute reversible error, we pretermit addressing the text messages exchanged with Sergeant Glaudi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b388-5\">. La. C.Cr.P. art. 921 provides that \u201c[a] judgment or ruling shall not be reversed by an appellate court because of any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights of the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">. For instance, on cross examination, H.P. admitted that in her statement to police, she said that Mr. Thomassie did not actually insert anything- into her mouth. She testified, however, that he forced it into her mouth. H.P. also testified that she informed C.R. that Mr. Thomassie had his pants down around his ankles during the incident. At trial, however, D.C. testified that Mr. Thomassie\u2019s penis was pulled out through the zipper of his pants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>BONIN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APs\">CONCURS WITH REASONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">hi concur but write separately to underscore the wholly inadmissible and irrelevant nature of the text-messages between Mr. Thomassie and Anna Henry, which were erroneously admitted by the trial judge over strenuous defense objection, and to emphasize that the erroneous admission requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">It is noteworthy that the prosecution sought to introduce the text-messages under the Articles governing confessions and inculpatory statements of the defendant. <em>See </em>La. C.Cr.P. arts. 716, 722, 767, 768. But a statement by Mr. Thomassie that he prefers his adult girlfriend to depilate her pubic hair is neither a confession that he raped the victim in this case, H.P. nor an inculpatory statement. <em>See State v. Brumfield, </em>329 So.2d 181, 187 (La. 1976) (\u201c[A] confession admits commission of the <em>crime...\"); State v. Williams, </em>98-0806, p. 4 (La. App. 4 Cir. 3/24/99), 732 So.2d 105, 108 (An \u201c \u2018inculpatory statement\u2019 refers to an out-of-court admission of incriminating facts made by the defendant after the crime has been committed\u201d and \u201cis one that admits a fact tending to establish guilt or from which guilt can be inferred.\u201d) (citing <em>State v. Bodley, </em>394 So.2d 584, 589 (La. 1981)). Ms. Henry is an adult woman with no relation to the victim in this case. The text-messages neither relate to the charged crime nor do they constitute facts |2or circumstances from which guilt can be inferred. Thus, the prosecution\u2019s stated justification for admitting this evidence is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Two other proposed stand-by justifications for the exceptional admission of this evidence are Article 404 B(l) and Article 412.2 of the Louisiana Code of Evidence. But neither of these Articles applies to the text-message exchange between Mr. Tho-massie and his adult girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">First, Louisiana law prohibits the use of evidence of other wrongs or acts when they are admitted for the sole purpose of showing that the defendant committed the charged crime because he has a propensity to commit such crimes\u2019 or because he is a man of criminal character. <em>See State v. Garcia, </em>09-1578, p. 53 (La. 11/16/12), 108 So.3d 1, 38; <em>see also </em>La. C.E. art. 404 B(l). Such evidence is generally inadmissible is because the other acts \u201cinvolve[ ] substantial risk of grave prejudice to a defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Prieur, </em>277 So.2d 126, 128 (1973). There are, however, limited exceptions upon which evidence of other acts may be admitted. The prosecution must' establish that the evidence will be admitted for an independent reason, such as to prove \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident.\u201d La. C.E. art. 404 B(1). Before evidence can be admitted for one of the enumerated purposes in Article 404 B(l), the prosecution must also show that the other acts. evidence has \u201csubstantial relevant independent from showing defendant\u2019s criminal character in that it tends to prove a material fact genuinely at issue.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>09-1578, p. 54, 108 So.3d at 38. And, as always, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect. <em>See </em>La. C.E. art. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Second, a more generous or expansive rule Of admission of evidence applies when the defendant is charged with a crime involving sexually assaultive behavior or with acts that constitute a sex offense involving a victim who was under the age of seventeen at the time. <em>See </em>La. C.E. art. 412.2. Subject to the balancing test | sunder La. C.E., art. 403, \u201cevidence of the accused\u2019s commission of another crime, wrong, or act involving sexually assaultive behavior or acts which indicate a lustful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>disposition toward children may be admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant... La. C.E. art. 412.2 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">I address the latter exception first. While it is true that Mr. Thomassie was charged with an act \u201cthat constitute^] a sex offense involving a victim who was under the age of seventeen at the time,\u201d I discern no authority which would have supported the use of the exceptions under Article 412.2. Text-messages expressing a preference for a shorn pubic area on an adult woman who is sexually intimate with the defendant constitute neither \u201csexually assaultive behavior\u201d nor \u201cacts which indicate a lustful disposition toward children.\u201d <em>Cf. State v. Layton, </em>14-1910 (La. 3/17/15), 168 So.3d 358 (evidence that defendant fondled a woman\u2019s breasts at knifepoint constituted \u201csexually assaultive behavior\u201d even though act was not statutorily proscribed in Louisiana); <em>State v. Wright, </em>11-0141 (La. 12/6/11), 79 So.3d 309 (in prosecution for aggravated incest of teenage son, evidence of defendant\u2019s marriage to fourteen-year-old female was admissible to show lustful disposition toward adolescents); <em>State v. Cox, </em>15-0124 (La. App. 4 Cir. 7/15/15), 174 So.3d 131 (in prosecution for sexual abuse of four juveniles, evidence of uncharged sexual abuse of minor victims in other jurisdictions was relevant and admissible under La. C.E. art. 412.2); <em>State v. Farrier, </em>14-0623 (La. App. 4 Cir. 3/25/15), 162 So.3d 1233 (in prosecution for sexual battery of minor, recorded jailhouse calls where defendant admitted watching child pornography, that he could not fight \u201cthis,\u201d and that he hoped for leniency as \u201ca first offender,\u201d were admissible to show his lustful disposition towards children). Thus, the exceptions under La. C.E. art. 412.2 were not available to the prosecution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">As to the admissibility of the text-messages as potential \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts,\u201d I emphasize that if the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence |4under one of the enumerated purposes under La. C.E. art. 404 B, the evidence \u201cmust have substantial relevance ... in that <em>it tends to prove a material fact genuinely at issue.\u201d Garcia, </em>at p. 54,108 So.3d at 38 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In order to convict a defendant of the aggravated rape of a child under thirteen, the prosecution needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 1) the defendant engaged in anal, oral, or vaginal intercourse with the victim, and 2) that the victim was under thirteen-years-old at the time of the offense. <em>See </em>La. R.S. 14:42 A(4). Mr. Thomassie categorically denied the charge. Leaving aside the issue of whether the content in the text-messages even qualifies as \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, the evidence does not fall under any of the permitted purposes in Article 404 B.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Aggravated rape does not require a showing of specific intent; rather the \u201ccriminal intent necessary to sustain a conviction is established by the very doing of the act.\u201d <em>State v. Mills, </em>00-2525, p. 7 (La. App. 4 Cir. 12/27/01), 806 So.2d 59; <em>see also </em>La. R.S. 14:42. Moreover, motive and intent in an aggravated rape prosecution \u201care self-proving from the commission of the act itself, and are not material issues genuinely contested at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>00-1554, p. 12 (La. 4/3/01), 803 So.2d 916, 924. Absence of mistake or accident are likewise excluded as genuine issues. <em>See id., </em>at. pp. 12-13, 803 So.2d at 924 (\u201c[N]o rational jury could entertain the possibility, that the defendant\u2019s penis accidentally found its way into his victim\u2019s vagina or that it did so unaccompanied by lascivious intent.\u201d). Finally, the text-messages between Mr. Thomassie and Ms. Henry do not prove in any way whatsoever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>that the defendant had the opportunity, preparation, or plan to commit aggravated rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The prosecutor argued that the text-messages were \u201cessentially evidence of guilt\u201d and responded in the affirmative when the trial judge asked if the texts were being introduced \u201cto show the defendant\u2019s alleged predisposition.\u201d This reasoning | sflies in the face of long-standing and established jurisprudence. <em>See Prieur; </em>La. C.E. art. 404 A. <em>See also Old Chief v. U.S., </em>519 U.S. 172, 181, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997) (\u201cPropensity evidence\u201d presents a \u201crisk that a jury will convict for crimes other than those charged\u2014or that, uncertain of guilt, it will convict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment\u2014[this] creates a prejudicial effect that outweighs ordinary relevance.\u201d). The text-messages do not meet any exceptions to the general prohibition on character evidence, nor are - they relevant to the charged crime. <em>See State v. Scales, </em>93-2003, p. 9 (La. 5/22/95), 655 So.2d 1326, 1333. (Evidence sought to be admitted must \u201cbear[ ] a <em>rational connection </em>to the fact which is at issue in the case.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The text-messages are simply not probative and are thus inadmissible. It was error to allow the jury to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">As noted by the majority, the erroneous admission of evidence is subject to harmless error analysis. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>94-1379, (La. 11/27/95), 664 So.2d 94. Notably, when the state presents inadmissible evidence and the trial judge erroneously allows the inadmissible \u00e9vidence, however, \u201cthe prosecutor has a very heavy burden to demonstrate in the appellate court that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>99-3278, p. 6 (La. 12/8/00), 776 So.2d 418, 422. \u201cThe prosecutor, generally can overcome this heavy burden only with physical evidence directly connecting the accused with the charged crime, or with strong and corroborated circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">There are several factors that courts consistently take into account when conducting an analysis of whether the introduction of inadmissible evidence was harmless. Generally, a reviewing court will assess the strength of the state\u2019s case ^against the defendant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> whether the jury\u2019s verdict was unanimous or not,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whether the prosecutor relied on the erroneously-admitted evidence in closing argument,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and whether the trial court instructed the jury on the limited purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>for which the evidence was admitted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See generally Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (listing factors for courts to consider when conducting harmless error analysis in Confrontation Clause errors).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The prosecution\u2019s case against Mr. Thommasie consisted, in pertinent part, of testimony from H.P. and her mother, D.C., which as noted by the majority, contained numerous inconsistencies. <em>See State v. McArthur, </em>97-2918, p. 4 (La. 10/20/98), 719 So.2d 1037, 1043 (given \u201cnumerous inconsistencies\u201d in victim\u2019s testimony, court could not say that erroneous admission of other crimes evidence did not contribute to the verdict). No physical evidence connected Mr. Thomassie to the crime. <em>Cf. State v. Danastasio, </em>12-1157, p. 21 (La. App. 4 Cir. 1/30/14), 133 So.3d 224, 237 (erroneous admission of other crimes evidence harmless error in light of DNA evidence). Moreover, the prosecutor, in her closing rebuttal |7argument, stressed to the jury that the text messages between Mr. Thomassie and Ms. Henry should be \u201calarming\u201d to them and \u201cone of the most important things\u201d for them to consider in assessing \u201cjust what kind of real good guy [defendant] is.... \u201d <em>See Bell, </em>at p. 8, 776 So.2d at 423; <em>State v. Whittaker, </em>449 So.2d 611, 613 (La. App 1st Cir. 1984) (state \u201cstrenuously\u201d relied on inadmissible other crimes evidence as admission of defendant\u2019s guilt, especially in closing argument). And, as the majority points out, the jury convicted Mr. Thomas-sie by a ten-to-two, non-unanimous verdict. <em>See generally State v. Lewis, </em>12-1021, p. 16 (La. 3/19/13), 112 So.3d 796, 805 (non-unanimous verdict one of the factors to consider in harmless error analysis when defendant denied right to back strike juror); <em>State v. Frith, </em>13-1133, p. 13 (La. App. 4 Cir. 10/22/14), 151 So.3d 946, 954 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Evidence should be excluded when its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative nature. <em>See </em>La. C.E. art. 403. \u201cPrejudicial\u201d limits the introduction of other crimes evidence only when it is unduly and unfairly prejudicial. <em>See State v. Henderson, </em>12-2422, p. 2 (La. 1/4/13), 107 So.3d 566, 568. And \u201cunfair prejudice\u201d as to a criminal defendant, \u201cspeaks to the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Rose, </em>06-0402, p. 13 (La. 2/22/07), 949 So.2d 1236, 1244). The <em>only </em>plausible reason for the admission of evidence in this case was to' encourage the jury to infer guilt by suggesting that Mr. Thomassie\u2019s preferences, as texted, confirmed his desire for a prepubescent girl.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The text messages had no bearing on the charged crime nor did they have anyinde-pendent relevance. I thus do not find that the prosecution has met its heavy burden to show that the erroneous admission of prejudicial evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>| sIt was overreach and I therefore agree with the majority that- we cannot find that \u201cthe verdict actually rendered by this jury was surely unattributable to the error.\u201d <em>State v. Magee, </em>11-0574, p. 46 (La. 9/28/12), 103 So.3d 285, 318 (citing <em>Sullivan v.
