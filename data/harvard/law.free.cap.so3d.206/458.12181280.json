For the reasons that follow, defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed and his sentence is affirmed as amended. We further remand this case for correction of the commitment, consistent with the order in this opinion</p>\n<p id=\"Axki\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AqOQ\">Defendant, Juan Canales, was married to the victim, A.V.\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, mother. In 2010, the Kenner Police Department (\u201cKPD\u201d) began an investigation of defendant after a complaint of sexual battery of a minor, A.V.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was reported. The incidents had allegedly taken place in Kenner years before, when A.V. was approximately six or seven years old. The information was relayed to the Kenner Police Department by the Ouachi-ta Parish Sheriffs Office. A.V.\u2019s mother first contacted the Ouachita authorities after she learned that A.V. communicated to a friend, via the internet, that defendant had molested her. KPD Sergeant Joseph McRae contacted defendant, who denied any wrongdoing. Subsequent to the interview with defendant, a witness, Marvin Tran, came forward' and told Sergeant McRae that he had personally seen defendant touch A.V. in an inappropriate way in Monroe, Louisiana, and that defendant had threatened A.V. at that time, telling her not to \u201csay anything.\u201d Thereafter, defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">On March 28, 2013, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office filed a bill of information charging defendant with one count of sexual battery upon a known juvenile, a violation of La. R.S. 14:43.1. On August 9, 2013, defendant pled not guilty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>and he ultimately proceeded to trial before a six-person jury on September 29, 2015. The jury found defendant guilty as charged on September 30, 2015. On October 15, 2015, defendant was sentenced to 10-years imprisonment at |shard labor without the benefits of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence and ordered to pay various fines and fees. The State then filed a multiple offender bill of information which alleged defendant to be a second felony offender. After defendant stipulated to the allegations in the multiple bill, the trial court vacated the original sentence and re-sentenced defendant to 15 years at hard labor without the benefits <em>of </em>parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. After defendant\u2019s motion for new trial was denied, he filed a timely motion for appeal, which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In his sole assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court denied him his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial when it removed his family during the victim\u2019s testimony, based on the State\u2019s argument that the victim indicated it would be \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d to testify with those persons present in the courtroom. Defendant further asserts that the trial court\u2019s action of excluding the family members was an error because it does not meet the criteria for a valid court closure, as set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Waller v. </em>Co., 467 U.S. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Conversely, the State argues that the partial court closure was permissible, where its purpose was reasonably necessary to prevent A.V.\u2019s embarrassment or emotional disturbance and to enable A.V. to testify to facts material to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"A6k\">LAW AND ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In the instant case, the record shows that, prior to trial, the State represented to the court that AV. was reluctant to testify in front of members of defendant\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">|4THE STATE:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoFZ\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">There were\u2014the victim in this case, Judge, has made it apparent to me that she will have great difficulty and embarrassment in testifying if the defendant\u2019s family is in the courtroom. She has said that she said that she would be very embarrassed to the point of shutting down if they\u2019re in the courtroom because she knows them. This used to be her stepfather.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfK\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">The victim\u2019s testimony is of the up-most [sic] materiality. And she will be completely embarrassed, Judge, because she knows these people and she has said that she will have an incredibly difficult time testifying. So for that reason, Judge\u2014I know it\u2019s to your discretion\u2014I would ask the Court to respectfully request that the defendant\u2019s family members leave the courtroom while she\u2019s testifying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">Defense counsel objected to the State\u2019s request, and argued, in summary, that \u201c[Ejmbarrassment, in and of itself, should not be a reason to, to take away [defendant\u2019s] right to a public hearing.\u201d The trial judge then determined that members of defendant\u2019s family would not be present in the courtroom while A.V. testified. During trial, the trial court took a recess before AV.\u2019s testimony. Outside of the presence of the jury, the trial court instructed defendant\u2019s family that they were to exit the courtroom for the entirety of AV.\u2019s testimony. The proceedings resumed, and at the conclusion of AV.\u2019s testimony, the trial court again took a short recess. At that time, defendant\u2019s family was allowed to return to the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>We begin our analysis with an ac-knowledgement that the record in this case provides only a bare amount of information regarding A.V.\u2019s unwillingness to testify while members of the defendant\u2019s family were present. A.V. was not sworn in and questioned by the court on this matter, nor was she cross-examined by defense counsel. The record contains the argument by the State, through the Assistant District Attorney, that testifying would cause A.V. to suffer emotionally. |sOther than the information relayed to the court through the argument of the prosecuting attorney, no evidence or testimony was provided to the court for its consideration of whether defendant\u2019s family should be removed from the courtroom to facilitate A.V.\u2019s testimony. The first issue to be addressed, then, is whether the State\u2019s argument to the Judge was a sufficient basis for the trial court to consider a partial court closure in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">While other appellate courts have found it permissible for a trial court to consider a motion for court closure, solely based upon assertions made on behalf of a witness by either the State or defense counsel, it is apparent that such a review is not without difficulty. For example, in <em>United States ex rel. Smallwood v. LaValle, </em>377 F.Supp. 1148, 1151 (E.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd. </em>508 F.2d 837 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 920, 95 S.Ct. 1586, 43 L.Ed.2d 788 (1975), which was a murder trial, the State informed the trial judge that its principal witness, a pregnant 16-year-old, was \u201cafraid\u201d to testify, and asked that the courtroom be cleared for her testimony. In the conversation that ensued between the court, the State and defense counsel, the court learned that the witness could not point to any single threat against her. The judge did not question the witness, nor was any additional evidence provided in support of the State\u2019s requested action. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the judge cleared the courtroom while the witness testified. On an application for a writ of habeas corpus, the U.S. District Court for the- Eastern District of New York considered the defendant\u2019s claim that the exclusion violated his right to a public trial. In finding that the trial court did not err, the district court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">The colloquy in the record in this case reveals that the trial judge\u2019s concern was multi-faceted. His exclusion order was based partly on concern for the welfare of \u00e1 young expectant mother and her unborn child and partly on her own subjective fear of reprisal\u2014whether reasonable or unreasonable\u2014if she testified in public. While the record falls short of establishing a real danger to her health or that of her child, or the reasonableness of her fears in terms of actual threats, or even a demonstration of her inability to testify publicly, this court is very reluctant to second-guess the trial court\u2019s discretion on a |flcold record four years hence. <em>See United States ex rel. Bruno v. Herold, supra, </em>408 F.2d [125] at 127, 129 [(2d Cir .1969) ]. In view of the defense objection at trial, the benefits of hindsight and reflection suggest that the trial court might have been more circumspect in its decision, perhaps following the approach outlined above. Nevertheless, this court can perceive, under the applicable law, no error of constitutional magnitude indicating a disregard of the trial court\u2019s responsibility to conduct a fair and public trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1153.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">In <em>State v. Poindexter, </em>231 La. 630, 92 So.2d 390 (La. 1956), the issue before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Louisiana Supreme Court was whether a trial judge erroneously concluded that he had no discretion to remove certain persons from the courtroom when a defense witness indicated that he, could not testify with those persons present. In that case, there was no direct indication to the court from the, potential witness that he could not testify. Instead, this information came through defense counsel who \u201ctestified under oath that the witness Beardon refused to testify in the case because of the presence of penitentiary personnel in the courtroom.\u201d Thereafter, the district attorney stipulated \u201cthat one of the defense attorneys had talked to the witness, and that he refused to testify unless the penitentiary personnel were removed from the courtroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638, 92 So.2d 390. The Supreme Court observed in its opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">In the instant case it may have been better procedure for counsel for the defendant to have had the witness sworn and let him personally refuse to testify so that he might have been subject to punishment for contempt. However, in view of the admission and stipulation by the State that this witness would not testify while the penitentiary personnel were present in the courtroom, his refusal has to be accepted as a fact by us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au8y\"><em>Id. </em>at 636, 92 So.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Some of the cases cited in <em>Poindexter, supra, </em>contain examples of trial judges accepting an assertion by the State that a witness is fearful of testifying. In <em>Hogan v. State, </em>191 Ark. 437, 86 S.W.2d 931 (1936), the court allowed a rape ^victim, who was a minor, to testify for a second time based solely upon State\u2019s request without any additional evidence, after the court apparently saw the fear of the witness while testifying in front of spectators in the courtroom. In <em>State v. Damm, </em>(South Dakota), 62 S.D. 123, 262 N.W. 7 (1933), the trial court cleared the courtroom for the remainder of a minor rape victim\u2019s testimony based solely upon the State\u2019s request, when it was apparent that testifying was causing the victim emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">In <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>68 F.3d 94 (5th Cir. 1995), the Assistant U.S. Attorney asked the trial judge to close 'the proceedings while \u201cJane Doe,\u201d who was the child victim of a kidnapping and sexual assault, testified. Over the defendants\u2019 objections, the court ordered that a sister of one defendant leave the courtroom, and also prohibited any new spectators from entering during Jane\u2019s testimony. The district court allowed the remaining audience, which included relatives of both defendants, to stay. In reviewing the convictions on appeal and the issue of whether the partial closure of the courtroom violated the defendants\u2019 constitutional right to a public trial, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal acknowledged the lack of information about why Jane did not wish to testify in front of certain persons in the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">The government initially made a request for a full closure, arguing that it was concerned that forcing the twelve year old Jane to testify in front of the public would traumatize or intimidate her, perhaps causing psychological harm . or making her unable to communicate. Although the district court did not create a detailed record on this issue, we infer that it eventually ordered the partial closure on this basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 98-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">In the instant case, as in <em>Smallwood, supra, </em>and <em>Osborne, supra, </em>we are re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>quired to review, based upon a cold record, the action.of the trial court in removing spectators from the courtroom, predicated upon the State\u2019s assertion only, that it was necessary to accommodate the victim\u2019s testimony and minimize |Rthe emotional impact that testifying would have upon her. As correctly pointed out by defense counsel as part of his objection, A.V. had not identified any threats against her or articulated a specific reason why she could not testify in front of those persons. Defense counsel also argued as part of his objection that the prosecutor was not in a position to assess \u201cwhat emotional disturbance or embarrassment or consequences there might be\u201d in compelling the victim to testify with those persons present. Regardless of whether that was an accurate statement, however, it remained unchallenged that A.V. had communicated to the State the difficulty she would encounter if required to testify in front of the defendant\u2019s family and associates. While not tantamount to the stipulation found in <em>Poindexter, swpra, </em>we find that, in the least, there was a tacit acknowledgement in this case by defendant that A.V. told the prosecutor about her concerns. In fact, the record contains an uncontradicted statement by the prosecutor at the time of the request to remove the spectators, that he had previously discussed this very issue with defense counsel. In summary, we find, as the Court did in <em>Poindexter, </em>that there is a sufficient basis to consider the State\u2019s representation to the trial judge of A.V.\u2019s communicating her difficulty in testifying before certain spectators-in the audience to be an unchallenged summarization of A.V.\u2019s expressed feelings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court had grounds to act upon the State\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">19We next consider the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s action in removing the spectators during A.V.\u2019s testimony resulted in an infrigement of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">As provided in the sixth amendment of the United States Constitution, and Article 1, section 16, of the Louisiana Constitution, in a criminal case, the accused is -afforded the right to enjoy a public trial. However, the right to a public trial is not absolute. <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2210, \"81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984). The right to a public trial is not a \u201climitless imperative^]\u201d the right is subject to the trial judge\u2019s power to keep order in the courtroom or to prevent unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>pressures or embarrassment to a witness. <em>United, States ex rel. Smallwood v. LaValle, supra. </em>A trial judge may, in his sound discretion, exclude spectators from the courtroom while the testimony of a witness in a criminal case is being taken, if such a step is reasonably necessary to prevent embarrassment or emotional disturbance of that witness or to enable that witness to testify to facts material to the case. <em>State v. Poindexter, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Defendant urges this Court to apply the factors found in <em>Waller v. Georgia, supra, </em>to determine the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action in removing some of the spectators from the courtroom during A.V.\u2019s testimony. <em>Waller, </em>however, dealt with a different set of circumstances. We <em>find </em>that the U.S. Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Osborne, supra, </em>provides a more relevant framework for analyzing this issue with respect to a partial closure of the proceedings. In <em>Osborne, </em>the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal recognized that other circuit courts had adopted a modified version of <em>Waller, </em>which was \u201ca less demanding test requiring the party seeking the partial closure to show only a \u2018substantial reason\u2019 for the closure.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">Prior to the <em>Waller </em>decision, this circuit addressed the constitutionality of a partial closure in <em>Aaron v. Capps. </em>In <em>Aaron, </em>this j incourt held that, when considering a partial closure, a trial court should look to the particular circumstances of the case to see if the defendant will still receive the safeguards of the public trial guarantee. This court reasoned that the partial closing of court proceedings does not raise the same constitutional concerns as a total closure, because an audience remains to ensure the fairness of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">Although.this circuit has not had the opportunity to reexamine the constitutionality of a partial closing since the <em>Waller </em>decision, five other circuits have addressed the issue. The Second, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have all found that <em>Waller\u2019s </em>stringent standard does not apply to partial closures, and have adopted a less demanding test requiring the party seeking the partial closure to show only a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d for the closure. As in this circuit\u2019s <em>Aaron </em>decision, these courts have all based their decisions on a determination that partial closures do not implicate the same fairness and secrecy concerns as total closures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">We agree. We do not read <em>Waller </em>as altering this court\u2019s analysis of partial closings as discussed in <em>Aaron. </em>We now, however, also adopt the \u201csubstantial reason\u201d test set forth by other courts as a . method of determining if a partial closure meets the constitutional standards of <em>Aaron.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">Applying this test to the instant suit, we find that the partial closure was justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 98-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">In the instant case, the State made the trial court aware of A.V.\u2019s concerns that she would have great difficulty testifying if the defendant\u2019s family members were present. As discussed <em>supra, </em>we find that the State\u2019s argument on this point, without any additional evidence in the record, was sufficient for the court to consider a partial closure of the trial for A.V.\u2019s testimony. The only remaining question, then, is whether the State\u2019s argument regarding A.V.\u2019s reluctance to testify provided a substantial reason to the court to justify a partial closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">In granting the partial closure, the trial judge explained her ruling, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-13\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAHJ\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>As far as I\u2019m concerned, individuals in the back really, in the gallery area, the family members have\u2014don\u2019t have constitutional rights. He has to be here the whole time but it\u2019s not necessary that they be here the entire time. And if she\u2019s uncomfortable with them in the courtroom while she testify, [sic] and we want the truth, and we want her to testify truthfully, fully and h truthfully, then I have to, at least within reason making sure his constitutional rights are protected, afford her the opportunity to do just that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">As the reviewing courts did in the cases discussed <em>supra, </em>we find the trial court\u2019s action of excluding certain persons from the courtroom for the limited duration of AV.\u2019s testimony to be adequately supported. The Louisiana Supreme Court has acknowledged that a trial judge has the discretion to exclude persons from the courtroom if he or she deems it to be reasonably necessary to prevent embarrassment or emotional disturbance of that witness or to enable that witness to testify to facts material to the case. <em>State v. Poin-dexter.; supra. </em>In this case, the trial court made a finding on the record that removing the relevant spectators from the courtroom would assist the victim in testifying. As the court did in <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>we infer that the trial court took such action to help alleviate any impact that A.V. believed her testifying in the presence of defendant\u2019s family would have upon her emotional state. The trial court also took care to have the defendant\u2019s family leave from and return to the courtroom outside of the presence of the jury. Furthermore, the courtroom remained open to the general public during the portion of the teial when AV. testified. Defendant has not alleged any prejudice resulting from the partial closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Based upon our review of the record, we cannot say that the trial judge\u2019s accommodations in this case to allow A.V. to testify with minimum embarrassment or emotional disturbance was an error that violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This assignment is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AJs\">ERROR PATENT REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The record was reviewed for errors patent, according to La. C.Cr.P. Art. 920; <em>State v. Oliveaux, </em>312 So.2d 337 (La. 1975); and <em>State v. Weiland, </em>556 So.2d 175 (La. App. 5 Cir. 1990). The following matters are noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">| igFirst, the trial court erred in ordering the defendant to participate in a sex offender treatment program. La. C.Cr.P. Art. 895(J) applies to sex offenders placed on probation. Accordingly, this part of defendant\u2019s sentence is vacated. <em>See, State v. Esteves, </em>01-399, p. 6 (La.App. 5 Cir. 10/30/01), 800 So.2d 1040. The trial court further erred in imposing a \u201c[g]eneral fine\u201d of $250.00 during sentencing on the multiple bill, when La. R.S. 15:529.1 does not authorize a fine. <em>State v. Dickerson, </em>584 So.2d 1140 (La. 1991). This portion of defendant\u2019s sentence is also vacated. This matter is remanded to the trial court with instructions to correct the commitment and to transmit the amended commitment to the officer in charge of the institution to which defendant has been sentenced. <em>See State ex rel. Roland v. State, </em>06-0244 (La. 9/15/06), 937 So.2d 846 <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">DECREE</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed. Defendant\u2019s sentence is vacated in part, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>affirmed as amended. We remand this case for correction of the commitment, consistent with the order in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE AMENDED AND AFFIRMED AS AMENDED; REMANDED WITH ORDER</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-11\">. In accordance with the law, initials will be used to reference the name of the victim. <em>See </em>La. R.S. 46:1844(W).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-12\">. A.V. testified at trial that she was born in November of 1996, and was 18 at the time she gave her testimony before the jury. At trial, A.V. testified that while defendant was married to her mother and the family lived in Kenner, defendant touched A.V.\u2019s \u201cprivate areas\u201d with his hands and he also made A.V. touch him on one occasion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b531-6\">. We note that <em>Smallwood, </em>has previously been cited by Louisiana appellate courts on at least two occasions. <em>See, State v. Raymond, </em>447 So.2d 51 (La. App. 1st Cir.), <em>writ denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>449 So.2d 1347 (La. 1984), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>11-1178 (La.App. 1 Cir. 2/13/12), 90 sold 556, <em>writ </em>denied, 12-538 (La. 9/12/12), 98 So.3d 818.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-5\">. We acknowledge the great difficulty that victims of these types of crimes face in confronting their alleged abusers, as well as the legislative and judicial remedies available in Louisiana to child victim witnesses facing those circumstances in a court of law. In the modern world, where it is not uncommon for witnesses in criminal proceedings to be threatened and intimidated, trial courts need to take the necessary steps to properly protect those who may be placing themselves at personal risk by testifying against a defendant. Equally important to our system of law is ensuring the constitutional rights of accused persons through trial. With respect to the type of issue raised herein, one practice that district courts can employ to protect the interests of both the victim and the accused is a record which, at a minimum, malees clear: a witness's reason, preferably provided as sworn testimony, for not wanting to testify in front of a person or persons in the courtroom, a colloquy stating the court\u2019s own findings and conclusions regarding those stated reasons by the witness, and, if applicable, a showing that any trial court action of a partial or full closure of a courtroom to accommodate a witness\u2019s testimony is an option least likely to restrict a defendant's constitutional right to a public 'trial under the particular circumstances. Proceedings that meet such a standard would, in this Court\u2019s opinion, eliminate an unfortunate circumstance where a Victim, who may very well have a legitimate need to testify with accommodation, is required to testify yet a second time because the trial court\u2019s justification for closing the proceedings to the public' in the first trial is not supported by the record before an' appellate court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b535-5\">. <em>See, State v.
