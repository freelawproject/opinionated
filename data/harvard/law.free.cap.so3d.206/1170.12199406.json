For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-17\">This case arises out of Plaintiff Quiana Lorden\u2019s (Lorden\u2019s) alleged slip and fall that occurred on September 18, 2013, at Merryville. At the time of the incident, Lorden was a direct employee of Southern Care Hospice (Southern Care) and was assisting a hospice patient residing at Mer-ryville. Lorden\u2019s petition alleges that she \u201cwas assisting the patient following a shower that the patient had eompleted[,]\u201d and that, following the shower, \u201cthere was a great deal of water on the floor in the patient\u2019s room.\u201d Therefore, upon Lorden\u2019s request, a housekeeper employed by Mer-ryville was sent to clean the wet floor. According to Lorden, while the housekeeper was cleaning the floor, he \u201cspread the water to formerly dry areas of the room.\u201d Lorden alleges that she then \u201cstepped on an area of the floor that she previously knew to be dry,\u201d slipped and fell, and landed on her knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-18\">Lorden, along with her husband Christopher Lorden, individually, and on behalf of her minor child, Thaddrick Johnson, filed a tort action against Merryville, Merryville Properties, LLC (Merryville Properties), and Paramount Healthcare Consultants, LLC (\u201cPHC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-19\">Zurich American Insurance Company (Zurich), which is Southern Care\u2019s work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>ers\u2019 compensation insurer, intervened in the action, alleging it had paid 1 \u00bfworkers\u2019 compensation indemnity benefits to, or on behalf of Lorden, and that it was entitled to reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">Each of the defendants filed motions for summary judgment. Merryville sought dismissal on the basis that it was Lorden\u2019s statutory employer under La.R.S. 23:1061 and therefore immune from Plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims; Merryville Properties sought dismissal, arguing that it was only responsible for leasing property to Merryville; and PHC sought dismissal because it did not own or manage the property at issue. Plaintiffs opposed only Merryville\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">A hearing was held on October 26, 2015. The trial court granted each of the defendants\u2019 motions and dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 and Zurich\u2019s claims. As to Merryville, the trial court found that Lorden was \u201cin the course and scope of her employment at the time this happened\u201d and, therefore, dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">Plaintiffs appeal only the summary judgment dismissing their claims against Mer-ryville. They argue that material issues of fact exist as to whether Merryville was Lorden\u2019s statutory employer under La. R.S. 23:1061 and/or a borrowing employer under La.R.S. 23:1031; and, therefore, a summary judgment finding that Merryville is immune from Plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims is precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">Zurich also appeals the trial court\u2019s dismissal of its claims against Merryville, arguing that it was error for the trial court to dismiss its claims when the motion for summary judgment did not address its claims and when material issues of fact exist as to whether Merryville is Lorden\u2019s statutory employer and/or borrowing employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-10\">Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 966 (A)(2) explains that the \u201csummary judgment procedure is designed to secure the just, |3speedy, and inexpensive determination\u201d of actions. Further, \u201c[t]he procedure is favored and shall be construed to accomplish these ends.\u201d <em>Id, </em>A summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions, together with the affidavits, if any, admitted for purposes of the motion for summary judgment, show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact, and that mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(B)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-11\">Although the moving party bears the burden of proof on the motion for summary judgment, the movant is not required to negate all essential elements of the adverse party\u2019s claim, action or defense if he or she will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the matter at issue. La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(C)(2). Rather, the movant is required \u201cto point out to the court that there is an absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party\u2019s claim, action, or defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In turn, if the adverse party does not produce sufficient factual support to establish that he or she will be able to satisfy his or her evidentiary burden of proof at trial, there is no \u25a0 genuine issue of material fact. <em>Id. </em>On review, an appellate court considers a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201cusing the same criteria that govern the trial court\u2019s determination of whether summary judgment is appropriate, <em>i.e. </em>whether there is any genuine issue of material fact, and whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Reynolds v. Bordelon, </em>14-2371, p. 3 (La. 6/30/15), 172 So.3d 607, 610.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number><em>Blanks v. Entergy Gulf States La., LLC, </em>15-1094, pp. 3-4 (La.App. 3 Cir. 4/6/16), 189 So.3d 599, 601 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">STATUTORY EMPLOYER</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">Appellants take issue with the trial court granting Merryville\u2019s motion for summary judgment because it found that there was no evidence indicating Lorden was not within the course and scope of her employment at the time of the incident. While we agree that this specific finding' by the trial court is not determinative of 14the issue of Merryville\u2019s tort immunity, we review the record <em>de novo </em>to determine whether it supports a summary judgment dismissal of the claims against Merryville.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">Merryville argues that it is immune from Plaintiffs\u2019 tort action b\u00e9cause it is Lorden\u2019s statutory employer as<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contemplated by La.R.S. 23:1061, which states in part as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-7\">A. (1) Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Subsection, when any \u201cprincipal\u201d as defined in R.S. 23:1032(A)(2)[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>], undertakes to execute any work, which is a part of his trade, business, or occupation and contracts with any person, in this Section referred to as the \u201ccontractor\u201d, for the execution by or under the contractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by the principal, the principal, as a statutory employer, shall be granted the exclusive remedy protections of R.S. 23:1032 and shall be Hable to pay to any employee employed in the execution of the work or to his dependent, any compensation under this Chapter which he would have been liable to pay if the employee had been immediately employed by him ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-11\">(2) A statutory employer relationship shall exist whenever the services or work provided by the immediate employer is contemplated by or included in a contract between the principal and any person or entity other than the employee\u2019s immediate employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAa0\">MerryviUe argues that it is a statutory employer under La.R.S. 23:1061(A)(2), which is often caHed the \u2018\u201ctwo contract\u2019 defense.\u201d <em>Allen v. State ex. rel. Ernest N. Morial-New Orleans Exhibition Hall Auth., </em>02-1072, p. 8 (La. 4/9/03), 842 So.2d 373, 379.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-12\">The \u201ctwo contract\u201d defense applies when: (1) the principal enters into a contract with a third party; (2) pursuant to that \u25a0 contract, work must be performed; and (3) in order for the principal to fulfill its contractual obligation to perform the work, the principal enters into a subcontract for all or part of the work performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-13\">\n<em>iid-</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-14\">Merryville suggests that the two contracts establishing it as Lorden\u2019s statutory employer are (1) an agreement between the hospice patient and Merryville, which it argues is established by the affidavit of Shandel Hambrick, who is an Assistant Administrator of Merryville, and the ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>Mbits attached to the affidavit, and (2) a written \u201cSkilled Nursing Facility Contract\u201d between Southern Care and Merry-ville, dated March 25, 2003. Merryville argues that these contracts establish that it subcontracted with Southern Care for the performance of certain services it had agreed to provide to the hospice patient and, therefore, it is a statutory employer of Southern Care\u2019s employees, including Lorden, under La.R.S. 23:1061(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">Appellants argue there are material issues of fact regarding the relationship between Merryville and Southern Care, their duties, and whether Merryville had any obligation to provide hospice services to its patients, thereby precluding a summary judgment finding that Merryville is a statutory employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Our interpretation of the contracts at issue is governed by the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1245-7\">\u201c[W]hen a contract can be construed from the four corners of the instrument without looking to extrinsic evidence, the question of contractual interpretation is answered as a matter of law.\u201d \u201cInterpretation of a contract is the determination of the common intent of the parties.\u201d The reasonable intention of the parties to a contract is to be sought by examining the words of the contract itself, and not assumed. \u201cWhen the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences, no further interpretation may be made in' search of the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d Common intent is determined, therefore, in accordance with the general, ordinary, plain and popular meaning of the words used in the contract. Accordingly, when a clause in a contract is clear and unambiguous, the letter of that clause should not be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit, as it is not the duty of the courts to bend the meaning of the words of a |ficontract into harmony with a supposed reasonable intention of the parties. Most importantly, a contract \u201cmust be interpreted in a common-sense fashion, according to the words of the contract their common and usual significance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\"><em>Prejean v. Guillory, </em>10-740, pp. 6-7 (La. 7/2/10), 38 So.3d 274, 279 (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1245-10\">A contract is considered ambiguous on the issue of intent when either it lacks a provision bearing on that issue, the terms of a written contract are susceptible to more than one interpretation, there is uncertainty or ambiguity as to its provisions, or the intent of the parties cannot be ascertained from the language employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\"><em>Campbell v.

Provide an activities program-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-14\">8. Furnish bed linens and Resident gowns as required ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1246-15\">It is undisputed that Merryville was providing services to the hospice patient in this case. However, Hambrick\u2019s affidavit and the attached exhibits are insufficient to establish the extent of any agreement between the patient and Mer-ryville, or the services Merryville had agreed to provide the patient. The affidavit does not state that the documents attached to it were the same documents that the patient in the instant case signed, or the same documents that every patient signs. In addition, there is no evidence indicating that the patient in this case was receiving skilled nursing services or non-skilled nursing services; therefore, it is unknown whether a terms and conditions document applied, even if the documents attached to the affidavit reflected Merryville\u2019s agreement with the hospice patient in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-17\">|sWe next review the \u201cSkilled Nursing Facility Contract\u201d between Southern Care and Merryville, dated March 25, 2003. It contains the following language (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-18\">WHEREAS, [Southern Care] administers a program of palliative and supportive services, including interdisciplinary services to meet the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs of terminally ill persons and their families; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atcq\">WT3EREAS, [Merryville] is a duly licensed, skilled nursing facility providing nursing facility services to its residents and desires to make hospice services available to such residents[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAq0Ib\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-19\">NOW THERFORE, [Merryville] and [Southern Care] ... do hereby agree each with the other as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-20\">1. Eligible Patients</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-21\">[Merryville] agrees to admit hospice patients referred to it by [Southern Care] for respite and long term care, including those who may be eligible for hospice Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. This will, of course, be subject to [Merryville\u2019s] usual admission criteria and the availability of beds in the Facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-22\">[Southern Care] agrees to provide Hospice services to residents of [Merryville] who have voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>elected to receive Hospice care and who have complied with the admission criteria of Hospice and state and federal laws pertaining to the provision of Hospice services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-5\">2. Services to be Furnished by [Merry-ville]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-7\">[Merryville] will provide the resident of [Merryville], who is a Hospice patient with the nursing, dietary, housekeeping, and other services normally offered by a licensed nursing facility, depending on the level of care required by the patient which [Merryville] would have provided in the absence of a Hospice program and which are subject to the patient\u2019s Hospice plan of care. These services include, but are not limited to, room and board, medications not related to the management of the terminal illness, nursing and personal care as provided to other residents of the Facility, and the Facility\u2019s normal [9program of therapies and activities unrelated to the patient\u2019s terminal illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-8\">With respect to the management of the patient\u2019s terminal illness, [Merry-ville] agrees to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-9\">A.

Services to Be Provided by [Southern Care]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-14\">A.Education: [Southern Care] will conduct such inservice education for [Merryville\u2019s] staff as is agreed upon by [Southern Care] and [Merryville] to educate the staff about the activities, philosophy, and services of [Southern Care]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-16\">B. Physicians: The Hospice patient\u2019s personal physician shall be responsible for the direct medical care of the patient ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-17\">C.

The Hospice plan will specify which services are related to the patient\u2019s terminal illness, and therefore, will be furnished by Hospice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-18\">D.

[Merryville] shall provide medical equipment and medical supplies to Hospice Impatients that are ordinarily supplied to [Merryville] patients[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pASTB\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-20\">. 9. Retention of Responsibility:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-21\">[Merryville] agrees that [Southern Care] retains the responsibility for planning, coordinating, prescribing and documenting hospice services and care on behalf of the patient and the family of the patient, and [Merry-ville] agrees that [Southern Care] retains responsibility for appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>hospice care training of the personnel who provide the care under this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pANi\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-4\">12. Indemnification</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-5\">[Southern Care] shall not be liable under any contract or obligations of [Merryville], except as otherwise provided pursuant to this Agreement, or for any act or omission of the [Merry-ville] ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-6\">[Merryville] shall not be liable under any contracts or obligations of [Southern Care], except as otherwise provided pursuant to this Agreement, or for any act or omission of [Southern Care]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-7\">It is expressly understood that both parties to this Agreement are independent contractors and engage in the operation of their own respective businesses. Neither party is, or is considered as, an agent of the other party for any purpose whatsoever. Neither party has authority to enter into contract for the other party or make any warranties or representations on behalf of the other party. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to establish a relationship of copartners or joint ventures between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">The language in the \u201cSkilled Nursing Facility Contract\u201d indicates that Southern Care and Merryville agreed to provide two different sets of services to Merryville residents who are eligible to receive, and have elected to receive, hospice sendees. Southern Care provides hospice services, which are services related to the patient\u2019s terminal illness that are specified in the patient\u2019s Hospice | nplan. Merryville, on the other hand, provides nursing facility services, which includes services normally offered by a licensed nursing facility that are unrelated to the patient\u2019s terminal illness and that are not specified in the patient\u2019s hospice plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">However, there is no applicable hospice plan in the record in this case, therefore it is unknown what services Southern Care agreed to provide to the patient. The record also does not establish that Merryville would have provided the patient with hospice services pertaining to the patient\u2019s terminal illness had it not contracted with Southern Care. Therefore, we find that material issues of fact remain concerning whether Merryville entered into a subcontract with Southern Care for the performance of all or part of the services that Merryville agreed to provide the patient in this case. Consequently, a summary judgment finding that Merryville is the statutory employer of Lorden under the \u201ctwo contract defense\u201d contemplated by La.R.S. 23:1061(A)(2) is premature and thereby precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">BORROWING EMPLOYER</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">Appellants also argue on appeal that the record is insufficient to establish that Merryville is immune from their tort claims on the basis that it is a borrowing, or special, employer under La.R.S. 23:1031(C), which states (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-12\">In the case of any employee for whose injury or death payments are due and who is, at the time of the injury, employed by a borrowing employer in this Section referred to as a \u201cspecial employer\u201d, and is under the control and direction of the special employer in the performance of the work, both the special employer and the immediate employer, referred to in this Section as a \u201cgeneral employer\u201d, shall be liable jointly and in solido to pay benefits as provided under this Chapter. ... The special and the general employers shall be entitled to the exclusive remedy protections provided in R.S. 23:1032.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-13\">ln&gt;We agree with Appellants. Merryville did not submit the issue of whether it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>Lorden\u2019s borrowing employer to the trial court in connection with its summary judgment, and it does not argue on the appeal that it is Lorden\u2019s borrowing employer. The record before us does not establish that Merryville is Lorden\u2019s borrowing employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">ZURICH\u2019S CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Zurich also argues on appeal that it was improper for the trial court to dismiss its claims when Merryville\u2019s motion for summary judgment did not address Zurich\u2019s claims and was not served on Zurich. Because we have found that a summary judgment dismissal of Appellants\u2019 claims is not supported by the record, this issue presented by Zurich is thereby rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs and Zurich\u2019s claims against Merry-ville, and we remand the matter for further proceedings. Costs of this appeal are assessed to Appellee, Merryville Rehabilitation, LP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">.
