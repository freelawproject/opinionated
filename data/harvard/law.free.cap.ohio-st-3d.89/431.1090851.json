First, we must determine whether the records in question are \u201cpublic records\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 149.43. If these records are not public records but rather are confidential investigatory materials, then we must determine whether the presence of a nonagent, third party during witness interviews constitutes a waiver of confidentiality in the otherwise privileged material.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">I. Confidentiality of Investigatory Records</p>\n<p id=\"aty-dedup-0\">Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act is codified in R.C. 149.43 <em>et seq. </em>The statute defines \u201c[pjublic record\u201d as \u201cany record that is kept by any public office.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1). The term \u201cpublic office\u201d includes \u201cany state agency * * * established by the laws of this state for the exercise of any function of government.\u201d R.C. 149.011(A). R.C. 149.43 must be construed liberally in favor of broad access to records kept by public offices, and any doubt is to be resolved in favor of disclosure of the records. <em>State ex rel. Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Petro </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 261, 264, 685 N.E.2d 1223, 1227, citing <em>State ex rel. Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. Shirey </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 400, 401, 678 N.E.2d 557, 559. Additionally, mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43. R.C. 149.43(C); see, also, <em>State ex rel. Multimedia, Inc. v. Snowden </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 141, 142, 647 N.E.2d 1374, 1377, citing <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 426, 639 N.E.2d 83, 88-89. With these standards in mind, we now proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">A. Medical Board Records</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The Medical Board is a \u201cpublic office\u201d for the purposes of R.C. 149.43. Former R.C. 4731.22(C)(1), the applicable provision governing Medical Board investigations, stated, \u201cInformation received by the board pursuant to an investigation shall be confidential and not subject to discovery in any civil action.\u201d 146 Ohio Laws, Part V, 8765. (The current version is codified at R.C. 4731.22[F][5] and is virtually the same.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In <em>State Med. Bd. of Ohio v. Murray </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 527, 536, 613 N.E.2d 636, 642-643, we held that information contained in the Medical Board\u2019s records \u201cis to be kept confidential at all times and is not, under any circumstances, * * * discoverable in a civil action.\u201d Based on the plain language employed in R.C. 4731.22, language that we previously deemed a \u201cclear legislative directive,\u201d we hold that the Medical Board\u2019s investigative records are not public records. <em>Id. </em>at 536, 613 N.E.2d at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">R.C. 149.43(A)(1) defines \u201cpublic record\u201d and enumerates exceptions from the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d for purposes of the Public Records Act. \u201cRecords the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law\u201d are not public records. R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(q), formerly R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(p), 146 Ohio Laws, Part I, 134. In enacting former R.C. 4731.22(C)(1), the General Assembly specifically exempted the Medical Board\u2019s investigative records from disclosure under R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Having determined that the Medical Board\u2019s investigative records are not public records within the meaning of R.C. 149.43, we must now determine whether the Medical Board waived its right to confidentiality by allowing Wilson, a third party, to attend witness interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Former R.C. 4731.22(C)(1) mandated that the board \u201cconduct all investigations and proceedings in such a manner as to protect patient confidentiality. The board shall not make public names or other identifying information about patients unless proper consent is given or a waiver of the patient privilege exists\u201d under R.C. 2317.02(B). 146 Ohio Laws, Part V, 8766. (This mandate remains unchanged in the current version of R.C. 4731.22. See R.C. 4731.22[F][5]. Moreover, this current version requires the board to protect confidentiality not only of patients but also of persons who file complaints with the board.) This provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>contains safeguards designed to protect patient confidentiality in the same manner that the physician-patient privilege protects patient confidences. <em>State Med. Bd. of Ohio v. Miller </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 136, 138, 541 N.E.2d 602, 604. The court of appeals correctly recognized that by allowing Wilson to attend witness interviews, the Medical Board violated its duty to maintain the confidentiality in the information it gathered. We agree that it was improper for the Medical Board to give a private third party access to this information. Thus, the issue remains whether the Medical Board\u2019s breach of confidentiality constitutes a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">One physician, Dr. Semertzides, authorized the release of information gathered at an interview attended by Wilson. The court of appeals determined that by signing the release Semertzides waived his privilege of confidentiality with regard to information gathered at his interview. Consequently, the court of appeals directed the trial court to release the records pertaining to Semertzides and to withhold any information concerning anyone else whose privacy rights were implicated. The court ordered that all other records should remain confidential because \u201c[wjithout a valid waiver from all persons whose privacy rights are implicated, these records may not be disclosed under, the Public Records Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">\u2018Waiver\u201d is defined as a voluntary relinquishment of a known right. See <em>Chubb v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 275, 278, 690 N.E.2d 1267, 1269, citing <em>State ex rel. Athens Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Gallia, Jackson, Meigs, Vinton Joint Solid Waste Mgt. Dist. Bd. of Directors </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 611, 616, 665 N.E.2d 202, 207. Persons may either expressly or impliedly waive statutory provisions intended for their own benefit, but statutory provisions cannot be waived when they are intended for the benefit of others. See <em>Brannock v. Brannock </em>(1986), 104 N.M. 385, 386, 722 P.2d 636, 637; see, also, <em>State v. Ventura </em>(1999), 101 Ohio Misc.2d 15, 19, 720 N.E.2d 1024, 1027. Moreover, it is a well-settled general principle that no party has the power to waive matters that affect third parties, because the holder of the privilege is the only one who has the power to relinquish it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Several groups have a privilege of confidentiality in the Medical Board\u2019s investigative files. <em>In re Kralik </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 232, 236, 655 N.E.2d 273, 275. These groups include patients, physicians who are under investigation, investigation witnesses, and any other persons whose confidentiality right is implicated by a Medical Board investigation. <em>Id. </em>The holder of the confidentiality privilege is the one who must waive it before the contents of the Medical Board\u2019s investigative files relating to that person may be divulged. <em>Id. </em>Hence, when someone who is not authorized to waive the privilege discloses privileged information, the information remains privileged. <em>State v. Shipley </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 771, 775, 641 N.E.2d 822, 825, citing <em>Powers v. Chicago Transit Auth. </em>(C.A.7, 1989), 890 F.2d 1355, 1357-1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>By permitting Wilson to attend Medical Board interviews with witnesses, the Medical Board waived its own confidentiality privilege; however, the Medical Board cannot unilaterally waive others\u2019 privileges to confidentiality, because the Medical Board is not the holder of those privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The court of appeals properly ordered an <em>in camera </em>review of records pertaining to the interview with Semertzides and the release of those records after they are redacted to protect the confidentiality of anyone else who has not waived the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">B. Insurance Department Records</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The State Department of Insurance is a \u201cpublic office\u201d for purposes of R.C. 149.43. At issue is R.C. 3901.44, which relates to insurance fraud investigatory records.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Former R.C. 3901.44(A) stated: \u201cAll papers, documents, reports, and evidence in the possession of the division of insurance fraud of the department of insurance that pertain to an investigation conducted or authorized by the division are confidential law enforcement investigatory records under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. Notwithstanding such section, the division shall not prohibit public inspection of such records that pertain to an investigation after the expiration of all federal and state statutes of limitations applicable to the particular offense to which the papers, documents, reports, and evidence relate.\u201d 142 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4579. (The current version, codified at R.C. 3901.44[B], is substantially the same.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Former R.C. 3901.44(A)\u2019s explicit reference to R.C. 149.43 requires that the two sections be read in conjunction. \u201cConfidential law enforcement investigatory records\u201d are not public records for purposes of R.C. 149.43. Former R.C. 149.43(A)(1), now R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(h). However, this is not the end of the inquiry. R.C. 149.43(A)(2) defines \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory records\u201d as \u201cany record that pertains to a law enforcement matter of criminal, quasi-criminal, civil, or administrative nature, <em>but only to the extent that the release of the record would create a high probability of disclosure of any of the following: .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">\u201c(a) The identity of a suspect who has not been charged with the offense to which the record pertains, or of an information source or witness to whom confidentiality has been reasonably promised;</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">\u201c(b) Information provided by an information source or witness to whom confidentiality has been reasonably promised, which information would reasonably tend to disclose the source\u2019s or witness\u2019s identity;</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">\u201c(c) Specific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures or specific investigatory work product;</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201c(d) Information that would endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel, a crime victim, a witness, or a confidential information source.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The Insurance Department invites this court to hold that analysis pursuant to R.C. 149.43 is unnecessary because the plain language of R.C. 3901.44 specifically deems insurance fraud investigatory records \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory records\u201d under R.C. 149.43. We decline to adopt this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">A two-step analysis is required when exempting records from release under R.C. 149.43(A)(2). <em>State ex rel. Multimedia, Inc. v. Snowden </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 141, 142, 647 N.E.2d 1374, 1377. The first inquiry is whether the record in question is a confidential law enforcement record. The second inquiry is whether releasing the record would create a high probability of disclosure of any of the four categories of information specified in R.C. 149.43(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The language employed by the General Assembly in former R.C. 3901.44(A), now (B), answers the first query in the affirmative. In essence, what R.C. 3901.44 does is classify insurance fraud investigatory records as \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory records\u201d under R.C. 149.43. Thus, the next step is to ascertain whether any of the exemptions in R.C. 149.43(A)(2) apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">\u201c[E]xeeptions to disclosure must be strictly construed against the custodian of the public records, and the burden to establish an exception is on the custodian.\u201d <em>Multimedia, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 142, 647 N.E.2d at 1377, citing <em>State ex rel. James v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 168, 169, 637 N.E.2d 911, 912; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. Petro </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 261, 266, 685 N.E.2d 1223, 1228; <em>State ex rel. McCleary v. Roberts </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 365, 370, 725 N.E.2d 1144, 1148-1149. Our duty requires us to strictly construe confidential law enforcement investigatory records and \u201cresolve any doubts in favor of disclosure.\u201d <em>Multimedia, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 143, 647 N.E.2d at 1378. Generally, in the absence of evidence that the custodian of the records disclosed them contents to the public, the exemptions are fully applicable. <em>Petro, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 265, 685 N.E.2d at 1227; see, also, <em>State ex rel. WLWT-TV5 v. Leis </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 357, 361, 673 N.E.2d 1365, 1369-1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Application of a statutory exemption to a particular document is best accomplished by an <em>in camera </em>inspection. See <em>Henneman v. Toledo </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 241, 243, 520 N.E.2d 207, 210. Based on the limited record before us, we are unable to discern the nature of the records at issue. Consequently, the trial court is the tribunal best equipped to inspect these documents <em>in camera, </em>to determine whether their release \u201cwould create a high probability of disclosure\u201d of any of the material specified in R.C. 149.43(A)(2), and to withhold any information that falls within a statutory exemption. After examination of the investigatory files, material that does not fall within an exemption must be disclosed upon a request made pursuant to R.C. 149.43, and any exempted information should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>withheld. See <em>Franklin Cty. Sheriff\u2019s Dept. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 498, 589 N.E.2d 24, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Having concluded that a two-part inquiry is required in order to determine whether insurance fraud investigatory records, which R.C. 3901.44 designates \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory records\u201d for purposes of R.C. 149.43, are exempted from release, we now turn to the question of whether the Insurance Department waived its right to rely on any applicable exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">R.C. 149.43\u2019s exemptions are \u201cusually fully applicable absent evidence that the public office having custody of the records disclosed the records to the public.\u201d <em>Petro, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 265, 685 N.E.2d at 1227. Wilson, an investigator employed by Anthem, was present at several witness interviews conducted by Raising. During the investigation of the appellees, Wilson attended these interviews as a representative of Anthem and brought with him a working knowledge of the insurance industry and his employer. At no time during his investigation of the appellees did Raising share or disclose the contents of the Insurance Department\u2019s investigatory file with Wilson. Investigations into insurance fraud are not conducted in a vacuum. Investigators working for private insurance companies may have occasion to interact with investigators from the Insurance Department. As a matter of fact, R.C. 3999.42, which went into effect in March 1998, requires that insurers having a \u201creasonable belief that a person is perpetrating or facilitating an insurance fraud * * * notify the department of insurance.\u201d Although Wilson is a member of the public, his presence at witness interviews conducted by the Insurance Department is not tantamount to a public disclosure and does not effectuate a waiver of any applicable statutory exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Thus, the court of appeals properly remanded this cause so that the trial court could conduct an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the records in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The Public Records Act serves a laudable purpose by ensuring that governmental functions are not conducted behind a shroud of secrecy. However, even in a society where an open government is considered essential to maintaining a properly functioning democracy, not every iota of information is subject to public scrutiny. Certain safeguards are necessary. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b666-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b666-12\">Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3X\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree that the Medical Board\u2019s investigative records are not public records and that the Medical Board waived its own \u2014 and only its own \u2014 confidentiality privilege with respect to the Medical Board records discussed in Part IA of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s judgment that the insurance department records discussed in Part IB might be subject to public disclosure under the Public Records Act. Former R.C. 3901.44 explicitly categorizes the insurance department documents at issue as \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory records [and thereby excepted from public disclosure as \u2018public records\u2019] under section 149.43,\u201d which precludes the judiciary from reaching a contrary result. The majority analyzes the applicability of the \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory records\u201d exception and concludes that it does not apply, when the statute plainly states otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">We are not privileged to ignore the plain and unambiguous language of a statute. <em>State v. Krutz </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 36, 38, 28 OBR 96, 97, 502 N.E.2d 210, 211. To hold as the majority does is to do just that.</p>\n<judges id=\"b667-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b667-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A02\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I dissent with respect to whether the presence of a third party at witness interviews constituted a waiver of the State Medical Board\u2019s privilege of confidentiality. I also join Justice Cook\u2019s dissent and would find that insurance department records are not subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act. I concur as to the remainder of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Under Part IB of the majority\u2019s opinion, \u201cInsurance Department Records,\u201d the majority concludes that the presence of Anthem\u2019s investigator did not constitute a waiver of the Department of Insurance\u2019s privilege of confidentiality. I would apply the same rationale to Part IA and find that the investigator\u2019s presence also did not constitute a waiver of the Medical Board\u2019s privilege. There is no reason to distinguish between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">An insurance fraud investigator is integral to the work of both the Department of Insurance and the Medical Board to uncover fraud or handle allegations of unauthorized medical practice. The investigator possesses the expertise, knowledge, and investigative background that enable the Medical Board and Department of Insurance to determine the direction of their own investigations. At times, there were joint investigations that involved the investigator for the State Medical Board, Patricia Elliss, the Department of Insurance investigator, Robert Raising, and Anthem\u2019s investigator, Richard Wilson. They worked together to gather evidence and interview witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>The allegations being investigated involved issues of fraudulent billing, with complex billing codes and methods. The use of experts, such as Anthem\u2019s investigator, is crucial in helping the Medical Board to effectively conduct its investigation. The majority recognizes this importance to the Department of Insurance yet somehow excludes the Medical Board from obtaining the same benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The majority does not address the effect of its decision upon the presence of other third parties; however, the logical extension is that victims and other parties who wish to have a trusted advisor, family member, or friend present at their interview will now waive the confidentiality of their statements. This could affect a victim\u2019s willingness to report wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">We should hold that the presence of an insurance investigator who is an active participant in the investigation of the wrongdoing at a witness interview does not result in a waiver of the confidentiality of the Medical Board\u2019s investigative records.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
