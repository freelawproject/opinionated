Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avy\">The issue presented in this case is whether an attorney can be compelled to disclose to the grand jury a letter written by a client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>and discovered by an investigator that contains evidence of a possible crime or whether the Ohio Code of Professional Responsibility prohibits such disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">At the outset, we understand that appellant was faced with an ethical dilemma and had the difficult decision of determining how to respond to the competing challenges of maintaining client confidentiality and preserving the safety concerns of the public. We appreciate that appellant confronted the problem head-on by first asking the Secretary of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court for advice on whether he had an obligation to report a possible crime and then by heeding that advice by reporting the matter to the court and cooperating with the police. Nevertheless, for the reasons that follow, we find that appellant must comply with the grand jury subpoena and relinquish the letter in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The concept of client confidentiality, including the attorney\u2019s ethical obligations concerning confidentiality, is embodied in DR 4-101. DR 4-101(A) defines the terms \u201cconfidence\u201d and \u201csecret\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\u201c \u2018Confidence\u2019 refers to information protected by the attorney-client privilege under applicable law and \u2018secret\u2019 refers to other information gained in the professional relationship that the client has requested to be held inviolate or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or would be likely detrimental to the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">DR 4-101(B) states, \u201cExcept when permitted under DR 4-101(C), a lawyer shall not knowingly * * * [rjeveal a confidence or secret of a client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">We must first determine whether the letter sought falls within the definition of a client \u201csecret.\u201d Unlike \u201cconfidence,\u201d which is limited to information an attorney obtains directly from his or her client, the term \u201csecret\u201d is defined in broad terms. Therefore, a client secret includes information obtained from third-party sources, including \u201cinformation obtained by a lawyer from witnesses, by personal investigation, or by an investigation of an agent of the lawyer, disclosure of which would be embarrassing or harmful to the client.\u201d Guttenberg &amp; Snyder, The Law of Professional Responsibility in Ohio (1992), Section 9.2, at 228; Hazard, Under Shelter of Confidentiality (1999), 50 Case W.Res.L.Rev. 1, 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">The court of appeals found that the letter was not a secret because it was not <em>information </em>gained in the professional relationship. Instead, the court said that the letter was simply physical evidence, which needed to be disclosed to the authorities. Even though the letter does constitute physical evidence of a possible crime, it also contains information detrimental to appellant. Thus, we find that the letter falls within the definition of a client \u201csecret,\u201d since it was obtained in the professional attorney-client relationship, by appellant\u2019s agent (the investigator), and since it contains detrimental information detailing a possible crime committed by appellant\u2019s former client.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Although the letter is a client secret, this does not necessarily mean that disclosure of the letter is absolutely prohibited. An attorney may disclose a client secret if one of the four listed exceptions in DR 4 \u2014 101(C) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Appellant concedes that DR 4 \u2014 101(C)(3) permits him to \u201creveal * * * [t]he intention of his client to commit a crime and the information necessary to prevent the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, appellant contends that this provision is narrow in its scope and permits him to orally disclose the information contained in the letter, but does not permit him to disclose the physical evidence (the letter). Therefore, appellant maintains that DR 4-101(C)(3) did not permit him to reveal more than he did when he orally disclosed the intention of his former client to commit a crime and prevented a crime from occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">We agree with appellant that he was authorized by DR 4-101(0(3) when he chose to reveal the intent of his client to commit a crime, and, actually, went beyond what DR 4-101(0(3) allows by reading the entire letter to the trial court and police. However, the fact that he revealed this information does not answer the question whether he is obligated to produce the letter itself. Thus, the question that remains is whether appellant is required to relinquish the letter itself and present it to the grand jury. We find that the exception found in DR 4-102(0(2) governs disposition of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">DR 4-101(0(2) provides that an attorney may reveal \u201c[c]onfidences or secrets when permitted under Disciplinary Rules or required by law or court order.\u201d Although the language contained in DR 4-101(C)(2), like that of DR 4 \u2014 101(C)(3), is written in permissive terms, courts have interpreted provisions similar to DR 4-101(C)(2) in such a manner as to require disclosure. The exception of DR 4-101(C)(2) for disclosures required by law has been construed so that \u201cthe effect of other rules * * * compel[s] disclosures.\u201d Hodes, The Code of Professional Responsibility, The Kutak Rules, and the Trial Lawyer\u2019s Code: Surprisingly, Three Peas in a Pod (1981), 35 U. Miami L.Rev. 739, 791. Consequently, if a lawyer is \u201crequired by law\u201d to disclose information to the authorities, \u201cthese legal obligations create \u2018forced\u2019 exceptions to confidentiality.\u201d 1 Hazard <em>&amp; </em>Hodes, The Law of Lawyering: A Handbook on the Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2 Ed.1990) 183, Section 1.6:310. Under these circumstances, a lawyer\u2019s duty \u201cnot to use or disclose confidential client information * * * is superseded when the law specifically requires such use or disclosure.\u201d Restatement of the Law 3d, Law Governing Lawyers (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 1996), Section 115, Comment <em>a.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The exception of DR 4 \u2014 101(C)(2) for disclosures required by law has been applied in the context of mandating that attorneys relinquish evidence and instrumentalities of crime to law-enforcement agencies. Thus, the rule has emerged that, despite any confidentiality concerns, a criminal defense attorney must produce real evidence obtained from his or her client or from a third-party source, regardless of whether the evidence is mere evidence of a client\u2019s crime, see, <em>e.g., Morrell v. Alaska </em>(1978), 575 P.2d 1200, or is a fruit or instrumentality of a crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In either event, the physical evidence must be turned over to the proper authorities. See <em>In re Ryder </em>(C.A.4, 1967), 381 F.2d 713 (holding that an attorney abuses his professional responsibility by knowingly taking possession of and secreting the fruits and instrumentalities of a crime); <em>State v. Green </em>(La.1986), 493 So.2d 1178 (holding that the attorney had an obligation to relinquish client\u2019s gun, an instrumentality of a crime, to authorities). In essence, the confidentiality rules do not give an attorney the right to withhold evidence. See <em>People v. Lee </em>(1970), 3 Cal.App.3d 514, 526, 83 Cal.Rptr. 715, 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Appellant contends, however, that there are strong policy reasons against mandating disclosure. Appellant believes that mandatory disclosure will discourage attorneys from reporting possible threats made by their clients and will therefore run contrary to the intent of the code, which is to prevent crimes from occurring. Appellant cites the Massachusetts decision of <em>Purcell v. Dist. Atty. for Suffolk Dist. </em>(1997), 424 Mass. 109, 676 N.E.2d 436, which highlights these concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In <em>Purcell, </em>an attorney informed police about his client\u2019s intention to commit arson. The trial court ordered the attorney to testify about the conversation he had with his client concerning his client\u2019s intention to commit this crime, and the state defended the order on the basis of ,the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. The Massachusetts Supreme Court vacated the trial court\u2019s order and held that the attorney did not have to testify against his client. In so holding, the court noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\"><em>\u201cWe </em>must be cautious in permitting the use of client communications that a lawyer has revealed only because of a threat to others. Lawyers will be reluctant to come forward if they know that the information that they disclose may lead to adverse consequences to their clients. A practice of the use of such disclosures might prompt a lawyer to warn a client in advance that the disclosure of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>information may not be held in confidence, thereby chilling free discourse between lawyer and client and reducing the prospect that the lawyer will learn of a serious threat to the well-being of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Although these may be valid concerns, we find that the <em>Purcell </em>decision is distinguishable from the instant case, and that the policy reasons cited in <em>Purcell </em>have less validity here. <em>Purcell </em>involved direct communications between an attorney and client. The issue in that case was whether the attorney was required to testify against his client. In this case, the attorney-client privilege is not at issue. Nor is appellant being asked to testify against his former client. Instead, the instant case revolves around whether a physical piece of evidence must be relinquished to the grand jury. While we recognize the importance of maintaining a client\u2019s confidences and secrets and understand that an attorney may have concerns in turning over incriminating evidence against his or her client, we do not believe that these concerns should override the public interest in maintaining public safety and promoting the administration of justice by prosecuting individuals for their alleged criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Since the letter sought in this case contains evidence of a possible crime, we find that the letter must be turned over to the grand jury. Accordingly, we hold that where an attorney receives physical evidence from a third party relating to a possible crime committed by his or her client, the attorney is obligated to relinquish that evidence to law-enforcement authorities and must comply with a subpoena issued to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Other provisions of the code support our holding that appellant must relinquish the letter to the grand jury. DR 7-109(A) provides, \u201cA lawyer shall not suppress any evidence that he or his client has a legal obligation to reveal or produce.\u201d Furthermore, DR 7 \u2014 102(A)(3) provides, \u201cIn his representation of a client,'a lawyer shall not * * * [cjonceal or knowingly fail to disclose that which he is required by law to reveal.\u201d Reading these rules together, we believe that under the facts presented in this case, appellant has a legal obligation to turn the letter over to the grand jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">We agree with the court of appeals that the sanction imposed against appellant stemming from the contempt proceedings should be vacated, given that appellant challenged the subpoena on confidentiality grounds in good faith. See <em>Seventh Elect Church in Israel v. Rogers </em>(1984), 102 Wash.2d 527, 688 P.2d 506. Under these circumstances, we do not believe appellant should be punished and held in contempt. The finding of contempt is vacated on condition that appellant comply with the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and order appellant to relinquish the letter in question to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b778-6\">Moyek, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b778-7\">Cook, J., concurs in judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b778-8\">Douglas, Kennedy and Pfeifer, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b778-9\">John P.

Appellant points out that this provision is written in permissive terms, since it states that a lawyer \u201cmay\u201d reveal the client\u2019s intent to commit a crime. We acknowledge that DR 4 \u2014 101(C)(3) is permissive. Nevertheless, this has no bearing on the outcome in this case, since appellant concedes that he already disclosed the relevant information to the authorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-8\">. In <em>MorreU, </em>the Supreme Court of Alaska held that a criminal defense attorney was obligated to turn over to authorities a legal pad containing a kidnapping plan written by his client that was given to him by his client\u2019s friend. Although the main issue before the court in <em>Moirell </em>was whether the defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel, the decision is applicable to this case, since the court also addressed the interplay between the relevant disciplinary rules, including the rules regarding clients\u2019 secrets. See <em>id. </em>at 1211, fn. 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\">. Although appellant has not concealed any evidence, we also note that a person may be charged with obstruction of justice under R.C. 2921.32, for concealment of physical evidence of a crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b778-10\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3m\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with the majority that the letter is a client secret and that Helmick was authorized to reveal the intent of his client to commit a crime. DR 4-101(0(3). Revealing \u201cthe information necessary to prevent the crime,\u201d DR 4-101(0(3), should have concluded the matter. Unfortunately, the trial court and now a majority of this court chose to read DR 4-101(0(2) liberally. That reading of the exception swallows the rule of DR 4-101(B)(l), which states that a lawyer \u201cshall not knowingly * * * [rjeveal a confidence or secret of his client,\u201d and declares open season on defense attorney files.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">The majority relies on cases from other jurisdictions in which attorneys were required to turn over to the proper authorities the fruits and instrumentalities, including a gun, of crime. <em>E.g., In re Ryder </em>(C.A.4, 1967), 381 F.2d 713; <em>State v. Green </em>(La.1986), 493 So.2d 1178. Those cases are not similar factually to this case. <em>Purcell v. Dist. Atty. for Suffolk Dist. </em>(1997), 424 Mass. 109, 676 N.E.2d 436, is, and we should have taken a similarly cautious approach. Otherwise, \u201c[ljawyers will be reluctant to come forward if they know that the information that they disclose may lead to adverse consequences to their clients * * *, thereby chilling free discourse between lawyer and client and reducing the prospect that the lawyer will learn of a serious threat to the well-being of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 676 N.E.2d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">Helmick acted the way all attorneys with an ethical dilemma should: he sought out competent counsel and followed the advice given. He acted in a manner designed to prevent the commission of a crime, which is what the (C)(3) exception to DR 4-101 is all about.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">Today\u2019s opinion will likely have two unfortunate results. First, overzealous prosecutors will be more likely to engage in fishing expeditions. Second, attorneys and their clients will be less likely to discuss potential crimes, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>will decrease the likelihood that the crimes can be prevented. I concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b779-5\">Douglas and Kennedy, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
