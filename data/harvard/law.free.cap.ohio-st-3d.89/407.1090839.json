Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Here, the commission examined the totality of circumstances and rejected claimant\u2019s assertion of a sudden onset of temporary total disability coinciding with his violation of White Swan\u2019s substance abuse policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">The commission acknowledged claimant\u2019s medical treatment prior to his termination but stressed that his allowed condition had not prevented him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>working before then. The commission further emphasized that claimant reported for his regular shift on September 4, 1997, and did not complain of any work-prohibitive problems at that time. It was only after claimant tested positive for alcohol consumption that his condition suddenly became work-prohibitive. Based on this evidence, the commission did not abuse its discretion in denying TTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
