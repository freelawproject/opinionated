For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">A trial court may grant a new trial for various specified reasons, including an \u201c[ijrregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, magistrate, or prevailing party.\u201d Civ.R. 59(A)(1). Even absent one of the grounds specified, a trial court may grant a new trial \u201cin the sound discretion of the court for good cause shown.\u201d Civ.R. 59(A)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">There is a rule of long standing in Ohio that a trial court ought not to \u201creverse a judgment because of the misconduct of a juror unless prejudice to the complaining party is shown.\u201d <em>State v. Hipkins </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 80, 83, 23 O.O.3d 123, 125, 430 N.E.2d 943, 946. See <em>Armleder v. Lieberman </em>(1877), 33 Ohio St. 77, 1877 WL 165, paragraph one of the syllabus. We have applied this rule to a number of cases involving ordinary juror misconduct. <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 230, 233, 703 N.E.2d 286, 290 (juror asked question of psychologist friend before beginning of deliberations); <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 527, 684 N.E.2d 47, 60-61 (juror discussed the jury process with non-jurors during trial); <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 480, 620 N.E.2d 50, 67 (juror asked a testifying detective \u201chow he was feeling\u201d); <em>Hipkins, </em>69 Ohio St.2d at 83, 23 O.O.3d at 125, 430 N.E.2d at 945-946 (juror had brief conversation with witness). However, the case before us involves extraordinary misconduct where a stranger to the jury entered the jury room and remained there throughout the entire deliberative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Since this is a case of first instance in our state, we have reviewed several similar cases adjudicated in other states. One court has held that allowing alternate jurors to be present during jury deliberations for ten minutes is enough to taint a jury. <em>Commonwealth v. Krick </em>(1949), 164 Pa.Super. 516, 520-521, 67 A.2d 746, 749. Another court stated that alternate jurors \u201creally are not jurors. When they attend jury deliberations they do so as mere strangers.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Smith </em>(1988), 403 Mass. 489, 494, 531 N.E.2d 556, 559. See <em>Brigman v. State </em>(Okla.Crim.App.1960), 350 P.2d 321, 323. Still another court has stated that \u201cany time an alternate juror is in the jury room during deliberations he participates by his presence, and whether he says little or nothing, his presence will void the trial.\u201d <em>State v. Bindyke </em>(1975), 288 N.C. 608, 627-628, 220 S.E.2d 521, 533. Finally, several courts have written of the difficulty and dangers of inquiring into the prejudicial effect of an alternate juror\u2019s presence in jury deliberations. <em>United States v. Beasley </em>(C.A.10, 1972), 464 F.2d 468, 470 (inquiry itself is dangerous intrusion into the proceeding of the jury); <em>United States v. Virginia Erection Corp. </em>(C.A.4, 1964), 335 F.2d 868, 871-872; <em>State v. Cuzick </em>(1975), 85 Wash.2d 146, 150, 530 P.2d 288, 290; <em>Bindyke; Krick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Were any of these factors the sole factor for the trial court to consider, it might have arrived at a different decision. However, the trial court was not confronted with a lengthy intrusion, or a stranger to the jury, or possible non-verbal communication, or the difficulty of determining prejudice. The trial court was confronted with all four.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The trial court was also aware of this court\u2019s concern about the sanctity of jury deliberations. We recently stated, \u201c \u2018Courts face a delicate and complex task whenever they undertake to investigate reports of juror misconduct or bias during the course of a trial. This undertaking is particularly sensitive where, as here, the court endeavors to investigate allegations of juror misconduct during deliberations. As a general rule, no one \u2014 including the judge presiding at trial\u2014 has a \u201cright to know\u201d how a jury, or any individual juror, has deliberated or how a decision was reached by a jury or juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 81, 723 N.E.2d 1019, 1044, quoting <em>United States v. Thomas </em>(C.A.2, 1997), 116 F.3d 606, 618. See <em>Virginia Erection Corp., </em>335 F.2d at 872 (\u201cpresence of the alternate in the jury room violated the cardinal principle that the deliberations of the jury shall remain private and secret in every case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Brownell\u2019s improper presence likely was innocent and his influence may have been negligible. However, given its duration, his status as a non-juror, the possibility if not likelihood of non-verbal communication, and the difficulty of determining whether he prejudiced the jury, we cannot say that the trial court was wrong to grant a mistrial. To do so, we would have to find an abuse of discretion, which connotes an attitude by the court that is arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 169, 559 N.E.2d 1301, 1308. Our review of the record reveals nothing of the sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Our opinion does not abrogate the long-standing rule that juror misconduct should not be the cause of a reversal absent prejudice. Neither does it create a presumption of prejudice whenever an outsider invades the sanctity of jury deliberations. But, see, <em>Bindyke, </em>220 S.E.2d at 531 (majority view is that the presence of an outsider during deliberations requires declaration of mistrial). Instead, we will continue to rely upon the sound discretion of our trial judges. When confronted with extraordinary circumstances, a trial court must be allowed to consider all of the pertinent circumstances in arriving at a decision. Given the circumstances in this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Fain and F.E.

I concur in the well-reasoned opinion and judgment of the majority. While the majority\u2019s discussion of cases from other jurisdictions is both interesting and useful, I would answer the primary question before us by referring to Civ.R. 47(C). Civ.R. 47(C) states, in part, that \u201c[a]n alternate juror who does not replace a regular juror <em>shall </em>be discharged after the jury retires to consider its verdict.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The \u201cjuror\u201d in question herein was, having been discharged, no longer a juror. Thus, attendance in the room where the jury was deliberating was improper, and even without proof of anything else, the mere presence of a nonjuror was cause to grant a mistrial. The trial judge was clearly correct and, I would submit, under a duty to act, given the clear violation of the rule.</p>\n<judges id=\"b481-11\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b481-12\">Fain, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnKd\">concurring. I concur in Justice Pfeifer\u2019s opinion for the court, but I write separately to elaborate upon my reasoning. In my view, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by declaring a mistrial, especially because that action by the trial court was invited by counsel for both parties, who indicated, before the verdict was known, that the unusual circumstance of the alternate juror having sat in the jury room throughout deliberations \u201cplace[d] a question mark\u201d on \u201cthe validity of the verdict,\u201d as counsel for Rist, the party who prevailed in the verdict, put it. Although Rist\u2019s counsel thereafter sought to have the trial judge question the regular jurors concerning the alternate juror\u2019s role during deliberations, the trial judge was well within his discretion in rejecting this proposal, since that would have infringed upon the privacy of the jury\u2019s deliberative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">Although I concur that the trial judge was within his<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> discretion in declaring the mistrial, especially in view of the implicit invitation to do so by counsel for both parties, who indicated that the alternate juror\u2019s presence during deliberations had tainted the verdict, I am of the opinion that the trial judge would also have been well within his discretion had he decided not to declare a mistrial. In this \u00cd am guided by this court\u2019s opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in <em>Armleder v. Lieberman </em>(1877), 33 Ohio St. 77, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>which analyzed a comparable situation with reasoning remarkably applicable one hundred twenty-three years later. While a jury was deliberating, a \u201cdangerous\u201d fire broke out less than one hundred fifty feet from the jury room. The jurors, along with other courthouse denizens, exited the courthouse in some haste. While outside, one of the jurors spoke with an attorney, who was apparently not involved with the case in which the juror was deliberating, concerning the difficulty of deciding the case without access to certain books and papers. The attorney may have indicated that the jury might ask the court for the documents. The trial judge\u2019s decision not to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict upon grounds of juror misconduct was upheld, the court reasoning:</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u201cWhile the conduct of the juror was clearly improper, and such as would ordinarily call for animadversion from the court, we wholly fail to discover from the testimony such misconduct as prevented a fair trial or an honest verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u201cA different ruling would not operate justly. It would punish an innocent party for no offense of his. When the juror is guilty of violating both oath and duty by improper conduct, he should be made to answer for it, and not an innocent party, in no way accessory to the misconduct of the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">' \u201cTo arrest from a party a verdict, which appears to have been honestly obtained, after long and expensive litigation, merely because a juror has been so indiscreet as to speak of the case to a stranger, when he could have received no advantage from that improper act of the juror, and the opposite party no prejudice, would be scarcely compatible with the due administration of judicial justice. When, however, the prevailing party, or his agent or friend, has approached a juror during the trial, or while he has the case under consideration, and addressed the juror on the subject of the action, the verdict should be set aside. He should be made, in that way, to feel the punishment of violated law. [Citation omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u201cSo, if it appears to the court that the unsuccessful party either did, or probably might have sustained injury from the improper conduct of the juror, a new trial should be granted, to the end that a verdict may be obtained, freed from suspicion that one party has been favored, or the other prejudiced by the misconduct of a juror. The court will seek, as far as practicable, to preserve the purity of trials by jury, and the books show that many learned judges have thought the surest way to attain that end is by setting aside every verdict where a juror has spoken of the case contrary to law. This is hardly the spirit of our statute, and would fail to attain the desired result. The juror suffers nothing by setting aside the verdict. The successful party alone is injured; and, if innocent, should not be made to suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u201cUpon the whole, we think the rule that will best secure the desired result would be, that, in cases where the irregularity or misconduct of the juror appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>to have operated in favor of the successful party, and as a necessary consequence, to the prejudice of the unsuccessful party, a new trial should be granted. On the other hand, where it appears that it has produced no such result, the verdict should be permitted to stand.\u201d <em>Armleder v. Lieberman, supra, </em>at 83-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">I commend this reasoning to trial judges today confronted with similar juror misconduct or irregularity. Litigation today is no less expensive in time and money than it was in 1877, when <em>Armleder </em>was decided. If the misconduct or irregularity is not the fault of the prevailing party, and if it does not appear likely that the verdict was influenced by the misconduct or irregularity, a trial judge, in the sound exercise of discretion, should ordinarily not declare a mistrial, but should accept the verdict, and render judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In the case before us, however, I cannot say that Judge Walker abused his discretion in declaring a mistrial, in view of the fact that counsel for both parties had expressed an opinion that the validity of the verdict had been brought into question by the presence of the alternate juror in the jury room during deliberations. Although counsel for Rist thereafter, but before the verdict was known to him, expressed a desire that inquiry be made of the regular jurors concerning the effect that the presence of the alternate juror may have had upon their deliberations, in my view the trial judge was within his discretion in rejecting this proposal because of the invasion of the privacy of the jury\u2019s deliberations that would necessarily have resulted from the proposed inquiry.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-14\">. Technically, <em>Armleder </em>was an opinion of the Supreme Court <em>Commission </em>of Ohio, rather than of the Supreme Court, but the decisions of the Commission are entitled to equal precedential deference. See Section 22, Article IV, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b483-7\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"agz-dedup-0\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision. I agree instead with the court of appeals\u2019 view that the trial court abused its discretion when it <em>sua sponte </em>declared a mistrial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Like Judge Fain, I find this court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Armleder </em>to be \u201cremarkably applicable\u201d even today. But <em>Armleder </em>imposes a duty on the trial judge to <em>\u201cseek, as far as practicable, </em>to preserve the purity of trials by jury\u201d by <em>assessing </em>whether the irregularity prejudiced the unsuccessful party, or whether \u2014 as in <em>Armleder </em>\u2014 it \u201cproduced no such result.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Armleder v. Lieberman </em>(1877), 33 Ohio St. 77, 84; see, also, <em>State v. Hipkins </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 80, 83, 23 O.O.3d 123, 125, 430 N.E.2d 943, 946 (A trial court should not reverse a verdict on the basis of juror misconduct absent prejudice to the complaining party.).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">If the trial court here had made the assessment that <em>Armleder </em>and our more recent cases describe, I would be less inclined to find an abuse of discretion, regardless of the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. But after learning that Brownell was in the jury room during deliberations, the trial judge told counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u201cI hate to say this, but I think we\u2019ve got a mistrial.\u201d Then, without any evidence of prejudicial effect \u2014 and without a motion from either party \u2014 the trial judge declared, \u201cI will read the verdict and then I will poll the jury, and then I\u2019m going to have to declare a mistrial. * * * I don\u2019t have any option.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">To the trial judge, a mistrial was a foregone conclusion. This violates the letter and spirit of our law, which \u201cseeks, as far as practicable, to preserve\u201d verdicts by requiring a meaningful investigation into prejudice. <em>Armleder, supra. </em>\u201c[Wjhere the trial court completely misconstrues the letter and spirit of the law, it is clear that the court has been unreasonable and has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Warner v. Waste Mgt., Inc. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 91, 99, 521 N.E.2d 1091, 1098-1099, fn. 10, citing <em>Ojalvo v. Bd. of Trustees of Ohio State Univ. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 230, 232-233, 12 OBR 313, 315, 466 N.E.2d 875, 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Judge Fain concludes that the trial court\u2019s error, if any, was the result of an \u201cimplicit invitation\u201d from counsel for both parties. But I would not apply the doctrine of invited error here. Invited error is a branch of the waiver doctrine that estops a party from seeking to profit from an error that the party invited or induced. See <em>State ex rel. Fowler v. Smith </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 357, 359, 626 N.E.2d 950, 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Here, neither party invited or induced the trial court\u2019s error. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant actually moved for a mistrial prior to the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial. An implicit invitation should not estop Dr. Rist from arguing, as he did successfully at the court of appeals, that the trial court abused its discretion by <em>sua sponte </em>declaring a mistrial without any evidence of prejudice. See <em>Mary M. v. Los Angeles </em>(1991), 54 Cal.3d 202, 212-213, 285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 104, 814 P.2d 1341, 1346; <em>Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent &amp; Protective Assn. v.
