Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab2\">Appellants set forth several propositions of law. However, both parties agree that the pivotal issue concerns the meaning of the word \u201ccompatible\u201d as found in Section F-501.6 of the Ohio Fire Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as codified in Ohio Adm.Code 1301:7-7-05(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Ohio Adm.Code 1301:7-7-05(B)(6) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u201cF-501.6 Threads: All threads provided for fire department connections to sprinkler systems, standpipe systems, yard hydrants or any other fire hose connection shall be <em>compatible </em>with the connections utilized by the local fire department.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">The term \u201ccompatible\u201d is not defined in the Ohio Fire Code. Therefore, we consider Ohio Adm.Code 1301:7-7-02(A)(4), which provides that terms that are not defined \u201cshall have ordinarily accepted meanings such as the context implies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The court of appeals\u2019 majority cited the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary definition: \u201c1. capable of existing together in harmony * * * 5. designed to work with another device or system without modification.\u201d Utilizing the part 5 definition, the court determined that the county connection was not compatible with the local department because an adapter (a modification) had to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The dissent faulted the majority for omitting the rest of the part 5 definition. The dissent referred to the whole definition, which reads, \u201c[DJesigned to work with another 'device or system without modification; <em>esp. </em>being a computer designed to operate in the same manner and use the same software as another computer.\u201d Thus, the dissent noted that part 5 of the definition was a recent addition to the definition and not in existence when the Ohio Fire Code was written.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Appellants also claim that the court of appeals\u2019 decision to focus on part 5 of the definition instead of relying upon part 1 of the definition, <em>ie., </em>\u201ccapable of existing together in harmony,\u201d was erroneous. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Both the Random House Dictionary and the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary define \u201ccompatible\u201d as capable of existing together in harmony. Indeed, this is the same definition found in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 463. If all three dictionaries define \u201ccompatible\u201d in this manner, obviously this must be the ordinarily accepted meaning of the word. Thus, we find that the court of appeals\u2019 reliance on the fifth part of the definition is too restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Moreover, we agree with appellants and the dissent that if the drafters of the Ohio Fire Code wanted to require identical threads, they would have used the term \u201cidentical\u201d rather than \u201ccompatible\u201d in Ohio Adm.Code 1301:7-7-05(B)(6). However, the drafters declined to do so. Therefore, since the term \u201ccompatible\u201d is used in the code, we apply the .ordinary meaning of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Here, the record reflects that adapters are available which allow the fire department\u2019s equipment to connect to the side nozzles of the fire hydrants that are part of the county system. The record also establishes that the Jerusalem Township Fire Department has these adapters and uses them to access the water supply system. Thus, the use of these adapters renders the threads capable of existing together in harmony or \u201ccompatible,\u201d as defined by all three dictionaries. Although appellee argues that the use of adapters to connect to the fire hydrants creates potential problems and dangers, we find no support in the record for such an assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">We believe our interpretation is logical for yet another reason. If the county was required to replace the New York Central threads with National Standard threads to satisfy this township, what would prevent the other unincorporated areas serviced by the county from demanding that the county change their hydrant threads as well? The record reveals that the cost to change the side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>nozzle hydrant threads is approximately $140 per hydrant. The county system contains approximately 1,500 hydrants. This could become a costly endeavor for the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Accordingly, we find that with the use of an adapter, the threads on the fire hydrants are capable of being used with the threads utilized by the Jerusalem Township Fire Department. Therefore, we hold that the county system of hydrants is compatible with the township\u2019s fire hoses. Appellants did not violate Ohio Adm.Code 1301:7-7-05(B)(6). The court of appeals\u2019 judgment is reversed, and the judgment of the common pleas court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b488-7\">Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-11\">. Pursuant to R.C. 3737.82, the State Fire Marshal \u201cshall adopt a state fire code which shall consist of rules relating to all aspects of fire safety.\u201d The statute further states that the code shall include rules relating to the installation and location of fire protection equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">The State Fire Marshal adopted the National Fire Prevention Code.

Those of us who grew up in small towns remember the familiar wail of the firehouse siren. It called in farmers from fields, barbers from behind their chairs, and lawyers from lunch, to respond to a neighbor\u2019s call for help. The allure of the alarm may have been replaced by the banality of the beeper, but the core idea, neighbors helping neighbors, still beats in the heart of local fire departments all over this state. Local fire departments form the first line of defense, and bring local knowledge to the fight when others come to help.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The Ohio Administrative Code recognizes the important role of local fire departments. The majority errs when it makes this case about the definition of \u201ccompatible.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 1301:7 \u2014 7\u201405(B)(6) puts the onus on the county to make threads compatible with those used by the local fire department, not vice versa. The local threads are the ones that already exist \u2014 it is the county that must make the match. As it now stands, it is the local departments that must make their equipment compatible with the county threads, through the use of adapters. That is obviously not the intent of the Administrative Code section at issue. The responsibility of compatibility is with the county, not the local fire departments. Otherwise, Ohio Adm.Code 1301:7 \u2014 7\u201405(B)(6) would call for connections <em>adaptable </em>for use by the local departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">The increased expense of changing threads, cited by the majority as an additional reason for deciding against the local departments, does not hold water. What local fire departments represent \u2014 self-sufficiency, local control, and unity\u2014 is priceless, and if not priceless, is worth more than $140 a hydrant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-11\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
