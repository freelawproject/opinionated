As we said in <em>Warren Cty. Bar Assn. v. Bunce </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 112, 115, 689 N.E.2d 566, 568, \u2018When imposing a sanction, we will consider not only the duty violated, but the lawyer\u2019s mental state, the actual injury caused, and whether mitigating factors exist.\u201d Based on our review of the record and noting that respondent has already been censured by the probate court, we suspend respondent from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>practice of law for one year, with the entire year stayed. During the year of stayed suspension respondent shall be on probation and her legal practice monitored by an attorney selected by and reporting regularly to the relator. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-6\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AHK\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b304-7\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1h\">dissenting. I agree with the majority that suspension is the appropriate sanction here, but I respectfully depart from the majority\u2019s decision to stay the entire suspension in favor of supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The majority\u2019s decision to suspend respondent finds support in the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When respondent filed documents with the Secretary of State indicating that she was the sole incorporator of Raphael\u2019s Inc., she engaged in conduct involving fraud, dishonesty, deceit, or misrepresentation. Respondent also handled a legal matter that she knew she was not competent to handle. The ABA Standards provide that \u201c[i]n order to protect the public, a suspension should be imposed in cases when a lawyer engages in practice areas in which a lawyer knows that he or she is not competent.\u201d Standard 4.52, Commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Citing \u201csubstantial\u201d mitigating evidence, the majority chooses to depart from the board\u2019s recommendation and to stay respondent\u2019s entire suspension. I agree that respondent\u2019s lack of a dishonest or selfish motive, cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, censure by the probate court, and honorable reputation are mitigating factors that reflect the board\u2019s own recently proposed Guidelines for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And due to these mitigating factors, I would stay six months of respondent\u2019s suspension. Nevertheless, I concur with the panel\u2019s recommendation that \u201cany sanction which [does] not include some actual suspension from the practice of law would send the wrong message to the rest of the Bar and to the public in general.\u201d The panel\u2019s approach reflects the ABA\u2019s position that \u201c[i]f a lawyer\u2019s misconduct is serious enough to warrant a suspension from practice, the lawyer should not be reinstated until rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>can be established. * * * [I]t is preferable to suspend a lawyer for at least six months in order to ensure effective demonstration of rehabilitation.\u201d Standard 2.3, Commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Because I believe that the board\u2019s recommended one-year suspension with six months stayed is the appropriate sanction in this case, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-7\">Moyer, C. J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-10\">.
