Chapter 1923 deals with forcible entry and detainer. Pursuant to R.C. 1923.02(A)(9), a forcible entry and detainer proceeding can be had against \u201ctenants who have breached an obligation imposed upon them by a written rental agreement.\u201d The statute empowers landlords to regain possession of their property upon a tenant\u2019s breach of the rental agreement. R.C. 1923.04 requires notice to the tenant \u2014 the landlord must notify the adverse party to leave the premises at least three days before bringing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">There is no dispute in this case that Morgan violated the terms of the rental agreement, nor is there a dispute that appellants properly served a notice to vacate. The issue is whether the notice to vacate the premises absolved Morgan of her liability for damages based on future rent due under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">The trial and appellate courts relied on <em>Cubbon v. Locker </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 200, 5 OBR 462, 450 N.E.2d 697, where the court held that service of the three-day notice to vacate the premises is an election of remedies and operates as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>notice to the tenant that the tenancy is terminated. The court further reasoned that the termination of the tenancy releases the tenant from rent not yet due.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">To determine whether the use of an action for forcible entry and detainer constitutes an election of remedies, we look to the statutory chapter at issue. We find that Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme does not force a landlord to choose between eviction and a claim for damages for breach of contract. Rather, R.C. 1923.03 states, \u201cJudgments under this chapter [regarding forcible entry and detainer actions] are not a bar to a later action brought by either party.\u201d Thus, R.C. Chapter 1923, by its own terms, does not limit landlords\u2019 remedies upon a breach merely to securing their property through eviction. Lessors may also bring a separate suit for damages brought about by the lessee\u2019s breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The allowance of a separate suit indicates the General Assembly\u2019s realization that post-termination damages, including rents, are unknowable at the time of the institution of eviction proceedings. Damages are not knowable upon termination because termination does not operate as a windfall for the landlord \u2014 the remaining rents under the agreement do not come due all at once. As in any other breach-of-contract action, a plaintiff landlord must prove damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The statutory language is consistent with the idea that despite the termination of the lease the extent of the lessee\u2019s liability remains in doubt. Lessees are potentially liable for rents coming due under the agreement as long as the property remains unrented. The important corollary to that is that landlords have a duty, as all parties to contracts do, to mitigate their damages caused by a breach. Landlords mitigate by attempting to rerent the property. Their efforts to do so must be reasonable, and the reasonableness should be determined at the trial level. If the lessor has acted reasonably in attempting to secure a new tenant, the lessee is liable for the rent up to the point of the lessor\u2019s finding a new tenant, or the expiration of the lease, whichever is earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Depending on the length of the lease, the final determination of damages for post-termination rent could take time \u2014 and the statute recognizes that by not requiring joinder at the time of eviction. R.C. 1923.081 does note that those claims that are definite at the time of eviction, past due rent and other damages, may be joined with a forcible entry and detainer action.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">We thus find that R.C. Chapter 1923, in its allowance of separate actions under the lease by both parties does contemplate that lessees are liable to lessors for post-termination rent. We find that <em>Cubbon </em>is therefore flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\"><em>Cubbon </em>also conflicts with the public policy reasoning of the court in <em>Briggs v. MacSwain </em>(1986), 31 Ohio App.3d 85, 31 OBR 126, 508 N.E.2d 1028. That court plainly held that a three-day notice to vacate does not terminate the obligations of the tenant to pay rent for the remainder of the term. The <em>Briggs </em>court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>considered which party should bear the burden caused by a lessee\u2019s breach of the lease:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\u201cA tenant may not avoid her obligations under the lease agreement for payment of the rent during the term of the lease, or until a new tenant is secured, by failing to pay her rent and then vacating after she receives the required three-day notice for non-payment of rent.\u201d 31 Ohio App.3d at 86, 31 OBR at 127, 508 N.E.2d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The breach of the lease in <em>Briggs </em>was failure to pay rent, whereas the breach here was for violating the agreement\u2019s \u201cnondisturbance\u201d clause, but the reasoning is the same. Should a person be able to escape her obligations under a lease by purposefully violating that lease and waiting for the lessor to present her with a three-day notice to vacate? We agree with the <em>Briggs </em>court that the answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, whenever a lease became unpalatable, a lessee could commit some bad act and thereupon be relieved of the burden of her bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">In the present case, the statutory law and public policy are on the side of the landlords, insofar as the recoverability of some rent after termination is concerned. However, the law may not be with them upon remand if they cannot show that they reasonably attempted to relet the property for seven months. A seven-month vacancy strains the limits of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-11\">Douglas, Lazarus, F.E.
