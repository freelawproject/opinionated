However, as aptly noted by the court of appeals, the record in this case does not reveal whether the testimony and records that appellant seeks to obtain regarding appellee\u2019s treatment at CADAS concern communications received by physicians, licensed psychologists, licensed counselors, and/or licensed social workers. Thus, in the interest of judicial economy, and because all of these providers are governed by similar statutes, we will determine at once whether the testimonial privileges governing all these providers are applicable to communications made by a parent in the course of treatment ordered as part of a reunification plan in an action for dependency and neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">The relevant testimonial privileges are statutory in nature, and are codified at R.C. 2317.02(B)(1) (concerning communications between a physician and patient), R.C. 4732.19 (concerning communications between a licensed psychologist and client), and R.C. 2317.02(G) (concerning communications between a licensed counselor or licensed social worker and client). Under these sections, the respective privileges are to be given effect absent specific statutory waivers or exceptions, none of which applies to this case. No provision is made in any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>these statutes that would allow for the in-court disclosure of confidential information on the basis that the treatment or service received by the patient or client was involuntary in nature, ordered as part of a journalized case plan provided in R.C. 2151.412, or is necessary or relevant to a determination of permanent custody under R.C. 2151.414. Nor is any such provision to be found anywhere in R.C. Chapter 2151 as it pertains to dependency and neglect proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">This court has repeatedly and consistently refused to engraft judicial waivers, exceptions, or limitations into the testimonial privilege statutes where the circumstances of the communication fall squarely within the reach of the statute. In <em>State v. Smorgala </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 222, 223, 553 N.E.2d 672, 673-674, the court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">\u201cThe question presented for review by this certification is whether the courts of Ohio should judicially create a public policy limitation upon the statutorily created physician-patient privilege which would allow otherwise clearly inadmissible evidence to be received in \u2018drunk driving\u2019 cases. In keeping with the constitutional principle of separation of powers, we cannot adopt such a position. Judicial policy preferences may not be used to override valid legislative enactments, for the General Assembly should be the final arbiter of public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In <em>In re Miller </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 99, 108, 585 N.E.2d 396, 404, we succinctly stated that \u201cOhio\u2019s physician-patient privilege statute makes no exception for civil commitment proceedings. T\u00cdiis means that the privilege applies in the appropriate commitment situation involving a patient and his or her psychotherapist.\u201d And in <em>State v. McDermott </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 570, 572-573, 651 N.E.2d 985, 987, the court reiterated that \u201cthe General Assembly may broaden the statutory exceptions which constitute] waiver of the privileged communications but * * * the courts should not augment the enumerated waivers. \u2018The argument addressed to this court might be addressed to the legislature with persuasive power * * * but it is not for this court to make such an amendment.\u2019 <em>[Swetland v. Miles </em>(1920) ], 101 Ohio St. [501] at 504-505, 130 N.E. [22] at 23.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Nevertheless, appellant argues that \u201cthe purpose of the privilege is severely undermined when the patient is not voluntarily seeking help,\u201d and that \u201cthe rationale protecting communications by a parent to a physician, licensed psychologist, social worker or counselor does not apply in proceedings under R.C. Chapter 2151.\u201d Whatever persuasive force these arguments may have, this is not the appropriate forum in which to raise them. This court will not engage in subterfuge by judicially creating a public policy limitation under the guise of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Moreover, there is nothing in the interplay between R.C. Chapter 2151 and the testimonial privilege statutes that supports appellant\u2019s position. \u201cThe purpose of the [physician-patient privilege] statute is to create an atmosphere of confidential<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ity, encouraging the patient to be completely candid and open with his or her physician, thereby enabling more complete treatment.\u201d <em>In re Miller, supra, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 107, 585 N.E.2d at 403. Otherwise, the fear of disclosure \u201ccould seriously impede the patient\u2019s chances for a recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 585 N.E.2d at 404. The same purpose, of course, underlies each of the testimonial privilege statutes. The same concerns are prevalent where a parent is required, under the terms of a reunification plan, to utilize medical, psychological, or other social and rehabilitative services in an effort to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to be placed outside the home so that the child can return home. See R.C. 2151.01(C), 2151.412(F)(l)(b)(i) and (H), and 2151.414(E)(1). Thus, as well stated by the court of appeals:</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\u201cIn order to meet the goal of the reunification plan, the purpose underlying the statutory privilege \u2014 effective treatment \u2014 is material and significant. In other words, if a parent is fearful that any communications with her provider will not be privileged, she may not be open and truthful during treatment, thereby undermining the effectiveness of treatment and ultimately defeating the goal of remedying the reason for the removal of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Accordingly, we hold that in the absence of a specific statutory waiver or exception, the testimonial privileges established under R.C. 2317.02(B)(1) (concerning communications between a physician and patient), R.C. 4732.19 (concerning communications between a licensed psychologist and client), and R.C. 2317.02(G) (concerning communications between a licensed counselor or licensed social worker and client) are applicable to communications made by a parent in the course of treatment ordered as part of a reunification plan in an action for dependency and neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b767-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b767-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b767-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ajl-dedup-0\">concurring. I reluctantly concur for the reason that the statutory privileges neither distinguish between voluntary and involuntary treatment, nor create any exception for communications made in the course of court-ordered treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">There are strong public policy reasons in favor of. creating such an exception, particularly when the safety and welfare of a child are at stake. If an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>witness who treated or consulted with a parent in court-ordered treatment reports only that the parent involuntarily attended counseling sessions, the court is left to wonder whether the counseling sessions were effective or whether the parent continues to experience problems that would impede his or her ability to parent. If no additional details of the treatment are disclosed, the court does not have material, relevant information upon which to base its decision about the child\u2019s fate and the parent\u2019s continued right to parent that,child.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">These are serious concerns that must be weighed against the basic tenet of confidentiality, and the concern that a parent will not be candid and open while undergoing treatment for fear of later disclosure. However, I agree that these competing public policy issues should not be judicially crafted, and instead belong in the legislative forum subject to public debate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
