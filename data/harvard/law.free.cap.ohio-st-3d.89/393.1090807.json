The order does not mention it, but the commission was apparently relying on the fact that Dr. Urse had continued to certify Cope\u2019s TTD based on two conditions. Specifically, in a series of forms, Dr. Urse had represented that Cope was temporarily and totally disabled by the allowed knee sprain and also by \u201cautonomic nerve disorder,\u201d a condition that Cope claims encompasses RSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Cope argues that the commission can never rely on a doctor\u2019s MMI report if the doctor has not considered all allowed conditions. Sears responds that the commission has no reason to consider an allowed condition if it is no longer disabling. The court of appeals agreed with Sears, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">Ordinarily, the commission must consider all allowed conditions in determining the extent of a claimant\u2019s disability. <em>State ex rel. Tilley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 524, 526, 678 N.E.2d 1392, 1394. But as the court of appeals\u2019 magistrate explained, once Dr. Urse confirmed in December 1995 that Cope was not suffering from RSD, that diagnosis left only one remaining allowed condition to which Cope\u2019s disability could be attributed \u2014 left knee strain. Thus, it is of no consequence that Dr. Ray did not account for RSD in his initial report: an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>allowed but <em>nondisabling </em>condition is irrelevant to determining whether a claimant continues to qualify for disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Moreover, while Dr. Urse continued to certify Cope\u2019s TTD after December 1995, it is significant that he never specified an RSD diagnosis again.' Sometimes he referred to Cope\u2019s \u201cleft knee soreness.\u201d Other times he would use codes for her condition from the International Classification of Diseases (9 Ed.1996) (\u201cICD-9\u201d) \u2014 844.9 for knee sprain and 337.9 for \u201cunspecified disorder of autonomic nervous system.\u201d Cope insists that the 337.9 code is a catchall category for disorders of the autonomic nervous system, that RSD falls in this category, and that this allowed condition is still contributing to Cope\u2019s disability. But as the court of appeals found, nothing in the record clearly establishes that RSD, which is categorized as ICD-9 Code 337.2, is synonymous with the condition referred to by ICD-9 Code 337.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The court of appeals, therefore, did not err in finding that the commission abused its discretion by discrediting Dr. Ray\u2019s initial report. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment granting a writ of mandamus. The commission is directed to vacate its order rejecting Dr. Ray\u2019s initial MMI report and denying Sears\u2019s motion to terminate TTD. The commission is further directed to issue a new order that grants or denies this motion in a manner consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b624-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E.
