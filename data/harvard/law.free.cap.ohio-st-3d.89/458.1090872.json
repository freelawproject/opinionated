In Part I, below, we discuss the'rules applicable to out-of-state attorneys who perform legal, services in Ohio. In Part II, we consider the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s acknowledged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">I. Preventing the Unauthorized Practice of Law by Out-of-State Attorneys</p>\n<p id=\"Al66\">A discussion of the rules pertaining to the in-state legal services rendered by out-of-state attorneys will assist members of the bar in preventing problems such as those that arose in this case from occurring in the future. In Part A, we note that, although the text of DR 3-101(A) provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not aid a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>non-lawyer </em>in the unauthorized practice of law\u201d (emphasis added), the rule prohibits Ohio attorneys from aiding either laypersons or <em>attorneys </em>unlicensed in Ohio in the unauthorized practice of law. In Part B, we discuss some of the authorized methods for out-of-state attorneys to offer their legal expertise in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">A. Aiding Out-of-State Attorneys in the Unauthorized Practice of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Canon 3 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and its associated Ethical Considerations and Disciplinary Rules focus on preventing \u201claymen\u201d or \u201cnon-lawyers\u201d from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. In addition, EC 3-9 and DR 3-101(B) recognize the impropriety of attorneys\u2019 practicing law in jurisdictions where they are not licensed. Our rules prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law are intended to protect Ohio citizens from the dangers of faulty legal representation rendered by persons not trained in, examined on, or licensed to practice by the laws of our state. These dangers can arise from the services of out-of-state attorneys unfamiliar with Ohio\u2019s legal system as well as from the work of laypersons unschooled in the legal profession. Accord <em>Ayamo v. State Bd. of Governors of Washington State Bar Assn. </em>(1946), 24 Wash.2d 706, 167 P.2d 674. And since a state\u2019s internal attorney-discipline system can impose disciplinary sanctions only upon that state\u2019s own licensed attorneys, each state has an interest in restricting the practice of law within its borders to those attorneys who are subject to its disciplinary system. See Gov.Bar R. IV(1) (\u201cThe Code of Professional Responsibility * * * shall be <em>binding upon all persons admitted to practice law in Ohio </em>\u201d [emphasis added]); see, also, <em>18 Internatl. Ltd. v. Interstate Express, Inc. </em>(1982), 116 Misc.2d 66, 455 N.Y.S.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">For these reasons, our Rules for the Government of the Bar define the \u201cunauthorized practice of law\u201d as \u201cthe rendering of legal services for another by <em>any person not admitted to practice in Ohio </em>under Rule I and not granted active status under Rule VI, or certified under Rule II [interns], Rule IX [temporary certification], or Rule XI [foreign legal consultants] of the Supreme Court Rules for the Government of the Bar.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Gov.Bar R. VII(2)(A). The rules also provide that an attorney who is admitted to the practice of law in another state, but not in Ohio, and who is employed by an Ohio law firm may not practice law in Ohio or hold himself or herself out as authorized to practice in Ohio until admitted to practice here. Gov.Bar R. VI(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">An Ohio lawyer can aid the unauthorized practice of law and violate DR 3-101(A), then, by facilitating or failing to adequately limit, through supervision, the activities of a lawyer unlicensed in Ohio. Respondent has stipulated to such a violation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>B. Out-of-State Attorneys in Ohio</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Although we may enjoin out-of-state attorneys from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in our state, and although Ohio attorneys such as respondent violate DR 3-101(A) by aiding out-of-state attorneys in the unauthorized practice of law, our state\u2019s Rules for the Government of the Bar are not blind to the interjurisdictional realities of modern legal practice. EC 3-9, part of the Code of Professional Responsibility adopted by this court in Gov.Bar R. IV, explicitly recognizes the tension that exists between our global society and each state\u2019s regulation of the unauthorized practice of law: \u201c[T]he demands of business and the mobility of our society pose distinct problems in the regulation of the practice of law by the states. In furtherance of the public interest, the legal profession should discourage regulation that unreasonably imposes territorial limitations upon the right of a lawyer to handle the legal affairs of his client * * * including the presentation of a contested matter in a tribunal before which the lawyer is not permanently admitted to practice.\u201d Our state\u2019s Rules for the Government of the Bar provide several avenues through which out-of-state attorneys may perform legal services in Ohio under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">1. <em>Admission Without Examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Gov.Bar R. 1(9) permits certain experienced out-of-state attorneys to apply for admission to the practice of law in Ohio without examination, when those attorneys intend to practice law in Ohio \u201cactively and on a continuing basis.\u201d Gov.Bar R. I(9)(A)(6). Division (H) of this rule emphasizes that an applicant for admission must not engage in the practice of law in Ohio prior to the approval of his or her application and presentation of the applicant to this court by a licensed Ohio attorney. By its own terms, however, Division (H) does not apply to participation in litigation by out-of-state attorneys in Ohio cases when the attorney participates with leave of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">2. <em>Registration for Corporate Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Our rules also permit out-of-state attorneys employed full-time by nongovernmental Ohio employers (but <em>not </em>by Ohio law firms) to register for \u201ccorporate status.\u201d Gov.Bar R. VI(4). An out-of-state attorney granted corporate status under this section \u201cmay perform legal services in Ohio solely for a nongovernmental Ohio employer, as long as the attorney is a full-time employee of that employer.\u201d Gov.Bar R. VI(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">There are several important caveats to this rule. An attorney granted corporate status may <em>not </em>practice before any Ohio court or agency on behalf of the attorney\u2019s Ohio employer \u201cor any person except himself or herself, unless granted leave by the court or agency.\u201d Gov.Bar R. VI(4)(B). And out-of-state attorneys who perform legal services in Ohio for their employers but do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>register or qualify to register under this rule are subject to referral for investigation concerning the unauthorized practice of law. Gov.Bar R. VI(4)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Finally, registration for corporate status <em>does not apply to out-of-state attorneys who are employed by, associated with, or partners in an Ohio law firm. </em>Gov.Bar R. VI(4)(D). \u201cUntil the attorney is admitted to the practice of law in Ohio, the attorney may not practice law in Ohio, hold himself or herself out as authorized to practice law in Ohio, or practice before any nonfederal court or agency in this state on behalf of any person except himself or herself, unless granted leave by the court or agency. The law firm may include the name of the attorney on its letterhead only if the letterhead includes a designation that the attorney is not admitted in Ohio.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">3. <em>Admission Pro Hac Vice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">An out-of-state attorney who has not attained one of the above qualifications may still, with respect to a particular proceeding, appear before Ohio tribunals, participate in oral arguments, and file pleadings, memoranda, briefs, or other documents by following the applicable court rules of practice and obtaining admission <em>pro hac vice. </em>See, <em>e.g., </em>S.Ct.Prac.R. 1(2); Loc.R. 1.03 of the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County, General Division; see, also, Gov.Bar R. I(9)(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">4. <em>Limited Practice of Law by Foreign Legal Consultants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Those admitted to the practice of law in a foreign country or political subdivision thereof may apply for a certificate of registration as a foreign legal consultant. See Gov.Bar R. XI. Foreign legal consultants may render legal services in Ohio, but they are subject to significant limitations regarding both the scope of those services and the legal documents or instruments that they may draft. <em>Id., </em>Section 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">5. <em>Partnerships Among Lawyers Licensed in Different Jurisdictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">Lawyers authorized to practice law in different jurisdictions may form partnerships and use the same firm name in each jurisdiction so long as the firm letterhead and other permissible listings of members and associates \u201cmake clear the jurisdictional limitations\u201d on those attorneys. DR 2-102(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">The foregoing discussion indexes some of the options available to out-of-state attorneys who wish to provide limited services to Ohio clients. In <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Misch, supra, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 260-261, 695 N.E.2d at 247-248, this court discussed these rules, distinguished Misch\u2019s activities from those of a consultant, business broker, or paralegal, and held that Misch had impermissibly rendered legal services in Ohio. Respondent has acknowledged that he failed to monitor Misch to ensure that Misch did not mislead Sindell clients or exceed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>limited authority, and that his breach of this duty led Sindell clients or former clients to erroneously believe that Misch was authorized to practice law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">II. Determining the Appropriate Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">Relator objects to the board\u2019s recommendation that respondent receive a public reprimand, contending that respondent\u2019s misconduct \u2014 when measured against this court\u2019s precedent and the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions\u2014 warrants a one-year suspension from the practice of law. We disagree, and adopt the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">As relator notes, this court has not had occasion to consider the appropriate disciplinary sanctions for attorneys, such as respondent, who aid out-of-state attorneys in the unauthorized practice of law in Ohio. Our prior cases concerning DR 3-101(A) have addressed Ohio lawyers who aided nonlawyers in the unauthorized practice of law, and most have addressed situations where a violation of DR 3-101(A) was but one of several disciplinary violations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">A. <em>Wayne Cty. Bar Assn. v. Naumoff</em></p>\n<p id=\"Azxy\">Relator relies heavily on our 1996 <em>Naumoff </em>case because Naumoffs actual suspension resulted solely from a violation of DR 3-101 (A) \u2014 the same violation that respondent has stipulated to here. <em>Wayne Cty. Bar Assn. v. Naumoff </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 637, 639, 660 N.E.2d 1177, 1178. But we find <em>Naumoff </em>distinguishable because Naumoffs prior disciplinary record affected the sanction. Respondent here lacks any prior disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Moreover, the respondent in <em>Naumoff </em>aided a <em>nonlawyer </em>in the practice of law. At the time Misch engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in this case, he was admitted to the bar in Illinois and to the federal bar in Ohio, and the parties stipulated that he possessed considerable experience in corporate restructuring. Though Misch\u2019s legal qualifications do not excuse either Misch\u2019s unauthorized practice of law or respondent\u2019s violation of DR 3-101(A), they may reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>have influenced the degree of supervision that respondent deemed appropriate or necessary while Misch performed what respondent erroneously believed to be permissible consulting services for Sindell clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">B. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Fehler-Schultz</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Relator also cites a case in which this court indefinitely suspended an Ohio attorney who aided the unauthorized practice of law by permitting one of his firm\u2019s investigators \u2014 another Ohio attorney, who was serving an indefinite suspension from the practice of law due to criminal convictions \u2014 to interview a client, negotiate with an insurer, obtain the client\u2019s signature on an unsigned contingency fee contract, and advise the client regarding settlement. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Fehler-Schultz </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 452, 597 N.E.2d 79. As relator concedes, however, <em>Fehler-Schultz </em>did not concern an Ohio attorney who aided an out-of-state attorney in the unauthorized practice of law, and the respondent in that case committed additional disciplinary violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">C. Application of the ABA Standards for Lawyer Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Due to the lack of applicable precedent, we find the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions to be a helpful methodology for determining the appropriate sanction in this case. See ABA Center for Professional Responsibility, Standards for Imposing Lawyer-Sanctions (1991 &amp; Amend.1992); see, also, <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Brown </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 316, 720 N.E.2d 525. According to the ABA Standards, an attorney who aids the unauthorized practice of law violates a duty owed as a professional, and the recommended sanctions for such conduct appear in Standard 7.0 <em>et seq. </em>Relator correctly notes that Standard 7.2 recommends suspending an attorney who <em>\u201cknowingly </em>engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Relator contends that suspension is appropriate here, asserting that respondent <em>\u201cknew </em>of all the attendant circumstances that allowed clients and others to conclude that Misch was an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">The ABA Committee\u2019s Introduction to Standard 7.0, however, provides, \u201cWhile these standards have been developed out of a desire to protect the public, such as by restricting practice to those persons who have met appropriate educational requirements, * * * <em>a sanction of disbarment or suspension will rarely be required, and a sanction of reprimand, admonition or probation will be sufficient to ensure that the public is protected and the bar is educated.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Standard 7.0, Introduction. The ABA Standards recommend that courts suspend or disbar attorneys for violations of DR 3-101(A) only in particularly egregious eases \u2014 and this is not one of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>We agree with relator that respondent\u2019s introductions to clients in the Better Meats and Kasper matters were misleading, for respondent told these clients that Misch was \u201cworking with\u201d Sindell without specifically mentioning Misch\u2019s lack of an Ohio law license. Respondent also authorized a misleading letter and billing statement in the Better Meats matter. The letter quoted the same billing rate for \u201cPartners and Mr. Misch,\u201d and the statement listed Misch as federal court counsel, but neither document indicated whether Misch was an attorney licensed to practice law in Ohio. And respondent arguably facilitated Misch\u2019s unauthorized actions in the Manfredi Motors matter by introducing Misch to Manfredi\u2019s tax counsel and then failing to monitor Misch\u2019s use of the Sindell letterhead or other firm resources. Respondent could have known earlier than he did that Sindell clients were being led to believe that Misch was licensed to practice law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">But like the panel and board, we conclude that respondent\u2019s acknowledged failures in these matters \u201carose more out of neglect by omission * * * as opposed to affirmative, deceitful conduct that enabled Misch to engage in the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d Thus we do not find that respondent\u2019s supervisory failings deserve the harsher discipline that the ABA Standards reserve for egregious intentional or knowing violations of DR 3-101(A). Accord <em>People v. Robinson </em>(Colo.1990), 803 P.2d 474 (applying ABA Standards, Supreme Court of Colorado publicly censured attorney who failed to request that out-of-state attorney appearing on behalf of firm be specially admitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Our decision to impose a lesser sanction is supported by the lack of aggravating factors and the presence of several mitigating factors in this case. Relator submits that respondent\u2019s \u201cextensive experience as an attorney\u201d should weigh in favor of a harsher sanction, since ABA Standard 9.22(i) includes \u201csubstantial experience in the practice of law\u201d as a potential aggravating circumstance. We note, however, that when the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recently proposed a list of aggravating factors that closely resembles the list in the ABA Standards, the board chose not to propose that an attorney\u2019s substantial experience be considered by the board in recommending a more severe sanction. See Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, Proposed Amendments to Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings, Section 10(A), Ohio Official Reports, Nov. 22,1999 Advance Sheets, xlii, xlv.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Regardless, respondent\u2019s significant legal experience is not a compelling aggravating factor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Relator also suggests that only three mitigating factors are appropriate for this court\u2019s consideration. First, relator acknowledges several letters that attest to respondent\u2019s character and standing in the community. Relator also acknowledges respondent\u2019s admission of responsibility. Finally, relator concedes that respondent\u2019s misconduct did not arise from affirmative deceit. We also find, however, two additional mitigating circumstances that appear in the board\u2019s own list of mitigating factors: respondent\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record and his cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings. <em>Id., </em>Section 10(B). The presence of these additional mitigating factors further supports our conclusion that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Like the parties, the panel, and the board, we agree that respondent \u2014 as the Sindell partner most responsible for Misch \u2014 had a duty to ensure that Misch did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law. Respondent breached this duty and violated DR 3-101(A) by failing to disclose Misch\u2019s limited authority to Sindell clients and by failing to take steps to ensure that Misch did not manipulate Sindell resources to exceed that limited authority. But due to the lack of affirmative deceit on respondent\u2019s part, and due to the presence of several mitigating circumstances, we agree with the board that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction in this case \u2014 a result that comports with the ABA Standards.
