We disagree as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">There is unquestionably significant evidence in the voluminous record before us that tends to show that Saint-Gobain did not act in a discriminatory manner. However, there is also ample evidence to enable reasonable minds to find for the appellants. Whether we would have found for appellants or for Saint-Gobain is immaterial; it is sufficient that there is adequate evidence for reasonable minds to find for either. <em>O\u2019Day v. Webb </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 215, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896, paragraph four of the syllabus; see <em>Pangle v. Joyce </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 389, 391, 667 N.E.2d 1202, 1203. Accordingly, the trial court ruled correctly and the court of appeals erred in reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>motion for directed verdict. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the jury verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and jury verdicts reinstated.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b644-5\">Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b644-6\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b644-7\">Moyer, C.J., Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b644-8\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASZG\">dissenting. The majority decides that \u201cthere is * * * ample evidence to enable reasonable minds to find for the appellants.\u201d But other than reciting the standard for directed verdicts from our O\u2019Day<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> syllabus, the majority simply concludes, without elaboration, that the court of appeals erred when it deemed the evidence legally <em>insufficient </em>to permit appellants\u2019 gender discrimination claims to reach the, jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The majority discounts the thorough legal analysis by the court of appeals without any contrary analysis. In effect, the majority says here that a directed verdict may be granted against a party only if that party fails to present any evidence. To say this is to improperly insulate cases from review for legal sufficiency under Civ.R. 50. See <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. </em>(2000), 530 U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">The appellate panel found that the complexity of this case called for a ninety-seven-page opinion. In a very recent decision on the same general issue, the United States Supreme Court required fifteen pages to analyze the problem of applying Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 to discrimination cases that employ <em>McDonnell Douglas\u2019s </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> burden-shifting analysis. <em>Reeves, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Ohio follows federal jurisprudence in the area of discrimination law. <em>Little Forest Med. Ctr. of Akron v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 607, 609-610, 575 N.E.2d 1164, 1167. See, also, <em>Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Joint Apprenticeship Commt. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 192, 196, 20 O.O.3d 200, 202-203, 421 N.E.2d 128, 131. In <em>Reeves, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court established parameters for federal appellate courts reviewing the application of Civ.R. 50 to <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>cases, and emphasized its determination <em>not </em>to \u201cinsulate an entire category of employment discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>cases from review under Rule 50.\u201d <em>Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. at -, 120 S.Ct. at 2109, 147 L.Ed.2d at 120. This case deserves appropriate legal review under the recently announced <em>Reeves </em>standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Given that the majority fails to counter the appellate court\u2019s legal analysis, I am unable to join the judgment to reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b645-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-12\">. <em>O\u2019Day v.
