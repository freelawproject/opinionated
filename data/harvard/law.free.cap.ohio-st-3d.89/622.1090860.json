We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">R.C. 5715.19(G) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>complainant shall provide to the board of revision all information or evidence within the complainant\u2019s knowledge or possession that affects the real property that is the subject of the complaint. A complainant who fails to provide such information or evidence is precluded from introducing it on appeal to the board of tax appeals or the court of common pleas, except that the board of tax appeals or court may admit and consider the evidence if the complainant shows good cause for the complainant\u2019s failure to provide the information or evidence to the board of revision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">This court has had occasion to rule on R.C. 5715.19(G). In <em>Coventry Towers, Inc. v. Strongsville </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 120, 18 OBR 151, 480 N.E.2d 412, the city revised a report it had presented to the board of revision before the city presented it to the BTA. The property owner objected to the admission of the revised appraisal. Nevertheless, the BTA admitted the city\u2019s revised appraisal into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">On appeal, we affirmed the BTA\u2019s ruling because the property owner presented no evidence that the city had the information contained in the revised appraisal within its knowledge or possession when it appeared before the board of revision. In fact, the appraiser testified that much of the information presented in the revised appraisal \u201cwas obtained as a result of the hearing before the board of revision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122, 18 OBR at 152, 480 N.E.2d at 413. In applying R.C. 5715.19(G) we held, \u201cThis provision requires a complainant before the board of revision to submit all pertinent information affecting the property in question within his knowledge or possession at that time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121, 18 OBR at 152, 480 N.E.2d at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">CASA\u2019s counsel stated that Murdy\u2019s testimony was being presented only \u201cto amplify the documents that are already of record.\u201d The documents referred to by CASA\u2019s counsel were those presented to the BOR and contained in the transcript sent to the BTA, but \u201cnot relied on by the BOR.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">The BTA accepted Murdy\u2019s testimony, stating that it was \u201cmerely intended to amplify evidence previously submitted to, but not considered by the BOR,\u201d and that it was not \u201cthe type of \u2018new\u2019 information contemplated\u201d by R.C. 5715.19(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">The BTA erred because it accepted Murdy\u2019s testimony \u201cto amplify evidence previously submitted to, but not considered by the BOR.\u201d CASA proffered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>documents at the BOR, which had not admitted them into evidence. The BTA observed that the BOR did not consider the documents \u201cbecause appellant [CASA] did not provide a -witness at the BOR hearing to authenticate or lay a proper foundation for these documents.\u201d The BTA should have excluded Mur-dy\u2019s testimony because it did not pertain to any evidence or information provided to the BOR. Further, CASA did not attempt to show good cause why it had not presented the evidence or information Murdy testified about to the BOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the decision of the BTA is unreasonable and unlawful and it is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b855-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
