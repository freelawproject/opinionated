First, we must determine whether the period of limitations provided in R.C. 2305.10 is tolled when an individual temporarily leaves the state of Ohio for non-business reasons. In addition, we must determine if the application of R.C. 2305.15 against such an individual is unconstitutional for the reason that it constitutes an impermissible burden on interstate commerce under the holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 888, 108 S.Ct. 2218, 100 L.Ed.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">R.C. 2305.15(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">\u201cWhen a cause of action accrues against a person, if he is out of the state, has absconded, or conceals himself, the period of limitation for the commencement of the action as provided in [section 2305.10] does not begin to run until he comes into the state or while he is so absconded or so concealed. <em>After the cause of action accrues if he departs from the state, absconds, or conceals himself, the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>time of his absence or concealment shall not be computed as any part of the period within which the action must be brought. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">In <em>Wetzel v. Weyant </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 135, 70 O.O.2d 227, 323 N.E.2d 711, this court determined that the period of limitations provided in R.C. 2305.10 is tolled by the application of R.C. 2305.15 when an individual temporarily leaves the state, and such period of absence is not computed as any part of the period within which a suit must be brought. We are not persuaded to change the law announced in <em>Wetzel. </em>R.C. 2305.15 has remained virtually unchanged since at least 1947. <em>Wetzel </em>at 137, 70 O.O.2d at 228, 323 N.E.2d at 712. The plain language of this section of the Revised Code provides that when a person \u201cdeparts from the state * * *, the time of his absence or concealment shall not be computed as any part of the period within which the action must be brought.\u201d The General Assembly has the authority to adopt statutes of limitations for the commencement of causes of action. Unless a statute is unconstitutional, we have no authority to change the plain meaning of the statute. Therefore, we conclude that the limitations period provided in R.C. 2305.10 is tolled when an individual temporarily leaves the state of Ohio for non-business reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Defendants argue that the holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bendix, supra, </em>renders R.C.' 2305.15 unconstitutional as construed by this court in <em>Weyant. </em>In <em>Bendix, </em>the United States Supreme Court ruled R.C. 2305.15 unconstitutional as it was applied against an out-of-state corporation that did not have an agent designated for service of process within the state of Ohio. In <em>Bendix, </em>it was asserted that R.C. 2305.15 should be construed to extend the period of limitations against an out-of-state corporation perpetually, unless the corporation designates an agent for service of process within the state of Ohio. The Supreme Court, however, held that such an application of R.C. 2305.15 would impose an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. <em>Id., </em>486 U.S. at 894, 108 S.Ct. at 2222, 100 L.Ed.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Defendants argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Bendix </em>should be applied to plaintiffs\u2019 claims against them. However, the court\u2019s ruling in <em>Bendix </em>was limited to the facts of the case. In writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy states, \u201c[I]n the particular case before us, the Ohio tolling statute must fall under the Commerce Clause. Ohio cannot justify its statute as a means of protecting its residents from corporations who become liable for acts done within the State, but later withdraw from the jurisdiction * * * .\u201d <em>Id. </em>This language indicates that the decision of the court in <em>Bendix </em>operates to preclude the application of R.C. 2305.15 against out-of-state corporations that have not appointed an agent for service of process in the state of Ohio. However, the decision stops far short of declaring R.C. 2305.15 unconstitutional in any other application.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>In <em>Bendix, </em>the court noted that application of R.C. 2305.15 to an out-of-state corporation without an agent designated for service of process within the state of Ohio would subject the corporation to perpetual liability in lawsuits arising from their actions in the state of Ohio. This would impose \u201ca greater burden on out-of-state companies than it does on Ohio companies\u201d in violation of the Commerce Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 893-894, 108 S.Ct. at 2221-2222, 100 L.Ed.2d at 903-904. However, the application of R.C. 2305.15 to individuals, such as defendants, who temporarily leave the state of Ohio for non-business reasons, imposes no such impermissible burden. For this reason, we hold that the application of R.C. 2305.15 against an individual, who temporarily leaves the state of Ohio for non-business reasons, does not constitute an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Defendants concede that they left the state of Ohio for a period of ten days to vacation in Kentucky. Plaintiffs filed their claims two days beyond the period of limitations provided in R.C. 2305.10. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 claims were timely filed pursuant to the tolling provision provided in R.C. 2305.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b771-9\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b771-10\">Cook, J., concurs in judgment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b771-11\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AY6\">concurring in judgment. I agree with the judgment of the majority that the tolling statute is constitutional as applied here. But I do not join the majority in holding that \u201cthe limitations period provided in R.C. 2305.10 is tolled when an individual <em>temporarily </em>leaves the state of Ohio <em>for non-business reasons.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">The qualifying word \u201ctemporarily\u201d does not appear in R.C. 2305.15. Though our <em>Wetzel </em>syllabus provided that R.C. 2305.15 tolls the limitations period where a defendant \u201ctemporarily leaves the state\u201d after a cause of action accrues, this was only to underscore our affirmance of the court of appeals\u2019 view that the tolling statute \u201cdoes not provide an exception for temporary absences.\u201d <em>Wetzel v. Weyant </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 135, 136, 70 O.O.2d 227, 228, 323 N.E.2d 711, 712. R.C. 2305.15 does not distinguish between \u201ctypes\u201d of absences, and continued use of the qualifying word \u201ctemporarily\u201d could be read to <em>limit </em>the application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tolling statute. And the majority fails to analyze the parameters of that limitation, if such a limitation indeed exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The majority also adds the qualifying phrase, \u201cfor non-business reasons.\u201d Like the word \u201ctemporarily,\u201d this phrase does not appear in R.C. 2305.15. It would seem that the majority employs this phrase in an effort to meet <em>Bendix, </em>where the United States Supreme Court found the tolling statute unconstitutional as applied to a foreign corporation. <em>Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 888, 108 S.Ct. 2218, 100 L.Ed.2d 896. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the application of the tolling statute against the individual defendants here would not conflict with the <em>Bendix </em>holding. But are the <em>goals </em>of the out-of-state defendant the decisive factor, as the majority\u2019s qualifying phrase suggests? The <em>Bendix </em>majority merely determined, after all, that the \u201cimpermissible burden\u201d test could invalidate tolling statutes as applied to \u201cout-of-state <em>persons </em>* * * <em>engaged in commerce.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>486 U.S. at 893, 108 S.Ct. at 2222, 100 L.Ed.2d at 903. If the <em>goals </em>of the defendant who leaves the state are indeed relevant, the majority fails to explain how or why.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
