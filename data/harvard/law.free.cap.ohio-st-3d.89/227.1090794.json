Under Civ.R. 12(B) and 56(C), a court must notify all parties at least fourteen days before the time fixed for hearing when it converts a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim into a motion for summary judgment. <em>Petrey v. Simon </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 154, 4 OBR 396, 447 N.E.2d 1285, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. Based on <em>Petrey, </em>the court of appeals erred in converting Judge Russo\u2019s motion without notifying the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Nevertheless, this error was harmless because the court of appeals could have taken judicial notice of the mootness of Nelson\u2019s writ action without converting Judge Russo\u2019s dismissal motion to a motion for summary judgment. <em>State ex rel. Findlay Publishing Co. v. Schroeder </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 580, 581, 669 N.E.2d 835, 837, citing <em>State ex rel. Neff v. Corrigan </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 12, 16, 661 N.E.2d 170, 174; see, also, <em>State ex rel. The V Cos. v. Marshall </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 467, 471, 692 N.E.2d 198, 202. In fact, \u201can event that causes a case to be moot may be proved by extrinsic evidence outside the record.\u201d <em>Pewitt v. Lorain Correctional Inst. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 470, 472, 597 N.E.2d 92, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">The entry and findings of fact and conclusions of law attached to Judge Russo\u2019s dismissal motion established that Judge Russo had performed the requested act. Neither mandamus nor procedendo will compel the performance of a duty that has already been performed. <em>State ex rel. Grove v. Nadel </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 252, 253, 703 N.E.2d 304, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-13\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
