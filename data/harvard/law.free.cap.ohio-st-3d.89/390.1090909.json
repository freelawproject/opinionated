Clark v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 563, 565, 634 N.E.2d 1014, 1016. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Claimant asks us to substitute the term \u201cincome\u201d for the terms \u201cwage\u201d and \u201cearnings.\u201d In so doing, claimant seeks to include the amount of \u201cmiscellaneous income\u201d \u2014 which represents reimbursement for lodging, meals, and tool and trucking expenses \u2014 that his employer reported on federal tax form 1099. We decline this invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">\u201cIncome\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cearnings\u201d or \u201cwages.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 714, defines \u201cearnings\u201d as \u201cwages * * * earned as compensation for labor.\u201d Similarly, wages constitute \u201cmonetary remuneration by an employer * * * for labor or services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2568. \u201cIncome,\u201d on the other hand, represents \u201ca gain or recurrent benefit that is [usually] measured in money and for a given period of time, derives from capital, labor, or a combination of both.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1143. Income is a much broader term than \u201cearnings\u201d or \u201cwages,\u201d and cannot, therefore, be used interchangeably.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">This is important, because the distinction in terms transforms claimant\u2019s proposal into a request that we read into a statute words that are not contained therein. This we cannot do. See <em>Carrel v. Allied Products Corp. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 284, 288, 677 N.E.2d 795, 799. Claimant cites other Revised Code and Administrative Code sections that he claims refer more broadly to the concept of income. Those provisions \u2014 most of which apply to unemployment, not workers\u2019 compensation \u2014 are, upon review, all inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Claimant also argues that nothing in R.C. 4123.61 directs the commission to exclude form 1099 \u201cmiscellaneous income\u201d from the AWW calculation. That contention is, however, double-edged, since nothing in that provision demands or authorizes its inclusion. Again, R.C. 4123.61 explicitly refers to average weekly <em>wage, </em>not average weekly <em>income.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">To hold as claimant advocates is inappropriate from a legal perspective, for to do so would permit the inclusion into the AWW calculation of dividends, interest, and other forms of income unrelated to claimant\u2019s job performance. This is clearly not what the General Assembly had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">We recognize that in some situations, lodging, meals, etc. can be part of the wage package. The commission acknowledged this, but found, in its order, that claimant did not present evidence that the disputed money was indeed gainful remuneration rather than simple reimbursement for expenses incurred by claimant. The commission was particularly interested in viewing claimant\u2019s 1040 form and its categorization of the disputed amount, but claimant did not submit that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">We find, therefore, that the commission did not abuse its discretion in failing to include claimant\u2019s form 1099 \u201cmiscellaneous income\u201d in the computation of his AWW.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Absent inclusion of \u201cmiscellaneous income\u201d into his AWW, claimant alternatively asserts that the commission abused its discretion in using the revised calculation that it did. This is a difficult argument to analyze, for it is unclear what the claimant seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">R.C. 4123.61 allows the commission to deviate from the standard AWW formula where there are \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d that render the traditional formula untenable. The commission, in this case, reset claimant\u2019s AWW by multiplying claimant\u2019s $10 hourly wage by forty hours. Claimant argues that this calculation is unfair because during some weeks he worked less than forty hours. In the same breath, however, claimant then states that there were some weeks that he worked more than forty hours. Given these facts, the commission\u2019s decision to simply average these variations out to a forty-hour work week should not be considered an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b621-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
