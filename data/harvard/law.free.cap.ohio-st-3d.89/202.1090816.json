For the following reasons, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">In the absence of a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party challenging that jurisdiction has an adequate remedy at law by appeal. <em>Page v. Riley </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 621, 623, 710 N.E.2d 690, 692. Prohibition will not issue as a substitute for appeal to review mere errors in judgment. <em>Berthelot v. Dezso </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 257, 259, 714 N.E.2d 888, 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Therefore, Brooks had an adequate remedy by appeal to raise his claims on appeal, and he is precluded from raising them by extraordinary writ. See <em>State ex rel. Poore v. Mayer </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 78, 79, 26 O.O.2d 375, 376, 197 N.E.2d 557, 558 (prohibition unavailable to challenge erroneous ruling on the admissibility of evidence); <em>Smith v. Mitchell </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 624, 625, 687 N.E.2d 749, 750 (claims of erroneous jury instructions and verdict forms should have been raised on direct appeal rather than in action for habeas corpus).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">In addition, as the court of appeals noted, the partial transcript attached to Brooks\u2019s complaint established that the 911 tape <em>was </em>admitted into evidence, so that Judge Gaul did not err in permitting the jury to consider it during its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Finally, because it is evident that Brooks seeks release from prison, he should have raised these claims in a habeas corpus action instead of by way of prohibition. See <em>State ex rel. Jackson v. Callahan </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 73, 711 N.E.2d 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-15\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
