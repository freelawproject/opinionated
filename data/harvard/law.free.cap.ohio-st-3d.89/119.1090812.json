I dissent and would suspend respondent for one year with six months stayed with conditions. I believe that respondent\u2019s neglect was so severe that without the mitigation, it would warrant indefinite suspension. However, in consideration of his psychological and medication conditions, I believe a lighter sentence is warranted, but not a full stay of any suspension. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
