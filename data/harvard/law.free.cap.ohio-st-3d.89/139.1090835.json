The General Assembly empowered the Ohio Elections Commission to investigate allegations regarding the dissemination of false and misleading statements by candidates for public office in Ohio, and to take appropriate action when it concludes that a violation has occurred. The commission may exercise its authority, however, only when that authority does not clash with the freedoms of speech and press independently recognized by the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The trial court determined that the commission properly reprimanded Dan McKimm for publishing the illustration contained in his campaign brochure. But the court of appeals reversed, holding that the commission\u2019s order violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because we determine that the court of appeals erred in its analysis of the constitutional issues in this case, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">The Elements of R.C. 3517.21(B)(10)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">At the commission hearing, McKimm conceded that he distributed the brochure intending to affect the outcome of the campaign and to promote his candidacy. All that remained for the commission to determine, therefore, was whether McKimm disseminated (1) a false statement about his opponent, (2) \u201cknowing the same to be false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d R.C. 3517.21(B)(10).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The court of appeals reversed the decision of the trial court on the basis of the second element (termed \u201cactual malice\u201d), holding that the record did not contain clear and convincing evidence that McKimm distributed the cartoon with actual malice. Because we analyze the evidentiary requirements differently than the court of appeals, we conclude that the evidence supports the commission\u2019s findings regarding both elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In Part A, below, we agree with the trial court that, to the reasonable reader, McKimm\u2019s cartoon constitutes a false statement of fact: that Gonzalez accepted a bribe or received an illegal kickback when he voted to award the unbid contract. In Part B, we conclude that, since there was sufficient evidence for the Elections Commission to draw the reasonable inference that McKimm <em>intended, </em>to convey the very message that he <em>did </em>convey about Gonzalez\u2019s \u201ccrime,\u201d and since McKimm admitted that he had no basis to believe that Gonzalez committed bribery during his tenure as trustee, McKimm disseminated the brochure containing this reasonable connotation of bribery with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">A. McKimm\u2019s Money-Under-the-Table Cartoon: To the Reasonable Reader', a False Statement that Gonzalez Committed Bribery</p>\n<p id=\"A2th\">The common pleas court determined that the illustration accompanying Question No. 7 made \u201ca clear and obvious implication that [Gonzalez], in voting to violate township policy, received money \u2014 under the table \u2014 in return.\u201d We agree. Under both the United States and Ohio Constitutions, courts assess the meaning of an allegedly libelous statement under an objective standard \u2014 that of the reasonable reader. <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 1, 21, 110 S.Ct. 2695, 2707, 111 L.Ed.2d 1, 19; <em>Vail v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 649 N.E.2d 182, 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">1. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s Reasonable-Reader Standard</p>\n<p id=\"Ay-\">In <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., </em>the United States Supreme Court applied an objective standard to assess the meaning of allegedly libelous statements in a newspaper column concerning a high school wrestling coach\u2019s testimony before a common pleas court. (1990), 497 U.S. at 21, 110 S.Ct. at 2707, 111 L.Ed.2d at 19. The title of the column stated that the high school \u201cbeat the law with the \u2018big lie.\u2019 \u201d Other statements in the column suggested that lies were told during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>proceedings, such as the phrase, \u201cIf you get in a jam, lie your way out.\u201d The coach sued the newspaper and columnist, alleging that these and other statements in the column in effect accused him of committing the crime of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On appeal, the United States Supreme Court determined that \u201c[t]he dispositive question * * * becomes whether a <em>reasonable factfinder </em>could conclude that the statements in the * * * column imply an assertion that petitioner Milkovich perjured himself in a judicial proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>497 U.S. at 21, 110 S.Ct. at 2707, 111 L.Ed.2d at 19. The Supreme Court concluded that the average reader of the column would be left with just such an impression \u2014 that the wrestling coach perjured himself in order to avoid the athletic association\u2019s orders against his team. <em>Id. </em>To reach this conclusion, the Supreme Court did not consider the columnist\u2019s subjective interpretation of the statements in his column. Rather, the court assessed the \u201cclear impact,\u201d \u201cgeneral tenor,\u201d and \u201cimpression\u201d created by the statements in the column. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Just after deciding <em>Milkovich, </em>the United States Supreme Court again applied an objective, reasonable-reader standard. See <em>Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc. </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 496, 111 S.Ct. 2419, 115 L.Ed.2d 447. In <em>Masson, </em>the court considered whether quotations in a magazine, attributed to a noted psychoanalyst, were verbatim reports of statements that the psychoanalyst actually made or were \u201cnonliteral * * * reconstructions\u201d of Masson\u2019s statements. <em>Id., </em>501 U.S. at 513, 111 S.Ct. at 2431, 115 L.Ed.2d at 470. Because the publisher or author failed to warn the reader that the quotations might not be verbatim, and because the magazine had a reputation for \u201cscrupulous factual accuracy,\u201d the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe <em>reasonable reader </em>would understand the quotations to be nearly verbatim reports of statements made by the subject.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>Taken together, <em>Milkovich </em>and <em>Masson </em>stand for the proposition that, under the United States Constitution, courts assess the meaning of an allegedly libelous statement from the perspective of the reasonable reader \u2014 not from the perspective of the publisher of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">2. Ohio\u2019s Reasonable-Reader Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Even though this court responded to <em>Milkovich </em>by holding that the Ohio Constitution provides a separate and independent guarantee of protection for opinions, we still assess \u201cthe common meaning ascribed to the words by an ordinary reader\u201d in order to determine whether an allegedly libelous statement is a false statement of fact. <em>Vail v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 649 N.E.2d 182, 186; <em>In re Harper </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 211, 228, 673 N.E.2d 1253, 1267. All four factors of Ohio\u2019s test for distinguishing a statement of fact from an opinion depend on the reasonable reader\u2019s perception of the statement \u2014 not on the perception of the publisher. <em>Vail, supra, </em>72 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>St.3d at 282-283, 649 N.E.2d at 185-186; <em>Scott v. News-Herald </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 243, 251-253, 25 OBR 302, 309-311, 496 N.E.2d 699, 707-708.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">As <em>Milkovich, Masson, Vail, </em>and <em>Harper </em>demonstrate, then, the law charges the author of an allegedly defamatory statement with the meaning that the reasonable reader attaches to that statement. See, also, 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1977), Section 563 (\u201cThe meaning of a communication is that which the recipient correctly, or mistakenly but reasonably, understands that it was intended to express.\u201d). If the law were otherwise, publishers of false statements of fact could routinely escape liability for their harmful and false assertions simply by advancing a harmless, subjective interpretation of those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">3. Application of the Reasonable-Reader Standard to McKimm\u2019s Cartoon</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In the case at bar, the Elections Commission could not reprimand McKimm for the illustration accompanying Question No. 7 unless the cartoon, to the reasonable reader, constituted a false statement of fact about Gonzalez. R.C. 3517.21(B)(10); <em>Milkovich; Vail. </em>We conclude that the commission and trial court correctly assessed the meaning of McKimm\u2019s cartoon from the perspective of the reasonable reader and that the average reader would view the cartoon as a false factual assertion that Gonzalez accepted cash in exchange for his vote to award the unbid construction contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Commissioner Duncan explicitly referred to the appropriate standard when he said, \u201c[0]ne wonders what it was that a <em>reasonable reader </em>would perceive after having seen this cartoon.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Shortly thereafter, Commissioner Duncan concluded \u2014 along with the other commissioners who voted to reprimand McKimm \u2014 that the cartoon unambiguously depicted Gonzalez engaging in unlawful activity. Likewise, citing <em>Milkovich </em>and <em>Vail, </em>the common pleas judge determined that McKimm\u2019s illustration was \u201ccapable of only one <em>reasonable </em>interpretation: which is [that Gonzalez] took money under the table to award a contract without competitive bidding and therefore was guilty of bribery.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The phrase \u201cpassing money under the table\u201d connotes an illegal transaction made for personal gain. The drawing depicting this illegal conduct appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>adjacent to text in a \u201cquiz\u201d that made serious and specific allegations about Gonzalez\u2019s conduct as a trustee. The quiz even included a phone number for voters to call for documentation \u2014 suggesting that the statements therein could be proven true. And a political cartoon that falsely depicts a public official engaging in illegal conduct will not be exempt from legal redress merely because the charge is depicted graphically rather than verbally. See 50 American Jurisprudence 2d (1995), Libel and Slander, Section 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">As the commission notes in its merit brief, \u201cWe all know what a hand under a table holding cash implies, particularly * * * in the context of a discussion about a government contract being let contrary to standard policy and without competitive bidding.\u201d McKimm\u2019s cartoon implied to the reasonable reader that Gonzalez actually accepted cash for his vote to award the lucrative, unbid construction contract. Accord <em>DeVito v. Gollinger </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 51, 56, 726 N.E.2d 1048, 1052 (\u201cThe \u2018under the table\u2019 transaction depicted in the cartoon is a clear accusation of bribery, a particularly egregious offense by a public official.\u201d); see, also, <em>Newman v. Delahunty </em>(1994), 293 N.J.Super. 491, 517, 681 A.2d 671, 684 (cartoon about mayor was a \u201cnot so subtle\u201d charge of corruption).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">4. The Innocent-Construction Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">McKimm maintains that the Elections Commission could not find a violation of the election laws for speech that is \u201cclearly susceptible [of] innocent interpretation.\u201d Here, McKimm refers to the rule that \u201cif allegedly defamatory words are susceptible [of] two meanings, one defamatory and one innocent, the defamatory meaning should be rejected, and the innocent meaning adopted.\u201d <em>Yeager v. Local Union 20 </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 369, 372, 6 OBR 421, 423, 453 N.E.2d 666, 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The innocent-construction rule does not protect McKimm\u2019s cartoon in this case. The rule protects only those statements that are <em>reasonably </em>susceptible of an innocent construction. <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo construe a publication in an unreasonable manner in order to give it an innocent interpretation is itself incompatible with the rule\u2019s requirement that words be given their \u2018natural and obvious meaning.\u2019 \u201d 8 Speiser, Krause <em>&amp; </em>Gans, The American Law of Torts (1991) 436, Section 29:39, citing <em>John v. Tribune Co. </em>(1962), 24 Ill.2d 437, 181 N.E.2d 105. Because we agree -with the trial court that McKimm\u2019s drawing of a hand passing cash under a table is susceptible of but one reasonable interpretation \u2014 that Gonzalez accepted money in exchange for his vote to award the unbid contract referred to in the accompanying text \u2014 the rule is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">B. McKimm Disseminated the Cartoon with Actual Malice</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Having determined that McKimm\u2019s cartoon was defamatory, we turn to the only remaining issue: whether McKimm published the cartoon with actual malice \u2014 that is, either knowing that it was false or acting in reckless disregard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>whether it was false or not. R.C. 3517.21(B)(10); <em>Pestrak v. Ohio Elections Comm. </em>(C.A.6, 1991), 926 F.2d 573, 577, citing <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964), 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, and <em>Garrison v. Louisiana </em>(1964), 379 U.S. 64, 75, 85 S.Ct. 209, 216, 13 L.Ed.2d 125, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">1. The Role of the Actual-Malice Standard</p>\n<p id=\"A0X\">By permitting liability only for those- false statements about public officials made with actual malice, courts promote robust criticism of public officials in their conduct of governmental affairs. <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 323, 334, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3004, 41 L.Ed.2d 789, 802. Public officials will often be subject to \u201cvehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks.\u201d <em>New York Times, supra, </em>376 U.S. at 270, 84 S.Ct. at 721, 11 L.Ed.2d at 701. By prohibiting the imposition of strict liability for false statements made against public figures, the actual-malice standard provides essential \u201cbreathing space\u201d'for the criticism that is inevitable in free debate and crucial to our democratic system. <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 767, 772, 106 S.Ct. 1558, 1561, 89 L.Ed.2d 783, 790, quoting <em>New York Times, supra, </em>376 U.S. at 272, 84 S.Ct. at 721, 11 L.Ed.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">On the other hand, the actual-malice standard is not an impenetrable shield for the benefit of those who engage in false speech about public figures. \u201c[F]alse speech, even political speech, does not merit constitutional protection if the speaker knows of the falsehood or recklessly disregards the truth.\u201d <em>Pestrak, supra, </em>926 F.2d at 577. \u201c[T]he use of the known he as a tool is at once at odds with the premises of democratic government and with the orderly manner in which economic, social, or political change is to be effected. * * * Hence the knowingly false statement and the false statement made with reckless disregard of the truth, do not enjoy constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Garrison, supra, </em>379 U.S. at 75, 85 S.Ct. at 216, 13 L.Ed.2d at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">2. The Evidentiary Requirements of the Actual-Malice Standard</p>\n<p id=\"Avm\">Whether the evidence in the record supports a finding of actual malice is a question of law. <em>Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 657, 685, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 2694, 105 L.Ed.2d 562, 587. To answer this question, we are obliged to undertake an independent review of the record. <em>Id. </em>at 659, 109 S.Ct. at 2681, 105 L.Ed.2d at 571. We may not infer the existence of actual malice from evidence of personal spite or ill will alone; rather, our focus is on the publisher\u2019s attitude toward the truth or falsity of the publication. <em>Perez v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 215, 520 N.E.2d 198, paragraph two of the syllabus. But evidence of ill will can be relevant: \u201c \u2018This standard requires a clear and convincing showing, which may be by <em>circumstantial evidence, </em>of the defendant\u2019s actual state of mind \u2014 either subjective awareness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of probable falsity or actual intent to publish falsely.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>National Rifle Assn. v. Dayton Newspapers, Inc. </em>(S.D.Ohio 1983), 555 F.Supp. 1299, 1304, quoting <em>Yiamouyiannis v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc. </em>(C.A.2 1980), 619 F.2d 932, 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">To support its interpretation of the evidence required to support a finding of actual malice, the court of appeals relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc. </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 485, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502. But the <em>Bose </em>court found clear and convincing evidence of actual malice lacking only because the author\u2019s statement \u2014 which misdescribed the sound of a loudspeaker in a Consumer Reports review\u2014 \u201cwas \u2018one of a number of possible rational interpretations\u2019 of an event that \u2018bristled with ambiguities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 104 S.Ct. at 1966, 80 L.Ed.2d at 525, quoting <em>Time, Inc. v. Pape </em>(1971), 401 U.S. 279, 290, 91 S.Ct. 633, 639, 28 L.Ed.2d 45, 53. McKimm\u2019s cartoon, on the other hand, judged by the reasonable-reader standard, suggested that Gonzalez .engaged in an illegal act. A cartoon that depicts the commission of an illegal act is not a \u201cpossible rational interpretation\u201d of events when the author has <em>no basis </em>to believe that an illegal act has occurred. Accordingly, we conclude that the appellate court\u2019s reliance on <em>Bose </em>was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In <em>St. Amant v. Thompson </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 727, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262, also cited by the court of appeals, the Supreme Court discussed the evidence that is required to support a conclusion that a defamation defendant has acted in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of his or her publication. The <em>Thompson </em>court held that \u201c[tjhere must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that <em>the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts </em>as to the truth of his publication.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>390 U.S. at 731, 88 S.Ct. at 1325, 20 L.Ed.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\"><em>Thompson </em>certainly requires evidence of the defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind in order to satisfy the actual-malice standard. <em>Id. </em>at 733, 88 S.Ct. at 1326, 20 L.Ed.2d at 268. But <em>Thompson </em>also explicitly limits the ability of defendants to subvert the standard with self-serving testimony. \u201cThe defendant * * * cannot, however, automatically insure a favorable verdict by testifying that he published with a belief that the statements were true. The finder of fact must determine whether the publication was indeed made in good faith. Professions of good faith will be unlikely to prove persuasive, for example, where a story is fabricated by the defendant, [or] is the product of his imagination * * * .\u201d <em>Id., </em>390 U.S. at 732, 88 S.Ct. at 1326, 20 L.Ed.2d at 267-268.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We conclude that the record in this case clearly and convincingly confirms that McKimm\u2019s conduct surpassed the actual-malice threshold. McKimm\u2019s testimony before the commission amply supported that body\u2019s conclusion \u2014 and our own\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>that McKimm <em>intended </em>to convey to township voters the false message that the drawing <em>did </em>convey to the reasonable reader of his brochure.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">McKimm knew that Gonzalez and the other trustees were not legally obliged to solicit bids for the construction contract before awarding it, and knew that the trustees awarded the unbid contract only after discussion in an open meeting. McKimm also testified, however, that he personally disapproved of Gonzalez\u2019s vote, and that he felt a wrongdoing had occurred. In this, McKimm saw an opportunity \u2014 for he testified that, if township voters were aware of what happened, \u201cthey would have reacted in the same fashion that I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">But instead of merely disseminating his brochure with the bare facts that appeared in the text of Question No. 7, McKimm chose to accompany those facts with a cartoon. That cartoon, as we have already determined, unambiguously depicts a hand passing money under the table \u2014 a concept with which McKimm admitted he was personally familiar. McKimm, however, also admitted that he had <em>no basis </em>to believe that Gonzalez had engaged in any illegal conduct during his tenure as trustee. As the trial court determined, McKimm chose \u201cto illustrate the right of the voters to question [Gonzalez\u2019s] conduct by illustrating a criminal act, where no evidence exists to support such an act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">When called to answer for his choice before the commission, McKimm admitted that he knew of the phrase \u201cpassing money under the table,\u201d and that he had no basis to believe that Gonzalez had participated in such an act \u2014 or any illegal acts \u2014 during his tenure as trustee. McKimm also testified implausibly by insisting that the hand in his drawing appeared either on the \u201cother side of the table,\u201d or \u201cbehind the table,\u201d but \u201cnot under the table.\u201d See <em>Thompson, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 732, 88 S.Ct. at 1326, 20 L.Ed.2d at 267-268. After our independent review of this record, we agree with the commission and the trial court that McKimm disseminated his cartoon well aware of its false implication. McKimm conveyed a message to the reasonable reader that he knew had no basis in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The commission properly acted in this case to recognize society\u2019s \u201cpervasive and strong interest in preventing and redressing attacks upon reputation.\u201d <em>Rosenblatt v. Baer </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 75, 86, 86 S.Ct. 669, 676, 15 L.Ed.2d 597, 605.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that when a candidate for public office distributes a campaign brochure containing an illustration with accompanying text that imply to the reasonable reader that the candidate\u2019s opponent committed an illegal act while in office, and the candidate lacks any basis to believe that the opponent committed the act depicted in the brochure, the Ohio Elections Commission may constitutionally determine that the candidate violated R.C. 3517.21(B)(10). Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals, and reinstate the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

The commission must apply a standard of clear and convincing evidence with respect to findings under R.C. 3517.21. R.C. 3517.155(D). Former R.C. 3599.091, which also forbade falsehoods in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>election campaigns (subsection [B]), permitted the commission to impose fines and issue cease-and-desist orders under a lesser preponderance standard (subsection [C]), but the Sixth Circuit held these enforcement methods unconstitutional, since the United States Supreme Court had determined that \u201cno punishment may be levied in areas trenching on the first amendment involving public figures without \u2018clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pestrak v. Ohio Elections Comm. </em>(C.A.6, 1991), 926 F.2d 573, 578, citing <em>New York Times Co. v.

The first factor, the court\u2019s inquiry into the specific language used, focuses on \u201cthe common meaning ascribed to the words by an ordinary reader.\u201d Under the second factor, which examines whether the allegedly defamatory statement is verifiable, we noted that when a statement \u201clacks a plausible method of verification, a reasonable reader will not believe that the statement has specific factual content.\u201d <em>Vail, supra, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 282-283, 649 N.E.2d at 186. The third factor considers the reaction of \u201cthe average reader viewing the words in their internal context,\u201d and the fourth factor focuses on the broader context of the statement from \u201cthe reader\u2019s viewpoint.\u201d <em>Scott, supra, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 253, 25 OBR at 311, 496 N.E.2d at 708.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\">. McKimm argues for the first time to this court that the commission lacked the authority to send him a letter of reprimand or to punish him \u201cby publicly branding him as a violator of O.R.C. \u00a7 3517.21(B), a criminal offense.\u201d McKimm did not raise this objection before the commission, the common pleas court, or the court of appeals. Accordingly, we do not address this issue here. In general, \u201can appellate court will not consider any error which counsel for a party complaining of the trial court\u2019s judgment could have called but did not call to the trial court\u2019s attention at a time when such error could have been avoided or corrected by the trial court.\u201d <em>State v.
