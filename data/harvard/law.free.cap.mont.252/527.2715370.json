Merzlak and Janene L. Merzlak (Merzlaks) brought an action for legal malpractice against their attorney James E. Purcell and his law firm Henningsen &amp; Purcell, PC. (Purcell). The Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, found Purcell negligently represented the Merzlaks, ordered the return of $12,398.20 in attorney\u2019s fees together with interest, and denied punitive damages. Merzlaks appeal the amount of the judgment. Purcell cross-appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">We find the following issues dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">1. Did the Merzlaks satisfy all elements necessary to prove legal malpractice against Purcell?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">2. Did the court improperly award the Merzlaks $12,398.20 in attorney\u2019s fees plus interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">On November 12, 1982, the Merzlaks, passengers in a vehicle driven by Kerry Hansen, were injured in a head-on collision. The accident occurred on an icy bridge, on Interstate 90, west of Superior, Montana. Joe Merzlak, Janene Merzlak, Kerry Hansen, and Kerry\u2019s wife, Ruth Hansen were traveling from Butte to Spokane when a semi-tractor truck and trailer owned by Livestock Transport Company of Washington (Livestock) struck the vehicle. The Livestock vehicle, traveling east on Interstate 90, veered into Hansen\u2019s westbound lane to avoid a vehicle disabled in the eastbound lane. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>impact killed Kerry Hansen, and injured the Merzlaks and Ruth Hansen. Purcell represented the Merzlaks in their settlement negotiations with Livestock\u2019s insurer. This representation underlies the Merzlaks\u2019 malpractice claim against Purcell. Purcell settled the Merzlaks\u2019 claims with Livestock\u2019s insurer for $50,000. Merzlaks claim this settlement amount was undervalued.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The District Court found Purcell negligently represented the Merzlaks by failing to obtain informed consent for settlement, settling without current medical information, and simultaneously representing the Merzlaks, Ruth Hansen and the estate of Kerry Hansen.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Did the Merzlaks satisfy all elements necessary to prove legal malpractice against Purcell?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Attorney malpractice is professional negligence. In order to recover in a professional negligence action, \u201cthe plaintiff must prove that the professional owed him a duty, and that the professional failed to live up to that duty, thus causing damages to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Lorash v. Epstein </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 21, 24, 767 P.2d 1335, 1337, quoting <em>Carlson v. Morton </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 234, 238, 745 P.2d 1133, 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The proper measure of damage in an attorney malpractice action is the difference between the client\u2019s recovery and the amount that would have been recovered by the client except for the attorney\u2019s negligence. \"... [A] claim of malpractice must be supported not only by a showing of malpractice by ... [the attorney], but by a showing that hut for\u2019 their negligence, [the client] ... would have recovered additional amounts ...\u201d <em>Weaver v. Law Firm of Graybill </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 175, 179, 803 P.2d 1089, 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Purcell contends that the Merzlaks did not prove Purcell\u2019s conduct caused them damage. As later discussed, the District Court agreed with that contention. Failure to prove damages is fatal to an attorney malpractice action. <em>Kinniburgh v. Garrity </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 350, 355, 798 P.2d 102, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">In its Memorandum, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the District Court properly concluded that in order to establish a cause of action for legal malpractice, there must be a showing that the attorney owed his client a duty of care, that there was a breach of this duty by a failure to use reasonable care and skill, and that the breach was the proximate cause of the client\u2019s injury and resulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>damages. The key Finding of Fact with regard to damages is the following partial statement from Finding of Fact 37 by the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">37.....Insufficient evidence was presented to enable this Court to be convinced that a settlement value could be placed on this case had Purcell not handled the case as he did ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The District Court reached the following key conclusion on the issue of damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">The issue of damages is a troubling aspect of this case. As noted in Findings of Fact #3 7, the testimony regarding the settlement value of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims was very speculative and does not afford a sufficient basis for an award of damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">We have carefully reviewed the evidence and conclude that the District Court was correct in its finding that insufficient evidence was presented to establish a settlement value different from the value negotiated by Purcell. We further agree with the conclusion of the District Court that the testimony regarding the settlement value of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims was speculative and did not afford a sufficient basis for an award of damages. As in <em>Kinniburgh, </em>we conclude that the failure to prove damages is fatal to the attorney malpractice action. We hold that the Merzlaks failed to prove legal malpractice against Purcell because of their failure to prove damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Did the court improperly award the Merzlaks $12,398.20 in attorney\u2019s fees plus interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The District Court concluded that Purcell breached his duty of reasonable care in representing the Merzlaks. Accordingly it ordered a return of the attorney\u2019s fee paid by the Merzlaks to Purcell in the amount of $12,298.20, together with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">While Purcell may have breached his duty of care, that is insufficient to justify an award of damages. Lorash, <em>Kinniburgh </em>and <em>Weaver. </em>Failure to prove damages is fatal to the action. Thus, we hold that the District Court improperly awarded the Merzlaks $12,398.20 in attorney\u2019s fees, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">We remand for the entry of a judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-14\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT, GRAY, McDONOUGH concur.
