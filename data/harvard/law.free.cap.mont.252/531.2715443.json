The District Court further sentenced Harvey to 4000 hours of community service. We affirm on another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">We rephrase the issues presented on appeal to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Did the District court err when it suspended Harvey\u2019s sentences of ten years imprisonment for attempt (deliberate homicide) and two years imprisonment for use of a dangerous weapon under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(5) and -221(3), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Harvey and Katherine Jean Niemi (Jean) were married on June 10,1966. Following their marriage, the couple resided in Great Falls, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Both Harvey and Jean were employed as teachers; Jean retired in 1988 and Harvey retired in 1989. Through the years, Harvey and Jean generally were viewed as a happily married couple. Many perceived Harvey to be a mild-mannered, non-violent, and kind person. Prior to January 1990, Harvey\u2019s criminal record consisted of one minor traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">On January 9,1990, Harvey and Jean began a normal day at home. Following a noon-time meal, Harvey told Jean that he was going to a local store to purchase some remodeling supplies. However, Harvey did not leave the home. He went to the basement, changed his clothing, put on an old pair of eyeglasses and a pair of panty hose over bis head, and placed rubber gloves on his hands. He then waited for Jean to enter the basement. When Jean entered the basement to use a bathroom, Harvey stabbed her several times with a knife, wounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>her in the head, chest, stomach, and hand. Following the stabbing, Harvey expressed remorse and said he could not understand how he could have committed such an offense. Jean recovered from the stab wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">On January 23, 1990, the State charged Harvey by information with one count of attempt (deliberate homicide). Harvey pled not guilty to this charge on February 14, 1990. A jury trial was held on November 13 to November 20,1990. At the trial, Harvey testified that for years he had repressed anger concerning Jean. He further testified that at the time of the stabbing, he felt he was not in his body, but rather, was above and behind his body, watching what was happening. Dr. William Stratford, a psychiatrist, testified that at the time of the stabbing, Harvey experienced a dissociative state of mind. On November 20, 1990, the jury found Harvey guilty of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Prior to sentencing, Harvey moved the District Court to find that \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, exempted him from the mandatory minimum sentencing penalties contained in \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA, the sentencing provision for deliberate homicide, and \u00a7 46-18-221(1), MCA, a sentencing provision for use of a dangerous weapon. Harvey argued that \u00a7 46-18-222(2) and (3), MCA, exempted him from the mandatory minimum sentences because at the time he stabbed Jean 1) his mental capacity was significantly impaired, and 2) he was acting under unusual and substantial duress. At the sentencing hearing, Harvey abandoned his argument that he was acting under unusual and substantial duress at the time he stabbed Jean but maintained that his mental capacity was significantly impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Following oral argument, the District Court found that Harvey\u2019s mental capacity at the time he stabbed Jean did not exempt him from the mandatory minimum sentences under \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102(2) and 46-18-221(1), MCA. The District court sentenced Harvey to ten years imprisonment for attempt (deliberate homicide) and two years imprisonment for use of a dangerous weapon, both sentences suspended except for fifteen days already served. The District Court further sentenced Harvey to 4000 hours of community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The State filed its notice of appeal regarding Harvey\u2019s sentence on January 15, 1991. Harvey likewise filed a notice of appeal on March 8, 1991. On June 4, 1991, the State filed a brief, which in part anticipated and discussed issues Harvey could raise in his cross-appeal. On August 6, 1991, Harvey filed a brief that resembles the format of a cross-appeal. On August 13, 1991, Harvey moved this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Court to stay his appeal pending the outcome of the State\u2019s appeal under Montana Rule of Appellate Procedure 3. On September 9,1991, this Court granted Harvey\u2019s request for a stay of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Because Harvey\u2019s cross-appeal has been stayed by this Court, issues raised by both the State and Harvey in their respective briefs that pertain to Harvey\u2019s cross-appeal will not be discussed herein. Accordingly, we will limit our discussion to the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Did the District Court err when it suspended Harvey\u2019s sentences of ten years imprisonment for attempt (deliberate homicide) and two years imprisonment for use of a dangerous weapon under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(5) and -221(3), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The District Court at the sentencing hearing held that Harvey\u2019s mental capacity at the time he stabbed Jean did not exempt him from mandatory minimum sentencing -under \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA. The District Court acknowledged, however, that it was a \u201cclose question\u201d as to whether Harvey\u2019s mental capacity was significantly impaired at the time of the offense under \u00a7 46-18-222(2), MCA. The District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">When you look at what happened here, the overall event that occurred it is almost incredible and it is difficult to believe that anybody in their right mind in full possession of their mental faculties would have committed this offense under these circumstances.... And although there has been a psychiatric explanation of what happened, this dissociative state, the jury did not accept that offered evidence in determining guilt of Mr. Niemi. Although the required proof, I think, to establish this mental capacity exception, I don\u2019t think it requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt as do the elements of the criminal offense. But, I really question whether \u2014 there is certainly some indication, certainly some testimony here that the mental capacity of Mr. Niemi was impaired at that time when this offense occurred and maybe for a short period of time before it occurred when he was waiting. But, I find it difficult to accept that Mr. Niemi\u2019s mental capacity was so significantly impaired to justify an exception from mandatory minimum sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">This is the most -unusual criminal case that I have presided over in my 14 years on the bench. It\u2019s very bizarre. Serious and yet the people that are involved are exemplary people and it just borders on mind boggling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The District Court further held that incarceration in this instance would be inappropriate in light ofHarvey\u2019s stellar community service record, the nature of the offense, the unlikelihood that Harvey would ever attempt to harm Jean again, Harvey\u2019s remorse, and his lack of a previous criminal record. Thereafter, the District Court, <em>inter alia, </em>sentenced Harvey to the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment for attempt (deliberate homicide) under \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA, and the mandatory minimum sentence of two years imprisonment for use of a dangerous weapon under \u00a7 46-18-221(1), MCA; the court suspended both sentences except for fifteen days already served. The District Court cited <em>State v. Arbgast </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 220, 656 P.2d 828, as authority for its ability to suspend Harvey\u2019s mandatory minimum sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The State argues that <em>Arbgast </em>is not applicable to these facts. The State further argues that the District Court erred by suspending the sentences in this case under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(5) and -221(3), MCA. Section 46-18-201(5), MCA, provides \u201c[ejxcept as provided in 46-18-222, the imposition or execution of the first 10 years of a sentence of imprisonment imposed under 45-5-102 may not be deferred or suspended.\u201d Section 46-18-221(3), MCA, provides that the mandatory minimum sentence for use of a dangerous weapon \u201cmay not be deferred or suspended, except as provided in 46-18- 222. \u201d The State argues that because the District Court held that \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, did not apply, \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(5) and -221(3), MCA, require the court to sentence Harvey to serve twelve years imprisonment for attempt (deliberate homicide) and use of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We agree that <em>Arbgast </em>is not applicable here. In <em>Arbgast, </em>suspension of the defendant\u2019s sentence was not specifically limited by statute to one of the exceptions contained in \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA. Here, both statutes under which Harvey was sentenced expressly prohibit suspension of the sentence <em>unless </em>\u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">However, following a careful review of the record, we hold that the sentences at issue herein can be suspended because Harvey\u2019s mental capacity at the time of the offense was significantly impaired under \u00a7 46-18-222(2), MCA. Section 46-18-222(2), MCA, provides in part that a defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence may be suspended if \u201cthe defendant\u2019s mental capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense for which he is to be sentenced, was significantly impaired, <em>although not so impaired as to constitute a defense to the prosecution.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.] Here, the jury did not find that Dr. Stratford\u2019s testimony concerning Harvey\u2019s mental state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>supported a defense to the offense. However, \u00a7 46-18-222(2), MCA, still allows a court in sentencing a defendant to suspend mandatory minimum sentencing if it finds the defendant\u2019s mental capacity was significantly impaired but not so impaired as to constitute a defense. We emphasize again that the District Court stated that the issue of whether Harvey was significantly impaired was a \u201cclose question.\u201d Moreover, we are persuaded by Dr. Stratford\u2019s testimony, which details how Harvey experienced a dissociative state of mind at the time of the offense. We therefore affirm the result of the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentencing order on the ground that Harvey is exempt from mandatory minimum sentencing under \u00a7 46-18-222 (2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b558-5\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNTER, WEBER AND McDonough concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
