Petitioners Karen Sparks, the defendant in that proceeding, and Jerry O\u2019Neil seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including a writ of mandamus. They request this Court\u2019s declaration that O\u2019Neil and other non-attorneys similarly situated have the right, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-31-601 and 37-61-210, MCA, to act as attorneys in Montana courts of limited jurisdiction on a regular and recurring basis. The Office of the Attorney General responded, as did Whitefish City Judge Brad Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The petition before us raises the question of lay representation in Montana\u2019s courts of limited jurisdiction. While it is clear that Article VII, \u00a7 2(3) of the 1972 Montana Constitution vests exclusive jurisdiction in this Court to make rules governing practice in all Montana courts, we have not heretofore comprehensively addressed this issue which now is arising with increasing frequency. Because of the statewide importance and implications of the issue, we accept original jurisdiction of this petition pursuant to Article VII, \u00a7 2(1) of the 1972 Montana Constitution, and the procedures set forth in Rule 17 of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure, in order to provide guidance on the question of lay representation to the courts of limited jurisdiction throughout the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The underlying facts upon which this proceeding is based are not in dispute. The Whitefish City Attorney filed a complaint against Karen Sparks in Whitefish City Court for misdemeanor theft pursuant to \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA. At her initial appearance on September 18, 1991, Sparks appeared and acknowledged that she possessed a copy of the complaint and that she was aware an arrest warrant had been issued. Sparks was informed of her right to counsel and her right to a continuance so she could obtain counsel. Sparks pled not guilty and requested a court-appointed attorney. The court explained that it was not seeking confinement for Sparks and, therefore, would not provide her with a court-appointed attorney. Sparks persisted, prompting the court to provide defendant with an Affidavit/Request for Court Appointed Counsel form.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">After Sparks\u2019 repeated attempts to secure court-appointed counsel, the court issued a Memorandum on October 17, 1991, concluding again that she was not entitled to court-appointed counsel but could obtain private counsel. On or about October 21, 1991, Jerry O\u2019Neil filed a notice of appearance in the Whitefish City Court indicating that he would appear on behalf of defendant Sparks. The court subsequently denied O\u2019Neil the right to represent Sparks in City Court and a jury trial was set for November 7, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The present petition was filed with this Court on November 8, 1991, seeking a stay of pending proceedings in the Whitefish City Court, a declaratory judgment that O\u2019Neil has the right under \u00a7\u00a7 25-31-601, MCA, and 37-61-210, MCA, to act as an attorney in the justice and city courts of Montana, and related injunctive and mandamus relief. This Court stayed the underlying proceedings. Additionally, Sparks requested that she be awarded her costs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. We do not address herein Sparks\u2019 request for costs and expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Standing is a threshold issue. <em>Stoianoff v. State of Montana </em>(9th Cir. 1983), 695 F.2d 1214. Thus, we must determine at the outset whether Jerry O\u2019Neil has standing in the action before us. We conclude that he does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Although included as a \u201cpetitioner\u201d in the caption of the petition to this Court, O\u2019Neil essentially seeks to come before us as a legal representative of Sparks. O\u2019Neil, an acknowledged lay person and not an attorney of record, possesses no legally recognized relationship to Sparks; therefore, he will not be recognized by this Court in the conduct or disposition of the case. <em>Clinton v. Miller </em>(1951), 124 Mont. 463, 226 P.2d 487. We construe this action to be a pro se action by Karen Sparks seeking representation by the person of her choice in the city court criminal proceeding in which she is a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Sparks contends that \u00a7 25-31-601, MCA, authorizes lay representation in criminal cases in Montana justices\u2019 courts. She argues further that \u00a7 37-61-210, MCA, extends that right to lay representation in criminal cases to city courts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Section 25-31-601, MCA, provides that \u201c[pjarties injustice\u2019s court may appear and act in person or by attorney; and any person, except the constable by whom the summons or jury process was served, may act as attorney.\u201d The statute is found in Title 25 of the Montana Code Annotated, entitled \u201cCivil Procedure.\u201d Chapter 31 of that Title is \u201cProcedure in Justices\u2019 Courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Section 25-31-601, MCA, is limited, by its plain language and placement in the Montana codes, to civil litigation injustices\u2019 courts. It does not apply to criminal proceedings in those courts or in other courts of limited jurisdiction. The criminal procedure statutes applicable to courts of limited jurisdiction, set forth in Title 46, Chapter 17, parts 1 through 4, do not contain language permitting representation by \u201cany person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Sparks\u2019 further contention that lay representation in criminal proceedings is extended to city courts by virtue of \u00a7 37-61-210, MCA, is also incorrect, even aside from our conclusion above that Montana law does not authorize lay representation in criminal proceedings in justices\u2019 courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Section 37-61-210, MCA, is entitled \u201cpenalty for practicing without license\u201d and provides that \u201c[i]f any person practices law in any court, except a justice\u2019s court or a city court, without having received a license as attorney and counselor, he is guilty of a contempt of court.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Sparks\u2019 reliance on \u00a7 37-61-210, MCA, as authority for legal representation by \u201cany person\u201d in a criminal proceeding in city court, is erroneous. Both the plain language and the placement of \u00a7 37-61-210, MCA, in the Licensing part of Title 37 (entitled \u201cProfessions and Occupations\u201d), Chapter 61 (entitled \u201cAttorneys at Law\u201d) of the Montana Code Annotated make it clear that it is a licensing and penalty statute. It does not, by its terms, authorize practice in either justices\u2019 or city courts; it merely alludes to, and exempts from penalty, such practice as may be authorized by other statutes. Therefore, we conclude that only such practice before courts of limited jurisdiction as is specifically authorized by existing statute or Court rule can be undertaken by lay people.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Sparks\u2019 reliance on a past Order of this Court in a case to which she was not a party is also to no avail. Orders without accompanying opinions have no precedential value from case to case, but pertain only to the circumstances of the action involved. 20 Am. Jur.2d, <em>Courts </em>\u00a7189.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Sparks\u2019 final contention is that \u00a7 25-31-601, MCA, authorizes lay representation of parties in courts of limited jurisdiction on a regular and recurring basis. While this is a case of first impression in Montana, statutes similar to \u00a7 25-31-601, MCA, have been addressed in other states and held applicable only to a \u201cone time\u201d representation of a party in a justice or magistrate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\"><em>State ex rel. Freison v. Isner </em>(W.Va. 1981), 285 S.E.2d 641, involved a collection agency appearing in magistrate court on behalf of petitioner\u2019s creditors through its nonlawyer manager. The court found that the statute authorizing appearances by lay persons in civil litigation did not permit the unauthorized practice of law, but anticipated the representation of a party by a nonlawyer on a \u201ccasual, non-recurring, non-pay basis as a means of assisting the party pro se.\u201d <em>Freison, </em>285 S.E. 2d at 655. The <em>Freison </em>court concluded that the West Virginia law, similar to Montana\u2019s, provides only for \u201can isolated or casual appearance by a non-lawyer friend or relative of a party to proceedings in magistrate court... <em>.\u2019\u2019Freison, </em>285 S.E.2d at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Similarly, the Supreme Court of Iowa held that a bill collector who attempted to bring suit injustice court as an assignee of his various clients was prohibited from doing so. <em>Bump v. Barnett </em>(Iowa 1944), 16 N.W.2d 579. The Iowa court, in referring to a statute much like \u00a7 25-31-601, MCA, stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">\u201cThe salutary purpose of the statute may not thus be perverted to encourage the growth of a class of \u2018justice court lawyers,\u2019 unfettered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>by the rules that bind licensed attorneys and without training in law and ethics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><em>Bump, </em>16 N.W.2d at 582-583. The Iowa court concluded that the bill collector was engaged in the illegal practice of law by his repeated representations in justice court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We agree with the reasoning of the West Virginia and Iowa courts. Section 25-31-601, MCA, was not intended to permit the unauthorized practice of law; the intent is to enable a friend or relative to assist and speak on behalf of a party at one proceeding. We hold that the statute is a \u201cone-time only\u201d grant of a privilege in justices\u2019 court civil proceedings. Further, we extend this specific privilege to civil proceedings in city courts pursuant to our constitutional authority to make rules governing practice for all Montana courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Finally, even if the underlying proceeding in Whitefish City Court were a civil one, it is clear that O\u2019Neil\u2019s representation of Sparks would not be permissible. We take judicial notice that O\u2019Neil attempted to represent at least one other person in a criminal action in a court of limited jurisdiction. See <em>Jerry O\u2019Neil and Clark Albertson v. Dale E. Gifford, </em>Order No. 88-145, April 25,1988. We also note that petitioner\u2019s brief herein provides a list of O\u2019Neil\u2019s \u201cclients.\u201d Neither O\u2019Neil nor any other lay person has authority to represent \u201cclients\u201d on a recurring basis in courts of limited jurisdiction. Such recurring representation constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Nothing herein impacts on the \u201cstudent practice rule\u201d at the University of Montana School of Law. Under this rule, students who have completed two years of law school are supervised by a licensed attorney and perform legal activities in Montana courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Petition herein, and all relief requested therein, is denied and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the stay of further proceedings in <em>City of Whitefish v. Karen Sparks </em>is hereby lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">DATED this 6th day of February, 1992.</p>\n<author id=\"b66-11\">s/ J.A. Turnage. Chief Justice</author>\n<author id=\"AU\">s/ John C.
