That he re-took her by virtue of a warrant from a justice of the peace; and that the court rejected the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-9\">Verdict for the plaintiffs : And the defendant moved for a new trial, upon the affidavit of his counsel, stating that he was prepared at the trial to have proved the facts alledged in the bill of exceptions; that he had intended to have pleaded specially, and thought he had done so, until after the jury were sworn to try the issue: That the counsel practising in that court attend other courts, and are obliged, from that cause, to be frequently absent when the rules, in the clerk\u2019s office, are held; by which means, pleas, not intended, are entered ; and that the members of the bar are Jn the habit of admitting amendments at any time, (often after the jury are sworn); but that privilege had been refused him, on the present occasion. And that the court being equally divided in opinion upon the point, the motion fell, and the evidence was consequently disallowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-10\">The district court gave judgment for the plaintiffs; and the defendant appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-11\"><em>G.

Raym. </em>1413. <em>Salk. </em>636. 1 Stra. 621. 2 <em>Call, </em>39. There is a difference in this respect between the practice of the court of common pleas, and that of the king\u2019s bench, owing to the circumstance of the writ being set forth at large in the first, but not in the latter, 1 <em>Wils. </em>99. 2 <em>Wils. </em>203: and we follow the practice of the king\u2019s bench. The evidence offered by the defendant to prove that the slave belonged to him, ought to have been received; for the title may be gone into upon the general issue, whether the contest respects real or personal property. 7 <em>T. Rep. </em>354. 12 <em>Vin. Ab. </em>147. <em>Bull. Nis. Pr. </em>90. 8 <em>T. Rep. </em>404. 12 <em>Vin. Ab. </em>148, 149. 5 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>217. There ought to have been a new trial, on account of the surprize; for the defendant\u2019s counsel intended to plead the special matter, but was prevented by mistake,</p>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b549-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\n<em>Cur. adv. unit.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-3\">\n<em>Williams, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6YU\">The doctrine of <em>quod cum </em>has long been disregarded, as unreasonable, and Mr. <em>Hay\u2019s </em>own cases prove it; for 1 <em>Wils. </em>99, shews that <em>quare vi et armis, </em>is sufficient; and that the <em>quod cum, </em>may be rejected as surplusage. 1 <em>Wils. </em>100. And in 2 <em>Wils. </em>204, the court speak certainly as to the court of common pleas, and doubtfully as to the king\u2019s bench. The second point is equally untenable; for the old rule was, that special matter could not be given in evidence upon the general issue. 6 <em>Mod. </em>153. 12 <em>Vin. Ab. </em>169, 202: And, although that rule has been relaxed in some degree, it has not been carried so far as is contended for on the other side | for whether the defendant had title to the slave or not, he had no right to enter in a hostile manner upon the plaintiff\u2019s land to take her. There was no ground for a new trial, as the defendant ought to have pleaded his justification, if he meant to avail himself of it. The indulgence allowed each other by the members of the bar, is not important, as it might be retracted, 6 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>671; and the district court had a legal discretion upon the point; which does not appear to have been exercised improperly. Besides, a new trial could not be asked for after a bill of exceptions. 1 <em>Wash. 5.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-4\"><em>Botts, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoj\">A recital never amounts to a charge, either in pleadings or conveyances. The defendant ought to have been permitted to prove title in the property. 5 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>607, 608, 627, 628. Which is the stronger, as the plaintiff went only for the value of the property. There ought to have been a new trial j for justice required it, as there was a complete surprize on the part of the defendant and his counsel.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b549-6\">Roane, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AUjB\">It always gives me pain to reverse judgments upon grounds which appear to be technical, and do not entirely accord with the general understanding of men. But I hold myself bound by well established precedents, and disclaim a power to change the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>In the case before us, I am compelled to consider the declaration as radically defective, in not making a positive charge of the trespass therein mentioned. Finding in 5 <em>Bac. </em>345, a direct authority to this point, (which was not cited at the bar,) I shall rely on it in addition to the cases which were cited. It is there held, that \u201c the declaration must contain such certain affirmation that it may be traversed; for, if there be no certain affirmation to make the declaration itself traversable, it will not be cured after a verdict, because it is a defect in substance; as if the declaration be <em>quod cum </em>the defendant assaulted Him, and the defendant plead not guilty, here is nothing put in issue; for the pleadings have affirmed nothing; and though the defendant be found guilty, yet cannot the plaintiff have judgment; because nothing is positively affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">This position is believed to be entirely supported by all the cases antient and modern; and has never been departed from but in relation to declarations in the court of <em>common pleas </em>in England; and there only, on the ground that the writ is incorporated with, and made part of the declaration, and is considered to cure the defect. This has never been holden to be the law, however, in the court of king\u2019s bench, except when acting as a court of error upon proceedings in - the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">However the statute of <em>jeofails </em>may be construed to operate, it has often been decided here that it did not extend to cure an omission to state the very substance and <em>git </em>of the action. In addition to the cases cited at the bar, I will beg leave to add the case of <em>Francisco </em>v. <em>Winston, 2 </em>Wash. 187; which in principle is not unlike the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">On this ground, therefore, without deciding upon the points adjudged by the district court at the trial, I am compelled to say, that the declaration is substantially defective, and that the judgment ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b550-12\">Fleming, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AYV\">I. think the evidence ought to have been received; for although it might not have amounted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>a justification, it would have gone to mitigate the damages. But the <em>quod cum </em>is fatal; for there must be an affirmative charge; and, although the defect is cured by the writ in the court of common pleas, it is not in the court of king\u2019s bench; to which the practice here conforms. I am therefore of opinion, that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b551-4\">Carrington, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ABS\">The <em>quod cum </em>was formerly an objection; but the modern authorities have shaken it. I think it is surplusage merely, and cured by the act of <em>jeofails. </em>The court does not usually reverse because there is too much, but because there is too little, in the declaration; for in the first case the redundancy is expunged, and the substantial parts preserved. Thus in <em>Chichester </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>1 Call, 83. <em>Winston v. Francisco, </em>2 Wash. 187; and <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Simm, </em>2 Call, 39, there was a defect, and not an excess, of matter. But in no case has it ever been decided that excess was fatal; for <em>utile per inutile non vitiatur. </em>Strike out the <em>quod cum </em>in the present case, and the declaration contains a complete charge. Ought we then, against the spirit and policy of the statute of <em>jeofails, </em>to retain those unimportant words for no other purpose, than to turn the. parties round, and put them to the expense and vexation of another suit ? I think not. The court, however, erred in not receiving the defendant\u2019s evidence in mitigation of damages ; and, upon that ground, I am of opinion that the judgment ought to be reversed, and a new trial awarded, with a direction to the district court, to receive the evidence.</p>\n<author id=\"b551-6\">Lyons, President.</author>\n<p id=\"Am4\">I think also, that the <em>quod cum </em>is surplusage only; and cured by the verdict. Upon that point, therefore, the court is equally divided; and so far the judgment is affirmed. But the evidence ought to have been admitted ; for the plea denied that the plaintiff had any title to the negro; and therefore it could not, with any propriety, bo said, that the defendant took away a slave belonging to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the plaintiffs. So that although she was taken from the close of the plaintiffs, which the defendant had not authority to do, yet it lessened the <em>gravamen; </em>and would have reduced the damages sustained by the trespass as to the freehold only, without regard to the value of the slave. The judgment therefore is to be reversed; and the following is to be the entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">\u201c This day came the parties by their counsel, and the court having maturely considered the transcript of the record of the judgment aforesaid, and the arguments of counsel, is of opinion, that <em>the </em>said judgment is erroneous, in this, that the district court refused to permit the evidence offered by the defendants, on the trial of this cause, to prove that the title of <em>the </em>slave, in the bill of exceptions mentioned, was in the defendant <em>Ballard, </em>to go to the jury, which ought to have been admitted in mitigation of damages: Therefore, it is considered that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the appellant recover against the appellee his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here. And it is ordered that the jury\u2019s verdict be set aside; that a new trial be had in the cause; and that, on such trial, the defendant be permitted to give evidence in mitigation of damages only, that the title of the said slave was in the said <em>James </em>Ballard.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
