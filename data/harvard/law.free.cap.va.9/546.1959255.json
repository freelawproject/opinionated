The breach is not well assigned; for the delinquency ought to have been specially set forth; and the omission to do so, put it out of the power of the defendant to make defence, or to plead the judgment in bar of another action for the same thing. <em>Esp.

The breach assigned extends to an averment of non-performance of any of the conditions of the bond; and nothing more special can be required.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b563-9\">Tucker, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AUE\">I am of opinion that the assignment of the breach in the words of the obligation, is not too general $ and it has been so decided, but I do not recollect the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Upon examining the several acts of assembly for imposing and collecting taxes, I am of opinion, that <em>Branch </em>was liable for the half tax due the 1st of May, 1785 : and that if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>is any error in the amount of the judgments, the party must ^ <em>x tf </em>seek relief in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"A2W\">Under the ordinance of convention, May 1776, <em>ch. </em>5, <em>sect. </em>8, and the act of assembly of October 1782, <em>ch. </em>39, the bond was properly taken, payable to the governour.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">But, if it had been otherwise, the taxes collected might have been recovered by a suit in the name of the governour, for the use of the commonwealth, under the special provisions contained in the acts of 1794, <em>ch. </em>84, <em>sect. </em>4, and <em>ch. </em>143; and the act of 1798, <em>ch. </em>19. Although the first of those laws gave the remedy on motion, or by special action on the case, the mode pursued in this case was more beneficial for the defendants than the former; and the form of the action is perhaps not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b564-10\">Fleming, Judge, Carrington, Judge, and Lyons, President,</author>\n<p id=\"AjA\">were all of the same opinion; and the judgment was accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
