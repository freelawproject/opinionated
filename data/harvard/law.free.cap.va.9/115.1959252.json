This report however was, without observing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>error, confirmed, and an interlocutory decree made for a sale of the mortgaged property to satisfy it. The defendants appealed to the court of appeals; where the decree was affirmed. But, when the cause went back to the court of chancery, the mistake was discovered; and, by that court, corrected. The defendants appealed from the correcting decree to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b132-11\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-9\">For the appellants it was insisted, that the court of chancery had not authority to change the decree of this court. That the precedent would be dangerous, if inferior tribunals should be allowed to alter the decrees of the court of appeals, as there would then be no end to controversies; and no man could say when a suit was ended. That, if the practice prevailed, the decrees of this court might be altered after they had been carried into execution by the court of chancery; the cause put off the docket; and to every appearance finally ended. That <em>interest reipublicce ut sit finis litium </em>was a sound maxim; and it was, upon that ground, that <em>White </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>2 Call, 376, was decided : which ought to be adhered to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-10\">On the other side, it was contended, that, as the decree was interlocutory, it might be corrected : and that no danger could result from it, as the point had never been mentioned, or adverted to by this court at the time of affirming the first decree.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b132-12\">Tucker, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AQx\">The single question is, Whether the chancellor could, upon the same facts, change the decree of this court ? The case of <em>White </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>2 Call, 376, decides that he could not; and I approve of that decision. It makes no difference, that it does not appear that the mistake was noticed at the time of affirming the former decree; for the point was fairly presented upon the record; and it cannot be admitted that the court did not advert to it. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>contrary doctrine would overthrow the whole theory of the law; which supposes every thing contained in the record to have been decided on ; and has wisely established the rule that <em>interest reipublica res judicatas non rescindi. </em>For I cannot conceive of any thing more inconvenient to society, than a power in the courts below to reverse and alter the solemn judgments of the supreme tribunal, as controversies would then be perpetual, and suits become interminable. I think therefore that the principle established, in the case of <em>White </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>ought to be adhered to; and consequently that the decree ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b133-4\">Roane, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ak4\">was of opinion that the decree should be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b133-5\">Carrington, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AkF\"><em>White </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>was a similar case; and there it was decided, that the court of chancery could not, upon the same facts, alter the decree of this court; which decision ought to be adhered to: or there will be no end to controversies; and parties will never be certain as to the result of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\"><em>Per Cur. </em>Reverse the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
