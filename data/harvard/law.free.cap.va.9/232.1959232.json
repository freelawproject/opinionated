That there was an action of slander depending, at that time, in the district court between <em>Anglea </em>and the defendant <em>Brackett; </em>who expected that some damages would be recovered against him in it. That <em>Anglea, </em>being indebted to the plaintiff, agreed that if the plaintiff would wait until that cause was decided, he should have the benefit of the judgment which should be obtained against <em>Brackett; </em>who agreed that it should be discounted against the plaintiff\u2019s bond aforesaid. That the plaintiff accordingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>waited with <em>Anglea </em>until the suit was ended. That <em>Anglea </em>recovered <em>\u00a3 </em>100 damages against Brackett, and assigned the judgment to the <em>plaintiff; </em>but that <em>Brackett </em>had, in the mean time, become insolvent | and had made a secret transfer of the plaintiff\u2019s bond to Redd, without any consideration, although the latter had notice of the before mentioned agreement between the plaintiff, Anglea, and Brackett, by an advertisement in the newspapers. That Redd, finding the transfer would be of no use, procured a secret assignment of the bond, likewise without any consideration, to <em>Miller; </em>who also had notice of the agreement aforesaid. That Miller, acting in concert with the other parties, has brought suit and obtained judgment in his own name upon the <em>bond; </em>but, in fact, for the benefit of Brackett, in order that the latter might avoid payment of <em>Anglea*s </em>judgment. The bill therefore prays for an injunction to <em>MilleAs </em>judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">The answer of <em>Brackett </em>denies the agreement as to <em>Anglea\u2019s judgment; </em>and states that, prior to the judgment, he had, for a valuable consideration, transferred the plaintiff\u2019s bond to <em>Redd; </em>at whose request, he afterwards assigned it to Miller, who was a creditor of <em>Redd; </em>and that the defendant has no interest in the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">The answer of <em>Brackett </em>admits the advertisement in the newspapers, but denies notice of the agreement relative to <em>Anglea\u2019s </em>judgment | and that the defendant does not believe that it existed. That the defendant refused to take the bond from Brackett, who was indebted to the defendant, until he could enquire of the plaintiff how much was due upon it, and when payment would be made. That the plaintiff acknowledged that the balance aforesaid was due upon the bond, and affirmed that he would pay it shortly. In consequence of which he accepted the transfer, and had the bond assigned to Miller, to whom he was then <em>indebted; </em>but has since paid him, and therefore has become entitled to the benefit of the judgment on the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The answer of <em>Miller </em>disclaims any knowledge of the transactions between the other parties; declares that <em>Redd </em>was indebted to him at the time of the assignment; that the plaintiff often promised payment; but failed to make it, and therefore he brought suit upon the bond. That <em>Redd </em>has since paid him; and. therefore is now entitled to the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-9\">Depositions of witnesses were taken on both sides; and the court of chancery dismissed the bill upon a hearing. The plaintiff appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-10\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsT\">The bill charges an agreement to discount the judgment; and, although the answer denies it, the denial is disproved by two witnesses. <em>Redd </em>had notice of the agreement before the assignment; and <em>Blanton, </em>having never renounced the right to discount, is still entitled to claim it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-11\">\n<em>Hay, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ail\">There was no contract for the discount. <em>Brackett </em>denies it; and his answer, so far from being disproved, is supported by three witnesses. Contracts for discounts are not good under the act of assembly; particularly against an assignee; who is affected by nothing, but an equity existing at the time of making the bond; or an actual payment before the assignment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-12\"><em>Wickham, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhJ\">The answers deny the plaintiff\u2019s equity; and they are not disproved: But before the complainant can claim the discount, he must prove the agreement for it. This is not done; and it is improbable that such a contract existed; for nobody would think of stipulating to wait for the chance of damages to be recovered by an action of slander, in discharge of an actual debt, already payable. The pretended discount was therefore an after thought; and was never contracted for.</p>\n<disposition data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b251-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\n<em>Cur. ado. vult.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-2\"><em>Randolph. </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3i\">The agreement is not only proved, but is valid in equity 5 and there ought to have been an issue to ascertain it. 1 <em>Ch. Cas. </em>50. The defendant had cause to suspect the plaintiff\u2019s right, and ought to have enquired into it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b251-4\">Tucker, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A71\">The charges in the bill, so far as they are material to entitle the complainant to relief against the defendants, are flatly denied by the answers. <em>Brackett </em>denies any agreement between the plaintiff and himself as to the eventual damages which <em>Anglea </em>might recover against him | and although there is the testimony of three witnesses, which may induce some belief that an agreement of that kind might have been contemplated, yet as there was then, no existing debt due from <em>Brackett </em>to <em>Anglea </em>at any time previous to the assignment to Miller, nor any proof that <em>Anglea </em>was a party to, or had assented to any such agreement, admitting that there was such an one between <em>Brackett </em>and <em>Blanton, </em>it might have been retracted j for <em>Anglea </em>had no certain demand against <em>Brackett, </em>which was capable of being set off against an existing debt, until after the judgment, which was two or three months subsequent to the assignment to <em>Miller </em>for the use of <em>Redd. </em>It was incapable of assignment both inlaw and equity: and, if such an agreement was made, as is pretended, between <em>Anglea </em>and <em>Blanton, </em>without the previous assent of <em>Brackett, </em>I should think it maintenance. And, even, if, after the judgment, <em>Jlnglea </em>had made an assignment of it before any replevin or forthcoming bond was given (which bonds our law makes assignable,) such an assignment, I apprehend, would not have been legal, but merely an equitable discount against the bond. On this however I give no opinion, being clearly of opinion that, until <em>Jlnglea </em>obtained judgment, no agreement, in respect to the damages which he might possibly recover, could affect the assignee of <em>Brackett, </em>unless there were some fraud between those parties. And although the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>fendants are expressly charged with a fraudulent combi- <em>\u00bb \u2022 \u00bb </em>to defeat the complainant\u2019s right to a discount for these damages, yet the circumstance is positively denied by all the parties, and there is not that I can discover, a tittle of evidence to support the charge, although there is abundant to rebut it. As against <em>Redd </em>and <em>Miller </em>the complainant is not, in my opinion, entitled even to the shadow of relief. Nor has he established his case so far even against <em>Brackett, </em>as to induce me <em>to </em>think differently from the chancellor. Taking the whole evidence together, I concur with him in opinion, that the allegations of the bill being denied by the answers, are not supported by the testimony; and therefore that the bill was rightly dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b252-6\">Roane, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aiv\">The agreement relative to <em>Angled? s </em>judgment is denied by the answer; which is supported by other testimony, and not disproved by <em>Blantorfs </em>witnesses. The contract is novel and improbable; and, upon the whole, I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b252-7\">Fleming and Carrington, Judges, concurred;</author>\n<p id=\"AID\">and the decree was accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
