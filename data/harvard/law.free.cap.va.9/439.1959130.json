The case agreed states, that <em>William Hall </em>being seized of the land, on the 21st of October, 1764, made his will, by which he devised to his son <em>Richard Hall </em>the land in question, <em>during his natural life, and no longer, and after to his eldest son, and his heirs </em>forever; <em>but if no male issue, to his eldest daughter, and her heirs </em>forever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-9\">The testator died in December 1764, and <em>Richard Hall, </em>the devisee, entered on the land devised immediately after his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-10\">About the year 1776, <em>Richard Hall </em>intermarried with <em>Sarah West, </em>and lived with her as his wife till his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-11\">About two years before the marriage they had issue, a son, <em>Thomas Hall, </em>who was always owned and reputed to be the son of <em>Richard </em>Hall, who never had another son.

That <em>Richard Hall </em>took an estate for life only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-9\">2. That <em>Thomas Hall </em>being born out of wedlock, and before the act of 1785, was not <em>eldest son </em>of <em>Richard Hall </em>in a legal sense; and, therefore,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-10\">3. That the limitation to the plaintiff <em>Elizabeth </em>as <em>eldest daughter </em>of <em>Richard Hall, </em>was good ; and that she, on the death of her father, became entitled to the lands in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-11\">Those made by the counsel for the appellees were,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-12\">1st. That by the will of <em>William Hall, Richard Hall </em>took an estate in tail male by implication; which, by force of the act of 1776, concerning estates tail, became an estate in fee simple absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-13\">2d. That if this point should be in favour of the appellants, <em>Thomas Hall, </em>under the 19th section of the act of descents, passed in 1792, was legitimated; and as eldest son of <em>Richard Hall, </em>was entitled to the remainder in fee in the land in question, after the death of his father; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-14\">3d.

For the words, die without issue, do not create an estate tail, either where it is manifest that the testator meant a life estate only, or where all the issue can take with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>out it. <em>Popham </em>v. <em>Bamfield, </em>1 Salk. 236. <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Garnet, </em>2 Wash. 9. For, in cases of that kind, the limitation is taken to mean \"such issue\u201d as those before specified, and not issue indefinitely. <em>Thomas Hall, </em>having been born out of wedlock before the act of 1785, was not the eldest son of <em>Richard Hall </em>in a legal sense; because that act says \u201c <em>shall </em>afterwards\u201d intermarry, which is necessarily prospective, and means those born subsequent to the act. Therefore the devise to the plaintiff <em>Elizabeth, </em>as eldest daughter of <em>Richard Hall, </em>took effect j and, consequently, upon the death of her father, she became entitled to the lands in controversy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-4\"><em>Wickham </em>and <em>Randolph, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL4\"><em>Richard, Hall </em>took an estate in tail male by implication; which, by the act of 1776, was turned into an estate in fee simple. For the doctrine in <em>Bamfield </em>v. <em>Popham, </em>has been denied ever since ; 1 <em>Wms. </em>759. 2 <em>Wash. </em>33; and the testator did not intend, that the daughter should take until after all the issue of <em>Thomas </em>had failed. <em>Thomas Hall </em>was legitimated by the act of 17921 and, as eldest son <em>of Richard, </em>was entitled to the remainder in fee after the death of his father. <em>Stones </em>v. <em>Keeling, </em>in this court, <em>(ante. </em>143.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b457-5\">Tucker, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"An0\"><em>William Hall </em>devised lands to his son <em>Richard Hall \"</em>during his natural life, and no longer, and after to his eldest son, and his heirs forever; but if no male issue, to his eldest daughter, and her heirs forever.\u201d <em>Richard Hall </em>had a natural son born in 1776, and, in 1778, married his mother, and recognized the child as his till his death in 1796. The father and son, by deed of bargain and sale, conveyed to the defendants. The father after-wards dying without ever having any other son, but leaving several daughters, the eldest brought suit for the lands, claiming them under the before mentioned clause in her grandfather\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"AuB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Mr. <em>Call </em>for the plaintiffs insisted, That <em>Richard Hall </em>took an estate for life only; that the limitation, to <em>Elizabeth </em>his eldest daughter, was good; and that she, on the death of her father, became entitled to the devised land, relying on 1 <em>Salk. </em>236. 1 <em>P. Wms. 54. Blackburn </em>v. <em>Edgely, </em>1 P. Wms. 600. <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Garnet, </em>2 Wash. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Mr. <em>Wickham </em>on the other hand, relied upon the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s </em>case, 1 Co. 99. 2 <em>Wash. </em>31. <em>P. Wms. </em>756.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The second point made <em>by </em>the appellant\u2019s counsel, that <em>Thomas Hall, </em>the son of <em>Richard, </em>being born out of wedlock, and before the act of 1785, was not eldest son of <em>Richard Hall </em>in a legal sense; and consequently could neither take as heir, nor as devisee under the will, appearing to me, to embrace the whole case, I shall pass over the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The words of the act of assembly are, that, \u201c where a man, having, by a woman, one or more children, shall after-wards intermarry with such woman, such child, or children, if recognized by him, shall thereby be legitimated.\u201d <em>Virg. Laws, </em>1794, <em>ch. </em>93, <em>sect. </em>19.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">It is contended that the word \u201c <em>shall,\u201d </em>being a word importing a thing to be done, or to happen after another thing which is done, or hath happened, must necessarily refer to marriages to be solemnized after the passing of the act; and cannot be construed to have any other relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">If this be the true construction, the meaning of the law will be the same, whether the word \u201c <em>afterwards,\u201d </em>be inserted therein, or not. But will it be said, that if that word were stricken out, the sense of the law would be precisely as it is now? The word \u201c <em>shall\u201d </em>would, in that case, indubitably apply to the time of passing the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">The word <em>\u201c afterwards\u201d </em>can never be applied but to a thing spoken of before : But the thing spoken of before in the act, is the having children born before wedlock: And the thing to be done afterwards, is the marrying the woman, and recognizing the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>If the sense contended for, by Mr. <em>Call, </em>were the proper sense of the law, the word \u201c <em>afterwards\u201d </em>would be construed as the word \u201c <em>hereafter:\u201d </em>But I am confident, that there is not a lexicon in the English language, in which it will be found in that sense. Its synonyme is \u201c <em>thereafter.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">Whenever a past event is spoken of, and another possible event, posterior thereto is spoken of at the same time, the word \u201c <em>shall\u201d </em>never imports a future, in reference to the time of speaking, but a future in reference to the first event only. <em>\u201c Shall,\u201d </em>in all such cases, means \u201c <em>shall have.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The law intending to provide for all cases generally, this arrangement of the sentence was necessary to embrace every possible case of the kind <em>\\ </em>and was meant not only to encourage marriages after the passing of the law, but to protect and provide for the innocent offspring of indiscreet parents, who had already made all the atonement in their power, for their misconduct, by putting the children, whom the father recognized as his own, on the same footing, as if born in lawful wedlock.</p>\n<author id=\"b459-5\">Lyons, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AlTU\">The court, after conference (absent judge <em>Fleming,) </em>are unanimously of opinion, that any legitimate son of <em>Richard Hall, </em>the devisee of <em>William Hall, </em>who might have been born during the lifetime of his father, was capable of taking the lands in question, under the devise in the will of the said <em>William Hall: </em>And that <em>Thomas Hall, </em>son of the said <em>Richard Hall, </em>under the operation of the act of assembly directing the course of descents, answering to that description, there is no error in the judgment of the district court; which is therefore to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
