Pending the suit, <em>Trent </em>died. <em>Carter's </em>answer stated that <em>Trent </em>had agreed to pay the partnership debts; and that the plaintiff might have made his debt out of the partnership effects. The plaintiff demurred as well as replied to the answer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The suit was not revived against <em>Trent's </em>executors; and the chancellor decreed payment of the debt against <em>Carter's </em>executors, who appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-4\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADZ\">The protest is not properly verified; for a copy by the executors was not sufficient.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY_\">It is to be presumed that there was an affidavit that the bill was lost; and it is too late to make the objection after the answer is filed. The notarial copy is evidence of the protest; and indeed the only evidence of it when the original is lost; for the notary is bound to make a record. The writ was against <em>Carter &amp; Trent, </em>and the judgment was against both : and therefore, although the declaration is imperfect and leaves a blank, it is not material; for the judgment is good until it is reversed. At any rate, the judgment is evidence of the bill; and the course of the court of chancery is to presume exhibits proved until an objection is made. Therefore, as no objection appears in the record, it will be presumed by this court, that the necessary proofs were made. <em>Carter </em>is liable, because he was a partner, and the bill is for a partnership transaction. He should have shewn that <em>Trent </em>had effects to satisfy the claim.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-6\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnP\">The jurisdiction may be admitted, and the want of the affidavit waved : But the bill was not verified, because it is not shewn that the copy was taken from the books of the notary; for, at law, it would have been necessary to prove it; and the same rule holds in equity. The presumption of probat is only that it was proved to be such a paper as it purports to be, and not that it was derived from a more authentic source. The declaration is against <em>Trent, </em>surviving partner of-; and it is an office judgment only, which could not be filled up, for want of the bill. This drove them into equity; and now the attempt is to support the suit in chancery by the imperfect judgment at law, or, in other words, to prove the propriety of the defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>judgment by the judgment itself, which cannot be done. <em>Trent\u2019s </em>representatives should have been parties to the suit, or the omission accounted for.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b176-11\">Lyons, President,</author>\n<p id=\"A-W\">delivered the resolution of the court: That the decree was erroneous, as <em>Trent\u2019s </em>executors had not been made parties; and therefore that it was to be reversed, and the cause sent back to the court of chancery for the proper parties to be made, and further proceedings had.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
