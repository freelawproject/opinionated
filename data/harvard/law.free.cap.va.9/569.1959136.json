The property appears to have been advertised at the court-house and other public places in the county. The appellee suffered the property to remain in <em>Lazarus Cook\u2019s </em>possession until the day of sale. The sheriff attended at <em>Lazarus Cook\u2019s </em>on the day of sale, but was prevented from selling by the said <em>Cook\u2019s </em>production of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>certificate from the clerk of the general court, stating that the court of appeals had reversed the judgment on which the execution had issued against the said <em>Cook. </em>The district court allowed the appellee his commissions on the execution.
