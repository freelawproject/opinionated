Appellant, Law Solutions Chicago, LLC, doing business as UpRight Law, LLC (\"UpRight\"), appeals from the Bankruptcy Court's Order [Bankr. Doc. 41]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"the Order\") on the United States Trustee's Motion to Disgorge Fees and For Other Appropriate Relief in the underlying bankruptcy matter,\n   <em>\n    In re Lillie Mae Banks\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-10456 (\"the Banks case\"). For the reasons announced herein, the Order of the Bankruptcy Court is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   UpRight characterizes itself as a \"national consumer bankruptcy law firm, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, with a practice model that differs from some law firms.\" Record Document 32, p. 30. Specifically, its Chicago office addresses the firm's administrative functions, advertising, and provides assistance to the \"local partners\" - the approximately 400 attorneys nationwide who \"have a relationship with the firm but also maintain a separate practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The local partners do not have any managerial authority in the firm,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, but receive a percentage of the fees that a client pays to UpRight if the partner provides services for that client, Bankr. Doc. 40, pp. 156-57. When a prospective client reaches out to UpRight, the Chicago-based staff enters the client's information into a system, a fee is generated, and a partner attorney is assigned to the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 190, 213-14; Record Document 32, pp. 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the underlying bankruptcy case, the debtor, Lillie Mae Banks (\"Banks\"), discovered UpRight through the internet and called UpRight at a number provided on its website. Bankr. Doc. 40, pp. 10-11. Though initially assigned an attorney not licensed to practice in the Western District of Louisiana, Banks was eventually represented by Andrea Augustus (\"Augustus\"), an attorney located in New Orleans who was formerly a local partner at UpRight. After a series of missteps by both UpRight and Augustus, the United States Trustee (\"UST\") filed a Motion to Disgorge Fees and For Other Appropriate Relief [Bankr. Doc. 16] in the Banks case. Generally, the UST's motion gave an account of the events that had taken place in the case, which all parties agree was \"horribly screwed up,\" Record Documents 7, p. 19; 22-9, p. 199, and requested that the court disgorge all fees collected, issue a $5,000 civil penalty, and issue certain injunctive relief to prevent future abuse and neglect by UpRight. Bankr. Doc. 16. The Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the motion, at which it heard testimony from Banks, attorney Augustus, and David Menditto, the associate general counsel for litigation at UpRight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Doc. 40. On February 6, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Order [Bankr. Doc. 41], which imposed a 90-day suspension and additional requirements on UpRight, and is the subject of this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court's Order generally found that UpRight failed to adequately represent Banks in what should have been a simple bankruptcy case. For example, the court found that UpRight: (1) initially assigned Banks an attorney located in Tennessee and not licensed to practice in Louisiana; (2) later assigned Banks to attorney Augustus, who was located 350 miles from Banks, despite promising that she would be represented by a local attorney; (3) never sent Banks a retainer agreement signed by an attorney licensed to practice in Louisiana; (4) used a problematic retainer agreement with terms that violate Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5 concerning fees and fee disputes; (5) made oral representations that contradicted the written retainer agreement; (6) made multiple misstatements or misrepresentations, and repeatedly broke promises made to Banks; and (6) failed to properly supervise Augustus over the entire course of UpRight's representation of\n   Banks. Bankr. Doc. 41, pp. 3-25. The court also found Augustus at fault, as she: (1) consistently neglected to contact Banks; (2) delayed filing Banks' first bankruptcy petition; (3) negligently allowed the first bankruptcy case to be dismissed and remain dismissed; (4) falsely indicated that Banks had signed her second bankruptcy petition; and (5) allowed the second bankruptcy to be dismissed by failing to file required documentation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-28. The court found professional negligence on the part of both Augustus and UpRight, including multiple, continuous violations of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further found that UpRight failed to comply with the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20528\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , when Banks' retainer agreement was electronically signed by an attorney not licensed to practice in Louisiana and who never saw or physically signed the agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20528\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20528\">\n    at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court ruled that disgorgement was appropriate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), specifically because UpRight failed to provide Banks with a properly executed written contract between them, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20528\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (2).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20528\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20528\">\n    at 34-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition to disgorgement, the court found relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(5) and 105 appropriate. Section 526(c)(5) provides that if a court finds an intentional violation of section 526, or a clear and consistent pattern or practice of violating section 526, it may enjoin the violation of that section or impose a civil penalty. The court found that \"UpRight's continued failure to provide Banks with bankruptcy services after numerous requests for help amount[ed] to an intentional violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1),\" and also noted that while UpRight \"promised to provide Banks an array of bankruptcy services,\" it \"repeatedly failed to provide those services or misrepresented those services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court imposed the sanctions agreed upon by the UST and UpRight: disgorgement of all fees paid by Banks, refunding the $30 Banks paid for credit counseling, and payment of a $5,000 civil penalty to the United States Treasury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the court suspended Augustus from practicing in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Louisiana for 90 days and ordered that her electronic filing privileges be suspended until she completes fifteen hours of bankruptcy specific continuing legal education and petitions the court for reinstatement of her privileges.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    at 36-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In doing so, it found that Stewart lacked Article III standing to support an injunction as there was no real threat she would suffer similar injury in the future. It noted that the case involved only a single debtor, and that the dispute was between the estate and the bank; it did not involve a class or claims by others. Stewart's objection to the bank's claim in her case was insufficient to serve as the jurisdictional basis for the relief controlling the contents of filings in other bankruptcy cases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182850,6050460\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/553/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182850,6050460\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/553/\">\n    at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   UpRight argues that the Bankruptcy Court's Order, like the injunction in\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , went beyond the dimensions of the immediate case and is broader than necessary to protect Banks. It emphasizes that Banks has received a discharge and will not benefit from any of the contested relief. Thus, argues UpRight, the purpose of the Order was to police a range of cases beyond the Banks case, and pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to issue such an Order. Record Document 32, pp. 51-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The UST argues that\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   concerns a court's power to enjoin a creditor's conduct, and does not affect a court's authority over its bar. Record Document 37, p. 61. This Court agrees. The injunction in\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   targeted the actions of Wells Fargo, a creditor, as opposed to attorneys practicing before the court. As previously noted, \"Courts enjoy broad discretion to determine who may practice before them and to regulate the conduct of those who do.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Nolen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5197421\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/362/#p371\">\n    472 F.3d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court has already determined that the contested relief is not properly classified as a traditional injunction, but instead stems from the Bankruptcy Court's authority over attorneys practicing before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This case is further distinguishable in that the debtor in\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   had not asserted a likelihood of future injury, whereas here, the UST specifically requested injunctive relief to prevent other clients from suffering similar abuse and neglect as that suffered by Banks. Bankr. Doc. 16, p. 15. Therefore, that particular issue-future harm to\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   debtors-was before the court, and the issue was raised via a motion authorized by the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(5).

However, with the exception of the 90-day suspension, the Court does not view the other contested measures as sanctions or discipline.

Although the OSC in this case did not specifically mention the possibility of a suspension, nor did it specify any particular Rule of Professional Conduct that was breached, it did give reasonable notice. The OSC reads: \"IT IS ORDERED that Mr. Clarence T. Nalls ... show cause ... why sanctions should not be imposed against him personally, under Fed. Rule Civ.

Record Document 32, pp. 57-58. UpRight's attempt to assert a due process violation on the part of the local attorneys is unavailing because the 90-day suspension was a sanction against UpRight, not the local attorneys. The Order states that the suspension was appropriate due to\n   <em>\n    UpRight\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    's\n   </em>\n   negligence and\n   <em>\n    UpRight's\n   </em>\n   violations of Louisiana's professionalism rules. Bankr. Doc. 41, pp. 36-37. It clarifies that \"partner attorneys who maintain separate legal practices may continue to file bankruptcy cases for those clients not contracted with or represented by UpRight\" and \"may also participate in any bankruptcy cases filed by UpRight prior to the entry\" of the Order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, it is clear that UpRight was on notice of, and also argued against, the possibility of relief outside of that specifically requested by the UST.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court then held a hearing at which UpRight presented witnesses and introduced exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Docs. 31, 33. At the hearing, the Bankruptcy Court notified UpRight that it was considering revoking its practice privileges, and UpRight was given the opportunity to respond. In sum, the Court finds that UpRight was not denied due process in this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Bad Faith and Burden of Proof\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, UpRight argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred when it ordered the contested relief without making a specific finding of bad faith based on clear and convincing evidence. Record Document 32, p. 59. UpRight notes the general rule that in order to impose sanctions under its inherent power, a court must make a specific\n   finding of bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crowe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11710111\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/217/\">\n    151 F.3d at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Bankruptcy Court specifically stated that the suspension was ordered pursuant to Local Rule 83.2.10,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was appropriate due to UpRight's negligence in representing Banks, its failure to adequately supervise Augustus, and its violations of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bankr. Doc. 41, pp. 36-37. Local Rule 83.2.4 adopts the Rules of Professional Conduct of the Louisiana State Bar Association as the rules of this Court. Thus, it appears the Bankruptcy Court suspended UpRight under the local rules, and the Fifth Circuit has declined to find that a finding of bad faith is required for a court to exercise its authority under the local rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Goode\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258404\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/553/#p559\">\n    821 F.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559 (5th Cir. 2016) (\"It is well settled that in order for a federal court to sanction an attorney under its inherent powers, it must make a specific finding that the attorney acted in bad faith. But, this Circuit has never explicitly extended this requirement to sanctions imposed pursuant to a local rule, and we decline to do so here.\" (internal citation omitted) ). Accordingly, the court was not required to make an explicit finding of bad faith. However, even if the Bankruptcy Court suspended UpRight pursuant to its inherent power, the Fifth Circuit has found that \"[w]hen bad faith is patent from the record and specific findings are unnecessary to understand the misconduct giving rise to the sanction, the necessary finding of 'bad faith' may be inferred.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Appellant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11558502\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/194/666/#p670\">\n    194 F.3d at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). Here, the record supports the conclusion that the Bankruptcy Court found bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blanco River, L.L.C. v.

App'x 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439 (5th Cir. 2012). The court found that UpRight violated at least five Rules of Professional Conduct, made multiple misrepresentations, failed to follow through on promises made to Banks, and repeatedly failed to supervise Augustus. The record supports a finding of bad faith, and the Bankruptcy Court did not err or abuse its discretion in ordering the modest 90-day suspension.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Additionally, UpRight argues that the court erred in ordering the suspension without making findings based on clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sealed Appellant 1 v.

However, the facts in this case are largely undisputed, and UpRight has acknowledged wrongdoing and that it made mistakes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Doc. 40, pp. 193, 188-215, 253. The Bankruptcy Court found multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, as well as misrepresentations and missteps by UpRight. The Court finds the evidence sufficient to satisfy the clear and convincing\n   standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Narrowly Tailored\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has stated that a \"sanctioning court must use the least restrictive sanction necessary to deter the inappropriate behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    In re First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9474722,9445934\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/282/864/\">\n    282 F.3d 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 867 (5th Cir. 2002). Citing this language, UpRight argues that the Bankruptcy Court's Order was not narrowly tailored to achieve its purpose. Record Document 32, p. 65. This Court disagrees. First, the suspension was relatively short and was imposed due to UpRight's negligence in representing Banks, its failure to adequately supervise Augustus, and its violations of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct. Additionally, each of the other contested measures was specifically aimed at some act that occurred during the Banks case. For example, the requirement that attorneys filing pleadings on behalf of UpRight update their CM/ECF accounts to reflect their affiliation with the firm was responsive to the fact that the docket in Banks' second bankruptcy case did not show that attorney Augustus was affiliated with UpRight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Docs. 41, p. 27; 40, pp. 107-08. And as further explained below, the other ordered measures similarly correspond to the facts of the Banks case. Thus, the Court finds that the ordered measures were sufficiently tailored, and UpRight's challenge on this basis is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Relief Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 526\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(5)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   UpRight argues that \u00a7 526(c)(5) only allows injunctive relief to cure a violation of the particular section of 526 found to have been violated. It claims that the Bankruptcy Court erred when it ordered relief that extended beyond the identified violation of \u00a7 526.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court found that UpRight had intentionally violated \u00a7 526(a)(1), which prohibits a debt relief agency from failing \"to perform any service that such agency informed an assisted person or prospective assisted person it would provide in connection with a case or proceeding under this title.\" Bankr. Doc. 41, p. 35. It also found that UpRight had repeatedly failed to provide bankruptcy services or misrepresented those services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Contrary to UpRight's argument, the contested measures are responsive to violations of \u00a7 526(a). For example, the Order requires that UpRight not accept payment from a Western District client until (1) the client has had a consultation with the attorney licenced to practice in this district who will represent them, and (2) there is a signed retainer agreement containing original signatures from the client and the attorney who will be in charge of the case. This is responsive to the Bankruptcy Court's finding that UpRight misrepresented and failed to perform services. Specifically, UpRight assured Banks that she would be assigned a local attorney, but she was instead assigned an attorney located in Tennessee\n   who was not licensed to practice in the Western District. This mistake resulted from UpRight's procedures that enabled it to sign a retainer agreement on a partner's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Doc. 40, pp. 186-88, 213-14. Additionally, the thorough and adequate consultation requirement is responsive to the delays and lack of communication in the Banks case, which occurred despite UpRight's representations that her attorney would be in contact with her. Similarly, the requirement that UpRight's retainer agreement conform to Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5(f)(5) and contain a paragraph of text taken from that rule is responsive to UpRight's misrepresentation that Banks would not be entitled to a refund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Doc. 41, p. 31. Finally, the requirements in the Order related to filing documents with a client's scanned original signature and maintaining an updated CM/ECF account reflecting an attorney's affiliation with UpRight are similarly responsive to findings by the Bankruptcy Court. First, the court found that Augustus filed a petition and bankruptcy schedules that were not reviewed or signed by Banks, and thus made a false representation to the court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the court found that the CM/ECF docket in Banks' second bankruptcy case did not reflect UpRight's involvement in the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

It also must conform to the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct.\" Bankr. Doc. 41, p. 8. UpRight complains that the phrase \"services integral to a Chapter 7 filing,\" is not clearly defined and violates Rule 65 specificity requirements. Record Document 32, p. 69. Additionally, it argues that the Order's instruction that retainer agreements must conform to the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct is nothing more than an injunction to \"obey the law,\" which violates due process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As an initial matter, it is not clear that the court intended its statements to constitute an order such that a violation of its terms could be grounds for contempt. The language appears in the Findings of Fact section of the opinion and is nearly 30 pages removed from the actual orders of the court. Nonetheless, the language regarding \"services integral to a Chapter 7 filing\" is not ambiguous when read in context. The Bankruptcy Court had just expressed frustration that Banks' retainer agreement allowed for \"additional attorney fees for the negotiation, review, and execution of reaffirmation agreements with creditors.\" Bankr. Doc. 41, p. 7. The court stated that it does not allow such unbundling of legal services, and explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   In the Fifth Circuit, a debtor must reaffirm, redeem, or surrender all secured debts.... If a debtor mistakenly does not reaffirm or redeem collateral, a debtor can be forced to surrender that collateral. Therefore, this Court considers reaffirmation or redemption an integral part of representation in a Chapter 7 case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). It seems quite clear that the \"services integral to a Chapter 7 filing\" that the court was referring to are the reaffirmation and redemption of secured debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As to the statement that UpRight's retainer agreements must conform to the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct,\n   the Bankruptcy Court had just found on the preceding page that some of the terms in UpRight's retainer agreement violate Rule 1.5 concerning fees. Additionally, the final portion of the Order specifies that the agreements must conform to Rule 1.5(f)(5). Thus, to the extent the challenged language is considered an order of the Bankruptcy Court, and when read in context, it was sufficiently tailored and does not violate UpRight's due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, to the extent they are construed as findings of fact, UpRight challenges the Bankruptcy Court's characterizations of it as a \"referral service\" and a \"marketer of legal services.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20526\">\n    at 19, 29, 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court agrees with both parties that the comments are dicta and were not intended to be findings of fact. However, even if these statements were findings of fact, they are not clearly erroneous. \"A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, although there is enough evidence to support it, the reviewing court is left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Cobrans Corp. v.

Doc. 41, p. 19. Additionally, there was evidence that UpRight repeatedly failed to supervise Augustus, even when her lack of diligence was brought to UpRight's attention.

Additionally, later in the hearing, when Mr. Menditto mentioned that UpRight might be willing to refile another bankruptcy case for Banks at no charge, the court responded: \"That presupposes you are in a position to effect that work after my opinion, so I'm not going to go there at this point in time.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191746\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/224/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191746\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/224/\">\n     at 242\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Section 526(c)(5) authorizes a court to enjoin violations of \u00a7 526 and to impose civil penalties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    As previously suggested, the Court agrees with the UST's characterization of the contested measures-that is, the Court views the measures as (1) a 90-day suspension, and (2) conditions with which UpRight must comply in order to practice in the Western District Bankruptcy Court. The Court views the conditions not as sanctions, but as modest remedial measures which were within the Bankruptcy Court's power to order. To the extent the conditions, and not just the 90-day suspension, could properly be classified as sanctions, the Court would find no due process violation regarding them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    UpRight argues that the Bankruptcy Court was not allowed to issue the suspension pursuant to Local Rule 83.2.10 because that rule authorizes suspensions of individual attorneys, and not law firms. Record Document 32, p. 63. The Court finds this argument unpersuasive. The Bankruptcy Court had broad discretion to interpret and apply its local rules, and nothing in the language of the rule prohibits the suspension of an entire firm.\n    <em>\n     Bonner v.

For the various reasons discussed herein, this argument is rejected. First, the Court does not consider the contested measures, with the exception of the 90-day suspension, to be sanctions. Instead, the measures were intended to regulate the conduct of attorneys practicing before the Bankruptcy Court. The measures were aimed at\n    <em>\n     UpRight\n    </em>\n    and were responsive to\n    <em>\n     UpRight's\n    </em>\n    conduct in the Banks case.
