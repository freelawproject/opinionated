By this Motion, Brookstone seeks to assume a store closing agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Gordon Brothers Retail Partners, LLC and Hilco Merchant Resources, LLC (collectively referred to hereinafter as \"Hilco\") to perform certain services relating to going-out-of-business sales (the \"GOB Sales\"). The United States Trustee (\"UST\") does not object generally to the relief sought by way of the Store Closing Motion, but argues that assumption of the Agreement is procedurally improper to the extent that the Agreement with Hilco constitutes the retention of a \"professional\" under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 327(a). For the reasons that follow, the Court determines that Hilco is not a professional for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 327(a), and the Debtor has otherwise carried its burden to warrant assumption of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hilco is a familiar player in Chapter 11 retail restructurings in this Court. In countless cases, it has provided valuable services to debtors relating to disposition and monetization of inventory, real estate, intellectual property and other estate assets. The procedural mechanism by which Hilco (and the handful of entities that are its industry peers) are engaged to perform these services has - with very few exceptions - been by way of assumption of a services contract by motion under \u00a7\u00a7 365(a) and 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Notwithstanding a well-developed practice in this and other courts, the UST has in recent months objected in several cases and insisted that, in the circumstances described above, Hilco is serving as a \"professional\" in the bankruptcy proceeding and must be retained under the strictures of \u00a7 327(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heritage Home Corp., LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-11736 (KG), UST Objection [Docket No. 265];\n   <em>\n    Samuels Jewelers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-11818 (KJC), UST Limited Objection [Docket No. 162].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a very recent case, my colleague Judge Gross was called upon to decide whether SB360 Capital Partners was a professional where it was acting in a role broadly similar to Hilco in the instant case.\n   <em>\n    Heritage Home Corp., LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-11736 (KG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204684802\">\n    2018 WL 4684802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Mem. Op. dated September 27, 2018 (\"Heritage Home\") [Docket No. 330]. After review of the applicable legal test derived from the\n   <em>\n    First Merchants\n   </em>\n   decision discussed in detail below, Judge Gross distilled the relevant analysis down to a standard the undersigned cannot improve\n   upon: \"What is clear in\n   <em>\n    First Merchants\n   </em>\n   is that a 'professional' is limited to those occupations which control, purchase or sell assets that are important to reorganization, is negotiating the terms of a plan of reorganization, [and] has discretion to exercise his or her own personal judgment....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12, citing\n   <em>\n    In re First Merchants Acceptance Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20873551\">\n    1997 WL 873551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3 (D. Del. Dec. 15, 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Applying this test to the case at bar, this Court is satisfied that Hilco's services, while clearly valuable and important, are not sufficiently central to the development and implementation of the Debtor's reorganization to support a finding that it is a \"professional\" within the meaning of \u00a7 327(a). The established practice requires fulsome disclosure of the services to be provided and the compensation to be paid, followed by a hearing on the merits where a debtor must carry its burden under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 365 and 363 to demonstrate that it is proceeding in good faith and that its proposed course of action reflects the exercise of its reasonable business judgment. This structure is compliant with the Bankruptcy Code and is sufficient to address the UST's legitimate desire for transparency and due process without imposing the additional requirements and restrictions required by \u00a7 327(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Brookstone Holdings Corporation and its affiliates (hereinafter \"Brookstone\" or the \"Debtor\") operate a well-known manufacturing and retailing business which produces and sells Brookstone-branded products in traditional retail outlets, including both mall and airport stores. Declaration of Greg Tribou In Support of the Debtors' Chapter 11 Petitions and Requests for First Day Relief (the \"First Day Aff.\") [Docket No. 2] at \u00b6 16. Brookstone also sells its branded products on the internet and as wholesaler. In addition to selling its own products, Brookstone provides distribution and sale opportunities for third-party products that fit within Brookstone's brand concept.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The record reflects that, as of the commencement of these cases on August 2, 2018 (the \"Petition Date\"), the Debtor operated 137 retail stores, 102 of which were located in malls and 35 of which were located in airports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. For fiscal year 2017, sales from Brookstone's mall stores made up approximately 52% of Brookstone's net sales, and sales from Brookstone's airport stores made up approximately 14% of Brookstone's net sales. The balance of Brookstone's sales came from e-commerce and its wholesale operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A number of factors led Brookstone to seek Chapter 11 relief. Notably, the Debtor represents that a shift in consumer preferences has led to a decline in profitability for Brookstone's mall stores, which have been operating at a loss each year since the Debtor's emergence from its first Chapter 11 proceeding in 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17, 55, 57. While its mall stores have been struggling, however, Brookstone sees potential for improvement in its other business segments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18-19, 22-27. In contrast to its mall stores, Brookstone's airport stores have, for the most part, operated profitably.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. The Debtor believes that its intellectual property carries substantial value, and its e-commerce presence has potential for expansion and further development.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27-29. However, Brookstone asserts that in order to realize its potential, it must restructure its operations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6-7, 18, 22, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to the Petition Date, Brookstone determined that its restructuring plan would include the closure of its mall stores and the liquidation of a substantial portion of the inventory of those stores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66-67. In order to assist Brookstone with the management of those store closures and the associated GOB Sales, it engaged the services of Hilco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66-67. On August 1, 2018, the Debtor and Hilco executed the Store Closing Agreement, which laid out the terms and conditions by which Hilco would assist Debtor with its store closures. The Debtor filed its petition for Chapter 11 relief the next day, and contemporaneously filed the Store Closing Motion [Docket No. 25] which requested,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Court authorize the Debtor to assume the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The UST has filed a limited objection to the issuance of an order granting Debtor approval of the assumption of the Closing Store Agreement (hereinafter the \"Limited Objection\") [Docket No. 185]. Specifically, the UST asks the Court to find that Hilco is a professional for the purpose of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and that the Debtor therefore must abide by the statutory requirements governing the retention of professionals in bankruptcy proceedings. After a hearing, the Court issued an Interim Order [Docket No. 75] granting most of the relief requested by the Debtor in the Store Closing Motion (and thereby allowing the GOB Sales to proceed), but taking under advisement the issue of whether Hilco is a \"professional\" for purposes of \u00a7 327(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hilco and the UST have prepared and submitted a helpful Joint Stipulation of Facts (the \"Joint Stipulation\") [Docket No. 261] setting forth agreed-upon facts relevant to the Store Closing Motion and the Limited Objection. The Joint Stipulation reflects that, prior to the Petition Date, the Debtor determined to close 102 stores and liquidate inventory over an 8-week post-petition period, and in order to facilitate this process, it entered into the Store Closing Agreement with Hilco. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6 2-4. Hilco's duties and obligations are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (i) Recommend appropriate discounting to effectively sell all of Merchant's goods located at the Stores as of the Sale Commencement Date or thereafter delivered thereto as may be mutually agreed by the parties in accordance with a \"store closing\" and other mutually agreed upon themed sale, and recommend appropriate point-of-purchase, point-of-sale, and other internal and external advertising in connection therewith;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (ii) Provide qualified supervision to oversee the conduct of the Sale;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (iii) Maintain focused and constant communication with Merchant's Store Operations team to coordinate and keep them abreast of strategy and timing and to properly effect Store-level communication by Merchant's employees to customers and others about the Sale;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (iv) Establish and monitor accounting functions for the Sale, including evaluation of sales of Merchant's goods located at the Stores by category, sales reporting and expense monitoring;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (v) Recommend loss prevention strategies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (vi) Coordinate with Merchant so that the operation of the Stores is being properly maintained including ongoing customer service and housekeeping activities; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (vii) Recommend appropriate staffing levels for the Stores and appropriate bonus and/or incentive programs (to be funded by Merchant) for Store employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n    at \u00b6 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties have also stipulated that Hilco's fee arrangement in the Store Closing Agreement is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ...the Debtors agreed to pay the Consultant a sliding \"Incentive Fee\" from no\n   Incentive Fee to 1.50 percent, which is tied to merchandise sales and the Aggregate Recovery Percentage.

The Consultant will also receive a separate 15% commission for selling furnishings, trade fixtures, and equipment, which the Debtors has not informed the Consultant that the Debtors wish to retain (\"Retained FF &amp; E\"). Any furniture, fixtures, and equipment not identified as Retained FF &amp; E, the Consultant may sell on a commission basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n    at \u00b6 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The record reflects that Hilco and Brookstone anticipated, at the time of entry into the Agreement on the eve of the bankruptcy proceeding, that they might enter into additional transactions or business arrangements beyond the GOB Sales contemplated in the Agreement. The potential for such transactions is expressly mentioned in the Agreement between Hilco and the Debtor. As described in the Joint Stipulation, the Agreement contained a provision which provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The Consultant is a service provider to the Debtors whose services have a limited purview, but may be expanded should the Debtors and [Hilco] agree mutually upon the terms of a global transaction (an 'Alternative Transaction') for assets not subject to the Closing Stores Agreement.

See Declaration of Disinterestedness of Ian Fredericks [Docket No. 232]; Declaration of Disinterestedness of Mackenzie Shea [Docket No. 234]. Hilco has represented that, while it is not required to file such disclosures in the context of an assumption motion under \u00a7 365, it has developed this practice in many prior cases either in response to concerns raised by the UST or in an effort to provide greater transparency regarding the transaction at hand. Brief of Hilco in Support of the Motion to Assume at \u00b6 74 [Docket No. 186].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The foregoing recounts a complicated but hardly unusual business relationship in the context of a retail bankruptcy. In a nutshell, Hilco contracted immediately before the Petition Date to assist the Debtor with the GOB Sales in exchange for compensation that appears in line with industry standards. However, informed by decades of experience with the potential pitfalls of even the most promising retail restructurings, Hilco and the Debtor left open and expressly contemplated that Hilco might be called upon or invited to play other roles in the case as circumstances may require, such as buying estate assets\n   or even serving as a lender to Brookstone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157(a) and (b)(1). Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201408\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1409. Consideration of this matter constitutes a \"core proceeding\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and (O).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    THE PARTIES' POSITIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The UST posits that Hilco is serving as an auctioneer and so must be retained under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 327(a). Alternatively, the UST contends that, given the nature of the services to be performed by Hilco for the Debtor here, Hilco is an \"other professional\" within the meaning of that term as it is used in \u00a7 327(a) and therefore must be formally retained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Hilco and the Debtor offer several responses to the UST's objection. First, the Debtor observes that Hilco and its peers have performed these services, without being retained under \u00a7 327(a), in scores if not hundreds of retail bankruptcies stretching back decades. Next, Brookstone submits that Hilco is not an auctioneer since it is not in any fashion conducting an auction. Brookstone then walks through the familiar six-factor test laid down in\n   <em>\n    First Merchants\n   </em>\n   to assert that Hilco is not an \"other professional\" under \u00a7 327(a). And finally, Brookstone contends that any ruling that would require Hilco to be retained as a professional would have a significant and detrimental impact, not only in this case, but in most retail Chapter 11 cases by severely limiting the types of work and services Hilco could perform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The issue before the Court is whether Hilco must be retained as a professional pursuant to \u00a7 327(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. That section provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Except as otherwise provided in this section, the trustee, with the court's approval, may employ one or more attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or\n   <em>\n    other professional persons\n   </em>\n   , that do not hold or represent an interest adverse to the estate, and that are disinterested persons, to represent or assist the trustee in carrying out the trustee's duties under this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Hilco, serving in the role described by the Store Closing Agreement, is a professional for the purposes of \u00a7 327(a), the retention of Hilco must be requested and approved under section \u00a7 327(a) and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 2014. These provisions operate to require the Debtor and Hilco to provide the Court with disclosures that relate to all connections and potential conflicts-of-interest. The Court must also determine that the professional is \"disinterested\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and does not \"hold or represent\n   an interest adverse to the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Importantly, if Hilco is a retained professional, it would likely be precluded from engaging in further transactions with the Debtor (such as purchasing assets not encompassed within the GOB Sales) that were referenced in the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As noted above, the UST argues as a threshold matter that Hilco must be retained as a professional, pursuant to \u00a7 327(a), because Hilco is an \"auctioneer.\" Limited Objection at 12-13. In the alternative, the UST argues that Hilco must be retained as a professional because Hilco is an \"other professional\" for purposes of \u00a7 327(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court addresses both arguments, in turn, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Hilco is Not an Auctioneer for the Purpose of \u00a7 327(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   An auctioneer is a professional identified under \u00a7 327(a). If a party is serving as an auctioneer, no matter how modest the compensation or how limited the services, it must be formally retained.\n   <em>\n    In re Borders Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180353\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/453/477/#p485\">\n    453 B.R. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2011). The Bankruptcy Code does not define the term \"auctioneer.\" The Court looks therefore to common usage of the term. An auctioneer is defined as \"[o]ne who conducts sales by auction.\" Oxford English Dictionary 778 (2nd ed. 2004). An auction is \"[a] public sale in which each bidder offers an increase upon the price offered by the preceding, the article put up being sold to the highest bidder.\" Oxford English Dictionary 778 (2nd ed. 2004). These general definitions are consistent with the Court's understanding and expectation regarding usage of these terms in the bankruptcy context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The undisputed record reflects that inventory being sold by Hilco is not being sold to the highest bidder at a public sale. Instead, it is being priced and sold at stores in a manner typical of a retail sale, not an auction. Transcript regarding hearing held August 29, 2018 at 149 [Docket No. 336] (hereinafter \"August 29 Tr.\"). During the course of Brookstone's GOB Sales, the customer does not compete with other purchasers for items, negotiate with Hilco regarding price, or make bids for any of the items for sale. Instead, the customer browses, selects, and purchases pre-priced merchandise from the store:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The consumer walks in, picks the item off the shelf, brings it to the cash register in the store, the merchant's employees are the ones who operate their [point-of-sale] systems; consumer hands the goods, it's scanned at the [point-of-sale] system, the receipt is generated, the merchant collects the proceeds of the sale from whatever tender the customer gave, customer walks out with the receipt and the merchandise...\n   <em>\n    There is no bidding. There is no negotiation\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   August 29 Tr. at 149-150 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In addition to the retail sale of inventory, Hilco is also under contract with the Debtor to sell the \"furniture, fixtures, and equipment\" (\"FF &amp; E\") in the stores. [Docket No. 25, Exhibit 2, \u00b6 6 (A)-(D) ]. While the disposal of this FF &amp; E is distinct from a typical retail sale, it is, nevertheless, not sold in an auction; nor does Hilco act as an auctioneer. Ian Fredericks, an officer of Hilco, testified that the FF &amp; E is marked with prices and is available for purchase. August 29 Tr. at 150-51.

That process, which includes the liquidation and store closure services provided by Hilco, is undoubtedly enabled by the Debtor's entry into Chapter 11 proceedings. The protections afforded to the Debtor by the Bankruptcy Code (and this Court) allow the Debtor to operate the GOB Sales free from contractual and regulatory restrictions that might otherwise restrict the Debtor's ability to quickly and efficiently liquidate its inventory and close its stores.

Hilco may offer advice or guidelines to the Debtor as to these areas, but it does not enjoy the freedom to dictate how the process is implemented. Indeed, the record reflects that Hilco offered advice to the Debtor as to how long to run the GOB Sales, and the Debtor rejected that advice.

The court emphasized the extent to which Ugly Duckling was proposing to essentially run the debtor's entire business:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [Ugly Duckling] will be intimately involved in the management of these receivables, the primary asset remaining in the Debtor's estate, and in accomplishing tasks that are within the fiduciary duties undertaken by a debtor-in-possession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In contrast to the wide discretion given to Ugly Duckling in\n   <em>\n    First Merchants\n   </em>\n   , Hilco is given a relatively narrow mandate under the Agreement. Hilco did not determine that store closures were warranted, which stores would be closed, or what the duration of the Store Closing Sale would be. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6 2-4, August 29 Tr. at 148. The Debtor retained final authority over the Store Closing Sale, acting as the final word on matters as minor as the design of the signage advertising for the GOB Sales and as major as pricing strategy and the sale timeline.

Unlike the consultant in\n   <em>\n    First Merchants\n   </em>\n   , Hilco has not been given discretion to \"accomplish[ ] tasks that are within the fiduciary duties undertaken by a debtor-in-possession.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Hilco provides advice and guidance on an inventory reduction and liquidation strategy. In\n   <em>\n    First Merchants\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, the court stressed the extraordinary mandate granted to the putative consultant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [Ugly Duckling's] role under the Consultation Agreement extends beyond mere debt collection to the evaluation and assessment of the [d]ebtor's equipment, personnel, organization, current and future facilities, and certain procedures and policies, relating to servicing the [r]eceivables.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n    at *4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, there is considerable distance between Hilco's assistance in inventory disposition, and the negotiation and implementation of a reorganization strategy that will be embodied in a plan that hopefully will enjoy stakeholder input and support. Indeed, the record reflects that Hilco's work for Brookstone has already concluded as of the date hereof, long before the filing of a plan or the closing of other transactions that form the core of the restructuring strategy. Accordingly, the Court finds that Hilco's role in the store closures does not constitute meaningful participation in the \"administration of the debtor's estate\" as contemplated by \u00a7 327(a). The fifth factor therefore favors Hilco and the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The sixth\n   <em>\n    First Merchants\n   </em>\n   factor is \"whether the employee's services involve some degree of special knowledge or skill, such that the employee can be considered a 'professional' within the ordinary meaning of the term.\"\n   <em>\n    First Merchants\n   </em>\n   at *3. In all candor, the Court finds this prong of the test to be entirely unhelpful. Long experience teaches that literally all business and service activities require \"specialized knowledge or skill\" on the part of the service provider. Hilco personnel undoubtedly possess specialized knowledge or skill, but so do all of the other entities providing services to the Debtor, from IT support to\n   waste management services and beyond. This factor therefore does not meaningfully weigh into the Court's decision today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Considering the relevant factors \"in\n   <em>\n    toto\n   </em>\n   ,\" as\n   <em>\n    First Merchants\n   </em>\n   contemplates, the Court is satisfied that Hilco is not acting as an \"other professional\" when it provides services to the Debtor pursuant to the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Limited Objection of the UST is overruled, and the Store Closing Motion is granted.
