Mr. Gomez's bankruptcy case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 10, 2016, Mr. Gomez, through his counsel, Mr. Aldana, filed a chapter 7 petition. He scheduled a 2001 Ford Focus automobile as his personal vehicle and claimed an exemption for the full value of the car. He failed to disclose his ownership of a 2012 Chevrolet Malibu, which he allegedly purchased approximately two months earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After remaining silent about the Malibu at two \u00a7 341(a) meetings of creditors, Mr.\n   Gomez amended his Schedule A/B to include the Malibu, which he valued at $4,500. He listed Anayas Auto Sales as holding a $2,700 claim secured by the Malibu. He did not amend his Schedule C to claim the Malibu as exempt. The bankruptcy court granted Mr. Gomez his discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Trustee discovered that Anayas Auto failed to perfect its lien on the Malibu until after the petition date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee requested that Anayas Auto release its lien, but it did not do so. As a result, the Trustee initiated an adversary proceeding against Anayas Auto for avoidance and recovery of a postpetition transfer under \u00a7 549. Anayas Auto did not answer the complaint, and the Trustee obtained default judgment and a release of the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Trustee e-mailed Mr. Aldana to inform him of the default judgment against Anayas Auto and request that Mr. Gomez either surrender the Malibu to the Trustee's auctioneer or offer to purchase the vehicle. Mr. Aldana did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Trustee also went to Mr. Gomez's residence to inquire about the Malibu. Mr. Gomez was not home, but a woman at the residence told the Trustee that she would tell Mr. Gomez to contact the Trustee about turning over the Malibu. Mr. Gomez did not contact the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The motion to compel cooperation and turnover\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Trustee filed a motion to compel turnover of the Malibu (\"Motion to Compel\"). He stated that he had used his avoidance power under \u00a7 549 to obtain a release of Anayas Auto's lien, but despite repeated requests for Mr. Gomez to surrender the Malibu, Mr. Gomez had failed to do so. He requested that the court order immediate turnover of the Malibu.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 10, 2018, the bankruptcy court issued its tentative ruling stating its inclination to grant the Motion to Compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Later that day, Mr. Aldana contacted the Trustee to inform him that he had \"just read\" the Motion to Compel (even though the Trustee had filed and served the Motion to Compel six weeks earlier) and was puzzled by the court's ruling, because the Malibu was exempted. The Trustee left Mr. Aldana a voicemail informing him that Mr. Gomez did not exempt the Malibu and that the avoidance of a lien by the estate does not restore the property to the debtor. Mr. Aldana did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Still later that same day, Mr. Gomez filed an amended Schedule C, wherein he exempted the full value of both the Focus and Malibu under both California Code of Civil Procedure (\"CCP\") sections 703.140(b)(2) (special bankruptcy exemption) and 704.010 (regular exemption).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, he did not oppose the Motion to Compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The bankruptcy court, noting that no one filed an opposition, granted the Motion\n   to Compel and ordered Mr. Gomez to turn over the Malibu.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Trustee's objection to claimed exemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Trustee filed an objection to Mr. Gomez's claimed exemptions in the Focus and Malibu (\"Objection\"). He argued that Mr. Gomez had not claimed the Malibu exempt prior to the Trustee's avoidance of Anayas Auto's lien, so Mr. Gomez could not claim the recovered property as exempt under \u00a7 522(g)(1). He also asserted that Mr. Gomez is only entitled to seek an exemption under either CCP section 703.140(b)(2) or section 704.010, but not both. Finally, he argued that Mr. Gomez amended Schedule C in bad faith because \"[d]espite all of these pleadings, requests and explanation, filed over the course of many months, Attorney Aldana now files a tardy, improper and clearly objectionable amendment to further delay the administration of this estate.\" The Trustee requested that the bankruptcy court award him his fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Gomez did not file an opposition to the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Both Mr. Aldana and the Trustee appeared at the telephonic hearing on the Trustee's Objection. The court sustained the Objection as to the Focus and Malibu and denied both exemptions. It continued the hearing on the issue of sanctions and stated that it \"will consider granting compensatory sanction[s], for Trustee's expenses incurred in connection to the opposition to exemption, and coercive sanction[s] under [its] inherent authority ....\" It allowed Mr. Aldana to file a response arguing against sanctions by February 22 and allowed the Trustee to respond by March 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Aldana did not file a timely response to the sanctions query. The Trustee filed his brief on February 27 and requested sanctions because: (1) Mr. Aldana should have known that the lien avoidance action was for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate; (2) the Appellants refused to turn over the Malibu for liquidation; (3) prior to filing the Objection, the Trustee provided Mr. Aldana with legal authority supporting return of the Malibu to the estate and explaining why Mr. Gomez could not claim an exemption; (4) Mr. Aldana nevertheless amended Schedule C to claim the Malibu exempt; (5) Mr. Aldana improperly claimed the Malibu exempt under both CCP sections 703.140 and 704.010 ; (6) the Appellants did not oppose the Objection; and (7) Mr. Aldana did not bother to defend himself and respond to the court's inquiry regarding sanctions. Additionally, the Trustee sought coercive sanctions because \"Mr. Aldana has repeatedly ignored and disregarded legal authority provided to him ... [and] did not even acknowledge any need to respond to this Court's request for explanation as to why sanctions should not be assigned.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Later that same day, Mr. Aldana filed a tardy declaration in response to the Trustee's filing. He stated that he did not act in bad faith because he relied on the advice of a former chapter 7 trustee, Vincent Gorski, and\n   <em>\n    Law v. Siegel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701998\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/415/\">\n    571 U.S. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825872,12701998\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1188/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701998\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/415/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), which he claimed stands for the proposition that \"any property can be exempted up until the date of closing.\" He stated that he merely disagreed with the Trustee's interpretation of the law, which is not indicative of bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Aldana offered the declaration of Mr. Gorski, whom he had allegedly consulted regarding the exemption. Mr. Gorski stated that he advised Mr. Aldana that \"the Debtor could modify his exemptions on property as claimed on Schedule C until the close of the bankruptcy case, including an exemption on the vehicle currently at\n   issue.\" In particular, he testified that\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   does not curtail a debtor's ability to claim an exemption if he did not participate in activities explicitly listed in \u00a7 522.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Prior to the continued hearing on the issue of sanctions, the bankruptcy court issued a tentative ruling stating that it was inclined to grant the request for sanctions based on its inherent powers. At the hearing, the court explained to Mr. Aldana (who admitted that he had not read the court's tentative ruling) that Mr. Gomez did not engage in sanctionable conduct, but that it would sanction Mr. Aldana under its inherent sanction authority. It noted that \"I have to find that you have done so in bad faith, which can be found where I have reckless conduct coupled with improper purpose.\" It stated that Mr. Aldana did not dispute that he received the Trustee's various filings but failed to oppose them, and, \"[i]nstead, after the Trustee has gone to the time and effort of setting aside the lien and doing the different things he's done, he's trying to get possession of this car, he's making demands, you filed exemptions that are problematic for two reasons.\" The court pointed out that Mr. Aldana had cited two inconsistent statutory bases for the exemption, but, more importantly, that he ignored \"hornbook bankruptcy law\" when claiming the exemption after the Trustee avoided the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ultimately, the court adhered to its tentative ruling and sanctioned Mr. Aldana $1,475, the amount of the Trustee's fees and costs for opposing the Objection. It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I'm finding on your count recklessness, which means you didn't properly look at the law the way an attorney in your position should have. You didn't take warnings about the law the way an attorney in your position should have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   And it rises above the level of recklessness, because your positions are frivolous and because you also did so in a manner that, in a small-dollar estate, has huge impact. This is the sort of behavior that the court can't countenance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The bankruptcy court entered the order (\"Sanctions Order\") adopting its tentative ruling in its entirety and sanctioning Mr. Aldana:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Aldana does not dispute that he received the Trustee's documents. He failed to oppose anything. Instead, he did an end run around his default and sought exemption as to the Malibu on the basis of two seriously flawed arguments. He attempts to avoid censure by relying on another attorney's opinion - an opinion that is worthless given that Mr. Aldana apparently failed to disclose the most relevant facts. Mr. Aldana frequently appears in this Court, a claim that he is a bankruptcy neophyte is not a defense. And in the face of this serious situation, he again failed to file a timely response. Here his conduct appears, at best, reckless, and this recklessness appears coupled with frivolous arguments and actions and disregard of this Court's scheduling requirements. Bad faith appears to exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court further ordered Mr. Aldana to report the sanction to the California bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal from the Sanctions Order.

The bankruptcy court exercised its inherent power to sanction Mr. Aldana for \"recklessness ... coupled with frivolous arguments and actions and disregard of this Court's scheduling requirements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A bankruptcy court \"has the inherent authority to impose sanctions for bad faith, which includes a broad range of willful improper conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Fink v.

They do not explain their superficial contentions or support them with any legal authority, other than their steadfast reliance on\n   <em>\n    Law v. Siegel\n   </em>\n   . This appeal is both frivolous and meritless. The bankruptcy court did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Appellants' arguments that ignore \u00a7 522(g)(1) are frivolous and reckless, not a mere \"difference of opinion.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Appellants insist that the law allows Mr. Gomez to exempt the Malibu at any time prior to the closing of the bankruptcy case. They say that the dispute in this case is really only a difference in interpretation of the law, which does not give rise to bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Appellants are wrong, and the law on this point is not ambiguous or open to interpretation. As the Trustee explained repeatedly, if he recovers certain property prior to the debtor claiming an exemption, that property cannot be exempted. Section 522(g) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (g) Notwithstanding sections 550 and 551 of this title,\n   <strong>\n    the debtor may exempt under subsection (b) of this section property that the trustee recovers under section\n   </strong>\n   510(c)(2), 542, 543,\n   <strong>\n    550\n   </strong>\n   , 551, or 553 of this title, to the extent that the debtor could have exempted such property under subsection (b) of this section if such property had not been transferred,\n   <strong>\n    if -\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (1)(A)\n   <strong>\n    such transfer was not a voluntary transfer of such property by the debtor\n   </strong>\n   ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (B) the debtor did not conceal such property; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (2) the debtor could have avoided such transfer under subsection (f)(1)(B) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00a7 522(g) (emphases added). In other words, \u00a7 522(g)(1) \"allows the debtor to exempt property that the trustee recovers under [various sections of the Bankruptcy Code] as long as the transfer was\n   <strong>\n    involuntary\n   </strong>\n   and the property was\n   <strong>\n    not concealed\n   </strong>\n   by the debtor.\" 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 522.12[1] (Alan N.

BAP 2017), we considered a similar situation where the trustee avoided a creditor's security interest in a vehicle and objected to a later attempt to exempt the vehicle. In that case, the debtors scheduled their 1965 Corvette, in which the debtor-husband's brother held a nonpurchase money security interest to secure a debt in excess of the vehicle's value. The trustee then sought turnover of the vehicle because the security interest was not perfected under Nevada law. The debtors amended their schedules to claim an exemption in the Corvette, but the trustee objected. The court agreed with the trustee and sustained the trustee's objection under \u00a7 522(g)(1)(A). It determined that there was a transfer of a security interest and that the trustee had recovered the vehicle under \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 550 for the benefit of the estate when the brother released the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On appeal, we first considered whether there was a \"voluntary transfer\" under \u00a7 522(g)(1). We applied Nevada law and concluded that the debtors had transferred a security interest in the Corvette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, we considered whether the trustee had avoided the security interest and recovered it for the estate. We noted that the brother did not perfect his interest in the Corvette under state law. The trustee's motion and threat of avoidance powers constituted \"some action\" that caused the brother to release the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In the present case, the bankruptcy court did not err in holding that the Trustee satisfied the two prongs of \u00a7 522(g)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   First, there was a \"transfer\" of estate property.

The bankruptcy court never suggested that the exemption should be denied because it was untimely or for any extra-statutory reason. Instead, it relied on the relevant statute that specifically prohibited Mr. Gomez from claiming an exemption in the Malibu.\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The bankruptcy court did not err in considering the totality of factors concerning the surrender of the Malibu.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court erroneously considered the facts in finding bad faith. They argue that the Trustee saw the Malibu at Mr. Gomez's house and chose not to retrieve the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The bankruptcy court did not err. There is no evidence in the record that the Trustee saw the Malibu at Mr. Gomez's house. Rather, the Trustee's declaration did not mention the Malibu and only states that Mr. Gomez was not home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Appellants also assert that the Trustee never told Mr. Gomez where to surrender the Malibu. But the Trustee told the Appellants to surrender the Malibu to the Trustee's auctioneer. They cannot claim that they did not know how to surrender the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The bankruptcy court did not err in considering Mr. Gorski's declaration.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by improperly discounting Mr. Gorski's declaration because he did not state that he was aware that the Trustee had avoided the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The bankruptcy court did not err. It considered Mr. Gorski's declaration, but simply found that his opinion was inapplicable because he did not address the fact that the Trustee had recovered the Malibu using his avoidance powers. Moreover, a third party's interpretation of the law is not binding on a court. The bankruptcy court's findings were not illogical, implausible, or without support in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The bankruptcy court applied the correct standard.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court \"called the actions reckless, but\n   that is not sufficient to sanction one's belief in the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Appellants are correct that the award of sanctions requires more than recklessness alone. The Ninth Circuit has stated that \"[s]anctions are available for a variety of types of willful actions, including recklessness when combined with an additional factor such as frivolousness, harassment, or an improper purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Fink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076942\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/989/#p992\">\n    239 F.3d at 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Appellants ignore the bankruptcy court's ruling. The court held multiple times that Mr. Aldana was reckless, but it also held that his positions were frivolous. It stated at the hearing, \"And it rises\n   <strong>\n    above the level of recklessness\n   </strong>\n   , because your positions are frivolous and because you also did so in a manner that, in a small-dollar estate, has huge impact.\" (Emphasis added.) The Sanctions Order confirms: \"Here his conduct appears, at best, reckless, and\n   <strong>\n    this recklessness appears coupled with frivolous arguments\n   </strong>\n   and actions and disregard of this Court's scheduling requirements.\" (Emphasis added.) The bankruptcy court did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Trustee is entitled to recover his fees and double costs from Mr. Aldana for this frivolous appeal.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Trustee requested by separate motion that we sanction the Appellants for filing a frivolous appeal, not following the appellate rules, and offering a \"fluctuating and erratic presentation of the issues on appeal.\" In keeping with their usual pattern, the Appellants filed an untimely opposition. We GRANT the request for fees and double costs against Mr. Aldana only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Rule 8020, which conforms to the language of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (\"FRAP\") 38, provides that: \"If the district court or BAP determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\" Rule 8020(a).

Furthermore, the Appellants did not bother to respond to the Motion to Compel or the court's threat of sanctions, yet they took the same incorrect position on appeal and submitted an opening brief with only two pages of argument that was largely devoid of legal authority or analysis.
