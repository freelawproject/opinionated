(\"Produce Pay\") asserts a claim under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20499\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"PACA\") against Spiech Farms, LLC, the debtor-in-possession in this chapter 11 case (the \"Debtor\"). Produce Pay argues that its PACA claim arises from the following two separate transactions with the Debtor. First, the Debtor allegedly sold produce to Produce Pay via a software platform. Second, the Debtor, acting as Produce Pay's consignee, sold the produce that Produce Pay purchased moments earlier, to the Debtor's pre-existing customers. Produce Pay contends that, as an unpaid seller or supplier of perishable agricultural commodities, it is a PACA trust beneficiary entitled to have its claim satisfied ahead of all other non-PACA creditors, including Chemical Bank, the Debtor's prepetition secured lender (\"Chemical\"). Alternatively, Produce Pay argues that when it purchased the Debtor's \"right, title and interest\" in produce, it also purchased the Debtor's receivables, including the Debtor's status as a PACA trust beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Debtor and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the \"Committee\") object to what they perceive as an attempt by Produce Pay to contort PACA. They argue, among other things, that Produce Pay has no PACA claim because the Debtor did not sell produce to Produce Pay, as title to the same produce had previously been transferred to the Debtor's pre-existing customers. The Debtor and the Committee further contend that the transactions between the Debtor and Produce Pay constitute a financing arrangement, not a true sale. As such, they argue that Produce Pay did not purchase produce or anything else from the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the following reasons, the court shall sustain the objections and disallow Produce Pay's claim under PACA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499e(c)(5),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and LCivR 83.2(a) (W.D.

The Debtor sells its produce to national grocery chains such as Wal-Mart, Meijer, Publix, Whole Foods and Kroger. According to the Debtor, it produces more than 80% of the fresh Concord grapes in the United States and is the largest producer of fresh table grapes east of the Mississippi River. (Ex. NNN at 32:5-7). At all relevant times, the Debtor was a licensed PACA dealer. (Ex. JJJ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Debtor's Prepetition Financing Relationships\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the years leading up to its bankruptcy, the Debtor primarily relied on Chemical to finance its operations. In exchange for term loans and lines of credit in excess of $4 million, the Debtor granted Chemical first priority mortgage liens and security interests in substantially all of the Debtor's assets [Dkt. No. 253].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early 2017, the Debtor began to experience financial distress due, in large part, to a frost that severely damaged, if not destroyed, its blueberry crop in Georgia. (Ex. NNN at 117:8-22). Without sufficient cash flow from the Georgia crop, the Debtor fell out of formula on at least one of its lines of credit with Chemical. (Ex. NNN at 177-78; Hr'g Tr. 116:3-20). As an accommodation, Chemical extended a \"bridge loan\" to the Debtor. (Hr'g Tr. 116:3-7). Notwithstanding this accommodation, the Debtor continued to struggle financially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the Spring of 2017, the Debtor began to consider alternative means by which to finance its operations. (Ex. NNN at 131-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   One alternative source of financing was offered by Produce Pay, a licensed PACA dealer based in Los Angeles, California. (Hr'g Tr. 14:6, 18-19). Produce Pay contacted the Debtor in late April 2017 and generally marketed its services as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Produce Pay is a multi-service finance company focused exclusively on the fresh produce space. We provide access to cash flow, anywhere in the world, the day after you ship your produce to the U.S. This would minimize risk and exposure by ensuring you and your base of growers have operational capital without tying up your own business' assets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Ex. EE). Throughout May 2017, the Debtor and Produce Pay discussed the possibility of entering into a financing arrangement. (Ex. EE; Ex. FF; Ex. GG). During these discussions, the Debtor informed Produce Pay that the Debtor had granted Chemical an interest in its accounts receivable, a fact that did not deter Produce Pay. (Ex. EE). Nonetheless, the parties were unable to come to any agreement and their discussions ended in late May 2017. (Ex. NNN at 132:10-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Over the next few months, the Debtor's financial condition continued to worsen. In mid-August 2017, the Debtor recommenced discussions with Produce Pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 132-33). During their negotiations, Produce Pay and the Debtor contemplated an arrangement centered around the Debtor's accounts receivable. (Ex. JJ; Ex. KK; Ex. PP; Ex. QQ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 31, 2018, the Debtor and Produce Pay entered into a Distribution Agreement (the \"Agreement\") designed to provide the Debtor with access to the funds it desperately needed. (Ex. G). While creative, the Agreement is at times confusing, perhaps purposely so. It contains shades of a true sale, factoring, consignment, securitization, and even hints of PACA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The maze of defined terms makes interpretation of the Agreement a challenging exercise, especially since, according to Produce Pay, the Agreement is simply for the sale of fruit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Agreement was structured to effectuate two primary transfers, which Produce Pay describes as \"two separate, simultaneous transactions between the Debtor and Produce Pay.\" [Dkt. No. 385]. First, Produce Pay agreed to purchase from the Debtor \"Distributed Asset Pools,\" which by definition under the Agreement includes produce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7 2.1). Under the Agreement, Produce Pay could, in its sole discretion, purchase a Distributed Asset Pool for the \"Asset Pool Purchase Price.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7 1(e);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ex. JJJ, Dusastre Decl. at \u00b6 6). Throughout the course of the parties' relationship, Produce Pay deemed the Asset Pool Purchase Price for all Distributed Asset Pools to be 50% of the accounts receivable due to the Debtor from its customers. (Hr'g Tr. 39-40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the Debtor agreed to act as Produce Pay's \"consignment agent\" by selling to the Debtor's pre-existing customers, on behalf of Produce Pay, the same produce that Produce Pay had allegedly just purchased as part of a Distributed Asset Pool. (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7 3.2; Ex. JJJ, Dusastre Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30). As Produce Pay's consignment agent, the Debtor was required to remit the \"Company Proceeds\" to Produce Pay, plus sales commissions, marketing commissions and certain expenses, including the costs of collection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7\u00a7 1(b), (j), (k), 6.1; Ex. JJJ, Dusastre Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 35-39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Agreement itself does not identify any Distributed Asset Pools or produce for sale. Instead, it contemplates that the Debtor will designate produce to the Agreement at some point in the future, which the Debtor did by uploading \"pallet reports\" through a software platform proprietary to Produce Pay. (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7 1; Hr'g Tr. 27:1-4). If Produce Pay decided to purchase the Distributed Asset Pool identified on a pallet report, it paid the Asset Pool Initial Purchase Price and transmitted an email to the Debtor advising it that funds had been wired to its account. (H'rg Tr. 65:7-13; Ex. R-2). Produce Pay also sent the Debtor a \"confirmation of sale\" through the platform. (Hr'g Tr. 28:8-14; Ex. JJJ). Produce Pay described this process as \"digital no touch, no see transactions.\" (Hr'g Tr. 26:24-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Agreement further provided that Produce Pay would never take physical possession of any produce. (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7 4.2; Hr'g Tr. 26:24-25). The risk of loss under the Agreement remained with the Debtor at all times. (Hr'g Tr. 102:3-13). In the event that the Debtor's customers did not pay the Debtor for the produce it was allegedly selling to them on behalf of Produce Pay, the Debtor was required to repurchase the Distributed Asset Pool. (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7 6.4). The Debtor was obligated to sell at least $1 million of Distributed Asset Pools to Produce Pay on an annual basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6.3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On or around September 8, 2017, the Debtor began to access funds under the Agreement. (Ex. 16). Unfortunately, the Debtor's new relationship with Produce Pay was hardly the financial solution it had hoped for. While conducting a search of financing statements in early September 2017, Chemical discovered that Produce Pay had filed a financing statement against the Debtor on September 1, 2017, one day after entering into the Agreement. (Hr'g Tr. 144:8-9; Ex. Q). In a meeting with the Debtor shortly thereafter, Chemical\n   expressed concern over Produce Pay's alleged security interest in the Debtor's assets but was unaware of the complicated structure of the Agreement or Produce Pay's confirmations of sale, including the reservation of PACA trust language contained therein. (Hr'g Tr. 123-125).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In subsequent communications, the Debtor informed Chemical that it was selling produce to Produce Pay, as reflected in one of the Debtor's borrowing base certificates which disclosed a \"Contra/Retention/PACA Payable\" in the amount of $614,284.82. (Ex. 7; Hr'g Tr. 123-24). Towards the end of October 2017, the Debtor told Chemical that it believed Produce Pay was entitled to protections under PACA. (Hr'g Tr. 126-28; Ex. 40; Ex. 41). It was at this time that Chemical realized Produce Pay was attempting to circumvent Chemical's security interest by asserting rights under PACA. (Hr'g Tr. 125:2-8; Ex. 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In a letter dated October 30, 2017 and in subsequent correspondence, Chemical formally declared the Debtor to be in default. (Ex. 8; Ex. 40). Chemical demanded that the Debtor notify its customers, as account debtors, that they were required to remit all future payments jointly to the Debtor and Chemical. (Ex. 8). Over the next eight days, Chemical also effectuated setoffs of more than $570,000 from the Debtor's deposit accounts. (Ex. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Around the same time that Chemical was scrutinizing the Debtor's transactions with Produce Pay, the Debtor's relationship with Produce Pay began to deteriorate. On October 2, 2017, Produce Pay notified the Debtor that it had yet to receive the first two payments due under the Agreement. (Ex. 19). Produce Pay reminded the Debtor that it currently owed $190,000, which would soon increase to $327,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In response, the Debtor proposed to apply new \"files\" toward the outstanding indebtedness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Produce Pay rejected the Debtor's proposal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Produce Pay informed the Debtor that it would need to begin to remit funds in satisfaction of the initial transactions before additional funds would be made available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Throughout October 2017, the Debtor failed to make payments to Produce Pay with much consistency. (Ex. 22). Nonetheless, over the course of their short-lived relationship, the Debtor managed to remit over $640,000 to Produce Pay, which allowed the Debtor to continue to receive new funds under the Agreement. (Ex. S).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In November 2017, as the Debtor was preparing to make a significant payment to Produce Pay, Chemical effectuated its setoffs, thereby depriving the Debtor of the funds it needed to partially satisfy Produce Pay. (Ex. NNN at 139:9-11). Produce Pay reacted by declining to make additional \"advances.\" (Ex. 20). Produce Pay also notified the Debtor that it was prepared to take legal action unless the Debtor immediately proposed a payment plan acceptable to Produce Pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). No such payment plan was forthcoming, however. Without any cash and millions of dollars in debt to Chemical and Produce Pay, the Debtor was unable to continue to fund its operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Bankruptcy Filing and Produce Pay's PACA Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On November 22, 2017, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11. The Debtor's case was contentious from the beginning. Chemical and Produce Pay both objected to the Debtor's use of cash collateral [Dkt. Nos. 18, 20]. After an evidentiary hearing over the course of several days, the court authorized the Debtor to use cash collateral on a final basis [Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   No. 253].\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As is common in bankruptcy cases involving PACA, the Debtor filed a motion to establish certain procedures related to PACA claims [Dkt. No. 128]. The court entered an order granting the Debtor's motion on March 1, 2018 [Dkt. No. 220]. Among other things, the order required any person asserting a claim under PACA to file a proof of claim and supporting documents by no later than May 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Produce Pay timely filed its proof of claim on April 13, 2018 [Claim No. 111]. The proof of claim is supported by numerous documents, including pallet reports, confirmations of sale, and a sworn declaration from Benjamin Dusastre, the chief financial officer of Produce Pay. (Ex. JJJ). In its proof of claim, Produce Pay asserts that it has a valid PACA claim in the amount of $1,002,273.70. The Debtor and the Committee filed timely objections to Produce Pay's claim, after which Produce Pay filed a reply [Dkt. Nos. 354, 357, 385].\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   All three parties also filed pretrial briefs [Dkt. Nos. 525, 526, 528].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court held an evidentiary hearing on September 24, 2018. At the hearing, the parties stipulated to the admissibility of over ninety exhibits [Dkt. No. 530], including certain testimony of Mr. Timothy Spiech, the Debtor's president, from the evidentiary hearing regarding the Debtor's use of cash collateral.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also heard testimony from Mr. Dusastre and Ms. Joan Johnson, a vice president at Chemical. While all three witnesses were credible, they were also understandably confused by the legal structure of the transactions between the Debtor and Produce Pay. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The sole issue before the court is whether Produce Pay has a valid PACA claim against the Debtor. The parties devote the majority of their briefing to PACA. PACA, however, is not the only relevant statutory authority. State commercial law, including Article 2 and Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (the \"U.C.C.\"), is also directly applicable to the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    A.

The second rule is that once goods are in the possession of the buyer, any reservation of an interest or title by the seller is deemed a security interest. Subject to those two rules, the parties may otherwise determine by mutual agreement the point in the transaction that title will pass to the buyer. If the parties do not explicitly agree on a point in time (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the date of the contract, upon delivery, etc.), Sections 2-401(2) and (3) provide default rules for determining the transfer of title of goods.

If the agreement is silent regarding passage of title and the goods are already in the place where the buyer will take possession, Section 2-401(3) provides that title passes upon the delivery of a \"document of title\" if one is contemplated, or at the time of contracting, if no \"documents of title\" are involved...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   In no event, however, may title remain in the seller after the buyer takes possession of the goods (or of a \"document of title\" to the goods, if applicable), regardless of the parties' agreement or intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    In re Rome Family Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896475\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/407/65/#p75\">\n    407 B.R. at 76-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted) (citations omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Malloy v.

Title Passed to the Customers Prior to Identification Under the Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This court finds other courts' interpretation of section 2-401 to be well\n   reasoned and applicable to the present dispute. The court must determine whether title to produce first passed to the Debtor's customers or Produce Pay. If title first passed to the Debtor's customers, the Debtor had no remaining title to transfer to Produce Pay as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Applying the relevant provisions of section 2-401 and section 2-501 of the U.C.C., the court concludes that the Debtor transferred title to the produce in Produce Pay's proof of claim to the Debtor's customers before that same produce was identified to the Agreement. The Agreement itself does not \"explicitly\" identify any produce designated for sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.C.C. \u00a7 2-501(1). Instead, the Agreement provides that the Debtor will identify produce to the Agreement by submitting information through the platform, which first occurred when the Debtor uploaded the pallet reports. (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7 1; Ex. JJJ; Ex. NNN at 149; Hr'g Tr. 27:1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Each pallet report attached to Produce Pay's proof of claim states that the produce had been shipped and delivered to the Debtor's customer before the Debtor uploaded the pallet report to the platform.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ex. R; Ex. JJJ). Similarly, each pallet report and the corresponding invoices referenced therein state that the Debtor's customer had been invoiced before the produce in the pallet report was offered to Produce Pay through the platform. (Ex. JJJ; Ex. 50). According to the invoices, the Debtor delivered the produce to its customers before the pallet reports were electronically submitted to Produce Pay through the platform. Produce Pay's confirmations of sale include \"ship dates,\" which Mr. Dusastre explained were the dates that the Debtor first identified a specific Distributed Asset Pool to Produce Pay by uploading a pallet report. (Ex. JJJ; Hr'g Tr. 31:13-21). With respect to every Distributed Asset Pool, the Debtor physically delivered produce to its customers before the Debtor designated produce for sale under the Agreement. (Ex. R; Ex. JJJ; Ex. NNN at 142-53; Ex. 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Produce Pay argues that \"full\" title to the produce did not pass to the Debtor's customers before Produce Pay was deemed to take title under the Agreement. (Hr'g Tr. 44:8-15, 88:5-6). According to Produce Pay, the Debtor retained some form of title even after it delivered produce to its customers because the customers had yet to remit payment to the Debtor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:8-15, 89-90). Mr. Dusastre testified that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [b]ecause if we look at one of the pallets, the debtor had shipped that product to a client. That client has received legal title, physical delivery of it, but had not paid for it. So the Debtor still had equitable title to the produce. [Produce Pay] purchased that equitable title, including the PACA rights that [the Debtor] held against [its customers].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:4-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Produce Pay seemingly relies on the \"cash sale\" doctrine,\" which prior to the enactment of the U.C.C., permitted a buyer and seller to agree that title to goods sold remained with the seller until the seller was paid.\n   <em>\n    In re Samuels &amp; Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1089566\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/526/1238/#p1246\">\n    526 F.2d at 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Produce Pay's reliance on the cash sale doctrine is misplaced. After goods are delivered, section 2-401 of the U.C.C. expressly limits the effect of any attempted reservation of title to a security interest, regardless of whether the sale is a cash sale or a credit sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1089566\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/526/1238/#p1246\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    G &amp; B Aircraft Mgmt. v.

BAP 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Because the produce was not identified to the Agreement until the Debtor uploaded its pallet reports, Produce Pay could not have obtained title to the produce before that time. U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2-401(1), 2-501(1). With respect to each pallet report identified in Produce Pay's proof of claim, the Debtor physically delivered the produce to its customers prior to the produce being \"shipped, marked or otherwise designated\" to the Agreement by the Debtor. (Ex. R, Ex. JJJ, Hr'g Tr. 7-8).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.C.C. \u00a7 2-501(1)(b). When the Debtor physically delivered the produce to its customers, title was deemed to pass. U.C.C. \u00a7 2-401. Produce Pay, therefore, never obtained title to the produce that is the subject of its PACA claim. Similarly, Produce Pay never had any possession or control of the produce, nor did it supply produce to anyone. The produce was gone in all respects before it was identified to the Agreement. As such, Produce Pay is not a seller or supplier of perishable agricultural commodities entitled to the status of a PACA trust beneficiary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    C. The Agreement Constitutes a Financing Arrangement - U.C.C. \u00a7 9-101 et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Perhaps realizing that it never sold or supplied produce, Produce Pay opaquely advances an alternative argument. Produce Pay contends that when it purchased a Distributed Asset Pool, it purchased all \"right, title and interest\" to the produce that was the subject of that Distributed Asset Pool. The Agreement is relatively silent in this regard. It states that upon payment for a Distributed Asset Pool, Produce Pay has all \"right, title and interest\" in a Distributed Asset Pool, and that the Debtor is required to execute any documents to effectuate such \"conveyance and assignment.\" (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7 3.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In its reply brief, Produce Pay states without further discussion or analysis that such \"right, title and interest\" consists of \"proceeds and receivables related to [the] produce.\" [Dkt. No. 385]. Mr. Dusastre testified that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Upon Produce Pay's purchase and Debtor's sale of each Asset Pool, Produce Pay assumed all rights, title, and interest in and to the [p]roduce, which necessarily\n   <em>\n    includes any and all related receivables generated from Debtor's sale of Produce\n   </em>\n   ... and Debtor's PACA trust rights preserved against its consignment purchasers or\n   <em>\n    account debtors\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   (Ex.

Focusing on the fact that the risk of loss remained with the Debtor at all times under the Agreement, they maintain that the transactions between the Debtor and Produce Pay constitute a financing arrangement, not a true sale. Accordingly, they argue that because Produce Pay did not purchase anything, Produce Pay is not entitled to any rights derived from the Debtor's produce or receivables, including the Debtor's rights as an unpaid PACA trust beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   PACA does not address the sale of receivables.

This court therefore predicts that if the Sixth Circuit were confronted with the issue, it would apply the transfer-of-risk test adopted by its sister circuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    2. Produce Pay Did Not Purchase Receivables, Including PACA Rights\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As the Debtor and the Committee highlight, numerous aspects of the Agreement are indicative of a financing arrangement, not a true sale. First, the Agreement requires the Debtor to collect receivables from its customers and to remit the Company Proceeds-50% of the proceeds from the Debtor's receivables, plus commissions and other charges-to Produce Pay. (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 6.1). The Debtor is obligated to pay this amount to Produce Pay even if the Debtor's customers, as account debtors, default on their obligations to the Debtor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6.1). As such, the Debtor, not Produce Pay, carried the burden of any default, setoff or price adjustment by the Debtor's customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Second, the Agreement states that in the event the Debtor does not remit the Company Proceeds within thirty days after Produce Pay purchases a Distributed Asset Pool, the sales commission due to Produce Pay will increase pursuant to formulas set forth in the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 6.2). The Agreement therefore penalized the Debtor, not Produce Pay, if the Debtor's customers failed to pay for the produce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Third, the Agreement required the Debtor to repurchase Distributed Asset Pools from Produce Pay unless, within sixty days from the date Produce Pay advanced funds to the Debtor, the Debtor repaid those funds, plus commissions and other charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6.4). Such other charges included any costs incurred by Produce Pay during that sixty day period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Agreement further allowed Produce Pay to recover the repurchase price by withholding (seemingly through recoupment or setoff) future payments otherwise due by Produce Pay to the Debtor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 3.3, 6.4). The Agreement thus not only allowed Produce Pay to recover the funds it initially advanced to the Debtor, but it also increased the amount owed by the Debtor if the Debtor's customers did not remit payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nickey Gregory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220153,3799486\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/591/\">\n    597 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   601-602 ;\n   <em>\n    Reaves Brokerage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537798\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/410/#p414\">\n    336 F.3d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Fourth, the risk of any default by the Debtor's customers was overtly placed on the Debtor. Produce Pay did not even attempt to disguise such means of recourse, as the Agreement states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   [The Debtor] shall bear all default risk of any purchaser of the Produce. As such, [the Debtor] shall compensate [Produce Pay] based on the first invoiced Gross Sale Proceeds even if a grocer, retailer or other purchaser or end user default on payment after having taken possession of the [p]roduce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7 6.8). It is hard to imagine an agreement being any clearer regarding the risk of loss than this provision. Unlike a true sale of receivables where the buyer assumes the risk of non-payment by account debtors, the Debtor's payment obligations under the Agreement were wholly-dependent on the amount it owed to Produce Pay, not the proceeds actually realized from the receivables.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Endico Potatoes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416050\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/1063/#p1066\">\n    67 F.3d at 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Fifth, the Debtor, not Produce Pay, was burdened with all risks and costs associated with any damages from consumption, storage, marketing, and promotion for the produce related to the receivables allegedly purchased by Produce Pay. (Ex. G, Agr. at \u00a7\u00a7 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 6.4). In the event that any claims were brought by third persons against Produce Pay, the Debtor was required to defend and indemnify Produce Pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 5.4). The Debtor, not Produce Pay, was obligated to procure insurance to protect against any loss to Produce Pay by naming it as an additional insured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 10.12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Produce Pay never suffered any adverse consequences due to recalls, disputes with suppliers, tax liabilities, or otherwise under the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 6.7, 7.3). Produce Pay had one material obligation under the Agreement - to loan the Debtor money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Sixth, the Agreement provides that the Debtor acknowledges it cannot use its accounts, accounts receivable or proceeds from the sale of produce as collateral in connection with loans from third parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 3.2, 12.1). The Debtor further acknowledged that it would not offer for sale to Produce Pay any Distributed Asset Pool that could be construed as another person's collateral. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 12.1). By including such language, the court infers that Produce Pay was concerned (rightly so) that the Agreement could be construed as a financing arrangement, thereby giving it a security interest subordinate to that of Chemical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Finally, other provisions in the Agreement further support the conclusion that the transactions were part of a financing arrangement, not a true sale of produce or receivables. The Agreement refers to the platform as a mechanism for \"alternative financing\" that is to be used by the Debtor to notify Produce Pay when it has a Distributed Asset Pool to \"finance.\" (Ex. G, Agr. at p. 1, \u00a7 1.2(a) );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S &amp; H Packing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421668\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/797/#p802\">\n    883 F.3d at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Prior to execution of the Agreement, the Debtor and Produce Pay discussed the Debtor's need for working capital and credit to be secured by the Debtor's receivables. (Ex. P; Ex. T; Ex. U; Ex. EE; Ex. MM);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nickey Gregory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220153,3799486\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/591/\">\n    597 F.3d at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One day after the Agreement was executed, Produce Pay filed a financing statement in which it identified\n   as collateral the Distributed Asset Pools \"and all cash collections from, and all proceeds of, the foregoing.\" (Ex. Q);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S &amp; H Packing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421668\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/797/#p802\">\n    883 F.3d at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While these facts alone are not determinative, they are further evidence that the Agreement was intended as a financing arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In sum, Produce Pay did not purchase receivables. Instead, it used them as collateral to secure repayment of the loans it made to the Debtor. Because Produce Pay did not purchase the Debtor's accounts receivable, it does not stand in the Debtor's shoes as an unpaid PACA trust beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Produce Pay never sold or supplied produce. Nor did it purchase receivables, including the Debtor's rights as an unpaid PACA trust beneficiary. No matter how creative the Agreement may be, it constitutes a financing arrangement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Classic Harvest LLC v.

(Hr'g Tr. 7-8).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    In light of its conclusion, the court need not address whether Section 3.2 of the Agreement and the definition of \"Distributed Asset Pool\" are temporally incompatible or at least give rise to an ambiguity in the Agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Produce Pay's arguments in this regard are fluid. In its reply brief, Produce Pay argues that when it purchased a Distributed Asset Pool, it purchased \"the right to all related proceeds and receivables therefrom, therefore extinguishing the Debtor's PACA trust rights in and to such [p]roduce.\" [Dkt. No. 385]. Such an argument is contrary to Mr. Dusastre's testimony in his declaration.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Produce Pay has not suggested that the Debtor assigned its contracts with its customers to Produce Pay pursuant to U.C.C. \u00a7 2-210, and the Agreement likewise creates no such inference. Produce Pay's arguments revolve around produce and all derivatives thereof, not contracts. None of the parties has suggested that PACA trust rights may be inalienable or unenforceable. The court will therefore not consider those issues.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Article 9 of the U.C.C. as adopted by the State of Delaware, Del. Code tit. 6, \u00a7 9-101\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    applies. None of the parties have addressed whether the receivables constitute \"accounts\" or \"payment intangibles\" under Article 9.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    U.C.C. \u00a7 9-102(a)(2)\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    U.C.C. \u00a7 9-102(a)(61). The court declines to speculate on this technical issue without more from the parties. Regardless, any decision on this issue would not change the court's conclusion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The court is unaware of any circuit courts of appeal that apply a different test when considering whether a transaction is a true sale or financing arrangement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    To rebut this contention, Mr. Dusastre testified that Produce Pay maintained a foodborne illness insurance policy. (Hr'g Tr. 48:20-22, 59:16-23, 102:3-13). Produce Pay had no obligation whatsoever under the Agreement to obtain its own insurance policy. The Debtor, however, was required not only to procure its own policy naming Produce Pay as an additional payee, but also to indemnify Produce Pay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The court reaches no conclusion regarding attachment and perfection of Produce Pay's security interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
