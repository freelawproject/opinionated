Lynch (\"Appellant\" or \"Lynch\"),\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , brings this appeal from the order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York Approving and Confirming the Combined First Amended Plan of Reorganization of Debtor Kirwan Offices S.\u00e0.r.l. (\"Debtor\" or \"Kirwan\"). The reorganization plan was proposed by Appellees Lapidem Ltd. (\"Lapidem\") and Mascini Holdings Limited (\"Mascini,\" and together with Lapidem, the \"Appellees\"), unsecured creditors of Kirwan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Bankruptcy Court's order is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Overview of the Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lynch brings this appeal against his co-investors in an investment scheme, Lapidem, a Cayman Islands company, and Mascini, a Cyprus Company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (16-22321\n   Dkt. No. 62 \u00b6\u00b6 3-6.) Lynch is a U.S. citizen who has lived in Russia since 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Through intermediate companies, Lapidem and Mascini are currently majority-owned and effectively controlled by VR Global Partners, LP, an investment fund domiciled in the Cayman Islands, and VR Capital Group Ltd., a Cayman Islands asset management company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant and Appellees constitute the exclusive shareholders in Kirwan, a Luxembourg entity that was established as a special investment vehicle in February 2007 for the purpose of participating in the auction, and ultimate acquisition, of Yukos Finance B.V. (\"Yukos Finance\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 7.) Yukos Finance was a subsidiary of Yukos Oil Company (\"Yukos Oil\"), which was the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition in Russia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) In connection with that bankruptcy, a Russian court-appointed bankruptcy receiver noticed an auction for 100% of the shares in Yukos Finance for August 15, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Seeking to win that auction, Lapidem and Mascini agreed to fund the acquisition in the form of debt financing so as to avoid a 1% Luxembourg capital tax. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) They structured their investment as 85% interest bearing debt, 14% interest free debt, and 1% equity. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 62 Ex. 25.1 at 15.) Lynch, in turn, supplied the mechanism for effecting the acquisition - OOO Monte-Valle (\"Monte-Valle\"), a company that he controlled, acquired 000 Promneftstroy (\"PNS\"), a Russian investment vehicle that had registered for the auction of Yukos Finance prior to the registration deadline and paid the required $60 million deposit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 15, 2007, PNS won the auction for 100% of the shares of Yukos Finance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) The winning bid was approximately $309 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 30, 2007, Lynch, Kirwan, Lapidem, and Mascini formally established their legal relationship by entering into a Shareholders Agreement (the \"SHA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25;\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 25.1.) Pursuant to the SHA, Lapidem and Mascini capitalized Kirwan with $2.5 million as share capital and $247.5 million as loans, in consideration for approximately 2.5 million newly issued Class A and B shares in Kirwan, which, together, accounted for 99.99% of Kirwan's outstanding share capital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 25.1 at 8, 45.) Lynch received a single Class C share, constituting the entire share class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 25.1 at 8, 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lynch's Class C share carried with it certain rights. Specifically, the SHA provided that certain matters required unanimous shareholder approval, including decisions about liquidation, receivership, administration, or \"any capital reorganization or other corporate action the effect of which would be to alter the rights attaching to the C share\" - thereby giving Lynch tremendous influence over certain corporate actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 25.1 at 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The SHA further provided that Appellee's loans had to be paid in full before they or Lynch could receive any recovery on account of their equity shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 25.1 at 17-18, 44.) Upon full repayment of the loans, Appellees were entitled to 90% of any profits in excess of their loans;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lynch was entitled to the remaining 10%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Yukos Finance Litigation and Events Leading to the Chapter 11 Filing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Shortly after PNS acquired the shares of Yukos Finance, PNS became embroiled in litigation in the Netherlands with certain members of Yukos Oil's former management over control of Yukos Finance. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 13 \u00b6\u00b6 15-23.) This litigation involved,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the validity of certain claims and asserted attachments over the Yukos Finance shares that, if recognized, would render PNS' claims to the shares worthless. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23-25.) Because of the protracted Yukos litigation, Kirwan has not obtained clear title to the assets acquired in the auction, preventing it from generating a return on its investment and paying a return to its shareholders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Lapidem and Mascini - as the sole sources of capital since Kirwan's inception - have financed the Yukos Finance litigation exclusively, loaning Kirwan an additional $32 million to cover litigation costs (on top of the $309 million they provided in acquisition loans). (16-22321 Dkt. No. 62 \u00b6 36.) In light of these costs and litigation setbacks, Lapidem and Mascini sought to settle the case. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 13 \u00b6 25.) Lynch, however, resisted the proposed settlement terms offered by Appellees, and stated that he would only agree to a settlement that netted him $35 million in his capacity as a Class C shareholder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Over the ensuing two years, as the parties disagreed over settlement, they further disagreed over the scope of Lynch's rights as a Class C shareholder. Lynch maintained that, under the SHA, no settlement in the Yukos Finance litigation could be achieved without his approval - a position that Appellees flatly reject. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30-35.) Exercising that purported right, Lynch conveyed directly to his adversary in the Yukos Finance Litigation that his adversary could not explore settlement without Lynch's consent. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 21 \u00b6 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Lynch alleges that, after repeated failed efforts by Appellees to wrest control of PNS' corporate governance in an attempt to void his rights as a Class C shareholder, Lapidem and Mascini contrived a bankruptcy \"scheme\" and \"manufactured US jurisdiction\" for the purpose of bringing about a corporate reorganization of Kirwan. (Dkt. No. 12 at 17.) Specifically, Lynch argues that Mascini and Lapidem engaged two U.S. law firms, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP (\"Akin Gump\") and Mandel Bhandari LLP (\"Mandel Bhandari\"), pursuant to which Kirwan paid retainers of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively, for the sole purpose of draining Kirwan's funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19 (citing 16-22321 Dkt. No. 62 \u00b6\u00b6 65, 77).) Lapidem and Mascini counter that these were legitimate and proper expenditures in connection with their continued efforts to assert legal title to the shares in Yukos Finance. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 13 \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By March 15, 2016, Kirwan owed Akin Gump $174,530.26 in legal fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) Mascini and Lapidem determined that this constituted an insolvency event and, in accordance with the parties' loan agreements, called their loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Kirwan (naturally) could not pay off those loans, prompting Lapidem and Mascini to file that same day an involuntary bankruptcy petition, pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, in Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Chapter 11 Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 6, 2016, Lynch - then represented by counsel - filed a motion for intervention and dismissal of the involuntary petition, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Appellees\n   filed the case in bad faith. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 8.) In the alternative, he asked the court to stay or abstain so the parties could arbitrate underlying claims of breach of the SHA, pursuant to an arbitration clause in that agreement, which provided for arbitration in London under the Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The gravamen of Lynch's filing was that Lapidem and Mascini breached the SHA in calling their loans due, filing the involuntary petition, and pursuing a Chapter 11 plan that would restructure Kirwan's governance structure and settle the Yukos Finance litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court presided over two separate hearings to consider the various issues posed by Lynch. Following a June 17, 2016 hearing, the Bankruptcy Court denied Lynch's request to abstain or stay the case so as to permit him to pursue arbitration in London, concluding that doing so would improperly interfere with the resolution of matters that were subject to the Court's core, subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (16-22321 Dkt. No. 43.) Lynch appealed this determination, but voluntarily dismissed his appeal shortly thereafter. (16 Civ. 6300 Dkt. No. 18-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At a second hearing on January 27, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court denied all remaining aspects of Lynch's motion, concluding that (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ) the Appellees did not file the case in bad faith, (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     ii\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ) Lynch failed to establish that Appellees breached the SHA, and (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     iii\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ) the SHA did not prevent the Appellees from pursuing a corporate reorganization of Kirwan in their capacity as creditors. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 174 at 98:17-101:2.) Lynch did not appeal this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On February 15, 2017, Appellees filed a proposed plan of reorganization for Kirwan that provided for reorganized capital and governance structures and termination of the SHA, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201123\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(l). (16-22321 Dkt. No. 97.) They also filed a motion to establish streamlined plan confirmation procedures. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 98.) Appellees served that motion on Appellant's counsel. The notice specified that appellees were seeking expedited consideration of the proposed plan of reorganization and advised that a telephonic hearing on that issue was scheduled for February 27, 2017. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 102.) Shortly after service of the motion, Lynch fired his lawyers; since then, he has proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Lynch, who conceded in subsequent Bankruptcy Court filings that he had knowledge of Appellee's filings (16-22321 Dkt. No. 148 \u00b6 19), elected not to participate in either the telephonic hearing considering Appellee's motion for streamlined procedures (16-22321 Dkt. Nos. 118, 192) or a hearing on the proposed plan of reorganization. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 145.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following a March 20, 2017 hearing on the proposed plan of reorganization, the Bankruptcy Court found that Lynch had been properly served with notice of the hearing, (16-22321 Dkt. No. 131 \u00b6\u00b6 E-F), determined that the SHA had terminated by its terms, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 N(ix) ), and confirmed the plan of reorganization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plan of reorganization as confirmed restructured Kirwan's governance structure by vesting control of the company exclusively in Lapidem and Mascini, eliminating the potential for continued governance stalemate. The plan contains exculpation and injunction clauses that enjoin any person, including Lynch, from trying to sue Appellees in any other forum on account of the events arising from Kirwan's bankruptcy proceeding and reorganization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 22-25.) Those provisions were specifically reviewed, addressed, and - with one minor amendment - approved by the Bankruptcy Court, which determined that they were appropriate under the circumstances and necessary to providing \"the protection that one should get from acting in good faith ... in a bankruptcy case, or [for] the actions that lead up to that bankruptcy case\" - as the Bankruptcy Court had found the Appellees did in connection with the proceedings before it. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 145 at 23:11-16.) The Bankruptcy Court further determined that Lynch's \"opposition to any reasonable restructuring ... scurried, if not crossed the line, over into bad faith.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   32:9-17.) \"It is in that context ... that I am prepared to approve the exculpation and injunction provisions of the plan.... [S]uch provisions are here, narrowly tailored, to reflect legitimate concerns that those who acted in good faith with respect to the commencement, prosecution, and culmination of this bankruptcy case, and the debtor itself, not be subject to back-door attacks and collateral litigation for their activities related to those things.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:18-33:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Lynch filed a motion for relief on April 4, 2017, seeking relief from the confirmation order, a new trial, or alteration or amendment of the confirmation order. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 148.) The court denied that motion following a hearing thereon. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 165.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

A closer look at his conduct is revealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Following Appellees' service of their motion to approve streamlined procedures regarding their proposed plan of reorganization of Kirwan - but prior to the February 27, 2017 telephonic hearing thereon - Lynch fired his restructuring counsel, upon whom service had been made. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 104.) As a courtesy, Appellees emailed both Lynch and Lynch's English-law counsel, who had represented Lynch in other Kirwan-related matters, instructions for dialing into the telephonic hearing. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 189 Ex. B). After the telephonic hearing, at which Lynch did not appear, Appellees again emailed Lynch and his English-law counsel a notice stating that the Bankruptcy Court approved Appellees' motion for streamlined procedures and, to that end, that it set a confirmation hearing on the proposed plan of reorganization for March 20, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. F.) The email did not bounce back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Immediately following the telephonic hearing, Appellees again emailed Lynch and his English-law counsel a draft proposed plan procedures order. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 164 Ex. 1 at 3.) Before the Bankruptcy Court had an opportunity to enter the order, Lynch responded to Appellees' message using the same email listed on the Jenner &amp; Block motion to withdraw, notifying them that he would be disabling his email account later that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7.) Appellees, who regarded Lynch's message as an \"improper attempt to evade service in defiance of the [the Bankruptcy Court's] order,\" immediately forwarded the email exchange to the Bankruptcy Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 at 2.) Within the hour, the Bankruptcy Court signed and entered an order expressly authorizing email service. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 109 \u00b6 2.) (\"All documents which may be required to be served on Stephen P. Lynch in the above-captioned case ... may be served by email to [Lynch's email address] .... Service by email shall be deemed sufficient on its own to satisfy Rule 2002 [of] the Federal Rules\n   of Bankruptcy Procedure.\"). Thereafter, Appellees served Lynch via email with notice of the date of the confirmation hearing and of the objection deadline. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 102.) The email did not bounce back. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 189 \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the March 20, 2017 confirmation hearing on the proposed plan of reorganization - which, like the February 27, 2017 telephonic hearing, Lynch did not attend - the Bankruptcy Court made an express finding that service was proper. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 145 at 27:22-28-7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   (16-22321 Dkt. No. 131 \u00b6\u00b6 E-F) (reiterating propriety of notice in confirmation of proposed reorganization plan.).) A day later, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the proposed reorganization plan, instituting the exculpation and injunction provisions that prevent Lynch from litigating Appellees' purported breaches of the SHA. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 131 \u00b6\u00b6 E-F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Two weeks later, Lynch filed a 30-page motion for relief, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 and 60, seeking relief from the exculpation and injunction clauses, so that he could pursue arbitration against Lapidem and Mascini in London. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 148.) Critically, Lynch admits in his moving papers that he deliberately skipped (and so was obviously aware of) the March 20 confirmation hearing because \"the risk of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , both claim and issue-wise, weighted [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] heavily in [favor] of nonparticipation in the confirmation hearing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) He further wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Lynch did not expect the Bankruptcy Court to routinely approve the third party release, exculpation and injunction of his [London] arbitration claims against the [Appellees] and their majority shareholder .... Lynch expected the U.S. Trustee charged with protecting the integrity of the bankruptcy process would object to the extensive third party release, exculpation and injunction for violation of 11 U.S. Code \u00a7 524(e) as being unprecedented, unwarranted and inequitable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At a hearing on his motion for relief, Lynch reiterated his knowing decision to absent himself from the confirmation proceedings, stating, \"To avoid barring those [London arbitration] claims on\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , I was advised by English counsel that I could not further participate in the bankruptcy, and there was really no point since I had no role and no power in the bankruptcy.\" (16-22321 Dkt. No. 170 at at 21:18-21.) The bankruptcy court, in denying Lynch's motion, remarked on Lynch's conduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Lynch has been actively participating in the case when he chose to do so. He was involved early on, but eventually chose, despite being served appropriately, he chose not to participate in the confirmation hearing....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   And here, Mr. Lynch was an active participate at his choosing, and other positions when he chose - at times when he chose not to participate. And that kind of selective participation is a problem....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   So despite sufficient notice of the confirmation proceedings, Mr. Lynch did not participate during those proceedings, and did not raise any of the objections he is now making.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:25-43:4, 43:17-20, 45:9-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The import of this procedural history is clear: Lynch was fully apprised of the bankruptcy proceedings below and chose not to participate, thinking it would preserve his ability to arbitrate his claim that Appellees breached the SHA.

The Bankruptcy Court explicitly found that it could not have performed that core function without including the exculpation and injunction provisions; otherwise, Lynch could collaterally attack the Bankruptcy Court's authority in a non-bankruptcy forum. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 145 at 23:10-16.)

As noted, Lynch claimed that Appellees breached the SHA by declaring an insolvency event and filing an involuntary petition before the Bankruptcy Court. (16-22321 Dkt. Nos. 8, 134.) Those allegations, left unresolved, threatened the vitality of any confirmed reorganization plan. Lynch made no effort to hide his desire to undo the bankruptcy process by pursuing arbitration in London.

Following Lynch's motion for intervention and dismissal, abstention, or stay of the involuntary proceeding - which, again, were predicated on Lynch's underlying third-party claims - the Bankruptcy Court held an extensive hearing, issued a denial and, in so doing, explicitly determined that it had core jurisdiction over that motion. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 43 at 1.) Lynch appealed to the District Court, (16 Civ. 6300 Dkt. No. 1), but, voluntarily dismissed his appeal. (16 Civ. 6300 Dkt. Nos. 18-20.)

P. 9023 and 9024.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court reiterates that Lynch's motion for relief from the exculpation and injunction clauses was not a proper vehicle for challenging those clauses for the first time.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 502. It was also improper for him to use Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 and 60 as a means to re-litigate his motion to dismiss, secure another hearing on the merits, or otherwise take a second bite at the apple on any of the matters previously raised to the Bankruptcy Court - including his assertions that the Appellees filed the involuntary petition in bad faith, that the Appellees breached the SHA, and that the SHA required the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss, stay, or abstain from deciding the case so as to permit the parties to pursue arbitration in London.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terrestar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20197621\">\n    2016 WL 197621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Insofar as Lynch's appeal from the denial of his motion for relief concerns the exculpation and injunction provisions - and it is that particular issue to which Appellant devotes the entirety of his moving papers on appeal - that argument is inextricably bound up with the issues that the Court already has addressed above. Contrary to his assertion on appeal, the Bankruptcy Court was not required to issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, because, as noted, the exculpation and injunction provisions were \"core\" matters within the Bankruptcy Court's subject matter jurisdiction. Nor are the exculpation and injunction provisions inconsistent with the Second Circuit's case law requiring that they be integral to the success of a confirmed reorganization plan, because, as stated a number of times already, they undoubtedly were.\n   <em>\n    Drexel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520790\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/960/285/#p292\">\n    960 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   293 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Quigley., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956224,3755821\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/45/\">\n    676 F.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57 (2d Cir. 2012) (court's authority to address related third-party claims depends upon whether the outcome \"might have any 'conceivably effect' on the bankruptcy estate.\") (internal citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    Metromedia\n   </em>\n   , 416 F.3d at 141 (non-debtor release should be approved where finding that \"truly unusual circumstances render the release terms important to the success of the plan\"). These factors, coupled with the Bankruptcy Court's findings that Lynch consented to the entry of a final order by his deliberate decision not to contest the exculpation and injunction clauses at the appropriate juncture (16-22321 Dkt. No. 170 45:9-12), necessarily mean that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lynch's motion for relief from the inculpation and exculpation injunctions, or, in the alternative, for a new hearing on the same issue.

Clearly, that dispute affects every aspect of the petitioners' ability to not only obtain the relief they would be seeking in the bankruptcy case but also a distribution of any funds if they got that relief which is a fundamental aspect of bankruptcy law,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the resolution and allocation of the debtor's estate among creditors and shareholders.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Six days after the hearing on Appellees' motion to approve streamlined confirmation procedures, Lynch filed an arbitration complaint against Appellees in London, seeking to undercut the bankruptcy proceedings. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 134.) That complaint embodied all of the claims prohibited by the exculpation clause. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 53 (\"[Appellees] demanding early repayment of the loans ..., the filing of the Involuntary petition with the US Bankruptcy Court and of the Reorganization Plan ... represent breaches by [them] of the SHA in many respects and caused damage to [Lynch].\").) Appellees responded by filing before the Bankruptcy Court a motion to compel Lynch to dismiss the arbitration in light of the exculpation and injunction clauses. (16-22321 Dkt. No. 133.) Determining that Lynch's arbitration complaint fell squarely within the injunction against bringing collateral suits, the Bankruptcy Court directed Lynch to dismiss his complaint. He did so without prejudice, preserving his right to re-file his arbitration complaint, pending the outcome of any appeal (such as this one). (16-22321 Dkt.
