In this adversary proceeding, the Plaintiff Daniel M. McDermott, United States Trustee, seeks a judgment denying Defendant French's discharge, based on the \"false oath\" provision in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A) (Count II of Plaintiff's Complaint).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held a bench trial, which was followed by Plaintiff's filing of a complete list of the false oaths the Plaintiff contends Defendant French made. This adversary proceeding is now ready for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has considered all of the evidence and arguments presented by the parties. This includes the testimony of the witnesses - namely, Defendant Thomas French (\"French\"), and Colleen Capalbo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And this includes all of the exhibits that were admitted into evidence - namely, Joint Exhibits 1-20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Opinion states the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court finds for Defendant French, and will enter a judgment dismissing Plaintiff's complaint objecting to French's discharge, with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

To describe the law applicable to Plaintiff's claim, the Court adopts and reiterates what it said in a recent opinion in the cases of\n   <em>\n    McDermott v. Wise and Wise v.

Statements made under penalty of perjury, as many of French's statements were, are considered to be under oath for purposes of \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11187536,11191482\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/679/\">\n    227 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   686 ;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, the Court finds that French's statements listed in the chart below as Item Nos. 1-3, 5, 8, 10-11, 13-14, 16-17, 21, and 24-27 were \"false,\" in that they were incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   With respect to the fifth element, the Court finds that each of the alleged false statements by French \"related materially to the bankruptcy case,\" because each of them clearly \"bears a relationship to the bankrupt's business transactions or estate, or concerns the discovery of assets, business dealings, or the existence and disposition of his property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11187536,11191482\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/679/\">\n    227 F.3d at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This very broad definition of materiality is relatively easy to meet, in part because it literally covers even\n   <em>\n    trivial\n   </em>\n   matters, as long as they relate to the bankruptcy debtor's \"business transactions or estate,\" or the debtor's \"assets,\" or the debtor's \"business dealings, or the existence and disposition of his property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   French disputes the third and fourth elements of Plaintiff's \"false oath\" claim, namely the elements that \"the debtor knew the statement was false;\" and that \"the debtor made the statement with fraudulent intent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11187536,11191482\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/679/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11187536,11191482\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/679/\">\n    at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As indicated in the chart below, with respect to each of the statements that the Court finds to have been false, the Court finds that French did know that the statement was false. What this finding means is that when French made the false statements at issue, he knew the correct (true) facts, even if he may have forgotten them at the time, or simply made an erroneous statement without fraudulent intent. Thus, the Court's finding on this knowledge-of-falsity element does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   establish the fraudulent-intent element as to any of the false statements at issue. That is a separate element, which the Plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Plaintiff's case fails on the element of fraudulent intent. As the chart below indicates, the Court finds, from all the facts and circumstances of this case, that French did not make any of the statements that the Court finds to be false with fraudulent intent. Rather, the Court finds that each of these false statements that French made was: (1) an innocent mistake or inadvertent error on French's part; or (2) concerned a matter that was so trivial, or otherwise of such a nature, that French could not have had any motive or any intention to lie about it; or both (1) and (2). And while the Court finds that French made a number of false (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , incorrect) statements, the Court does not find that French had a reckless disregard for the truth, under the circumstances. From all of this, the Court concludes that French did not make any of the false statements with fraudulent intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds for French, and will enter judgment dismissing the Plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. French will get his bankruptcy discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Court's findings regarding the specific false statements at issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The following chart lists all of the statements under oath made by French that the Plaintiff contends were false oaths under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A).

These are copied from the list filed by the Plaintiff after trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The other columns in the chart list the Court's findings about each alleged false oath; namely, whether the Plaintiff met his burden of proving the statement was false (the \"Proven False\" column); whether French knew the statement was false when he made it (\"Knowledge of Falsity\" column); and whether French made the statement with fraudulent intent (\"Fraudulent Intent Proven?\" column).

Thus, judgment must be for French.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Based on the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the reasons stated in this Opinion, the Court will enter judgment for the Defendant Thomas French and against the Plaintiff United States Trustee on Count II of the Complaint, and will enter a judgment dismissing the Plaintiff's complaint, with prejudice. Entry of such judgment will conclude this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Before trial, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the only other count in his complaint, Count I, with prejudice. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Order Granting Plaintiff's Oral Request to Voluntarily Dismiss Count I of Plaintiff's Complaint (Docket # 19).)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    A transcript of the trial is filed at Docket # 40 in this adversary proceeding, and that transcript is cited in this Opinion using the form \"Tr. at ----.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    In this Opinion, the Court will cite the joint trial exhibits using the form \"JX-----.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    \"Plaintiff's Post-Trial Supplemental List of Proven False Oaths by the Defendant\" (Docket # 41). During closing arguments at trial, the Court directed Plaintiff to file this list, and directed that the list include\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n    statement by French that Plaintiff contends was false and that meets all the other elements to be a \"false oath\" under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A).

For example, the Court finds falsity proven about Item No. 1 based on the findings of falsity made about specific statements in Debtor's schedules that are listed as Item Nos. 5, 24, and 27, and possibly the alternative finding about Item No. 26. Similarly, however, the Court finds fraudulent intent not proven as to Item No. 1 based on the Court's finding that fraudulent intent is not proven with respect to Item Nos. 5, 24, 26, and 27.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The Court finds, among other things, that as of the January 6, 2017 bankruptcy petition date, which is also the date on which French filed his schedules and Statement of Financial Affairs (\"SOFA\"), French had no interests in any incorporated or unincorporated business. Rather, as of that time French had had such interests only in the past, including his interests in the six former businesses disclosed in Schedule A/B # 4 (list of \"FDBA\" businesses) and in SOFA # 27 (JX-1 at pdf pages 2, 82-83). And as also found elsewhere in this chart and the accompanying endnotes, the Court finds that French had no ownership interest in any of the businesses known as American Expo Pros LLC, American Expo Pros, or American Medical Professional (aka AMP).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Court\n    <em>\n     does\n    </em>\n    believe French's testimony, and the testimony of Colleen Capalbo (French's long-time girlfriend at the time of trial), who each testified that French did not and does not have any ownership interest in the business known as American Expo Pros. (Testimony of Thomas French, Tr. at 85-87; 91, 140-42 (cited in this Opinion as \"French, Tr. at ----\"); Testimony of Colleen Capalbo, Tr. at 162-63, 167) (cited in this Opinion as \"Capalbo, Tr. at ----\"). The Court credits this testimony, even though French admits that he \"probably\" told a newspaper reporter in 2016 that he was the \"owner and promoter of American Expo Pros.\" (JX-5, June 10, 2016 article about the Armada Biker Days biker festival; French, Tr. at 89-90). French would have told the reporter this, as part of his effort to sell vendor space for the biker festival and promote the event, he says, \"[b]ecause it sounds better in the paper.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 90). That this was just sales puffery plausibly explains why French would falsely tell a reporter that he was the owner when in fact he was not the owner. Indeed, the same newspaper article shows a picture of French sitting on a motorcycle, with the caption \"Tom French rides his Harley-Davidson motorcycle.\" (JX-5, first page). But it is undisputed that the pictured motorcycle did not belong to French, that French has never owned a Harley, had never been on one in his life, and in fact is \"scared to death of them.\" (French, Tr. at 91).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Court finds that the business known as American Expo Pros was and is a sole proprietorship owned entirely by Ms. Capalbo, and that French worked for that business only as an employee, or as a 1099 independent contractor, selling vendor space for two shows that the business put on in late February and March 2017. The testimony of French and Capalbo about this is corroborated by the documents the Plaintiff obtained from the Roostertail, the venue where the 7th Annual THC Expo occurred, on March 17-19, 2017 (JX-12). This exhibit includes a lease for the event that was signed by Colleen Capalbo, and this exhibit includes copies of 10 checks written to the Roostertail, totaling $16,400.00 and dated over the time period January 14, 2017 to February 7, 2017. All of these checks were drawn on an account in the name of \"COLLEEN CAPALBO DBA AMERICAN EXPO PROS.\" And all of these checks were signed by Colleen Capalbo. (\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    French, Tr. at 120, lines 8-16).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    French earned sales commissions from Capalbo's business, American Expo Pros, totaling roughly $9,000.00 during the 2016-2017 time period. French admitted in his testimony that he did not include American Expo Pros as an employer or source of income, and did not list any income from that source, in his Schedule I. (JX-1 at pdf pages 72-73; French, Tr. at 99-100, 103).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Schedule I disclosed only income of $2,800.00 per month in gross income, in the form of the salary paid to French by another one of Capalbo's sole proprietorship businesses, \"American Medical Professional\" (aka AMP). French testified that he was and is paid a salary from that business of $700.00 per week. French also testified that he earned a total of about $9,000.00 in sales commissions from American Expo Pros, for work he did to promote and sell vendor/exhibitor space for two shows, known as the Gibralter Home Improvement and Garden Show, which occurred on February 24-26 and March 3-5, 2017, and the 7th Annual THC Expo, which occurred on March 17-19, 2017. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    JX-6 through 11; French, Tr. at 112-13). French testified that he was paid a commission in cash by Capalbo as and when he made sales for these shows, in amounts of $150.00 to $300.00 or so at a time, and that he earned the total sum of about $9,000.00 over a several month period, during 2016 to sometime in early 2017. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    French, Tr. at 112-13, 126-27).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The Plaintiff failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that French had a fraudulent intent in failing to disclose his employment with American Expo Pros, and in failing to show any income from that source on his Schedule I. The income was irregular in amount and sporadic, and spread over several months. Under the circumstances, this income was not large enough that French would have had a motive to conceal it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The French testimony cited by the Plaintiff as proving falsity does not actually do so. The referenced power washing job for Dr. Coombs in 2016 was done by French with another person, using the assumed name (dba) of \"Blastaway.\" For this job French was given a check for $3,400.00, dated August 3, 2016, which he cashed. (JX-14, seventh unnumbered page; French, Tr. at 52-55, 61). This was the gross payment received from French's customer for this job, a job which, French testified, resulted in a loss. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    JX-20, eighth page (Declaration Under Penalty of Perjury of French at \u00b6 2, stating that the job for Dr. Coombs \"resulted in a loss of income and lawsuit against me for even further damages\") ). When asked whether he had disclosed that he had \"done a $3,400 job in the year before [he] filed for bankruptcy,\" French initially answered \"I guess I didn't.\" (French, Tr. at 63). Then he was asked whether the $3,400 is \"part of your income taxes\" for 2016. French answered \"no.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 64). But then French immediately corrected his answers about this $3,400.00, by stating \"And you know what? Maybe I'm giving the wrong answer. I don't remember how much. I don't remember every detail.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 64.) The Court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden of proving that French's $3,400 in gross income from the job for Dr. Coombs is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    included in the $34,000.00 in gross income that French disclosed in SOFA # 4 (JX-1 at pdf page 77).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The Court\n    <em>\n     does\n    </em>\n    believe French's testimony, and the testimony of Colleen Capalbo, both of whom testified that Ms. Capalbo's businesses, which are not corporations, (American Expo Pros and American Medical Professionals (aka AMP) ) are separate from French's former businesses. (As to American Expo Pros,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    discussion and record citations in endnote 7 above. As to American Medical Professionals (aka AMP),\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    French, Tr. at 142; Capalbo, Tr. at 159, 161-62, 167-169). In this item No 7, the Plaintiff alleges that French transferred, to Ms. Capalbo, French's right to use a particular toll-free telephone number that he had previously used in his former medical marijuana licensing business (the number was \"877-RX-42099\" according to French, (French, Tr. at 28) ). But the Court credits the testimony of both French and Capalbo, who testified that both French and Capalbo had the right to use this telephone number, and the Court credits the testimony of Capalbo that both of them had been listed for some five years as the customers on the AT &amp; T monthly telephone bill for this phone number. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    French, Tr. at 128-29, 148-49, 155; Capalbo, Tr. at 166). The Plaintiff has failed to prove that French had made any sort of transfer of his rights, held jointly with Capalbo, within the 2 years before French filed bankruptcy, or at any time. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to prove that French's answer to SOFA # 18 was false.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    This failure to disclose Sho Pros, LLC at SOFA # 27 was a false statement, because French had an interest in this LLC during the 4 years before he filed bankruptcy. French formed this LLC on September 24, 2012, and it was formally dissolved on August 5, 2014. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    JX-3; French, Tr. at 74-75).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    French's failure to disclose Sho Pros, L.L.C. at SOFA # 27 clearly was without any fraudulent intent. That LLC was dissolved in August 2014, roughly two and a half years before French filed this bankruptcy case on January 6, 2017. And that LLC did only one show, a hunting and fishing show in Biloxi, Mississippi on September 9, 2013. (French, Tr. at 73-77, 80). The show \"failed\" and made no money. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 81-82). There is no evidence that this dissolved LLC had any assets or value. French clearly had no motive for trying to conceal his former interest in this long-dissolved LLC. And any suspicion that French was trying to conceal this LLC is dispelled by the fact that French\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    disclose this LLC, albeit as \"Showpros LLC,\" in the Schedule B and the Statement of Financial Affairs that he filed on September 11, 2013, in his previous Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, Case No. 13-57074. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket # 1 in Case No. 13-57074, at pdf pages 9, 39; French, Tr. at 76, 154-55).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    This Michigan LLC was formed when its articles of organization were filed on March 2, 2016. Those articles were signed by Robert Capalbo, who is Colleen Capalbo's father, as an \"organizer\" and as the LLC's resident agent. The articles also list French as an \"organizer\" and bear a signature in the name of French. But French denies that it is his signature, and disclaims any involvement with this LLC. (JX-4; French, Tr. at 82, 83, 85). The Plaintiff tried to show that this was in fact French's signature, based on a non-expert handwriting comparison with French's signature on another document (JX-3). But the Court is not persuaded by this non-expert handwriting evidence that French in fact signed JX-4. French's handwritten signature, in JX-3, is simple enough that it could easily be copied by another person; the handwriting for the two signatures is similar, but different in some specific ways pointed out by French's testimony (French, Tr. at 84-85); and French's signature on the back of the Coombs check in JX-14 is rather different from French's purported signature on JX-4, as French pointed out in his testimony (French, Tr. at 84). A conclusion at least equally likely is that Robert Capalbo signed French's name to JX-4. (Neither party called Robert Capalbo as a witness at trial.) Finally, French testified that this LLC, American Expo Pros, LLC, never did any business (French, Tr. at 153-54), and the Plaintiff presented no evidence to the contrary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Blastaway was an assumed name under which French admits that he did two jobs, power-washing homes - one for $450.00 in 2015, and one for Dr. Coombs for the gross price of $3,400.00 in August 2016. (French, Tr. at 42-43, 60-62, 65-66;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    endnote 9 above.) Even though this \"Blastaway\" business only ever did two jobs, it is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    true that it \"never got started\" or that it \"never operated.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    French stopped doing any power-washing work, under the Blastaway name or otherwise, in August 2016, some 4-5 months before filing this bankruptcy case, and according to French, this business never made any money. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    French, Tr. at 42-44). In any event, there is no evidence that this sole-proprietor business had any value as of the bankruptcy petition date. French had no motive to try to conceal it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    AMMP, or American Medical Marijuana Professionals, was an assumed name under which French operated his medical marijuana licensing business for several years, until he lost the business, over the time period of August or September 2015 to December 1, 2015, the date on which French was first incarcerated. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    French, Tr. at 21, 38, 127-28; SOFA # 27, JX-1 at pdf page 82). French used the telephone number discussed in endnote 10 above in operating this business. French's right to use this telephone number, which he held jointly with Colleen Capalbo, may have had some value in his medical marijuana licensing business, and may be considered property and an asset of the business. For this reason, it was not true that when AMMP shut down it had only \"files and a computer.\" It also had the right to use the phone number. And French knew that. But the idea - that a telephone number, or the right to use a particular telephone number, can be a business asset - is a rather subtle point of law, and is something that reasonably did not occur to French, who is an unsophisticated non-lawyer, with \"an eighth-grade education.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    French, Tr. at 76, 157). And the Plaintiff presented no evidence of any reason why French may have had a motive to conceal this telephone number \"asset.\" So the Court finds that the false statement French made about it was not made with fraudulent intent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    This is false only because of French's failure to also disclose Sho Pros, LLC, the LLC dissolved in 2014. But for the reasons discussed in endnote 12 above, the Court finds that this non-disclosure was not done with fraudulent intent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    This statement is too vague to be considered false, under the circumstances discussed in endnotes 9, 14, and 15 above, particularly given that Blastaway did only two small power-washing jobs and then ceased business.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    discussion in endnotes 9, 14, and 15 above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    This statement is false only because of French's failure to disclose Sho Pros, LLC, and that failure was not done with fraudulent intent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    discussion in endnote 17 above. French disclosed all his other pre-petition businesses, including Bestes Lawn and Patio, and American Medical Marijuana Professionals (aka AMMP) in SOFA # 27 (JX-1 at pdf pages 82-83) and in his \u00a7 341 meeting testimony (JX-2 at 9-14).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The correct citation for French's testimony to this effect is JX-2 at\n    <em>\n     16\n    </em>\n    , lines 11-12. The Plaintiff contends that this statement is false because at the time of the \u00a7 341 meeting in this case (March 8, 2017), French was owed sales commissions by Colleen Capalbo's sole-proprietor business, American Expo Pros. But the evidence at trial did not actually prove that fact.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The Plaintiff contends that because Colleen Capalbo used this telephone number from and after December 2015 in her sole-proprietor business, American Medical Professionals (aka AMP), the right to use it must have been transferred to her by French. But the Court cannot draw such a conclusion, because Ms. Capalbo already had shared the right to use that telephone number jointly with French, for several years.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    discussion in endnote 16 above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    discussion in endnotes 6, 7, 10, 13, and 15 above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    This statement is false because French also had some irregular, sporadic income from sales commissions during the period 2016 and early 2017, for work he did for Colleen Capalbo's sole proprietor business, American Expo Pros, on the home improvement show and the annual THC Expo show. But the Court finds that this false statement was not made with fraudulent intent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    discussion in endnote 8 above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    endnote 13 above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    These statements in Schedule F were untrue; Coombs did not have a judgment against French; and the debt arose in 2016, not 2014. But there is no conceivable motive that French could have had for purposely stating these falsehoods; he clearly had nothing to gain by them. These misstatements are trivial, under the circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    As French testified at trial, the THC Expo he was referring to in his Rule 2004 examination testimony was held 8 years before trial, and Sho Pros, LLC was not organized until after that time, in 2012. As French testified at trial, he ran that first THC Expo through an entity called Budget Consumer Shows, an entity that French disclosed in his SOFA # 27, JX-1 at pdf page 83. (French, Tr. at 77-80, 104-05;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    discussion in endnote 11 above). So French admittedly made an incorrect statement in his Rule 2004 examination testimony. But this was simply a trivial mistake by French in his Rule 2004 examination testimony. French had no apparent motive for making this incorrect statement in his Rule 2004 examination testimony, and Plaintiff has not proven that French made this false statement with any fraudulent intent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    discussion in endnotes 7, 8, and 24 above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    discussion in endnotes 10, 16, and 22 above. As the Court noted in endnote 16 above, the idea that a telephone number, or the right to use a particular telephone number, can be an item of property that must be disclosed in Schedule A/B is a rather subtle point of law. And it is something that reasonably did not occur to French, who is an unsophisticated non-lawyer, with \"an eight-grade education.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    French, Tr. at 76, 157). And the Plaintiff presented no evidence of any reason why French may have had a motive to conceal this telephone number \"asset.\" The Court finds that the false statement French made in failing to disclose in his bankruptcy schedules his right to use this telephone number was not made with fraudulent intent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
