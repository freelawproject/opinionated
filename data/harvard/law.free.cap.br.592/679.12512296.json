Michael Halfenger, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2009, defendant Deere &amp; Company sued plaintiff Kathy Schonscheck in state court alleging that she had defaulted on payments due under two purchase-money obligations for farm equipment. Deere sought replevin of its collateral. In 2010, while that action was pending, Schonscheck and her husband filed a petition in this court, commencing a case under chapter 12. Soon thereafter, but before Deere or the state court learned about the Schonschecks' chapter 12 case, the state court entered a default judgment against Schonscheck in favor of Deere. In 2017, after this court had dismissed the Schonschecks' 2010 bankruptcy case (and two more-recent chapter 12 cases), a state court issued a writ of replevin at Deere's request based on the 2010 default judgment. Deere then took possession of the farm equipment securing Schonscheck's debts to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2018, Schonscheck commenced this adversary proceeding alleging that the 2017 writ of replevin is invalid because the state court issued it based on the 2010 default judgment, which was void when entered due to the automatic stay that arose under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) when she and her husband commenced their first chapter 12 case in 2010.

In 2007, Schonscheck executed a \"Loan Contract - Security Agreement\" in favor of Deere that was secured by four pieces of equipment. See CM-ECF Doc.

Schonscheck brought this adversary proceeding on January 19. CM-ECF Doc. No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Schonscheck seeks a declaration that the 2010 state-court judgment entered in favor of Deere, on which Deere relied in requesting the 2017 writ of replevin it then used to seize its collateral, is void because the state court issued it while the automatic stay in her and her husband's 2010 case under chapter 12 was in place. She seeks summary judgment on this claim. Deere argues that this adversary proceeding should be dismissed because, among other reasons, even if the 2010 judgment is void, it had the right to repossess its collateral and there was no stay in effect when it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This court may consider the effect of the automatic stay that arose when the Schonschecks filed their 2010 chapter 12 case on the default judgment the state court entered a few days later. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). As there are no genuine issues\n   of material fact precluding summary judgment on Schonscheck's claim for declaratory relief, the court will consider whether she, or Deere, is entitled to relief on that claim.

P. 7056.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After reviewing the parties' initial summary judgment filings, the court, by order dated August 17, 2018, required Schonscheck to explain-in her reply in support of her summary-judgment motion-why the court should not retroactively annul the stay in the 2010 case to negate any effect it might otherwise have on the judgment Deere obtained in state court or its subsequent collection actions. The order states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The court is considering annulling the automatic stay for cause under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) and granting judgment in favor of Deere &amp; Company based on that annulment.

No. 18, at 2. Schonscheck timely replied, but she did not argue against annulment, much less satisfactorily explain why the court should not annul the automatic stay, as proposed. See CM-ECF Doc. No. 21. Because Schonscheck failed to comply with the court's order, the court annuls the 2010 case's \u00a7 362(a) stay as to Deere; all pertinent state-court orders, judgments, and writs; and all property in which Deere claims an interest retroactively to January 20, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court separately concludes that the stay should be annulled for cause, based on the facts and circumstances of this case, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Section 362(d) states that, \"[o]n request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court shall grant relief from the stay provided under [ \u00a7 362(a) ], such as by terminating,\n   <em>\n    annulling\n   </em>\n   , modifying, or conditioning such stay-(1) for cause ....\" \u00a7 362(d)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The word 'annulling' in this provision,\" the Eleventh Circuit has observed, \"contemplates the power of bankruptcy courts to grant relief from the stay which has retroactive effect; otherwise its inclusion, next to 'terminating', would be superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    Albany Partners, Ltd. v.

D. Md. 1990) (\"The effect of annulling the stay is to negate its existence in its entirety.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While bankruptcy courts are judicious in annulling the stay, courts have found cause to do so in circumstances like those presented here. For example, the Fifth Circuit has recognized that the automatic stay should not apply to nullify a foreclosure proceeding commenced by a creditor where \"redundancy and delay\n   would needlessly result\" because applying the automatic stay would have no meaningful effect beyond forcing the creditor \"to conduct another foreclosure proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Mut. Benefit Life Ins. Co. v. Pinetree, Ltd. (In re Pinetree, Ltd.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527769,6501475\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/34/\">\n    876 F.2d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37 (5th Cir. 1989).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [W]here a creditor having no knowledge of a pending bankruptcy forecloses in good faith on the collateral, and where the debtor's interest in that collateral is unenforceable against that creditor, and where the debtor, although notified in advance of the foreclosure, failed to assert its status before the foreclosure, ... the automatic stay should [be] annulled with respect to the post-bankruptcy foreclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527769,6501475\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/34/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The circumstances here similarly justify annulling the stay. Nothing suggests, and Schonscheck does not argue, that either the state court or Deere was aware of the 2010 bankruptcy case before the state court entered judgment for Deere. Moreover, the Schonschecks did not dispute the validity of the state-court judgment based on the automatic stay in their 2010 bankruptcy case or in any of their bankruptcy cases. On June 2, 2017, Kathy Schonscheck moved in the 2009 state-court replevin action to vacate the default judgment Deere obtained in 2010, but \"[t]he court never heard the motion.\" See CM-ECF Doc. No. 22, \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Schonscheck now asks this court to enforce a stay that terminated four years ago when the court dismissed her and her husband's 2010 bankruptcy case. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) &amp; (2)(B). To enforce the stay now to interfere with Deere's current efforts to collect on its collateral, after the Schonschecks have failed three times to complete a chapter 12 case, serves no bankruptcy purpose. Again, there is no suggestion that the state court or Deere knew about the stay when the state court entered the 2010 judgment for Deere. Nor does the record suggest that Deere is somehow not entitled to the relief that the state court has already granted it twice-replevin of its collateral based on the Schonschecks' failure to pay on the debts secured by that collateral. Enforcing the stay against the state court's 2010 judgment would merely force Deere to start over in state court, where already-completed state-court processes would have to be completed again. Such needless repetition serves no purpose but delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This court will not approve Schonscheck's obviously dilatory abuse of \u00a7 362(a). Annulment is warranted.

The court's annulment of the 2010 stay puts an end to this: Deere cannot be held liable for violating a stay that the court has retroactively annulled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, a stay violation is not \"willful\" without at least minimal \"awareness of [the] pending bankruptcy proceeding\".

After February 2017, though, there was no stay in place in any of the Schonschecks' many bankruptcy cases-a point Schonscheck concedes. So anything Deere or the state court did after that date could not have willfully violated \u00a7 362(a).

On August 17, 2018, the court ordered Schonscheck, \"by August 31, 2018\", to \"dispute[ ] any of the facts in Deere['s] ... brief and affidavit\", \"specify which facts are in dispute\", and \"provide material in support of her dispute ... in a form that would be admissible in evidence.\" CM-ECF Doc.
