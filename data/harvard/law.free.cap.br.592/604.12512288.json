(\"Chicago Title\") seeks a determination that the debt owed by Debtor Tatyana Mazik (\"the Debtor\") is nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) and \u00a7 523(a)(6). Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Debtor filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint (\"the Motion\"). The Motion is based primarily on three (3) grounds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) the untimely filing of Chicago Title's Complaint under nonbankruptcy law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) the untimely filing of the Complaint under federal bankruptcy law; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (3) failure to state facts alleging a valid claim against the Debtor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Motion will be granted, and the Complaint dismissed. However, Chicago Title will be granted leave to amend to assert a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to commencing this bankruptcy case, the Debtor filed an earlier case, under chapter 7, on March 28, 2017, docketed at Bky. No. 17-12125 (\"the Prior Case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 30, 2017, Chicago Title filed an adversary proceeding in the Prior Case, alleging that the debt arising from two (2) promissory notes it holds (\"the Notes\") was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2) and (a)(6). (\n   <em>\n    Adv\n   </em>\n   . No. 17-188). The Prior Case was dismissed on August 9, 2017 after the Debtor failed to attend several \u00a7 341 meetings of creditors. As a result, thereafter, the adversary proceeding was also dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Debtor filed the present chapter 13 bankruptcy case on January 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 23, 2018, the court issued the Notice of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case (Official Form 309I) (\"the \u00a7 341 Notice\"). The \u00a7 341 Notice set April 4, 2018 as the date for the meeting of creditors and fixed June 3, 2018 as the deadline to file a complaint challenging the dischargeability of a debt under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), \u00a7 523(a)(4) and \u00a7 1328(f).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the Complaint, Chicago Title alleges that the Debtor's husband, Yuriy Mazik (\"Mr. Mazik\"), brokered the purchase of a property at 102 Horseshoe Lane, North Wales, Pennsylvania (the \"First Property\"). Mr. Mazik initially told the purchasers - the Shapiros - that he was a licensed real estate agent. However, on the closing date, Mr. Mazik revealed that in fact he was not licensed either to broker the sale or to obtain a mortgage on behalf of the Shapiros. Therefore, the sale of the First Property to the Shapiros was not completed as planned. Rather, the First Property was purchased by the Debtor, who took out a mortgage on the property, financed in part by the Shapiro's $40,000 deposit. In an odd arrangement, the Shapiros lived in the First Property and paid the Debtor's mortgage until, in 2008, the Shapiros were able to obtain their own mortgage; at that time, the Shapiros purchased the First Property from the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Debtor's mortgage financing was provided by America's Wholesale Lender (\"America's Wholesale\"). The Debtor signed a note (\"the Horseshoe Lane Note\") and mortgage for $391,400.00. Chicago Title insured America's Wholesale in this lending transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Chicago Title alleges that due to the fraud and collusion of Mr. Mazik, the Debtor, and the settlement agent, America's Wholesale's mortgage on the First Property was not recorded. Because the America's Wholesale mortgage was unrecorded, its loan was not paid off at closing when the Shapiros purchased the First Property from the Debtor. Instead, the proceeds were received by the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In 2005, the Debtor and Mr. Mazik purchased another property located at 1477 Rockwell Road, Abington, Pennsylvania (\"the Second Property\"). The Debtor and Mr. Mazik financed this purchase with another mortgage from America's Wholesale, and the Debtor signed the associated $216,000.00 note (\"the Rockwell Road Note\") (collectively with the Horseshoe Lane Note, \"the Notes\"). Chicago Title also insured America's Wholesale in the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Again, Chicago Title alleges that the Debtor, her husband, and their settlement agent colluded to insure that the Rockwell Road mortgage was not recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In 2006, the Debtor and Mr. Mazik sold the Second Property. The unrecorded mortgage was not paid off at closing and the Debtor and Mr. Mazik received the\n   loan proceeds. They continued to make monthly payments on the Rockwell Road Note until 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The mortgages and their associated Notes were sold to Bank of America, which later discovered that the mortgages were unrecorded and had been primed by the properly-recorded mortgages of the subsequent purchasers. Bank of America tendered a title insurance claim to Chicago Title, which accepted coverage in 2015. Chicago Title paid the amount of the Notes to Bank of America, and Bank of America assigned the Notes to Chicago Title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Both Notes are in default and have been for some time. Both have been rendered unsecured by the failure to record the mortgages. With fees, costs and interest added to the unpaid principal, the Debtor owes more than $1 million on the Notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    V. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Debtor makes three (3) arguments in support of dismissal of the Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   1. The underlying claim against the Debtor is unenforceable because the statute of limitations under applicable nonbankruptcy law expired prior to the commencement of this bankruptcy case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   2. The Complaint is untimely under the rules of this court,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   3.

On May 21, 2018, the Debtor's co-defendants in the district court case filed a suggestion of bankruptcy.

In\n    <em>\n     August\n    </em>\n    , the debtor asserted that the underlying debt (a gambling debt incurred at a New Jersey casino) was unenforceable as a matter of public policy and statute in Pennsylvania. In other words, the debtor's argument in\n    <em>\n     August\n    </em>\n    was that the claim itself was not cognizable under applicable nonbankruptcy law -- in effect, that the claim simply did not exist. The statute of limitations defense raised by the Debtor in this adversary proceeding arguably differs in that it does not go to the inherent legitimacy of the debt memorialized by the Notes. The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that is waivable and the expiration of the limitations deadline does not extinguish the creditor's claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Keeler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783450\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/440/354/#p364\">\n     440 B.R. 354\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 364-65 (Bankr.
