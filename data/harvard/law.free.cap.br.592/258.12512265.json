INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court is the Chapter 7 Trustee's Objection to the Debtor's Claim of Exemptions (\"Objection\", ECF No. 475). Therein, the Chapter 7 Trustee, Ronald Chorches (\"Trustee\") objects to the claimed exemption of funds by the Debtor, Jie \"George\" Xiao (\"Mr. Xiao\" or \"Debtor\") in the LXEng, LLC (\"LXEng\") Pension Plan (\"Plan\") valued in the amount of $414,533.40. While initially claimed as an exemption under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(10),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court tried this case based upon the Debtor's belated amendment of the exemption\n   (ECF No. 458) pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(12). The gravamen of this matter concerns the Bankruptcy Code's exemption for certain tax-exempt retirement funds. For the reasons stated herein, the Objection is SUSTAINED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 30, 2013 (\"Petition Date\"), the Debtor commenced this proceeding by filing a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtor claimed an ownership interest in all of the assets of the Plan on his Amended Schedule B (ECF No. 27), having a value of $412,533.40 as of the Petition Date, and disclosed a 100% interest in LXEng on his Amended Schedule B, having a value of $0.00. The Debtor claimed an exemption in all of the assets of the Plan pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(l0)(E). The Debtor's Schedules reveal that he also claimed exemptions in other assets, including four different pension plans, which have gone unchallenged. The Debtor's Schedules further reveal nearly $1 million in general unsecured debt, plus disputed and unliquidated litigation claims by Dow Corning Corp. and its affiliate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 20, 2014, the Trustee filed the Objection to the Plan exemption (ECF No. 271). After no response from the Debtor for almost two years, on July 29, 2016, the Trustee filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on the Objection (ECF No. 393). On September 29, 2016, the Debtor filed a Response, an Opposition Brief, an Affidavit in Opposition, a Local Rule 56(a)(2) Statement, and a Response to the Trustee's Objection to the Debtor's exemption (ECF Nos. 397, 398, 399, 400, 401). The Court issued a scheduling order setting deadlines for discovery to be completed within sixty days and directing the Debtor to file monthly reports on the Plan (ECF No. 410).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 15, 2016, the Trustee filed a Motion for a Stand-Still Order Regarding the Plan Assets (ECF No. 413), to which the Debtor objected (ECF No. 415). The Court issued a Memorandum of Decision granting the Trustee's Motion for Stand-Still Order on December 1, 2016 (ECF No. 423). On December 13, 2016, the Debtor requested an extension of time to complete discovery and submit an expert report (ECF No. 427). The Court granted his request, and set further deadlines for discovery (ECF No. 440).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 27, 2017, the Debtor filed a Supplemental Document in Opposition to the Trustee's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 445), accompanied by an amended Local Rule 52(a)(2) Statement (ECF No. 447) and a Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Trustee's Motion for Summary Judgment written by the Debtor's expert (ECF No. 446). On March 20, 2017, the Debtor amended his Schedule C to change the Plan's exemption from a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(10) to one under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(12) (ECF No. 458), to which the Trustee later objected (ECF No. 475). The Trustee also filed a Reply to the Debtor's Opposition to Summary Judgment (ECF No. 459) on March 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 25, 2017, the Court denied the Trustee's Summary Judgment Motion (ECF No. 510), finding a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the Debtor was materially responsible for the Plan's noncompliance, and reserving judgment on whether there were additional facts in genuine dispute. The parties subsequently submitted a joint pre-trial order (ECF No. 516) on June 27, 2017 to advance the case to trial based upon the amended exception claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 12 and 13, 2017, the Court held a two-day trial on the Objection. During the course of the trial, the\n   Court heard testimony from the Trustee, his expert, John V. Galiette, Esq. (\"Mr. Galiette\"), Michael F. Ostuni (\"Mr. Ostuni\"), and Mr. Xiao. In rebuttal, the Debtor advanced his own testimony and that of his expert Andrew J. Fair, Esq. (\"Mr. Fair\"), and Mr. Ostuni.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although the contest was vigorous, few of the facts advanced by the Trustee at trial were successfully rebutted. Notably, Mr. Xiao's testimony was generally repetitive, self-serving, and unconvincing. Thematically, he professed ignorance of the nature and consequence of the professional advice he garnered to assist his company LXEng in the formation and administration of the Plan, and professed his abdication of material decisions to advisors. His protestations of reliance upon the advisors notwithstanding, his credibility was strained, and his testimony was conclusory, evasive and seemingly rehearsed. His recollection of certain events also appeared to this Court to be selective in favor of those that served his interests. The effect and calculus achieved by the decisions and modifications made to the Plan were, according to Mr. Xiao's advisors, at his behest and at all times manifestly served to exclusively benefit Mr. Xiao and his then wife, Xin Chen (\"Ms. Chen\"). In the end, his tortured, incomplete, and contrived navigation of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   compliance requirements for the Plan in order to support his claimed exemption under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(12) fails for the reasons articulated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III. JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and derives its authority to hear and determine this matter on reference from the District Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b)(1).

Mr. Fair conceded that once changes are made to a plan, such as the discretionary amendments LXEng made here, the plan is no longer protected by such determination letters. Tr. 2, 2:41. Accordingly, there is no presumption that the Plan is exempt under Section 522(b)(4)(A), and Debtor's contentions to the contrary are misleading and without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   C. The Plan is Not in Substantial Compliance with the IRC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Under Section 522(b)(4)(B), if there is no effective determination concerning the plan, the debtor must show, as one alternative, that no contrary ruling was made by the IRS or a court, and that the plan was in substantial compliance with the requirements of the IRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Here, there was no prior determination to the contrary made by a court or the IRS. The evidence presented at trial, however, overwhelmingly supports that the Plan was not in substantial compliance with the IRC. The evidence showed that\n   the Plan fatally deviated from a number of IRC requirements: (1) that it be a permanent plan; (2) the minimum participation requirements under IRC Section 401(a)(26) and related regulations; (3) the exclusive benefit requirements and nondiscrimination requirements under IRC \u00a7\u00a7 401 (a)(2) and (a)(4), respectively; and (4) the requirement that the Plan be operated in accordance with its terms. Tr. 1, 2:27-49, 3:26-28; Tr. 2, 2:07; Exs. T1, T9, T32, T33. The cumulative effect of these deviations convinces this Court that the Plan was not in substantial compliance with the IRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Plan Violated the Permanency Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As a condition for its qualification, a plan must be established with the goal of being a permanent, rather than a temporary, program. Therefore, although an employer may reserve the right to amend or terminate a plan, the abandonment of a plan for any reason other than business necessity within a few years after it has taken effect will be evidence that the plan, from its inception, was not a bona fide program for the exclusive benefit of employees in general.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.401\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -l(b)(2). As Mr. Galiette testified, the violation of the permanency requirement is determined by a facts and circumstances test, and valid business reasons justifying the termination of a plan within ten years include adverse business conditions, the liquidation of an employer, or the dissolution of an employer. Tr. 2, 2:45-2:46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In weighing the totality of the facts and circumstances in this case, as well as Mr. Xiao's lack of credibility, the weight of the evidence shows that the Plan was not established with the goal of being a permanent plan for the benefit of employees. Mr. Galiette credibly testified that based on his expert opinion, the Plan was terminated only shortly after it was initiated, at a time when only the owners of LXEng were participants and beneficiaries, while the Plan was fully funded, and when the Plan sponsor faced no adverse business conditions. Tr. 1, 2:01-03; Tr. 1, 2:26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Mr. Fair, the Debtor's expert, unconvincingly testified that the Plan was terminated because LXEng faced prospective adverse business conditions. In delivering his expert opinion, however, it became clear that Mr. Fair relied exclusively on the deposition testimony of Mr. Xiao and Mr. Ostuni in opining that a valid business reason existed to terminate the Plan. Tr. 2, 2:46-47. He neither reviewed LXEng's tax returns for the years 2007-2010, nor was he aware that in 2010, LXEng recognized revenue in excess of $4 million, and had received a payment of $6 million from one of its contracts. Tr. 2, 2:48-50. He was also unaware of the fact that in the same year, LXEng still had a $3 million receivable and access to a $2.9 million legal reserve fund. Tr. 2, 2:50-51. Accordingly, the Court gives little weight to the uninformed opinion of Mr. Fair in his assessment of this issue. This Court also finds that, given the Debtor's income at the time the Plan was terminated, it was not facing adverse business conditions. The Debtor provided no other explanation for why the Plan could justifiably be terminated. As Mr. Galiette testified, violation of the permanency requirement would, by itself, be enough to disqualify the Plan under the IRC. Tr. 1, 2:26. Accordingly, this Court finds that, based on the totality of the facts and circumstances in this case, the Plan violated the permanency requirement of the IRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Plan Violated the Minimum Participation Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   IRC Section 401(a)(26) provides that in order for a trust to constitute a qualified trust, the trust must be part of a plan\n   which, on each day of the plan year, benefits the lesser of (1) fifty employees of the employer; or (2) the greater of 40% of the employees of the employer or two employees (or if there is only one employee, such employee).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.401\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(26)-2(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Here, this Court finds that the Plan also violated the minimum participation requirement. As is evidenced by the Employee Census, the Plan did not benefit at least fifty employees, or the greater of 40% or two employees of LXEng, at any point during its existence. Ex. T9. Mr. Galiette testified that as of January 1, 2010, six employees would have satisfied the Plan eligibility requirements, meaning that there should have been at least three employees benefiting under the Plan. Tr. 1, 2:27-32. The only two employees benefiting under the Plan, however, were Mr. Xiao and Ms. Chen. Similarly, in 2011, ten employees would have been eligible to participate, meaning that at least four were required to benefit under the Plan. The only employees who benefited under the Plan in 2011 were Mr. Xiao and Ms. Chen. This testimony was not rebutted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Furthermore, the trial testimony established that none of the exceptions to the minimum participation rule apply in this case because: (1) the Plan benefited highly compensated employees; (2) the Plan was not a collectively bargained multiemployer plan; (3) the Plan was not a frozen underfunded plan subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (hereinafter \"ERISA\"); (4) the Plan was \"top-heavy\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (5) the Plan was not a 401(k) plan maintained by a governmental or tax-exempt entity; (6) and the Plan was not acquired by a second company through a merger or acquisition. Tr. 1, 2:33-36. Therefore, this Court finds that the Plan violated the minimum participation rule which, alone-according to both parties' experts-would be enough to disqualify the Plan. Tr. 1, 2:38; Tr. 2, 2:07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The Plan Violated the Nondiscrimination and Exclusive Benefit Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   IRC Section 401(a)(4) prohibits a plan from discriminating in favor of a subset of highly compensated employees by providing that a plan will be qualified only \"if the contributions or benefits provided under the plan do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.401\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). The Department of Treasury Regulation provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   If the plan is so designed as to amount to a subterfuge for the distribution of profits to shareholders, it will not qualify as a plan for the exclusive benefit of employees.... [A] plan is not for the exclusive benefit of employees in general if, by any device whatever, it discriminates either in eligibility requirements, contributions or benefits in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders ... or the highly compensated employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.401-1\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.401-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).

Mr. Galiette credibly testified that the adoption of the 2009 Amendment and 2010 Amendment and the timing of the termination of the Plan collectively excluded from participation or the accrual of benefits any employees of LXEng other than Mr. Xiao and Ms. Chen, who were highly compensated employees. First, Mr. Xiao increased the eligibility period in 2009 to exclude employees whom he had hired in or after 2008 and accelerated his and Ms. Chen's vesting of the accrued benefits to 100%. Next, Mr. Xiao froze the Plan to new participants, effective as of January 1, 2010, on the eve of when several of LXEng's employees would have become eligible to participate in the Plan under the two-year eligibility period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Additionally, the timing of the $38,849.00 payment into the Plan supports the inference that the Plan was only ever intended to benefit Mr. Xiao and Ms. Chen. Mr. Xiao had no obligation to deposit this amount into the Plan since the minimum funding had already been met for the calendar year 2009. The effect was to segregate funds for the sole benefit of Mr. Xiao and Ms. Chen, while freezing out all other employees. Tr. 1, 3:26-28. As Mr. Galiette testified, violation of either the anti-discrimination requirement or exclusive benefit rules would, alone, be enough to disqualify the Plan under the IRC. Tr. 1, 2:43. Accordingly, this Court finds that the Plan violated the anti-discrimination and exclusive benefit requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. The Plan Was Not Operated in Accordance With its Terms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In order to be qualified, a plan must be operated in accordance with a definite written program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.401-1\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.401-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The failure to operate a plan in accordance with its terms constitutes an operational defect that adversely affects the qualification of the plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rev. Proc. 2013-12, \u00a7 5.01(2)(b) (definition of Operational Failure).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Mr. Galiette testified that the Plan was not operating in accordance with its terms because it purchased life insurance policies. Tr. 1, 2:43-45; T1, at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 33. Mr. Fair, however, sufficiently rebutted that testimony by his opinion that the mere purchase of a life insurance policy, which is akin to making an investment, is not a disqualifying act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Mr. Galiette also testified, however, that according to the Plan, no prior service with another company was to be recognized in the calculation of benefits. Despite that provision, the Plan credited Mr. Xiao and Ms. Chen's alleged service with Keystone in order to qualify them for benefits under the Plan. In Mr. Galiette's opinion, the Plan should not have recognized either Mr. Xiao's or Ms. Chen's pre-participation service with Keystone because no merger occurred between LXEng and Keystone, nor were LXEng and Keystone engaged in the same line of work. Tr. 1, 2:46-48. When asked about Keystone's relationship to LXEng, Keystone's business operations generally, and about Ms. Chen's involvement with Keystone, Mr. Xiao's responses were oblique and evasive, and this Court accords such testimony little to no weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Mr. Galiette's testimony was competent, credible, and not sufficiently rebutted by Mr. Fair or Mr. Xiao. Accordingly, this Court concludes that the Plan was not operated in accordance with its terms, which by itself, as Mr. Galiette credibly testified, would be enough to disqualify the Plan under the IRC. Tr. 1, 2:48-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   D. The Debtor is Materially Responsible for the Plan's Substantial Compliance Failure\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Having found that the Plan is not in compliance with the IRC, the Court turns to the final prong of this inquiry. Section 522(b)(4)(B)(ii)(II) provides that even if a plan is not in substantial compliance, Mr. Xiao's interest in the funds may still be exempt if he demonstrates that he is not materially responsible for that failure. Mr. Xiao bears the burden of proof to show that he was not materially responsible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sharkey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186100\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/563/655/#p666\">\n    563 B.R. 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 666 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Mr. Xiao has not met his burden to show that he was not materially responsible for the Plan's substantial non-compliance with IRC Section 401. Not only has Mr. Xiao failed to present any credible evidence that he was not materially responsible for the qualification failures, but the overwhelming evidence shows that he was singularly responsible for such failures. It is undisputed that, from the Plan's formation to the Petition Date, Mr. Xiao was in sole control of LXEng, which he described as a \"one man company.\" Tr. 2, 0:12-13. Since the time of Mr. Little's death, Mr. Xiao admitted that he was the CEO, COO, and managing member of LXEng. LXEng was the Plan Administrator. In addition, it was undisputed that Mr. Xiao was also the co-trustee of the Plan with Ms. Chen and signed each and every document creating, amending, and terminating the Plan as the principal of LXEng and co-trustee of the Plan. As was made patently clear during Mr. Galiette's testimony, \"the Plan Administrator and the Plan sponsor are ultimately responsible for the Plan's failure to comply with the applicable IRC provisions, ERISA, and its own terms.\" Tr. 1, 3:15-16. This key testimony went unrebutted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Mr. Xiao has instead blamed the Plan's lack of qualification on PenServ, the Plan's third party administrator, and certain other professionals. Such an argument is not supported by the facts of this case. As Mr. Galiette testified, a third-party administrator is a service provider that the Plan Administrator retains to perform specific functions with no discretionary authority, unless it has specifically agreed to undertake fiduciary responsibility, which PenServ did not do in connection with the Plan. Tr. 1, 1:52, 3:19-20. Mr. Ostuni, the president of PenServ, was clear in his testimony that PenServ \"was unable to take any actions regarding the Plan without direction from LXEng as the Administrator, Mr. Xiao as the owner of LXEng, or LXEng's advisors and agents Mr. Cazes and Mr. Caputo.\" Tr. 1, 0:38-39. PenServ had no discretionary authority over the Plan, and could not make amendments, change its terms of participation, change the Plan Administrator or trustees, or terminate it. Only Mr. Xiao, acting through LXEng could do these things. Indeed, Mr. Ostuni testified that PenServ's role was to provide options to LXEng, but it was solely LXEng's decision of which option to choose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 538, at \u00b6 81. He further testified that PenServ, on its own initiative, would never have advised LXEng or any other client to adopt anything similar to the 2009 Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55. That testimony also went unrebutted. Mr. Xiao's own expert clearly indicated, \"a person is not exonerated from material responsibility for his elections and decisions by delegating administration to third parties.\" Tr. 2, 2:30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Regarding the other professionals, namely, Mr. Caputo and Mr. Cazes, there was no evidence that they could have been materially responsible for the Plan's lack of compliance with the IRC. Mr. Cazes is a certified public accountant and Mr. Caputo is a certified financial planner. Although the Debtor conceded that the two were agents of LXEng, he did not present any evidence showing that these individuals had any decision-making power over the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   As Mr. Xiao actively managed, supervised, and decided the affairs of the Plan as employer, manager, and co-trustee, he is materially responsible for its failure to comply with the pertinent sections of the IRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   VI. CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   By all accounts, the Plan failures at issue in this case do not merely constitute technical defaults, but instead are operational failures that \"are substantial violations of the core qualification requirements for a retirement\" plan as set forth in the IRC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IRC Section 401(a)(2). Given the timing of the 2009 and 2010 Amendments, and the subsequent freezing of the Plan, it appears that LXEng operated the Plan in order to solely benefit Mr. Xiao and his then spouse, Ms. Chen. According to the Treasury Regulations, a plan cannot act as a subterfuge for the distribution of profits to the owners of the employer.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.401-1\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.401-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). It appears to have been so here. Ex. T33, at p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Debtor has persistently argued that because the IRC allows for the correction of plan defaults, LXEng could, at any time, make the necessary corrections. Indeed, both experts supported the position that the IRS has correction programs that allow for the remediation or correction of even disqualifying plan errors within a certain time-frame. However, it is clear from the record here that the Debtor failed to take a single corrective measure from the Petition Date to the time of trial, despite ostensibly having the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, as Mr. Galiette testified, the correction of operational failures would presumably require LXEng to pay fines to the IRS and provide benefits to some or all of the Debtor's former employees. Both LXEng and Mr. Xiao are in the midst of Chapter 7 bankruptcies, and have demonstrated insufficient financial abilities to fund any corrections to which they might otherwise have had access. The corrective action arguments are impracticable, futile, and unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Finally, it is well-established law that a debtor's rights in a claimed exemption are established on the petition date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    William J.
