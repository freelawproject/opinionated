Nakagawa, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 5, 2018, a hearing was held on the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   brought by City National Bank (\"CNB\") in the above-captioned adversary proceeding. The appearances of counsel were noted in the record. After arguments were presented, the matter was taken under submission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 17, 2010, a voluntary Chapter 11 petition was filed by Charleston Associates, LLC (\"Debtor\"), in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (\"Delaware Bankruptcy Court\"). (ECF No. 1). Debtor was the owner and developer of a 96-acre shopping center located in Las Vegas, Nevada. The shopping center was developed in three phases, the first two of which were completed. The third phase encompassing approximately 42 acres, was partially completed, leaving approximately 23 acres of land that was largely undeveloped (the \"Undeveloped Land\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 24, 2010, Debtor commenced an adversary proceeding against RA Southeast Land Company, LLC (\"RAS\") and CNB, by filing a \"Complaint for Declaratory Judgment\" in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court. (AECF No. 1). The focal point of this dispute (\"RAS Adversary\") between the Debtor, its previous lender (CNB), and the purchaser from the lender (RAS), is on the rights with respect to the Undeveloped Land. Copies of ten documents, identified as Exhibits \"A\" through \"I,\" were attached to the complaint. Those separately lettered exhibits consisted of the following: (A) a \"Grant of Reciprocal Easements and Declaration of Covenants,\" dated as of January 31, 2001 (\"REA\"); (B) a \"Deed of Trust, Assignment of Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing,\" dated September 24, 2007, in favor of CNB (\"CNB Deed of Trust\"); (C) a \"Settlement Agreement,\" dated July 21, 2009, between the Debtor and CNB (\"Settlement Agreement\"); (D) a \"Trustee's Deed upon Sale,\" recorded August 11, 2009, reflecting CNB's foreclosure of the Undeveloped Land (\"Trustee's Deed\"); (E) an \"Amendment to Grant of Reciprocal Easements and Declaration of Covenants,\" dated September 15, 2009 (\"REA Amendment\") ostensibly recorded by Boca Fashion Village, LLC (\"BFV\") and signed by Martin H. Walrath, IV; (F) a \"re-recorded\" Trustee's Deed Upon Sale, recorded July 21, 2010; (G) a \"Memorandum of Transfer and Acceptance of Declarant's Rights and Assumption of Obligations,\" dated July 26, 2010; (H) an \"Assignment and Assumption Agreement Regarding Declarant Rights,\" dated September 28, 2010, and (I) a letter dated October 29, 2010, transmitting a \"Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions,\" effective November 1, 2010, for the sale of the Undeveloped Land by the Debtor to Quality Real Estate Management, LLC (\"QREM\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 29, 2010, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court entered an order transferring venue of the RAS Adversary to Nevada, where it was assigned Adversary No. 10-01452-LBR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 25, 2011, Debtor filed an amended complaint (\"Complaint\") framed as six \"counts,\" i.e., causes of action or claims for relief. (AECF No. 37). Count I, apparently against both RAS and CNB, seeks a declaration that the Debtor, not RAS, is the Declarant under the REA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count II against both RAS and CNB seeks a declaration that both defendants violated the automatic stay and that sanctions for the violation are appropriate. Count III against only RAS seeks a declaration that RAS separately violated the automatic stay by removing various signs from the Undeveloped Land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count IV against only RAS alleges that RAS intentionally interfered with the Debtor's contractual relationships with its tenants. An additional Count IV against only RAS alleges that RAS tortiously interfered with prospective economic advantage. Mis-numbered Count V against both RAS and CNB alleges slander of title with respect to the Undeveloped Land. Exhibits identical to those accompanying the initial complaint are attached to the amended Complaint. Debtor alleges that under the REA, it had certain \"Declarant Rights\" in connection with the Undeveloped Land, that were not the subject of the CNB Deed of Trust, nor the Settlement Agreement, and which were not acquired by CNB through the foreclosure sale that resulted in the Trustee's Deed. In particular, Debtor alleges that after the foreclosure sale and before commencement of the instant Adversary Proceeding, the following occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   21. On September 15, 2009, Charleston recorded an Amendment to Grant of Reciprocal Easements and Declaration of Covenants (\"Amendment to REA\") ... The Amendment to REA memorialized the transfer of interests from Charleston to BFV and provided that BFV \"hereby assumes the obligations of Declarant under the Declaration as set forth in Section 1.5.\" See Amendment to REA, Recital B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   22. On March 4, 2010, BFV was duly and lawfully merged into Charleston.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   23. Upon information and belief, on September 24, 2010, CNB sold the Undeveloped Land to RAS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   24. On several occasions in 2010, in apparent anticipation of the upcoming sale to RAS or another party, an employee of CNB contacted a representative of Charleston, and asked the Charleston representative whether Charleston would agree to transfer the Declarant's rights to CNB. The Charleston representative informed the CNB employee that Charleston was then and would continue to be the Declarant and that Charleston would never agree to transfer of the Declarant's rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   31. On November 1, 2010, Charleston entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (\"Purchase and Sale Agreement\"), a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit I, whereby Charleston agreed to sell to QREM or its assigns the Sears Site for $4,666,666.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   32. On November 8, 2010, Charleston filed a Motion of the Debtor and Debtor-in-Possession for an Order Authorizing the Sale of the Property Free and Clear of Liens, with the Proceeds of Such Sale to be Paid to the Debtor's Secured Lender (the \"Sale Motion\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   33. On November 16, 2010, the date of the scheduled hearing on the Sale Motion, RAS filed an Objection of RA Southeast Land Company, LLC to Motion of the Debtor and Debtor-in-Possession for an Order Authorizing the Sale of the Property Free and Clear of Liens, with the Proceeds of Such Sale to be Paid to the Debtor's Secured Lender (\"the \"Objection\"). In its Objection, RAS claimed that it is now the Declarant under the REA and that, by virtue of that alleged fact, Charleston will be unable to amend the REA in accordance with one of the conditions contained in the Purchase and Sale Agreement. RAS argued that Charleston could not therefore close the sale of the Sears Site.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, and 33. Debtor therefore alleges that the REA Amendment properly transferred its interests in the REA to BFV, including the Declarant Rights. As a result, Debtor alleges that it has the ability to include the Declarant Rights in a sale to QREM notwithstanding the claim of RAS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 28, 2011, CNB answered the Complaint, and also asserted a counterclaim (\"CNB Counterclaim\"). (AECF No. 54). The counterclaim is framed as six separate claims for relief against the Debtor: First - Breach of Contract, Second - Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Third - Declaratory Relief, Fourth - Fraudulent Inducement, Fifth - Negligent Misrepresentation, and Sixth - Slander of Title.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attached as Exhibit \"A\" to the CNB Counterclaim is a copy of a \"Deed of Trust, Assignment of Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing,\" recorded October 4, 2010, to secure the sale of the Undeveloped Land by CNB to RAS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 29, 2011, RAS also answered the Complaint, and also asserted a single counterclaim seeking declaratory relief and damages (\"RAS Counterclaim\"). (AECF No. 56). In its counterclaim, RAS alleges,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"Charleston and CNB entered into an agreement (\"Settlement Agreement\") under which, among other things, Charleston agreed to a \"friendly foreclosure\" under which it would not contest CNB's efforts to cause there to be a Trustee's sale of the Undeveloped Property under the Deed of Trust.\" RAS Counterclaim at \u00b6 15. It further alleges that \"On August 11, 2009, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Trustee's sale of the Undeveloped Land took place. Through a credit bid CNB acquired the Undeveloped Land and the inseparable right to become the successor Declarant pursuant to Section 1.5 of the REA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. Moreover, RAS alleges that \"By deed recorded on October 4, 2010, RAS acquired the Undeveloped Land from CNB.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. As of the result of the Debtor's conduct interfering with RAS's receipt and enjoyment of the Declarant Rights,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18, the prayer of RAS's counterclaim seeks entry of \"an order (1) declaring that RAS Southeast Land Company, LLC is\n   the Declarant under the REA, (2) declaring the Post-Foreclosure Amendment of the REA null and void, (3) declaring that the filing of the Post-Foreclosure Amendment constitutes slander of title, and (4) awarding RA Southeast Land Company, LLC damages, costs of suit, and reasonable attorneys fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:14-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 21, 2011, Debtor filed answers to the RAS Counterclaim and the CNB Counterclaim. (AECF Nos. 63 and 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 10, 2011, CNB filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims against it in the Debtor's Complaint, i.e., Count I, Count II and Count V, as well as on CNB's Third Counterclaim for declaratory relief. (AECF No. 68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 11, 2011, RAS filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims against it in the Debtor's Complaint, i.e., Count I, Count II, Count III, both Counts IV, and Count V, as well as on RAS's counterclaim. That summary judgment motion by RAS did not request that the damages, costs of suit, and reasonable attorneys fees sought in the prayer of the RAS Counterclaim be awarded by summary judgment. (AECF No. 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On June 20, 2011, Debtor filed a combined opposition to both summary judgment motions along with a countermotion for partial summary judgment on Counts I and II of its Complaint. As previously mentioned at 713-14,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , those two Counts seek a declaration that the Debtor possessed the Declarant Rights under the REA, and that both CNB and RAS violated the automatic stay by foreclosing on the Undeveloped Land and taking other actions thereafter. (AECF No. 92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 11, 2011, RAS filed a reply in support of its summary judgment motion combined with an opposition to the Debtor's countermotion (\"RAS Prior Opposition\"). (AECF No. 110). On the same date, CNB also filed its reply and opposition. (AECF No. 112).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On July 25, 2011, a hearing was conducted on the summary judgment motions as well as the countermotion. The motions by CNB and RAS were denied. The countermotion by the Debtor was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 5, 2011, an Order on Motions for Summary Judgment was entered, denying the summary judgment motions of CNB and RAS, and granting the countermotion for summary judgment brought by the Debtor. (AECF No. 120).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 1, 2011, an order was entered certifying the Order on Motions for Summary Judgment under FRCP 54(b). (AECF No. 145). On the same date, a Partial Summary Judgment was entered. (AECF No. 146). Additionally, a Supplemental Order on Summary Judgment Motions was entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (AECF No. 147).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 14, 2011, RAS filed a notice of appeal. (AECF No. 151).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the\n   same date, CNB also filed a notice of appeal. (AECF No. 153).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On December 15, 2011, CNB filed an election for its appeal to be heard by the United States District Court for the District of Nevada (\"USDC\"). (AECF No. 156).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 28, 2012, an order was entered by the Delaware Bankruptcy Court confirming the Debtor's Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (\"Plan\"). (ECF Nos. 725 and 809). Pursuant to the confirmed plan, New Boca Syndications Group, LLC (\"New Boca\") acquired the shopping center,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plan, Art. II., A., 8, which generates rental proceeds from its various tenants. In addition to acquiring the shopping center, New Boca assumed the Debtor's liability for the claims asserted by CNB and RAS in the RAS Adversary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan, Art. VII., C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On January 15, 2013, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court entered an order transferring venue of the Chapter 11 proceeding to Nevada, where it was assigned Case No. 13-10499-LBR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On July 25, 2013, the USDC entered an order reversing the Nevada bankruptcy court's Prior PSJ Order (\"Reversal Order\"). (USECF No. 70;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   AECF No. 207).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On August 23, 2013, Debtor filed a notice appealing the Reversal Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (\"Ninth Circuit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (USECF No. 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On January 25, 2016, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the USDC's Reversal Order (\"Circuit Order\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=632%20Fed.%20Appx.%20362\">\n    632 Fed.Appx. 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On February 17, 2016, after expiration of the period for filing a petition for rehearing under FRAP 41(b), the Ninth Circuit mandate to the USDC was entered.

(AECF No. 513). The order also scheduled a pretrial conference to be conducted on August 15, 2018, and also set forth various discovery deadlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On March 26, 2018, CNB filed the instant Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (\"Partial MSJ\"). (AECF No. 580). CNB seeks summary judgment on its First Counterclaim and Second Counterclaim, i.e., for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, against both the Debtor and New Boca. The motion is accompanied by the Declaration of Kevin P. McKenna (\"McKenna\") (\"McKenna Declaration\") and a Statement of Undisputed Facts in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (\"SUF\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (AECF Nos. 581 and 582).

The Prior PSJ Order also granted the Debtor's countermotion for summary judgment on Count I of its complaint for a declaration that it continued to own the Declarant Rights, as well as on Count II for a declaration that CNB and RAS violated the automatic stay by taking postbankruptcy actions affecting those Declarant Rights. Neither CNB nor the Debtor sought summary judgment with respect to CNB's First Counterclaim and Second Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The USDC, however, reversed the Prior PSJ Order. The USDC rejected this court's conclusion that the Debtor retained the Declarant Rights after CNB's foreclosure pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. Among other things, the USDC concluded that the REA Amendment purporting to transfer the Declarant Rights to BFV was unenforceable and invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reversal Order at 10:25. It found \"that CNB is the proper owner of the Declarant Rights after its foreclosure of the Undeveloped Land because it foreclosed not just on the real property, but also on the collateral associated with the real property (which includes the Declarant Rights).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:27 to 11:2. More important, the USDC concluded that the estate created by the CNB Deed of Trust included \"the Declarant Rights as property of the Trust Estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:5-7. As a result, the USDC interpreted Section 2.1(a) of the Settlement Agreement \"to mean that CNB's foreclosure transfers\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Charleston's interests in the Trust Estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, the USDC concluded that because CNB obtained the Declarant Rights when it completed its foreclosure sale on August 11, 2009, those rights were not property of the Debtor's bankruptcy estate when it filed the Chapter 11 petition on June 17, 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reversal Order at 10:26 to 13:16. As a result, the automatic stay did not apply, and the postpetition actions of CNB and RAS did not violate the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:18 to 15:7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of its conclusions, the USDC not only reversed the Prior PSJ Order, but also remanded \"\n   <em>\n    with instructions for the Bankruptcy Court to award summary judgment in favor of CNB and RAS\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:14-15 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Ninth Circuit agreed with the USDC and affirmed the USDC's decision to reverse the Prior PSJ Order.

Additionally, the Debtor suggests that additional damages for breach of the Settlement Agreement cannot be awarded because CNB previously was awarded $835,512.15 in attorneys fees by the bankruptcy court, and an additional $540,088.55 in attorneys fees by the USDC in connection with the appeals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:14-25.

The First Counterclaim, however, does not separately allege a breach of the Indemnification Agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Section 7.8 of the Settlement Agreement provides in pertinent part that \"the prevailing party in any action or proceeding which arises or relates to this Settlement Agreement shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in such action or proceeding.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    CNB Counterclaim at \u00b6 24.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Accordingly, those postpetition actions are\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    void.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sundquist v.

To the extent an appraisal prepared by a third party is kept and relied upon by a financial institution in the ordinary course of business, it may be considered for its probative value.

It argues that CNB's First Counterclaim and Second Counterclaim seek the same relief as a deficiency judgment that must be sought within six months after a foreclosure sale pursuant to NRS 40.455(1). Because CNB's foreclosure sale took place on August 13, 2009, Debtor argues that the CNB Counterclaims filed on March 28, 2011, are barred under Nevada law. It maintains that under NRS 40.453, the provisions of the Settlement Agreement permitting CNB to seek damages equivalent to a deficiency is against public policy and cannot be enforced. Debtor's belated argument, however, is without merit. Nothing in the Settlement Agreement waives or even mentions the provisions of NRS 40.455, and the requirement for CNB to credit bid the full amount of its obligation was designed to and prevented a deficiency under the CNB Deed of Trust. Section 2.2 of the Settlement Agreement expressly permits CNB to seek damages in the event that the Debtor materially interferes with the foreclosure. That the amount of damages mirrors a deficiency that might have resulted from a regularly conducted foreclosure sale does not subject CNB's breach of contract and breach of implied covenant claims to the requirements of NRS 40.455.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    In response to the Debtor's previous countermotion for summary judgment on the declaratory relief requested in Counts I and II of the Complaint, RAS raised the unclean hands doctrine.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    RAS Prior Opposition at 12:8 to 13:11. RAS argued that the Debtor's request for declaratory relief actually constitutes a quiet title action under Nevada law that is equitable in nature.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12:14-16. It maintained that the Debtor \"improvised a tale of secret agreements among related entities which contradicts the express REA Amendment,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 13:6-7, apparently constituting unclean hands. By contrast, CNB's First Counterclaim and Second Counterclaim are purely legal in nature because they are based on an express contract, i.e., the Settlement Agreement. As a result, the First Counterclaim and Second Counterclaim are not subject to the equitable defense of unclean hands.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Section 11.4 of the REA provides in pertinent part that if \"Declarant or any Owner or Occupant shall bring an action against Declarant or any other Owner or Occupant by reason of the breach of any covenant, term or obligation hereof, or otherwise arising out of this Declaration, the prevailing Declarant, Owner or Occupant in such suit shall be entitled to its costs of suit and reasonable attorney's fees, which shall be payable whether or not such action is prosecuted to judgment.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"33\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The underlying motion had been filed by CNB on March 16, 2016, to which was attached the Motion by City National Bank for Attorney's Fees that originally was filed before the Ninth Circuit.

As discussed at note 13,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the Substitution Order directed New Boca, as reorganized debtor and successor to the Debtor under the confirmed Chapter 11 plan, to satisfy the attorneys fees that had been awarded by the USDC in connection with the RAS Adversary appeal. The resulting CNB Fee Judgment was paid and CNB filed a Satisfaction of Judgment. Unlike the Substitution Motion, the instant Partial MSJ was filed only in the RAS Adversary and not in the Chapter 11 case. Although the Debtor opposed the Partial MSJ as a party to the RAS Adversary, New Boca did not respond, possibly because it is not a party to the RAS Adversary. Moreover, New Boca has asserted that it is not the actual debtor but only a related entity that purchased the Undeveloped Land. It has been required to pay the prior attorneys fee awards because under the confirmed Plan,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Plan, Art. IV., B.,4. and Art. VII., C., New Boca assumed joint and several liability of the Debtor to pay the claims of CNB arising from the RAS Adversary. At this time, the court will deny CNB's request for a judgment against New Boca in the instant adversary proceeding, without prejudice to CNB taking separate appropriate actions to enforce New Boca's contractual obligations arising out of the confirmed Plan. A monetary judgment in a separate civil action may be enforced by a writ of execution under applicable law. Likewise, if a properly requested motion to enforce the confirmed Plan results in a monetary award against New Boca, the resulting order may be enforced through the execution procedures of the State of Nevada.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.R.Bankr.P. 9014(c) (FRBP 7069 applies in contested matters); Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7069 (FRCP 69 applies in adversary proceedings); Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a)(1) (a money judgment is enforced by execution under the execution procedure of the state where the court is located).
