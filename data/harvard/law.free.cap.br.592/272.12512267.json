BERNSTEIN, United States Bankruptcy Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Plaintiff, Salvatore LaMonica (\"Trustee\"), the trustee of the administratively consolidated estates of TransCare Corporation and numerous debtor-affiliates (collectively, \"TransCare\" or the \"Estate\"), commenced this adversary proceeding to recover damages from the defendants under several theories discussed below. The non-individual defendants have moved to dismiss all or a portion of many of the Trustee's claims. (\n   <em>\n    See Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , dated May 4, 2018 (\"\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Memo\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Doc. # 11)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also Defendants'\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Reply to Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss Certain Claims Asserted in the Chapter 7 Trustee's Adversary Complaint\n   </em>\n   , dated June 18, 2018 (\"\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Reply\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Doc. # 17.) ) The Trustee opposes the motion. (\n   <em>\n    See Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , dated June 11, 2018 (\"\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Opposition\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Doc. # 16.) ) For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted in part and denied in part, and the Trustee is granted leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   TransCare provided emergency medical transportation services to hospitals and municipalities throughout the Northeast and disability transportation services for municipal authorities, such as the New York City Transit Authority (\"MTA\"). (\u00b6 1.) The Defendant Lynn Tilton was the sole member of TransCare's Board of Directors, (\u00b6\u00b6 2, 10), and the sole owner, chief executive officer and principal/manager of the \"Patriarch\" family of companies. (\u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-21.) As used in the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , the term \"Patriarch\" refers to all of the Defendants (collectively, the \"Patriarch Defendants\") other than Tilton, and includes the following entities: Patriarch Partners Agency Services, LLC (\"PPAS\"), Patriarch Partners, LLC, Patriarch Partners Management Group, LLC (\"PPMG\"), Ark II CLO 2001-1, Limited (\"Ark II\"), Ark Investment Partners II, L.P. (\"Ark Partners\"), LD Investments, LLC, Patriarch Partners II, LLC, Patriarch Partners III, LLC, Patriarch Partners VIII, LLC, Patriarch Partners XIV, LLC, Patriarch Partners XV, LLC, Transcendence Transit, Inc., and Transcendence Transit II, Inc. (\u00b6 4 n. 2.) The\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   alleges that Patriarch operated wholly under Tilton's control and pursuant to her directives \"as a wholly-integrated entity.\" (\u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Lending Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By a Credit Agreement dated August 4, 2003 (\"Credit Agreement\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   TransCare issued debt obligations to eight lenders (collectively, the \"Original Lenders\"). Two of the Original Lenders were the Patriarch Defendants, Ark II and Ark Partners. (Credit Agreement \u00a7 5.4, Schedule 1.0.) The other six Original Lenders were First Dominion Funding I, First Dominion Funding II, CSAM Funding II, CSAM Funding III, Atrium CDO and Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Each Original Lender appointed PPAS as the Administrative Agent to act on its behalf consistent with the terms of the Credit Agreement, and to exercise the powers reasonably incidental thereto. (\u00b6 11; Credit Agreement \u00a7 11.1.) According to the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , TransCare granted PPAS a senior secured lien on all of its assets, (\u00b6 29), although the Credit Agreement suggests that the Original Lenders were the secured parties and PPAS was their agent with respect to their liens. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Credit Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 11.10, 11.12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Credit Agreement was amended by Amendment 22, dated as of January 25, 2013. While the amendment did not modify the material terms of the Credit Agreement,\n   it was signed by a different group of lenders (the \"Lenders\"). In addition to PPAS, which signed as Administrative Agent, the Lenders included the Defendant Ark Partners and Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited, Zohar II 2005-1, Limited and Zohar III, Limited (collectively, the \"Zohar Entities\"). The Defendant Tilton signed on behalf of PPAS, Ark Partners and the Zohar Entities as manager of each Lender. Notably, Ark II was no longer listed as one of the Lenders, and the schedule of outstanding loans as of January 8, 2013 attached to Amendment 22 did not list any outstanding loans owed to Ark II. The form of Amendment 22 provided to the Court included signature lines for two additional lenders, First Dominion Funding I and Credit Suisse Alternative Capital, Inc., but their signatures did not appear on the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under the Credit Agreement, TransCare agreed to pay principal and interest to PPAS in installments for the benefit of the Lenders according to a schedule set forth in the Credit Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Credit Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 2.3, 5.1, 5.4, Schedule 1.0.) All payments were to be made to PPAS \"prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof\" to be distributed to the Lenders on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.9(a), (c).) PPAS was authorized to waive certain conditions with the written consent of the \"Required Lenders,\" but could not modify the time or amount of the payments due under the Credit Agreement without the consent of each affected Lender. The Credit Agreement provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Required Lenders may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders ... the Administrative Agent may ... waive, on such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; ...\n   <em>\n    provided, however\n   </em>\n   ... that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall ... reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof ... without the consent of each Lender affected thereby ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.1 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   avers that the Credit Agreement and the amendments to the Credit Agreement were not the product of arm's length transactions because Tilton controlled both Patriarch and TransCare. (\u00b6 31.) TransCare does not contend, however, that the Original Lenders did not fund the loan or that the terms of the Credit Agreement were unfair.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 13, 2006, TransCare entered into a revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") to fund the operations of the company. (\u00b6 32.) The same day, Wells Fargo and PPAS entered into an inter-creditor agreement pursuant to which PPAS recognized Wells Fargo's first lien on all of TransCare's assets and accounts receivable, including TransCare's right to payment under its \"MTA Contract.\" (\u00b6 32.) The MTA Contract, under which TransCare provided paratransit services for MTA customers using vehicles leased from the MTA, was TransCare's most profitable business unit. (\u00b6\u00b6 32, 41.) PPAS took a first lien position on TransCare's vehicles and certain miscellaneous physical assets only, and agreed it would not take any action to foreclose or otherwise enforce any liens junior to Wells Fargo. (\u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Deterioration of TransCare's Financial Condition and the Defendants' Mismanagement and Self-Dealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The gravamen of the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   concerns Tilton's response to TransCare's deteriorating financial condition, and charges mismanagement and two forms of self-dealing that overlap. First, she continued to insist that TransCare make interest payments under the Credit Agreement even though PPAS had the authority to waive the interest payments and TransCare lacked the funds to meet its operational and employee obligations. Second, she continued to rebuff suggestions to sell and offers to purchase TransCare's assets to meet its liquidity needs. Third, and arguably instead, she stole a corporate opportunity by causing the most valuable TransCare's assets to be transferred to affiliates through a strict foreclosure, and then crediting TransCare's outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement in an amount substantially less than the value of the foreclosed assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Between 2012 and 2014, the Debtor had net revenues of approximately $130 million and positive EBITDA, (\u00b6 40), and in 2012, PPAS modified the Credit Agreement to provide TransCare with an additional $2 million. (\u00b6 40.) Nevertheless, TransCare's costs grew and it lost clients because of its inability to invest in new vehicles. (\u00b6 40.) TransCare's executives were told that not paying bills on time and in full was the \"Patriarch way.\" (\u00b6 40 (quotation marks in original).) As a result, TransCare's payables grew, and critical vendors went unpaid. (\u00b6 40.) During the same period, TransCare paid over $11 million to PPAS on account of the loans. (\u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In early 2015, the MTA indicated its reluctance to renew the MTA Contract, scheduled to expire that summer, due to TransCare's deteriorating financial condition, and particularly, TransCare's inability to obtain replacement parts for the MTA vehicles. (\u00b6 41.) On February 4, 2015, TransCare executives warned Tilton that the company lacked cash to make payroll\n   the following day, and faced a projected $6.7 million shortfall by the end of March. (\u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 5, 2015, Glenn Leland, TransCare's CEO, advised Patriarch of a potential resolution to TransCare's financial problems. National Express had communicated an interest in purchasing TransCare's MTA Contract and paratransit business for between $15 million and $18 million. (\u00b6\u00b6 43, 44.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   National Express offered an immediate non-refundable deposit in the amount of $1.7 million to begin negotiations. (\u00b6 44.) In response, Tilton contacted Leland directly and berated him for exploring a sale option. (\u00b6 45.) Brian Stephen, a lawyer employed at Patriarch but claiming to represent TransCare's Board, (\u00b6 37), told Leland that he \"had no authority to even discuss sale options of any assets with any company,\" and \"claimed that TransCare would not receive any of the potential sale proceeds because 'Lynn has other debts.' \" (\u00b6 45.) Finally, Jean-Luc Pelissier, an Executive Managing Director of Patriarch, (\u00b6 38), told Leland \"that under no circumstances could he attempt to raise funds by exploring potential sales.\" (\u00b6 45.) Around the same time, RCA Ambulance Service expressed to Tilton its interest in acquiring TransCare, but she refused to authorize TransCare executives to consider the offer. (\u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On February 18, 2015, Leland drafted a stabilization plan, noted that TransCare was not a viable ongoing concern without an immediate cash infusion and repeated the prospect of a sale of the MTA business for between $14 million and $17 million as a source of immediate financing. (\u00b6\u00b6 47, 48.) Tilton again refused to allow TransCare to explore a sale, but nevertheless authorized Patriarch to lend funds to TransCare so that it could make payroll. (\u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In June 2015, TransCare's executives again warned Tilton that the company risked missing payroll and needed to recapitalize immediately, suggested borrowing, and warned that it lacked the funds needed to pay PPAS, make payroll and pay other expenditures. (\u00b6\u00b6 50, 51.) TransCare was informed that Tilton, as sole member of TransCare's board, insisted that TransCare make the interest payment to PPAS, and reminded TransCare that PPMG was not the only lender. (\u00b6\u00b6 51, 52.) In response, Leland advised Patriarch that TransCare could not maintain its critical supply chain and insurance if it had to pay the interest and continue to postpone back payroll tax deposits. (\u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In July 2015, TransCare missed payroll after bouncing a check to pay for insurance, and was warned by the New York Department of Health that the failure to provide immediate assurances to fund payroll would result in the shutdown of TransCare's operations. (\u00b6 54.) Leland informed Patriarch of offers to buy all or parts of TransCare from two separate national ambulance companies, as well as a \"Letter of Intent\" from National Express offering to buy the MTA business for $6 million to $7 million and a $2 million assumption of liabilities, but was instructed by Tilton's son-in-law, Scott Whalen, to make it \"clear\" that TransCare was not for sale. (\u00b6\u00b6 55-60.) On July 8 and 16, Tilton caused \"Patriarch\" to lend over $1.3 million to TransCare to fund payroll, bounced checks, and immediate needs. (\u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Leland's warnings, and Patriarch's demand for interest payments and rejection of sale proposals, as well as Patriarch's\n   other cash flow initiatives, such as forcing the employees to pay for their own fuel and withholding the payment of payroll taxes to the IRS, continued throughout the summer and into the late fall. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By December 16, 2015, Tilton advised Wells Fargo that she had determined to sell TransCare. (\u00b6 73.) Two days later, Patriarch analyst Michael Greenberg advised Tilton that the MTA Contract was worth between $22 million and $36 million, a figure \"vastly more\" than the amount needed to pay employees and recapitalize TransCare. (\u00b6 74.) In January 2016, Leland quit, and Tilton hired Carl Marks &amp; Co. (\"Carl Marks\") as restructuring advisors to TransCare, and told Carl Marks to report directly to her. (\u00b6 76.) By a credit agreement dated January 15, 2016 (the \"Ark Credit Agreement\"), Ark II committed to make $6.5 million available to TransCare Corporation for working capital and general corporate purposes, but did not make the promised amount available. (\u00b6\u00b6 77-78.) TransCare provided guarantees and liens to Ark II in connection with the Ark Credit Agreement. (\u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Strict Foreclosure and the Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 9, 2016, Tilton's personal attorneys contacted the firm of Curtis Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle LLP (\"Curtis Mallet\") about the need to immediately file chapter 11 bankruptcy cases for TransCare. (\u00b6 80.) In the meantime, also on February 9, 2016, Pelissier contacted the MTA and represented that the owner of TransCare wished to transfer the MTA Contract to a different entity. (\u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The next day, February 10, Tilton incorporated two new Delaware entities: Transcendence Transit, Inc., and a wholly-owned subsidiary called Transcendence Transit II, Inc. (\"Transcendence II\"). Transcendence II would take over TransCare's MTA Contract and other paratransit operations. (\u00b6\u00b6 81, 83.) That same day, Carl Marks provided Patriarch with financial projections showing that with TransCare's assets, Transcendence II would earn $22.7 million in revenue and $1.5 million in EBIDTA. (\u00b6 82.) Greenberg, the Patriarch analyst, pegged the revenues at $25 million from the MTA Contract and $31 million from its other paratransit operations. (\u00b6 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Tilton's plan was to be effectuated through a secret foreclosure of TransCare's assets. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-85.) On February 14, 2016, Pelissier submitted a detailed plan to TransCare's executives to prepare to transfer TransCare's lucrative MTA paratransit business as well as several other lucrative ambulance divisions. (\u00b6 86.) On February 18, 2016, TransCare signed an engagement agreement with Curtis Mallet to file the chapter 7 cases. (\u00b6 87.) All the while, Patriarch refused to fund TransCare's payroll taxes or reserve for them, and by February 24, 2016, TransCare owed approximately $1.148 million in payroll taxes for 2016, plus at least $172,000 in penalties and interest. (\u00b6 88.) When Carl Marks advised Tilton that TransCare lacked the funds necessary to pay payroll, 401(k) obligations, and outstanding payroll taxes from earlier pay dates as well as other critical expenses, Tilton chastised Carl Marks for seeking her direction and instead told Carl Marks to \"make decisions on what needs to be paid.\" (\u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On February 24, 2016, Patriarch, through a process controlled by Tilton, purported to strictly foreclose on TransCare's assets and assume TransCare's rights and obligations under the MTA Contract in satisfaction of $10 million of the amounts owed under the Credit Agreement. (\u00b6\u00b6 90-93.) Ultimately, however, Tilton's rescue plan fell apart. (\u00b6 94.) On February\n   24, 2016, she directed TransCare to file for chapter 7 bankruptcy, (\u00b6 89), and it did that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   One day later, and notwithstanding the automatic stay, Stephen advised TransCare executives to secure the assets. (\u00b6 95.) Later that evening, Pelissier instructed TransCare's executives to transfer TransCare's accounts receivable server out of TransCare's warehouse, but TransCare's vice president refused, rejected Patriarch's offer to join Transcendence, and alerted the Trustee. (\u00b6 96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Proofs of Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Four Patriarch Defendants filed proofs of claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   PPAS filed a secured claim in the sum of $35,090,492.76 based on the Credit Agreement. The claim reflects a $10 million credit relating to the acceptance of collateral resulting from the strict foreclosure. PPMG filed an unsecured claim in the sum of $2,038,515.87 owed under a Management Services Agreement. Ark II filed a secured claim in the sum of $1,077,966.97 based on outstanding indebtedness under the Ark Credit Agreement. The amount of the claim reflects a $789,457.00 credit representing the proceeds of collateral sales by the Trustee. Patriarch Partners, LLC filed an unsecured claim in the sum of $2,587.98 based on unpaid expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The\n    <em>\n     Ien\n    </em>\n    Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On the heels of the bankruptcy filing, one of TransCare's former employees commenced an adversary proceeding alleging violations of the federal and New York WARN Acts. (\n   <em>\n    See Complaint\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Ien v. TransCare Corp. et al.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Ian\n   </em>\n   \"), dated March 1, 2016 (\"\n   <em>\n    Ien Complaint\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Adv. Proc. No. 16-01033 Doc. # 1).) The defendants included TransCare, Tilton, and several Patriarch Defendants: Patriarch Partners, LLC, ARK CLO 2001-1 Limited, Ark Partners and Patriarch Partners III, LLC. The\n   <em>\n    Ien Complaint\n   </em>\n   charged that the non-individual defendants, under the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   control of Tilton, caused the shutting down of TransCare and the termination without warning or cause of approximately 1,700 employees by refusing to fund TransCare's operations and attempting to transfer those operations to newly created entities. (\n   <em>\n    Ien Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-49.) The\n   <em>\n    Ien Complaint\n   </em>\n   also asserted claims against all defendants for unpaid wages under New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In his\n   <em>\n    Answer to Adversary Class Action Complaint\n   </em>\n   , dated June 3, 2016 (\"\n   <em>\n    Trustee Answer\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Adv. Proc. No. 16-01033 Doc. # 24), the Trustee generally denied the material allegations in the\n   <em>\n    Ien Complaint\n   </em>\n   and asserted several affirmative defenses.

As noted, the gravamen of the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   is that Tilton breached her fiduciary duties by failing to waive the payment of interest under the Credit Agreement, at least on behalf of the Lenders she controlled, mismanaging TransCare and its finances, and ultimately, seizing a corporate opportunity by causing the strict foreclosure of its assets rather than selling those assets to a third party at a higher price. Specifically, the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   alleges that Tilton, through PPAS, insisted on the payment of interest from TransCare and collected substantial sums under the Credit Agreement at times when TransCare was unable to meet its obligations. (\u00b6\u00b6 30, 40, 51, 62.) In addition, the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   alleges that PPAS strictly foreclosed its security interest in certain TransCare assets, (\u00b6\u00b6 90-93), and its proof of claim credited TransCare in the amount of $10 million as a result of the strict foreclosure. (\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Opposition\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B, ECF pp. 5-10 of 32.) Under the Credit\n   Agreement, and not later than January 8, 2013, PPAS acted as the Administrative Agent for Ark Partners, and presumably collected interest and foreclosed on TransCare's assets as its agent as well as agent for the other Lenders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   also suggests that Transcendence II took an assignment of TransCare's MTA contract as part of Tilton's plan to assume control of TransCare's business.

The respondents before the SEC were Patriarch Partners, LLC, Patriarch Partners VIII, LLC, Patriarch Partners XIV, LLC, and Patriarch Partners XV, LLC (\"Patriarch Collateral Managers,\" together with Tilton, the \"SEC Respondents\"). The issue before the SEC administrative law judge was whether the SEC Respondents had violated the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, \u00a7 206(1), (2) and (4), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 80b-6, by making material misrepresentations and omissions to the institutional investors in three collateralized loan obligation funds managed by the Patriarch Collateral Mangers, namely, the Zohar Entities. Through the Patriarch Collateral Managers, Tilton used the monies in the Zohar Entities to buy or make loans to mid-sized distressed companies (\"Portfolio Companies\"). The SEC Opinion contains findings that Tilton would often decide to defer and accrue interest payments owed by the Portfolio Companies, and did so at times through \"amendment by course of performance\" rather than by a signed document.\n    <em>\n     SEC Opinion\n    </em>\n    , at *19.
