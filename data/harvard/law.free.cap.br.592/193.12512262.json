Marshall's Objection to Confirmation [Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   No. 37] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Objection\n   </em>\n   \") brought by the chapter 13 trustee (the \"\n   <em>\n    Chapter 13 Trustee\n   </em>\n   \") in opposition to an amended Chapter 13 Plan dated February 13, 2018 [Dkt. No. 31] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Plan\n   </em>\n   \") presented by Larry Shelton, the debtor in the above-captioned case (the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtor\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Chapter 13 Trustee objects to the Plan insofar as it is structured to provide payments to a secured creditor beginning as minimal, adequate protection payments and thereafter stepping up those payments to a more fulsome amount-a so-called \"step\" plan. Here, the increase in payments occurs when payments to the Debtor's counsel, The Semrad Law Firm, LLC (\"\n   <em>\n    Semrad\n   </em>\n   \"), are scheduled to be complete. The Chapter 13 Trustee alleges that such a payment structure violates the express requirements of chapter 13 plans, exists solely to benefit Semrad and is proposed in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons more fully stated below, the court agrees.

No. 45] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 7, 2017, the Debtor presented its original Chapter 13 Plan [Dkt. No. 13] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Original Plan\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Original Plan contained a provision with an effect similar to the one at issue in the Plan, though with substantially different language used to obtain that effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Original Plan \u00a7 8.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 25, 2018, the court conducted the first of four confirmation hearings in this matter (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Hearings\n   </em>\n   \"), at the time considering the Original Plan. Early in the Hearings, the Chapter 13 Trustee voiced concerns over nonstandard provisions in the Debtor's plans. While the Debtor revised the Original Plan when filing the Plan at issue here, the problematic effect of the nonstandard provisions remains unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Early in this case Semrad, the Chapter 13 Trustee and the court were also actively engaged in a similar matter, wherein Semrad and other chapter 13 debtors' counsel attempted to change the priority scheme in chapter 13 plans to permit counsel to be paid ahead of other creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gilliam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p470\">\n    582 B.R. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 470-75 (Bankr.

P. 3015(f), and because the matters herein turned, at least in part, on the issues in\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   , the court continued the matter for an objection to be filed and for\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   to be decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the Objection was filed, a briefing schedule was set and, as later modified, complied with by the parties. The\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   decision having been rendered on March 28, 2018, after the matter was fully briefed, the court conducted a final confirmation hearing on the Plan. At that hearing on\n   May 10, 2018, the matter was taken under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court has taken into consideration all of the foregoing, as well as the arguments of the parties at the Hearings.

While not the only firm engaging in such practices, Semrad, the counsel herein, has led the way in this behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   matter noted above, Semrad sought to alter the priority scheme in chapter 13 plans to afford Semrad payment in advance of those payments to which it would otherwise be entitled.\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p470\">\n    582 B.R. at 470-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   and fifty other cases determined by the court concurrently therewith, the court found that Semrad's changes to the priority of payments under chapter 13 plans were solely for Semrad's benefit and potentially harmful to Semrad's clients' interests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p470\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, and because Semrad could demonstrate neither client consent nor full disclosure to the court of this self-dealing, the court reduced Semrad's compensation and imposed rigid disclosure requirements of any similar agreements going forward.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p470\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p470\">\n    at 475-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As noted, it is not just Semrad engaging in this behavior before the undersigned.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Williams-Hayes\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17bk27961,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202207897\">\n    2018 WL 2207897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-5 (Bankr.

Step plans are plans that set artificially low payments to secured creditors for a period of time immediately following the plan's confirmation, then stepping up those payments to a more fulsome amount later in the term of the plan. During this period, the debtor's payments to the Chapter 13 Trustee remain unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In cases such as this one, where the step is included for the counsel's benefit, the lower initial amount theoretically frees up funds to pay the debtor's counsel, which allows counsel's fees to be paid more quickly. After counsel fees are paid, the amount paid to the secured creditors increases. There are other, more legitimate, uses of step plans. For example, a debtor might seek to reduce payments to secured creditors for a period to allow multiple secured debts to be paid prior to the maturity of one or more of those debts, then step up payments after the mature debts are no longer being paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Disregarding the effect of the step for the moment, the Debtor's Plan requires him to pay $900.00 per month for 60 months to the Chapter 13 Trustee. Plan, at \u00a7 2.1. The Plan sets distributions from those plan payments to nonmortgage secured creditors as follows: Ally Financial in the amount of $166.00 per month for a car; and American First Financial in the amount of $20.00 per month for furniture. Plan, at \u00a7 3.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The step is implemented with the following nonstandard plan provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   1. Commencing with the 11/2018 plan payment, Ally Financial will receive set payments in the amount of $775.00 per month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   2. Ally Financial will receive pre-confirmation adequate protection payments in the amount of $166.00 per month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   3. Commencing with the 11/2018 plan payment, American First Financial will receive set payments in the amount of $104.00 per month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plan, at \u00a7 8.1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plan, at \u00a7 1.3 (checking the \"Included\" box for nonstandard Plan provisions).

In chapter 11, for example, a unanimously accepted plan-which acceptance will be gaged based on the requirements of section 1126-might be confirmed even if it otherwise would not satisfy the so-called \"absolute priority rule\" embodied in section 1129(b).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7)(A)(i), (a)(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Voting is not mandated by statute in chapter 13 cases and thus there is no equivalent to section 1126 in chapter 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, courts are faced with a dilemma\n   when asked to determine, as they are in section 1325(a)(5)(A), whether a creditor has \"accepted\" a chapter 13 plan. By extension, courts are also faced with how to weigh objections in this regard, especially those of chapter 13 trustees where no creditor has objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In this context, many courts have concluded that silence by a secured creditor constitutes acceptance for the purpose of section 1325(a)(5)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   There is, of course, no question that, in the absence of any objection at all, the court may conclude that the requirements of section 1325(a)(3) have been met without the need for evidence in that regard. The Bankruptcy Rules provide as much.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3015(f) (\"If no objection is timely filed, the court may determine that the plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law without receiving evidence on such issues.\"). No such provision exists, however, within the Bankruptcy Rules with respect to section 1325(a)(1) or, by extension, section 1325(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Nonetheless, the\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   and its progeny stand for the proposition that, in the absence of an objection, the court may conclude that a plan has been accepted.\n   <em>\n    This is a very different thing.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Given how courts often handle motion practice, this conclusion is understandable even if misplaced.

Thus, even in chapter 11, where creditors are automatically afforded both the opportunity to object to and reject a plan, their silence does not equate to affirmative acceptance of a plan. To conclude that in chapter 13, where creditors have even less of a say, that their silence is of greater effect, is more than problematic. In chapter 13, all creditors have a right to object,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201324\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), but only secured creditors are asked to accept.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201323\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 1325(a)(5)(A).

Those principles look to the meaning and structure of the statute itself before looking elsewhere. Here, Congress chose the term \"accepted.\" The plain meaning of \"accept,\" without further context, is either to make a favorable response (by an affirmative act) or to endure without protest or reaction (silence), though the definitions seem to run toward the former, not the latter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As either meaning is possible, the language is ambiguous.

Congress used both terms in section 1327(a), which states that \"[t]he provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor, ... whether or not such creditor has objected to, has accepted, or has rejected the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201327\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Equating acceptance with lack of objection renders section 1323(c) nearly incomprehensible.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201323\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (\"Any holder of a secured claim that has accepted or rejected the plan is deemed to have accepted or rejected, as the case may be, the plan as modified, unless the modification provides for a change in the rights of such holder from what such rights were under the plan before modification, and such holder changes such holder's previous acceptance or rejection.\"). Section 1323(c), by its very wording, shows that Congress knows the difference between actual acceptance and deemed acceptance. Congress most certainly knew how to write section 1325(a)(5)(A) to state expressly that the provision would apply in the absence of the objection, but chose instead to speak in terms of acceptance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20327\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (\"unless there is objection by another creditor or the United States trustee\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"[a] claim or interest ... is deemed allowed unless a party in interest ... objects\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(15) (providing specific treatment requirements as predicates to confirming a chapter 11 plan as to creditors who object to the plan).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Third, placing the burden with regard to confirmation of a plan on the creditor incorrectly inverts the burdens under section 1325. As noted at the outset, the burden of showing satisfaction of the elements of section 1325 falls on the plan's proponent, in this case, the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6512200,10520369\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/1350/\">\n    957 F.2d at 1354-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the plan proponent, especially one proposing a nonstandard provision applicable only to specified creditors, the Debtor has the burden of demonstrating acceptance. Forcing a creditor to object to preserve its rights removes that burden from the Debtor. It is not unreasonable or out of the context with the overall statutory theme in chapter 13 to require a debtor to carry its burden by affirmatively seeking acceptance from creditors who a debtor is individually targeting with nonstandard provisions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briseno v.

The court must conclude that somehow preclusion and waiver equate to acceptance. The court must also conclude that the Chapter 13 Trustee's objection must be disregarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   That former assumption collapses preclusion and waiver into that of acceptance.

In\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court articulated the importance of bankruptcy courts ensuring that plans are confirmed only if they comply with the Bankruptcy Code. In the context of an unobjected to plan which attempted to discharge student loan debt without demonstrating undue hardship, the Court stated that \"[f]ailure to comply with this self-executing requirement should prevent confirmation of the plan\n   <em>\n    even if the creditor fails to object, or to appear in the proceeding\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   . That is because \u00a7 1325(a) instructs a bankruptcy court to confirm a plan only if the court finds,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the plan complies with the 'applicable provisions' of the Code.\"\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at 276-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted) (emphasis added).

It stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   It is correct that, if a plan is properly noticed and otherwise meets the requirements of \u00a7 1325(a), the Court may deem a secured creditor's silence to constitute acceptance of a plan and the plan may be confirmed. This \"implied\" acceptance is allowed because Chapter 13, unlike Chapter 11, has no balloting mechanism to evidence acceptance of a proposed plan, and it is only the negative-a filed objection-that evidences the lack of acceptance. When the creditor simply does nothing, the judicial doctrine of \"implied\" acceptance fills the drafting gap in the Code.\n   <em>\n    The concept of implied acceptance of an otherwise compliant plan, or even voting on similar provisions in Chapter 11, however, is quite different from proposing a plan intentionally inconsistent with the Code and then waiting for the trap to spring on a somnolent creditor.\n   </em>\n   Creditors are entitled to rely on the few unambiguous provisions of the BAPCPA for their treatment. They should not be required to scour every Chapter 13 plan to ensure that provisions of the BAPCPA specifically inapplicable to them will not be inserted in a proposed plan in the debtor's hope that the improper secured creditor treatment will become\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Montoya\n   </em>\n   , 341 B.R. at 45 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Montoya\n   </em>\n   conclusion is striking under the facts at bar, where it is clear that the Debtor here has intentionally proposed a plan inconsistent with section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) and, rather than affirmatively seek acceptance by the affected secured creditors, has lain in wait to see if the creditor objects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Thus while silence might equal acceptance of a chapter 13 plan generally, it is difficult to find it so under the facts at bar.

The Role of the Chapter 13 Trustee\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code as we know it today is the product of hard fought reforms in the 1970s. Prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 which, when codified, became the Bankruptcy Code, the bankruptcy law of the land was primarily that contained in the Nelson Act, Bankruptcy Act of 1898, Pub.

In 1973 the commission filed its final report,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Stat.%20840\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , which found that the \"most severe problem in the bankruptcy administration was the court system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5965. The report identified two problems. First, the report noted that the \"bankruptcy court ... is not truly and completely a court.\" It was \"not independent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, the report noted that bankruptcy judges were required to be too involved in the administration of cases, not truly acting as judges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5965-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As most are aware, the Bankruptcy Code addressed the former of these two problems by attempting to give \"the bankruptcy court the independence it needs to operate in today's complex bankruptcy world.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5965. While that effort was successful in many respects, in large part it failed. In the past ten years, bankruptcy court authority has been repeatedly and severely eroded by Supreme Court and other jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,4332163\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/462/\">\n    564 U.S. at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the Bankruptcy Code unconstitutionally vested authority in the bankruptcy courts). Such is the result that bankruptcy courts are no longer certain whether they can hear the simplest and most crucial matters within bankruptcy cases, such as fraudulent conveyance actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code addressed the latter problem by attempting to remove the supervisory functions from the judge. House Report, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5966. Those functions were transferred in large part to the United States Trustee's Office and the standing chapter 13 trustees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The stated goal was to \"involve[ ] the judge only when a dispute arises.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This second effort has been largely successful, but for two very important changes. First, the volume of cases heard by bankruptcy judges has risen disproportionately with the number of bankruptcy judges. In 1978, there were approximately 200 bankruptcy judges hearing approximately 227,000 cases. John E. Shepard,\n   <em>\n    The 1981 Bankruptcy Court Time Study\n   </em>\n   , Federal Judicial Center (1982), 33, 49-50, https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2012/1981Bank.pdf. In 2017, there are approximately 365 bankruptcy judges hearing over 1 million pending cases. U.S. Bankruptcy Courts Federal Judicial Caseload Statistics, Administrative Office of the United States Courts (March 31, 2018), http://www.uscourts.gov/statistics/table/f/federal-judicial-caseload-statistics/2018/03/31. In 2011, prior to the\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   decision, the caseload exceeded 1.5 million. Thus less than twice the number of judges are hearing four times or more cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The second change is that the Bankruptcy Code has become enormously more complex while efforts to create uniformity in the national bankruptcy system such as the national chapter 13 plan have been met\n   with resistance. The amount of time judges spend on consumer cases has risen dramatically while the courts above rightfully continue to stress the bankruptcy court's duty to scrutinize bankruptcy plans.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referring to the bankruptcy courts' authority and obligation to require debtors to adhere to the Bankruptcy Code);\n   <em>\n    In re Madison Hotel Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6561537,6561156,633084\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/749/410/\">\n    749 F.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 425 (7th Cir. 1984) (\"[T]his court has interpreted the identical 'good faith' language contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) to require the bankruptcy court to review the proposed plan for accuracy and 'a fundamental fairness in dealing with one's creditors.' \") (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ravenot v.

Many times the trustee is privy to the interactions between the debtor and its creditors that the court is not. Thus, while in the absence of any objection a court might presume a creditor's silence is acceptance, in the face of a chapter 13 trustee's objection, how could it therefore possibly be inappropriate to require the debtor to carry its burden expressly? These are specifically targeted, nonstandard plan provisions. All a debtor need do is confirm the affected creditor's acquiescence and report that to the court.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed.

This is incorrect, as these tests are independent. To hold that satisfaction of section 1325(a)(3) is subsumed into satisfaction of section 1325(a)(5) is to read section 1325(a)(3) out of existence.

It is not in keeping with the objectives and the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   This is an example of what the court was concerned with in\n   <em>\n    Montoya\n   </em>\n   . Semrad, on behalf of its client, the Debtor, has proposed a plan that it knows or should know violates both the express provisions and intention of section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I). As per past practice, Semrad lay in wait to see if the Plan gave rise to an objection from a Secured Creditor, or, as was noted in\n   <em>\n    Montoya\n   </em>\n   , the Plan could catch those creditors sleeping. If an objection had occurred, by Semrad's own admission, it would have removed the provision if it could not reach an agreement with the objecting creditor. By doing so, the Debtor (or Semrad) seeks to delay payment to the Debtor's Secured Creditors without even attempting to procure those creditors' acceptance under section 1325(a)(5)(A). That delay heightens the risks borne by such delayed creditors, solely to reduce risk and accelerate payment to another creditor, Semrad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   It should also be noted that, in advising the Debtor to proceed in this manner, Semrad has prioritized its desire to be paid over the best interests of the Debtor, its client. As this court observed previously in\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   , provisions such as those at bar here are harmful to the client. Not only does the delay in payment under the Plan shift risk to the Debtor's delayed creditors, but it leaves unpaid longer a debt that, in the event of failure of the debtor's bankruptcy plan, because it is secured, has superior rights outside of bankruptcy. This could leave the debtor in a worse position that had it not filed for bankruptcy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, delay in confirming a plan because of such provisions leaves open longer the possibility that a preconfirmation default may occur. As the court observed in\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   , \"the applicable law is less flexible with respect to preconfirmation defaults than it is with respect to postconfirmation ones.\"\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p470\">\n    582 B.R. at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   These risks and harms are borne by the Debtor for no reason other than to prefer payment to Semrad.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p470\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p470\">\n    at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he additions are asserted for the benefit of the attorneys alone, not the debtors in whose plans they are contained ....\"). \"[T]he plan provisions themselves and any effort spent on the plan provisions by Semrad were of no benefit to the estate in question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p470\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p470\">\n    at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   As a result, the court simply cannot conclude that the Plan deals with the Debtor's creditors with fundamental fairness.

One, however, remains open and goes to the heart of Semrad's misunderstanding of this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In the Response, the Debtor argues that there is nothing wrong with the Plan's proposal because section 1326 permits claims such as those by Semrad to be paid before the claims of other creditors. Section 1326 states, in pertinent part, that some claims shall be paid \"[b]efore or at the time of each payment to creditors under the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   While this argument is more persuasive in the context of the prioritization of payments handled in\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   as opposed to the step payments discussed here, it is ultimately unpersuasive in both contexts. As Judge Lynch pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Miceli\n   </em>\n   , there is no conflict between sections 1325(a)(5)(B) and 1326(b).\n   <em>\n    Miceli\n   </em>\n   , 587 B.R. at 497-98. Section 1326(b)'s optionality does not override the requirements of section 1326(a)(5)(B). In cases where there are no secured creditors, section 1326(b) allows the payments to attorneys to occur before the payments to unsecured creditors. However, when there are in fact secured creditors, stepping and therefore delaying payments to secured creditors cannot occur without the consent of the secured creditors, and thus without that consent, the payments under section 1326(b) will happen at the time of the payment to such creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In either case, that is not the crux of the court's ruling today. Remember that it is the payment scheme set forth in the National Plan that Semrad is attempting to change with nonstandard plan provisions. The National Plan follows the payment structure required by the Bankruptcy Code. Does section 1326 allow for a different structure in certain circumstances? Yes, that is one of the points of allowing nonstandard plan provisions. Does the fact that one Bankruptcy Code section permits an action override the specific restraints in another? Of course not. There are uses of the timing set forth in section 1326 that do not offend section 1325(a)(5). But those that do are impermissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The ruling today is limited to the question of what constitutes acceptance in light of a chapter 13 trustee's objection to nonstandard plan provisions under section 1325(a)(5), where no express acceptance has been provided to meet the debtor's burden thereunder. It is also about the inherent lack of good faith in pursuing such a plan, which is a determination independent from the statutory permissibility of the proposed provisions in a vacuum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, it is the court's conclusion that the Objection is well taken. As a result and by an order entered concurrently with this Memorandum Decision, confirmation of the Debtor's Plan will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   This matter comes before the court on Trustee Marilyn O.

The court, having jurisdiction over the subject matter, all necessary parties appearing at the confirmation hearings that took place, including the final hearing on May 10, 2018 where the matter was taken under advisement; the court having considered the arguments of all parties in their filings and at the hearings; and in accordance with the Memorandum Decision of the court in this matter issued concurrently herewith wherein the court found that the Objection was well taken,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Objection is SUSTAINED.
