Sacca, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issue before the Court is whether the exception to the automatic stay in \u00a7 362(b)(4) for a governmental unit exercising its police and regulatory powers is broad enough to include the imposition of sanctions by a court, including incarceration, in connection with a motion to compel discovery and for contempt against a non-attorney debtor in a post judgment collection proceeding. This Court concludes it is not so broad and that such proceedings are subject to the automatic stay. Although that conclusion seemed rather obvious to this Court, there does exist some case law - including at the level of the federal courts of appeal - that makes the issue more confusing than it should be with respect to which fact situations the exception should be applied in the context of sanctions motions and orders in non-bankruptcy forums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtor Shawntae Harris (\"Ms. Harris\") filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief on August 18, 2018. She filed this Adversary Proceeding on August 22, 2018, seeking injunctive relief against the continuation of state court proceedings on a Motion to Compel Discovery and for Contempt (the \"Motion\") filed by Creditor Shayla Stevens (\"Ms. Stevens\") by and through her counsel, Tozzi Law, LLC (\"Tozzi Law\") [Adv. Doc. 1]. Because a hearing in the state court was scheduled for August 24, 2018 on account of Ms. Harris' failure to appear at a post-petition contempt hearing in the state court on August 20, 2018, this matter came on for an expedited hearing before this Court on August 23, 2018, at which time the Court announced on the record that it was granting a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") to maintain the status quo while the Court considered the issue of whether the automatic stay applied to the state court proceeding [Adv. Doc. 6]. After a continued hearing on September 6, 2018, the Court extended the TRO until October 16, 2018 and scheduled an additional hearing on the matter for that date [Adv. Doc. 11]. The relief sought by Ms. Harris is a determination that the automatic stay applied to the contempt proceedings in the Cobb County Superior Court such that the hearing that took place on August 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   was a violation of the stay and that sanctions should be levied against Ms. Stevens and Tozzi Law for \"causing the [August 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ] hearing to go forward.\" [Adv. Doc. 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   THE STATE COURT PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Motion to Compel Discovery and for Contempt was filed in the Cobb County Superior Court on April 26, 2018. It arises\n   out of Ms. Stevens' attempt to collect a judgment in her favor against Ms. Harris in the amount of $6,400,000 that was rendered by the Superior Court of Cobb County on March 3, 2014, a fi. fa. for which was issued on May 20, 2014 [Civ. Case No. 11-1-6943]. On August 1, 2018, the Honorable Reuben M. Green of the Cobb County Superior Court issued an order granting the motion, ordering Ms. Harris to produce all documents related to the motion, and awarding reasonable expenses and attorney's fees. The order further stated that: \"\n   <em>\n    Unless\n   </em>\n   [the production of documents and payment of fees and expenses]\n   <em>\n    have been fully complied with\n   </em>\n   [by August 10, 2018], all parties and counsel shall report...on August 13, 2018...at which time the Court will determine whether to hold Shawntae Harris in willful contempt.\" [emphasis added]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to the August 13\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, Ms. Harris' former state court counsel Durante Partridge filed a Request for Clarification and a Response to Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents asserting that Ms. Harris had substantially complied with discovery requests and seeking clarification as to the scope of some of the Ms. Stevens' document production requests. During the compliance hearing on August 13, 2018, Ms. Stevens' state court counsel, Douglas Tozzi, told Judge Green that he was amenable to giving Ms. Harris another week to produce additional documents [Adv Doc. 13, p. 21]. The transcript from the hearing reveals the following;\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Judge Green: So I want this stuff produced. I want this resolved, whether that's paying the total judgment or y'all work something out, fine. It doesn't matter to me. But I don't want to see you all back in front of me on discovery dispute. So you either give the stuff or you go to jail until they come in and show me all the line items they want and you provide every one of those line items. [Adv Doc. 13, p. 22-23].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   * * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Judge Green: Anything else other than the two dates that I've said, that you need?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Tozzi: No, Your Honor, Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Judge Green: All right.

If it's sufficient for you to do the deposition and then you want more discovery after that, we can address more discovery in the future. But I don't want to make everybody come if we're close to compliance, at least sufficiently close that you can do your deposition. [Adv. Doc. 13, p. 29-30].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   * * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On or around Thursday, August 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Mr. Partridge informed Mr. Tozzi that he was terminated by Ms. Harris, although this is disputed by Ms. Harris.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 17\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Mr. Tozzi stated in an email to Judge Green's Staff Attorney regarding the August 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing: \"I suspect we will need to attend the compliance hearing as I am uncertain as to the current status given this [Mr. Partridge's termination] development.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [Adv. Doc. 7]. Ms. Harris filed her petition under Chapter 11 the next day on August 18, 2018 [Bkry. Doc. 1] and informed the state court and opposing counsel of that fact prior to the August 20, 2018 hearing. Neither Ms. Harris' new state court counsel, Gary Freed, her bankruptcy counsel, Shayna Steinfeld, nor the Debtor herself attended the hearing on August 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   because they thought it was stayed on account of the bankruptcy, and that Mr. Partridge would appear to advise Judge Green of the bankruptcy. Judge Green clearly thought otherwise and issued a rule nisi setting a hearing on August 24\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   to address Ms. Harris' contempt regarding discovery and the failure to appear. Ms. Harris filed this adversary proceeding to stay the hearing scheduled for the 24\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and obtain a permanent injunction against further proceedings in the state court on August 22, 2018 [Adv.

Ms. Stevens was conducting discovery in order to further the ultimate goal of collecting the $6.4 million judgment in her favor against Ms. Harris. Ms. Stevens filed the Motion in order to request the state court's assistance in compelling Ms. Harris to produce documents and to sanction her with a monetary penalty to reimburse Ms. Stevens for costs for Ms. Harris' perceived reticence in complying. While it is certainly in the public interest generally for parties to be able to collect judgments, it defies rational thought to assert that a court addressing a motion to compel or for contempt brought by the party seeking to collect a monetary judgment is somehow acting to \"effectuate public policy\" to a greater degree than it is assisting a private litigant in exercising her right to discovery and ability to collect that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ms. Stevens argues in her responses [Adv. Doc. 7, 13] that Judge Green was proceeding sua sponte as to the hearings on August 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and August 24\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and, therefore, the proceedings were exempt from the stay under \u00a7 362(b)(4). To support the claim that the August 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing was sua sponte, Ms. Stevens attached a portion of the hearing transcript for the August 13\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing [Adv. Doc. 13]. Rather than support the claim that the Judge was proceeding sua sponte, the transcript clearly shows that Judge Green was acting in response to the Motion of Ms. Stevens and was relying on the representations of Mr. Tozzi as to whether Ms. Harris complied in order to determine how (and if) to proceed with the August 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing. [\n   <em>\n    See excerpts from transcript above\n   </em>\n   ]. In addition, this Court is not persuaded by Ms. Stevens' contention that Judge Green was proceeding on his own motion because the Rule Nisi was \"prepared by and issued by the trial court.\" [Adv Doc. 13, p. 2]. Whether Judge Green chose to have one of the parties submit an order or chose to prepare the order himself is not dispositive of the question of whether the proceeding was sua sponte. The Motion was filed because Ms. Stevens sought the trial court's assistance in forcing Ms. Harris to more fully comply with the production of documents. Ms. Stevens also wanted to recover and was previously awarded the costs and expenses associated with being forced to bring the Motion in the first place. Judge Green would not have asked the parties to appear for a hearing on the 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   had Mr. Tozzi informed the court that he was satisfied with the level of compliance because Judge Green clearly states that when he tells Mr. Tozzi: \"If she is in, what\n   <em>\n    you believe to be\n   </em>\n   , sufficient compliance, even if it's not perfect, but if it's what you're comfortable with, let the other side know and\n   <em>\n    y'all don't need to come\n   </em>\n   on that Monday [August 20th] [emphasis added].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ms. Stevens relies on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals case of\n   <em>\n    Alpern v. Lieb\n   </em>\n   and the line of cases cited therein for her contention that \"[a] court entering a show cause order or imposing sanctions on its own volition, rather than the behest of a litigant, acts as a governmental unit in sanctioning parties.\" [Adv.

These holdings are unsurprising, because, as the court in\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   stated: \"[A]ttorneys are licensed by the state. Courts have an interest in punishing professional misconduct ... in order to prevent future acts of the same type.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6110722\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/74/546/\">\n    74 B.R. at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The sanctioning of an attorney or pro se litigant by a court for filing a frivolous lawsuit or appeal under Rule 11 or similar rule is more in the nature of an exercise of its regulatory powers and, therefore, could arguably fall within the exception carved out by \u00a7 362(b)(4). Leaving aside the issue of possible discipline of the Ms. Harris' former state court attorney, which would not be stayed, these cases are clearly distinguishable from the instant case because Ms. Harris is not an attorney and was not a pro se litigant and the contempt of court issue arose from Ms. Stevens' Motion to Compel Discovery and not on account of a frivolous lawsuit or appeal, and not from a court acting on its own volition or to otherwise regulate the practice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Alpern v.

For example, the reasoning therein that a private litigant bringing a Rule 11 motion is acting as a \"private attorney general\" so as to bring it within the scope of a governmental unit\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   exempt from the stay under \u00a7 362(b)(4) seems like a stretch to this Court, particularly when the rules of construction for that subsection call for a narrow interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Alpern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318952,6533194\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/689/\">\n    11 F.3d at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court would agree, however, that to the extent Alpern was going to persist with the appeal of the dismissal of his lawsuit\n   <em>\n    post-bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   , the court must have the authority and ability to regulate and sanction the conduct of the litigant before it without regard to the stay, at least as to the imposition, as opposed to the collection, of monetary sanctions. But where the underlying action is stayed by the filing of a bankruptcy case, such as what this Court has before it, what purpose is there to be served by pressing forward with a contempt motion related to a discovery dispute without obtaining relief from the automatic stay? There is simply no governmental police or regulatory power that would be advanced by allowing a state court to incarcerate a debtor for not producing documents in a post judgment collection action, the information in which documents the creditor could not even use to immediately collect the judgment because of the automatic stay, particularly when the creditor can try to obtain those same documents promptly in the bankruptcy proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Perhaps\n   <em>\n    Alpern\n   </em>\n   can be easily distinguished from this case based on the fact that Rule 11 specifically excludes discovery sanctions from within its scope. To the extent\n   <em>\n    Alpern\n   </em>\n   intended to go beyond that, including to permit a state court to incarcerate a debtor post-petition for failing to produce documents pre-petition in a post judgment collection action, this Court disagrees with it. Too many unnecessary questions arise with an expansive reading of\n   <em>\n    Alpern\n   </em>\n   with regard to the exception to the stay found in \u00a7 362(b)(4), an exception to the automatic stay that is otherwise supposed to be read and applied narrowly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition to this Court's concern with the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Alpern\n   </em>\n   , it is clear that at least one bankruptcy judge in the Seventh\n   Circuit - who was bound by its precedential authority - also did not agree with the reasoning of that case and found a way to rule that the stay did apply on facts virtually identical to those in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Benalcazar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349028\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/283/514/#p532\">\n    283 B.R. 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532 (Bankr.

Ms. Harris cannot escape her obligations for full financial disclosure in this Court.
