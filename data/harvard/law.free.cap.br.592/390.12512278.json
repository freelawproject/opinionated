FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant and others hosted and promoted events at nightclubs and other venues in the Atlanta area. Defendant sent blast texts to encourage others to attend these events. Between December 2012 and November 2015, Defendant used an automated system to send Plaintiff 112 text messages promoting such events. Plaintiff responded to the messages and requested Defendant to stop contacting him; he also registered on the national \"do-not-call\" registry. Defendant continued to contact Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2015, Plaintiff named Defendant as a defendant in a lawsuit in DeKalb County Superior Court and alleged Defendant violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the \"TCPA\")'s \"robocall\" and do not call restrictions by repeatedly sending him text messages after he asked Defendant to stop contacting him. No judgment was entered against Defendant, and the lawsuit was administratively closed on March 29, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant filed a petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 4, 2017. Plaintiff filed the complaint on July 3, 2017\n   seeking a determination a debt owed to him is nondischargeable pursuant to section 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code and to deny Defendant a discharge pursuant to sections 727(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code. On July 16, 2018, Plaintiff filed the Motion. Plaintiff asks the Court to find Defendant liable under the TCPA in the amount of $112,000 in actual damages, to treble the damages to $336,000, and to determine the claim is nondischargeable pursuant to section 523(a)(6). Plaintiff also seeks to deny Defendant a discharge pursuant to section 727(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code for failing to keep records of compensation he received in exchange for promoting events. Defendant responded to the Motion, Plaintiff filed a reply in support of the Motion, and Defendant filed a sur-reply. For the reasons stated below, the Court denies the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Apr. 11, 2012), the plaintiffs held a default judgment against the debtor based on violations of the TCPA and sought a determination the judgment was nondischargeable pursuant to section 523(a)(6). The bankruptcy court found the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence the debtor either deliberately or intentionally inflicted injury on them or the debtor's actions created an objective substantial certainty of harm to plaintiffs. The court found plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden of proof to show the debt arose from a \"willful and malicious injury\" as contemplated by section 523(a)(6). The court noted the debtor had violated the TCPA in other instances and might not be a sympathetic figure but, nevertheless, exceptions to discharge must be protected and the burden of proof properly sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the undisputed facts show by a preponderance of the evidence Defendant willfully and maliciously injured him. There has been no adjudication Defendant willfully and knowingly violated the TCPA; in fact, there has been no determination Defendant violated the TCPA at all. Defendant concedes he may have acted recklessly in sending Plaintiff blast texts, but he disputes he sent the messages to cause Plaintiff injury and Plaintiff has not established Defendant desired to injure him when he sent him the messages. Thus, disputed issues of fact remain including whether Defendant had a subjective motive to injure Plaintiff or believed his conduct was substantially certain to cause injury to Plaintiff. Accordingly, summary judgment is not warranted under section 523(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    b.
