Flechas (Flechas) is an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Mississippi. According to the web site of the Secretary of State of the State of Mississippi, Flechas created the law firm of Flechas &amp; Associates, P.A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Debtor) in\n   2002. Flechas is listed as the incorporator, director, and president of the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In October of 2007, the Debtor entered into\n   <em>\n    Contract[s] of Employment\n   </em>\n   (Employment Contracts) with five (5) separate parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor filed suit on behalf of these five (5) plaintiffs, and the case was styled\n   <em>\n    Rosalyn Simon, by and through Loraine Simon, Her Natural Mother, Adult Next Friend and Guardian Ad Litem; Ken'driana Gibbs, by and through Donzella January, Her Natural Mother, Adult Next Friend and Guardian Ad Litem; Petra \"Ron\" Chess, by and through Louise Chess, Her Natural Mother, Adult Next Friend and Guardian Ad Litem; Davion Norton, by and through Eva Norton, His Natural Mother, Adult Next Friend and Guardian Ad Litem,; and Alexandria Nickel, by and through Belinda Nickel, Her Natural Mother, Adult Next Friend and Guardian Ad Litem, v. Texaco, Inc.; Chevron Corporation; Estate of W. Joe Brown d/b/a Brown Auto Parts; and John Does 1-10\n   </em>\n   (Simon Litigation). The case was filed in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Mississippi, and assigned Cause No. 2007-110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Simon Litigation involved an allegation that the plaintiffs suffered injuries as a result of ground water contamination from underground storage tanks allegedly owned and maintained by the defendants and/or their successors in interest. While the Simon Litigation was pending, the Debtor associated two additional attorneys to serve as co-counsel in the Simon Litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Cupit/Moak Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 12, 2009, Danny Cupit, and Robert W. \"Bobby\" Moak (Cupit/Moak) entered into a contract styled\n   <em>\n    Assignment Agreement\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Cupit/Moak Contract) with Flechas. The first paragraph of the Cupit/Moak Contract states \"THIS AGREEMENT is made on the 12th day of November, 2009, between Eduardo A.

In exchange for up to $100,000.00, Flechas agreed to \"assign to Cupit and Moak each ... 7.5% of the total amount of attorney's fees collected\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   or stated another way, 15% of Flechas' 50% contingent fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Cupit/Moak allege that Flechas represented to them that he had not entered into any other similar contracts like the Cupit/Moak Contract.\n   <em>\n    See Affidavit of Robert W. \"Bobby\" Moak,\n   </em>\n   Adv. Proc. No. 1700006EE, Adv. Dkt. # 161-1, Exhibit A,\n   \u00b6 6-7 (June 8, 2018). Cupit/Moak disbursed a total of $99,800.00 to Flechas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the time that the Cupit/Moak Contract was entered into with Flechas, Cupit and Moak were attorneys licensed to practice law in Mississippi. Cupit and Moak were never in the same law firm as Flechas nor were they counsel of record for the plaintiffs in the Simon Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    MCF Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 15, 2011, MCF AF, LLC (MCF) and the Debtor entered into a\n   <em>\n    Confidential Judgment Purchase and Sale Agreement\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (MCF Contract). The second paragraph of the MCF Contract states \"[t]his Agreement is entered into at Los Angeles, California as of March 15, 2011, by and between Flechas &amp; Associates, P.A. (\"Seller\") and MCF AF, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Buyer\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   MCF paid the Debtor $295,500.00 in exchange for the Debtor selling $600,000.00 of the Debtor's attorney's fees in the Simon Litigation to MCF. In order to perfect its security interest, MCF filed a\n   <em>\n    UCC Financing Statement\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Financing Statement) on April 12, 2011.

The first paragraph of the WAG Contract states: \"[t]his Contingent Fees Purchase Agreement (\"AGREEMENT\") is dated May 14, 2012, and is between Eduardo Flechas, Esq. (\"ATTORNEY\"), individually, FLECHAS &amp; ASSOCIATES, P.A. (\"LAW FIRM\") ... and THE GRACE PARTNERSHIP....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   WAG paid the Debtor $66,000.00 in exchange for the Debtor selling $99,000.00 of the Debtor's attorney's fees in the Simon Litigation and other pending litigation of the Debtor. The Debtor did disclose to WAG, LLC (WAG) that it had previously assigned $200,000.00 of the attorney's fees from the Simon Litigation (and two other cases) to MCS Capital, LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The WAG Contract provides that WAG's \"claims shall be limited to fees remaining AFTER MCS Capital LLC has been paid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor did not disclose\n   the Cupit/Moak Contract or the MCF Contract to WAG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Simon Litigation Settlement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On or about August 11, 2010, a jury in the Simon Litigation returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The verdict was for $19,000,000.00, however, the court subsequently reduced the verdict to a final judgment of $16,829,372.00. The defendants appealed the final judgment to the Supreme Court of Mississippi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In September of 2013, the Simon Litigation plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement with the defendants. In exchange for total releases of the defendants and dismissal with prejudice of the Simon Litigation, the plaintiffs agreed to accept $3,500,000.00 (Simon Litigation Settlement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Flechas had other clients with claims similar to the Simon Litigation plaintiffs, but these claims had not been litigated. Out of the aggregate settlement amount, Flechas allocated $2,000,000.00 to the Simon Litigation. He allocated the remaining $1,500,000.00 to his clients whose claims had not been litigated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Out of the Simon Litigation Settlement, Flechas disbursed portions of his attorney's fees to various parties, but did not tender any funds to Cupit/Moak, MCF or WAG. Instead of paying Cupit/Moak, MCF, and WAG, Flechas filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion to Interplead and for Joinder of Parties\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (State Interpleader Motion) in the Chancery Court of Jefferson County, Mississippi. The State Interpleader Motion states \"[i]n 2007, the Defendant, Eduardo A. Flechas, and the law firm of Flechas &amp; Associates, P.A. (\"Flechas\"), were retained to represent five (5) plaintiffs in an environmental action (\n   <em>\n    Rosalyn Simon, et al. v. Texaco, Inc., et al.;\n   </em>\n   In the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Mississippi; Cause Number 2007-110).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It was at this point that Cupit/Moak, MCF, and WAG learned not only of each other, but also learned of other lending entities with whom Flechas and/or the Debtor had entered into contracts. Flechas and/or the Debtor sold, assigned or pledged a portion of the fees from the Simon Litigation to these parties in exchange for cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the State Interpleader Motion, Flechas interplead $240,601.29 (Simon Litigation Funds). Flechas asserted that this was the balance of the fees owed to him from the Simon Litigation after the deduction of other fees and expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cupit/Moak joined the State Interpleader Motion as a defendant and filed a counter-claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   MCF and some of the other named parties to the State Interpleader Motion, filed suit against Flechas and the Debtor in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. (Case No. 3:13-cv-000621-DPJ-FKB) (District Court Litigation) instead of joining the State Interpleader Motion. The parties rigorously proceeded with the District Court Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Meanwhile in the State Interpleader Motion, the chancellor dismissed Flechas' interpleader motion and transferred Cupit/Moak's counter-claim to the Jefferson\n   County Circuit Court. In the Jefferson County Circuit Court, Flechas and Cupit/Moak filed competing motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Filing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On November 26, 2013, MCS Capital, LLC filed\n   <em>\n    Involuntary Petitions\n   </em>\n   under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code against the Debtor (Flechas &amp; Associates, P.A.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Eduardo A. Flechas\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Flechas). On October 20, 2015, the Debtor and Flechas withdrew their opposition to the involuntary petitions and consented to the filing of Chapter 7 bankruptcy petitions. In January of 2016, the Debtor and Flechas converted their cases to Chapter 11s. Then on March 22, 2016, the Debtor and Flechas converted their cases back to Chapter 7s, which is the current status of the cases. Stephen Smith was appointed the Chapter 7 Trustee in both cases. After the bankruptcy cases were filed, litigation between the parties proceeded in the District Court Litigation and in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On September 30, 2016, this Court entered an\n   <em>\n    Order Granting Motion for Release of Funds and Pay to Registry of the Court\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   in both bankruptcy cases. This order authorized the Chancery Clerk of Jefferson County, Mississippi, to release the Simon Litigation Funds received from the Debtor and Flechas (as a result of the State Interpleader Motion) to the Chapter 7 Trustee, Stephen Smith (Trustee). Subsequently, the Trustee received the Simon Litigation Funds from the Chancery Clerk of Jefferson County, Mississippi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Adversary Proceeding\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On January 12, 2017, the Trustee commenced the above-styled adversary proceeding with the filing of the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   (Complaint). In the Complaint, the Trustee states that he received $240,295.29\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the Jefferson County Chancery Clerk and that each of the defendants named in the Complaint asserted a claim of some type against the Simon Litigation Funds. The Trustee was unable to determine the extent, validity, or priority of the defendants' claims, therefore, the Trustee requested the authority to interplead the Simon Litigation Funds into the registry of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court entered the\n   <em>\n    Order Granting Motion for Interpleader\n   </em>\n   (Adv. Dkt. # 27) (Interpleader Order) on February 3, 2017. The Interpleader Order states that \"[t]he fact that the payment of the funds is in the Flechas &amp; Associates, PA bankruptcy case (Case No. 13-03549 EE) is a convenience for the procedure of the interpleader and is not an adjudication that the funds are property of the Flechas &amp; Associates, PA bankruptcy case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The defendants filed answers to the Complaint and cross-claims against each other. A scheduling order was entered and discovery was conducted. The scheduling order was extended four or five times. Due to developments in the District Court Litigation (discussed below), on May 22, 2018, the parties entered into a\n   <em>\n    Scheduling Order for Dispositive Motions\n   </em>\n   (Adv. Dkt. # 159).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The two motions which are relative to this Opinion were filed by Cupit/Moak and MCF. On June 8, 2018, the\n   <em>\n    Motion of Bobby Moak and Danny E.

The MCF Contract and WAG Contract are valid and binding contracts with the Debtor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The Employment Contracts were not signed by Flechas in his individual capacity. Since the Employment Contracts were between the Simon Litigation plaintiffs and the Debtor, the Debtor is the only party who could enter into a contract to sell or assign the attorney's fees associated with the Employment Contracts. Cupit/Moak do not have privity of contract with the Debtor, therefore, Cupit/Moak do not have a lien on the fees earned by the Debtor in the Simon Litigation.
