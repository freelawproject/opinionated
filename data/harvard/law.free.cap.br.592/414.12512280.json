Stewart, Jr. (\"Stewart\"), is dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DeWitts contend that the bankruptcy court should have excepted Stewart's alleged obligation from discharge pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record establishes that the DeWitts satisfied their burden of proving: (1) all of the necessary elements for a claim of nondischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A); and (2) that Stewart should be personally liable for the debt owed to them by Boardwalk by piercing Boardwalk's corporate veil under New Hampshire law. Accordingly, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the Judgment as to \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Stewart is the owner of Data Industries, Inc., which did business as Boardwalk North (\"Boardwalk\"), a company specializing in home remodeling. In June 2013, the DeWitts entered into a contract with Boardwalk, whereby Boardwalk agreed to renovate the DeWitts' New Hampshire home for $1,649,936.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The contract included a three-page payment schedule based on the \"start of\" certain construction milestones.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the commencement of each of these specified milestones, the contract required the DeWitts to pay to Boardwalk the sum of $41,931.81. The contract did not explicitly state, however, how the milestone payments were to be disbursed or allocated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to a change order executed on August 2, 2013 (the \"Change Order\"), the contract amount was reduced to $1,300,000. One year later, when the project was only 45% complete, and after the DeWitts had paid Boardwalk a total of $1,175,350, Boardwalk abandoned the project. In September 2014, Boardwalk filed a petition for chapter 7 relief. Stewart's own chapter 7 bankruptcy petition followed several months later. The DeWitts have since paid a new contractor an additional $730,000 to complete the project, far more than the remaining contract balance of $175,755. The DeWitts filed a proof of claim in Stewart's case, indicating that they held an unsecured claim in the amount of $558,335.28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Bankruptcy Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 26, 2015, the DeWitts commenced an adversary proceeding against\n   Stewart with a thirteen-count complaint which they subsequently amended (the \"Amended Complaint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Amended Complaint, the DeWitts alleged that Stewart, the sole shareholder, president, and treasurer of Boardwalk, operated that company as his \"alter ego ... to perpetrate injustice and fraud upon\" them. The DeWitts further alleged that Stewart \"made numerous false representations to induce [them] into a contract with\" Boardwalk, \"misappropriated [their] advance payments and deposits ..., paid his personal expenses with those funds, and utilized Boardwalk['s] bank account as his own personal checking account.\" Accordingly, they claimed the \"fiction\" that Boardwalk was independent of Stewart \"should be disregarded\" and Stewart \"should be held personally liable for Boardwalk['s] breaches of contract, breaches of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, conversion, fraudulent misrepresentations, and violations of [N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7] 358-A\" (New Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act). They also sought a determination that Stewart was not entitled to a discharge in bankruptcy pursuant to \u00a7 727 or, alternatively, that Stewart's debt to them was not dischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In support of these claims, the DeWitts further alleged, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) \"In or about April 2013, [Stewart] met with the DeWitts concerning the renovation and addition to their home. [Stewart] personally represented that he had the skill, experience, and manpower to deliver a first-class Project by July 2014. [Stewart] personally represented that he had strong relationships with subcontractors and materials suppliers.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) \"The DeWitts hired Boardwalk .... The Contract was modified pursuant to an August 2, 2013 agreed change order ... reducing the total contract amount to $1,300,000.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) \"At the time of signing the Contract, [Stewart] requested, and the DeWitts paid, a $200,000 down payment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (4) \"Unbeknownst to the DeWitts, [Stewart] immediately began to misappropriate the DeWitts' deposit.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (5) \"On or about August 29, 2013, Boardwalk [ ] began work on the Project. [Stewart] required the DeWitts to make 'up front' installment payments tied to various \"milestones.\" [Stewart] personally represented to the DeWitts that paying in advance for work would allow him to negotiate the best possible prices with subcontractors and would save the DeWitts substantial sums of money. In reliance on [Stewart's] representations, the DeWitts made such installment payments, never refusing to pay for a milestone once work had been started. [Stewart's] representations, however[,] were false.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (6) \"[Stewart] also proposed that the DeWitts could receive up to $20,000 in prepaid milestone 'discounts' in exchange for an additional $172,000 up-front deposit, which the DeWitts made. This deposit was in addition to the $200,000 deposit the DeWitts initially paid. The Contract required that Boardwalk ... would pay all subcontractors and material suppliers for labor and materials used on the Project, and would hold the DeWitts' funds in trust for use on their Project. Instead, [Stewart] used\n   the DeWitts' deposits and advance milestone payments to pay debts unrelated to the Project, including the [Stewart's] personal obligations and expenses.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (7) \"On July 18, 2014, one of Boardwalk['s] subcontractors, Manning Drywall, sent the DeWitts a notice of intent to file a mechanic's lien against the Project.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (8) \"On July 22, 2014, the DeWitts met with [Stewart]. At that meeting, [Stewart] stated that [he] was in the process of 'recapitalizing the company' but gave no indication that the Project would not be completed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (9) \"Manning Drywall filed a lien against the Project ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (10) \"On or about July 24, 2014, [Stewart] notified the DeWitts by email that any financial difficulties had been resolved, and reiterated that Boardwalk intended to return to the Project to complete the work [ ].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (11) \"[T]his representation that financial difficulties had been resolved was false ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (12) \"The last day any person from Boardwalk [ ] was onsite performing substantive construction work was August 11, 2014. [Stewart] refused to return to the Project to complete construction and abandoned the Project.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on the foregoing allegations, the DeWitts asserted seven counts under state law, four \u00a7 523(a) counts, and two \u00a7 727(a) counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   note 4,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . After substantial winnowing of the issues, the bankruptcy court tried only two counts of the Amended Complaint-Count VIII, the \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) claim, and Count XI, the \u00a7 523(a)(6) claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A summary of each witness's testimony on direct examination follows in the same order it was presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Sheila DeWitt\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Sheila DeWitt (\"Mrs. DeWitt\"), a scientist with a Ph.D. in chemistry, testified regarding a variety of topics, ranging from the seeds of the parties' relationship to the numerous ways in which the DeWitts claim Stewart misrepresented his ability,\n   Boardwalk's financial condition, and the purpose of the DeWitts' payments. She began by explaining that when she and her husband, Joseph DeWitt (\"Mr. DeWitt\"), moved to New Hampshire in 2000, they purchased a house suitable for their community \"outreach,\" including serving meals to homeless individuals. Because the DeWitts' expanding community work eventually demanded more space, they embarked upon a home renovation project in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The DeWitts set a renovation budget of $700,000 to $1,000,000 and searched for a contractor. In March 2013, they met Stewart at a New Hampshire home show, where he had set up a booth for Boardwalk. During their first conversation with Stewart, the DeWitts described their renovation project as \"large scale,\" and Stewart responded that he was \"well qualified\" for such an undertaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The DeWitts subsequently began a \"[due] diligence process,\" which included sending emails to potential contractors containing a set of questions drafted by Mrs. DeWitt. On March 23, 2013, Stewart received one of Mrs. DeWitt's \"vetting\" emails, which included the following inquiries: (1) \"What were your annual revenues and number of jobs for 2011 and 2012 (separated by year)?\"; and (2) \"What are your revenue projections for 2013 (without [the] DeWitt project)?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On March 24, 2013, Stewart responded that for the year 2011, Boardwalk's revenues were $2,300,000. For the same period, however, Stewart's financial records for Boardwalk later disclosed during the course of discovery showed revenue of $1,948,000, and Boardwalk's tax return indicated revenue of $1,946,000. For the year 2012, Stewart reported to Mrs. DeWitt that Boardwalk had revenues of $1,700,000. Yet, Boardwalk's 2012 tax return for that year later revealed income of $1,500,000. Stewart further disclosed to Mrs. DeWitt that Boardwalk's income for the first quarter of 2013 was $1,200,000, while Stewart's financial records for that period showed income of approximately $335,000. Moreover, Stewart \"indicated that his company was doing extremely well,\" that \"[h]e had a large and experienced team, [and] a long and healthy track record of success in building high-end homes,\" and that the DeWitts \"should have trust and confidence in him and his team.\" In addition, Stewart represented that he had \"excellent relationships\" with subcontractors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mrs. DeWitt testified that, had the DeWitts known Boardwalk's actual revenues, they would have selected a different contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mrs. DeWitt's testimony then shifted to the documents which memorialized the parties' agreements. The first was a \"design fee purchase agree[ment]\" (the \"Design Agreement\") executed by the parties on April 19, 2013, pursuant to which Stewart (on behalf of Boardwalk) agreed to furnish a design proposal to the DeWitts at a cost of $2,895. The Design Agreement indicated an anticipated price range of $700,000 to $1,000,000 for completion of the project, and called for a \"Good Faith Deposit\" of \"approximately 10-15% of the estimated [s]elling price of project.\" Appended to the agreement was a document captioned \"DeWitt Design Parameters,\" which similarly indicated a price range of $700,000 to $1,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On June 26, 2013, the DeWitts paid Stewart \"a good faith deposit\" of $200,000 (the \"first deposit\"). This deposit significantly exceeded the amount called for in\n   the Design Agreement. The DeWitts voluntarily increased the amount of the required deposit \"in a good faith effort to continue a relationship with Boardwalk ....\" They were eager \"to start out on the right foot\" and believed that the first deposit would be applied to their project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The DeWitts saw the \"final contract\" for the first time on June 27, 2013-the day after they paid the $200,000 deposit. On that date, Stewart presented them with a Purchase Agreement which recited a project price of $1,649,936.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mrs. DeWitt explained that they were \"shock[ed]\" by this figure. With respect to payment, the Purchase Agreement provided: \"Payments to be made as the work progresses as per the Payment Schedule which is attached and made part of this Contract.\" The Payment Schedule listed 12 \"milestones,\" each linked to a $41,932 payment. Mrs. DeWitt testified that, when she and her husband saw the Purchase Agreement, they wanted \"to walk away,\" but \"felt trapped.\" They went forward despite their hesitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   During the course of the next six weeks, the DeWitts and Stewart's team met on several occasions in order to \"come up with alternative proposals.\" On August 2, 2013, the parties executed the Change Order, which reduced the price of the project to $1,300,000. Like the Purchase Agreement, the Change Order linked the payment schedule with the \"start of milestones.\" Stewart explained to the DeWitts that the purpose of the \"milestone payment\" approach was to \"leverage subcontractors, vendors and other resources that he needed ... so that he could move [the project] forward in a timely fashion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On August 27, 2013, at Stewart's request, the DeWitts made a second \"good faith deposit\" in the amount of $172,000 (the \"second deposit\") and the parties executed another payment schedule. Mrs. DeWitt testified that Stewart said this second deposit would increase \"efficiency on [the] project and ensure it was done.\" With respect to this deposit, her attorney inquired:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. [W]here did you understand that money was going to be spent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A. On our project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q. He told you that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q. And did you have any reason initially to believe that that was not true?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. No, not at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Notations on the August 27, 2013 Payment Schedule indicated that two of the progress payments (both paid on August 27, 2013) had been reduced from $40,619 to $38,588, reflecting a discount for prepayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As of August 27, 2013, work on the project had not yet begun, although the DeWitts had already paid Stewart about $450,000-consisting of the first deposit of $200,000, the second deposit of $172,000, and two prepaid milestone payments of $38,588 each. Work on the project site did not commence until two days later. Mrs. DeWitt testified that, according to Stewart, the prepayment of the milestones would enable him to hire subcontractors at a discount which he would \"pass ... on\" to the DeWitts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   When her attorney again asked, \"What were you told was going to happen with your money?\" Mrs. DeWitt answered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. We were told the money would be used for our project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q. To fund your project?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A. To fund our project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q. Would you have given this amount of money in advance to any contractor if you knew it was going to pay old bills?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. Never.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. Did you rely on Mr. Stewart's statement that you were, in fact, funding your own project?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A. We did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Q. Did you rely on that in terms of agreeing to this payment schedule?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. We did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A. Did you rely on that statement in terms of following the payment schedule?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Mrs. DeWitt further testified that she later learned Stewart had actually spent a portion of the $450,000 they paid-namely, $196,000-on jobs other than theirs. She repeated that she \"never\" would have paid the $450,000 if she had known Stewart was not using this sum to fund their own project. However, the DeWitts continued to make the prepayments upon request, believing that Stewart was applying the money exclusively to their project. For example, after the commencement of the project, on September 26, 2013, the DeWitts made two additional milestone payments totaling $77,176. Mrs. DeWitt stated that they continued \"to funnel money into Boardwalk\" because they \"felt trapped and wanted to ... get the project done.\" They subsequently learned, however, that Stewart used $51,000 out of the $77,176 paid \"on other expenses of Boardwalk.\" Throughout her direct examination, Mrs. DeWitt consistently testified that she and her husband had been told their payments were \"going to [their] project\" and that they would not have continued to pay money to Boardwalk if they had known that the payments \"were actually being used to pay old bills.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Although the DeWitts prepaid every milestone days or even weeks in advance, there were still project delays. Mrs. DeWitt testified that when they inquired about the cause for the delays, they were told Boardwalk \"couldn't get the ... subcontractors for the job.\" After Stewart had remained out of sight for eight months, he and Brian Lessard, a Boardwalk employee, finally met with the DeWitts and informed them that Boardwalk needed up to $360,000 to finish the project, even though the remaining balance due on their account at that time should have been $175,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Mrs. DeWitt then testified to a number of events which reflected Boardwalk's deteriorating financial condition. For example, on July 18, 2014, one of Boardwalk's subcontractors, Manning Drywall, sent the DeWitts a notice of intent to file a mechanics lien against the project. By then, the DeWitts had paid over $1,000,000 and their home was in shambles. On or about July 23, 2014, Manning Drywall filed a mechanics lien and two other subcontractors, Concord Lumber and Wetherbee Plumbing and Heating, soon followed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On July 24, 2014, Stewart notified the DeWitts that Boardwalk had \"resolved\" its financial difficulties and work on the project would resume. On July 30, 2014, the parties had a final meeting, during which Stewart asked the DeWitts if they would \"consider a mutual termination\" of their agreement. The DeWitts declined. On August 15, 2014, Boardwalk abandoned the project and, shortly thereafter, Stewart sent the DeWitts an \"As Built Policy Invoice,\" indicating that the DeWitts owed an additional $183,629, even though they had \"already paid in advance\" for work that had not been performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   These developments prompted the DeWitts to hire a new contractor, Hutter Construction (\"Hutter\"), who completed the project for $598,450.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Brian Lessard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Brian Lessard testified that he was employed by Boardwalk from 2006 through 2014-first, as its lead carpenter, then as its field site supervisor, and as its production manager. He ultimately became its vice president of operations. In 2013, when work on the DeWitts' project began, Lessard served as Boardwalk's vice president of operations, in charge of quality control. When questioned about Boardwalk's financial health as of April 2013, Lessard answered that the company was \"struggling\" and that it \"had a deficit.\" He described some of Boardwalk's relationships with subcontractors as \"strained\" or even \"bad.\" According to Lessard, Boardwalk had been charging some of its expenses to the personal credit card of Stewart's wife, Linda (\"Mrs. Stewart\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Consistent with Mrs. DeWitt's testimony, Lessard testified that he informed Boardwalk's clients that milestone payments enabled them to \"finance\" or \"fund\" their own projects. Lessard conceded that, in fact, milestone payments were collected to fund Boardwalk's business and improve its cash flow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In addition, Lessard testified regarding an email he sent to the DeWitts in which he used the word, \"leverage.\" Specifically, on March 4, 2014, Lessard wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   As far as the pre-payment goes, as you [can] imagine in order for us to offer this discount the idea is that we are leveraging your money to save money. So we would need to leverage your money for more th[a]n a couple days to [offset] the ($20,000.00 [overall] ) discount being applied. This program was designed with the intention that there would be multiple payments made at a time and that would allow us plenty of time to leverage and save money, with time being the catch. Having the benefit of your funds for a mere few days in return for such a large amount of money would be ill advised by even the most liberal accounts ... which is what he [Ed] believes the spirit of that agreement was all about, he said.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Lessard admitted that even though he told the DeWitts their payments were being \"leveraged\" with subcontractors to save money, this actually never occurred. According to Lessard, Stewart instructed him to \"find ways to start the milestones,\" even if not in the DeWitts' \"best interests,\" in order to \"keep the business moving forward\" and \"keep the company alive.\" In fact, even though the DeWitts had consistently prepaid the milestone payments, Boardwalk still had difficulty obtaining timely delivery of materials to the DeWitts' site. Lessard admitted that when the DeWitts inquired about the resulting project delays, he never informed them that Boardwalk's financial condition was \"the root of the problem.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Lessard testified that he regretted Boardwalk's treatment of the DeWitts, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   A. \"I'm not proud of the conduct of myself or the guys -- things were asked of the guys in the field to do or say.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q. ... \"Give me an example.\" ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A. \"Being elusive or deceitful.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Q. ...\"In what sense were you or your guys or other Boardwalk ... employees elusive and deceitful?\" ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A. ...[We were] blowing a lot of smoke and clouds [ ]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. ...\"To cover up the company's own financial problems\" ... ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A. \"Yeah.\"\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Despite all of the foregoing difficulties, Lessard testified, he had believed that Boardwalk would nonetheless finish the DeWitts' project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Linda Stewart\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Mrs. Stewart testified that she had worked for her husband in an administrative capacity since 1998. According to Mrs. Stewart, from 2009 to 2012, neither she nor her husband took a salary from Boardwalk. In May 2013, shortly after receiving a chapter 7 discharge in her personal bankruptcy case, Mrs. Stewart started receiving a $1,500 weekly salary from Boardwalk, which soon increased to $2,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Mrs. Stewart testified that in 2008, she and her husband obtained a $450,000 line of credit secured by their New Hampshire residence and applied a portion of the loan proceeds to Boardwalk's obligations and the remaining proceeds toward the purchase of a second home in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Lars Traffie\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Lars Traffie, president and CEO of Hutter, testified as an expert in the fields of residential construction, construction management, construction sequencing, construction billing, and construction industry standards. Traffie testified that the standard billing practice in the construction industry is to \"bill on a monthly basis based on the percentage completed and ... installed.\" According to Traffie, unlike Boardwalk, Hutter did not bill in advance for work not yet performed, unless a particular project required special fabrication of an item.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Traffie testified that based on his initial site visit in August 2014, he estimated the DeWitt project to be 45% complete. Upon his inspection, he discovered the structural integrity of the house was \"challenged,\" certain tasks were not sequenced properly, the master bedroom plumbing was not properly connected to the septic system, doors and windows had been installed without sealant, flashing was missing, and the roof had to be torn off. He stated that \"the sequencing was so inexplicable\" that one could conclude it was \"motivated by payment schedules.\" He quoted the DeWitts a price of $628,000 to finish the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Peter Pike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Peter Pike (\"Pike\"), a certified public accountant, testified that since 2010 or 2011, when he began working with Boardwalk, the company was always on the \"fringe of insolvency.\" He further testified that in February 2013 (only two months before Stewart met the DeWitts), Boardwalk was \"starting to come unraveled\" and the situation was \"dire.\" At that time, Boardwalk had sustained net operating losses for several consecutive years. In February 2014, Pike met with Stewart to discuss cash flow issues and a possible bankruptcy filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Edward T. Stewart, Jr.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   During his testimony, Stewart acknowledged that: he had never informed the DeWitts that Boardwalk was struggling; the Purchase Agreement was the largest contract he had ever signed; and he had given Mrs. DeWitt incorrect revenue figures for Boardwalk. Stewart agreed with Pike's testimony that Boardwalk \"had perpetual cash flow issues.\" In an effort to explain the discrepancy between the \"numbers\" he gave Mrs. DeWitt and Boardwalk's true financial condition, he testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   At the time, I was answering with my sales hat on, if you will, and salespeople\n   always think in terms of not revenue but in terms of sales.... So my answer was based [not] on revenue ... but sales.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Although Stewart admitted that when Boardwalk contracted with the DeWitts, a number of its subcontractors had already stopped extending credit to Boardwalk, he nonetheless insisted that he had good relationships with vendors and subcontractors. He claimed that he was \"flabbergasted\" when he received the notice of mechanics lien from Manning Drywall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A significant portion of Stewart's examination at trial was aimed at eliciting from him what he meant by \"funding\" one's project. Stewart agreed that he had informed the DeWitts their milestone payments were intended \"to fund their own project.\" On direct examination by his own attorney, Stewart testified that he used the milestone payment approach as a \"way to fund the project as you went through it.\" He stated: \"We always explain to the customer that these milestones were never intended to be completion points in time but rather the start of things. And again, they were just approximate times that we would ask for money throughout the project. \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Stewart admitted that he used the DeWitts' monies to operate Boardwalk but denied that he had told the DeWitts their milestone payments would be applied exclusively to their project. \"I've never told any client that,\" he insisted. He explained that when he received milestone payments from customers, he \"just deposited them into the general company account.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Stewart's testimony about the purpose of the second deposit was inconsistent. First, he disagreed that the $172,000 payment had anything to do with the DeWitts' eligibility for prepayment discounts, characterizing it, instead, as a \"good faith deposit part 2.\" He later conceded, however, that the second deposit was the price of obtaining a 5% discount on milestone payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Lastly, Stewart testified that, in August 2014 (i.e., the same month he abandoned the project), he borrowed $50,000 from his 401(k) retirement account to apply toward Boardwalk's obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Joseph DeWitt\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Mr. DeWitt testified that if he had known the truth about Boardwalk's financial condition, \"[Boardwalk] would have dropped out of the running.\" Mr. DeWitt reiterated that Stewart described his business as \"booming,\" and that he had the ability to \"get any subcontractors that he wanted.\" He also testified that Stewart assured him that he could complete the project within the DeWitts' budget of $700,000 to $1,000,000, but that it would \"be closer to a million.\" Later, according to Mr. DeWitt, Stewart confessed to him that the project never could have been finished for $1,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Mr. DeWitt described his meeting with Stewart on June 27, 2013-the day after the DeWitts paid Boardwalk $200,000 by wire transfer. During that meeting, Stewart revealed the price of $1,649,000 and Mr. DeWitt was \"stunned.\" When the DeWitts asked why the price was so high, Stewart blamed it on the DeWitts' add-ons. Yet, according to Mr. DeWitt, the parties had gone through a \"process of take things out, take things out ....\" When the DeWitts did add something, and asked about the cost of the change, Stewart would say: \"Joe, you can't tell until you get to the end of the project.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Mr. DeWitt testified that toward the end of July 2013, when the DeWitts met with Stewart, they announced they were \"done\" and stated that they wanted their \"money back.\" Stewart, in turn, asked: \"What will it take to save this project and what's the most you'll spend on this.\" This resulted in\n   a revised budget of $1,300,000. According to Mr. DeWitt, Stewart responded: \"We can do a house for that amount of money but we have to sign right now ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Mr. DeWitt also testified that the second deposit was \"money to secure the prepaid discount.\" He explained his understanding of the milestone payment schedule as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   A. The milestone schedule [ ] was set up [so] that we would pay money to [Stewart] in advance so he could use that money to leverage to get contractors to get any subsidy needed to get the equipment on site .... [Stewart] explained it so that he didn't have to have a big inventory of stuff and we didn't have to have delays to get stuff. He could have stuff just in time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Q. [ ] Did he tell you what was going to happen with your money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A. He was going to use it to fund our project. He was going to leverage that ... to get people to do the work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Memorandum Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The bankruptcy court began the analysis set forth in its 44-page Memorandum Opinion by \"assum[ing], without deciding, that [Boardwalk's] corporate veil has been pierced.\"\n   <em>\n    DeWitt v. Stewart (In re Stewart)\n   </em>\n   , Adv. Pro.

This assumption allows the Court to cut straight to the heart of the dispute between the parties-if Stewart's debts to the DeWitts are dischargeable, including those that would be imputed to him via veil-piercing-whether the corporate veil should actually be pierced is beside the point. Accordingly ... the Court shall refer to either the actions of [Boardwalk] or Stewart interchangeably.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203601196\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

They maintain that the \"trial court committed plain factual errors, as well as misinterpreted or misapplied the applicable law.\" The DeWitts' assertions of error focus on the bankruptcy court's finding that Stewart did not misrepresent how he was going to use their funds. They contend that in order to obtain deposits and prepayments which he used to fund his business, Stewart falsely represented that their money would be used to: (1) \"fund\" their project; and (2) \"leverage\" subcontractors. They claim, further, that Stewart intended for them to rely on his misrepresentations, they actually did rely on his misrepresentations, their reliance was justifiable, and they were harmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Moreover, in support of their \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) claim, the DeWitts argue that \"courts routinely refuse to grant a discharge where contractors have falsely represented their intent to use a creditor's funds for the creditor's project.\" The DeWitts ask the Panel: (1) to reverse the bankruptcy court's decision and \"find that the debt is excepted from discharge ...\"; and (2) for such other relief as the Panel \"determine[s] is just.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

He maintains that the parties had different understandings of the words \"fund\" and \"leverage.\" With respect to his use of the word \"fund,\" Stewart contends that the bankruptcy court correctly found: (1) his statements were \"too general to conclude that they were false\"; and (2) his alleged \"mis-sequencing\" of the project did not prove that his statements regarding \"funding\" the project were false. Stewart also argues he did not make any misrepresentations regarding the \"leveraging\" of subcontractors, asserting that the bankruptcy court correctly found that the DeWitts received the promised discount in exchange for their prepayments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   A bankruptcy appellate panel is duty-bound to determine its jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits, even if not raised by the litigants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Rivera Siaca v.

The \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) Standard Applied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The False Representation Element: Whether Stewart Made any Express Misrepresentations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The issue at the heart of this appeal is whether the record establishes that the DeWitts demonstrated the presence of a false representation (other than a statement respecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   by a preponderance of the evidence. On appeal, Stewart does not meaningfully challenge the DeWitts' assertions regarding the presence of the remaining \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) elements. Our task is to examine Stewart's conduct within the framework of the legal principles set forth above. From the record before us, several categories of misrepresentations by Stewart emerge, including his representations that: (1) he could complete the DeWitts' project within their budget; (2) the DeWitts' deposits would be applied to their project; and (3) the DeWitts' milestone payments would be used to \"fund\" their project and \"leverage\" subcontractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The False Representations Regarding the Budget and the First Deposit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The record demonstrates that, from the outset, the DeWitts were clear and consistent regarding their renovation budget-$700,000 to $1,000,000. They expressed their desire to complete the renovation within this price range to Stewart during their early communications with him and the budget became a term of the Design Agreement. Stewart not only assured the DeWitts that Boardwalk could complete the renovation within their budget but, according to his own testimony, he also\n   helped the DeWitts establish that budget. The DeWitts were unaware at this time-and Stewart did not disclose-that Boardwalk was already coming \"unraveled\" and the situation was \"dire\"; nor did Stewart reveal that any of his relationships with subcontractors were strained. Instead, Stewart described his business as \"booming.\" Persuaded in this manner that Boardwalk could not only complete their project, but do so within their budget, the parties' business relationship advanced; in April 2013, they executed the Design Agreement, which again identified the agreed-upon budget as $700,000 to $1,000,000 and included the DeWitt Design Parameters, echoing the same budget (while still failing to specify costs associated with the various line items). Pursuant to the terms of the Design Agreement, the DeWitts paid Boardwalk not only $2,895 to produce a design within budget, but also a $200,000 deposit. On June 26, 2013, the day after receiving the deposit, Stewart presented the DeWitts with a contract for the \"shock[ing]\" sum of $1,649,936, and then proceeded to use that deposit for purposes other than the DeWitt project. In fact, construction on the DeWitt site did not begin until a couple of months later and, by that time, the first deposit had been significantly dissipated. Based on this record, we conclude that Stewart misrepresented Boardwalk's ability to complete the DeWitts' renovation within budget and the purpose of the first deposit, in order to extract the deposit from them and to induce them to engage Boardwalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The False Representations Regarding the Second Deposit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   On August 27, 2013-still prior to the commencement of any construction work-the DeWitts paid yet another deposit, this time in the amount of $172,000. The DeWitts both testified that Stewart explained that the second deposit was intended \"to secure the prepaid discount.\" Stewart testified, alternately, that the second deposit was another \"good faith deposit\" and that the deposit would entitle the DeWitts to receive a 5% discount on prepaid milestone payments. Regardless of whether the second deposit is denominated as a \"good faith deposit\" or as consideration for a discount, one thing is clear and undisputed: Stewart did not use the entire deposit for the DeWitts' project and, much like the first deposit, the second was largely consumed by the time work on the site commenced. Given these circumstances, we conclude that the second deposit was procured through Stewart's fraudulent misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The False Representations Regarding Milestone Payments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Mrs. DeWitt repeatedly testified that Stewart informed the DeWitts their money was being applied to their own project. Stewart told her he would use their milestone payments to \"leverage subcontractors,\" and that their monies would \"fund\" their project. When Mrs. DeWitt asked Stewart what was meant by \"milestone payment,\" he answered that \"it was money to go into [their] project to leverage subcontractors, vendors and other resources that he needed to do [the] project so that he could move it forward in a timely fashion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Mrs. DeWitt's testimony was amply corroborated by other witnesses, including Mr. DeWitt, Lessard, and even Stewart. Mr. DeWitt reiterated throughout his direct examination that Stewart said he would use the DeWitts' payments to \"fund\" their project and \"leverage\" subcontractors. Mr. DeWitt recalled that Stewart told him that the milestone payments would also enable Stewart to acquire product \"just in time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   While Stewart denied stating that he would use the DeWitts' money\n   <em>\n    exclusively\n   </em>\n   on their project, he admitted that he told the DeWitts that their money would \"fund\" their project. Stewart also admitted that Boardwalk had experienced \"cash flow issues\" since 2008 and that he used the DeWitts' money to operate Boardwalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Lessard similarly testified: in 2013, Boardwalk was financially stressed; Boardwalk used the DeWitts' milestone payments to pay \"old bills\"; Stewart directed him to find ways to start milestones-even if not in the DeWitts' best interest-in order to generate milestone payments; Lessard told clients that milestone payments were intended to \"leverage\" subcontractors and to \"fund\" or \"finance\" their own projects; no \"leveraging\" of subcontractors occurred; Boardwalk was simply trying to improve its own cash flow with the DeWitts' payments; and, notwithstanding receipt of the DeWitts' milestone payments, Boardwalk was still unable to obtain certain goods and services timely, which resulted in project delays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   In addition, Traffie testified that the manner in which the project had been sequenced (or, more accurately, \"mis-sequenced\") suggested that certain tasks were commenced simply to generate milestone payments. For example, floor tile had been installed before HVAC work was completed, painting began before carpentry work was complete, and wallboard installed before electrical work was finished in the area of installation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the bankruptcy court's findings and conclusions supporting its decision that the DeWitts had not satisfied \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A)'s requirement of a fraudulent misrepresentation are irreconcilable with the evidence adduced at trial, and especially the bankruptcy court's findings that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   (1) Boardwalk's \"bad financial condition\" and \"relationships with subcontractors\" were \"peripheral to the transaction, at best.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203601196\">\n    2017 WL 3601196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   (2) \"Under the circumstances, terms like 'excellent' and 'good' were both indicative of the general proposition that [Boardwalk] had good working relationships with most of its subcontractors.

Moreover, the record does not support the bankruptcy court's essential findings that Stewart did not make any misrepresentations about the use of the DeWitts' funds (both the deposits and the milestone payments), the status of his relationships with his subcontractors, or the condition of Boardwalk's business. Rather, the record demonstrates that the DeWitts proved it is more likely than not that Stewart explicitly misrepresented that he would use their money only on their project and/or to leverage subcontractors on their project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, it is clear from the record that, when Stewart characterized Boardwalk's business as \"booming,\" its business was actually struggling and its relationships with a number subcontractors were strained due to nonpayment or late payment. With respect to these relationships, the question is not -as the bankruptcy court put it-whether they were \"good\" or \"excellent,\" but rather, whether they were fair or poor. Stewart, himself, conceded that a number of subcontractors had already stopped extending credit to Boardwalk by the time Boardwalk contracted with the DeWitts. Lessard described Boardwalk's relationships with its subcontractors as \"strained\" when the DeWitt project began. And, by summer 2014, three subcontractors had obtained mechanics\n   liens against the DeWitts' project. Boardwalk's desperate financial condition, as evidenced by its poor relationships with subcontractors and the testimony of its accountant, compels the inference that Stewart requested milestone payments and deposits to procure funds for the benefit of Boardwalk, rather than for the DeWitts' project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   In finding that Stewart made no misrepresentations regarding the use of the DeWitts' payments, the bankruptcy court committed several clear errors. First, it excessively discounted the testimony of the DeWitts, seemingly in favor of Stewart's testimony that he transferred $50,000 in August 2014 from his 401(k) retirement account to Boardwalk. It does not necessarily follow from Stewart's attempt to rescue his own company, however, that he had been honest in his dealings with the DeWitts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Second, in evaluating the collective testimony of the DeWitts, Stewart, and Lessard, the bankruptcy court appears to have ignored the plain meaning of the word, \"fund,\" which, in its verb form, means \"to allocate or provide funds for ... a project ....\" Fund Definition, Dictionary.com,\n   <em>\n    http://dictionary\n   </em>\n   , reference.com/browse/fund (last visited September 24, 2018). It also disregarded the ordinary meaning of \"deposit\"-\"anything given as security or in part payment.\" Deposit Definition, Dictionary.com,\n   <em>\n    http://dictionary\n   </em>\n   , reference.com/browse/fund (last visited September 24, 2018). Moreover, the cumulative testimony of the DeWitts, Stewart, and Lessard, persuades us that when Stewart told the DeWitts their payments would \"fund\" their project and when he requested deposits, he intended to communicate to the DeWitts that their monies would be applied solely to their project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Third, without offering any explanation, the bankruptcy court wholly ignored the testimony of Lessard that relationships with subcontractors were strained, as well as Pike's testimony that Boardwalk's financial condition was \"dire\" as of February 2013, and that the company had been on the fringe of insolvency for years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Alleged False Pretenses: Whether Stewart Made any Implied Misrepresentations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that Stewart did not\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   represent that he was going to use the DeWitts' funds exclusively on their project, the bankruptcy court erred by ignoring the question of whether he\n   <em>\n    impliedly\n   </em>\n   made such a representation. Indeed, the DeWitts alleged false pretenses as a theory of liability in the Amended Complaint. It is well established that an overt representation is not required by \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\n   <em>\n    In re Melo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344322\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/558/521/#p559\">\n    558 B.R. at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is a critical omission under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Cases considering the question of implied misrepresentation have often \"turned on whether the funds were 'entrusted' for a specific purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Fensick v.

We conclude that even if Stewart did not explicitly represent he would apply the DeWitts' monies exclusively to their project, the record, viewed as a whole, supports a conclusion that he impliedly made such false representations. The bankruptcy court committed clear error when: (1) it did not analyze whether Stewart obtained the DeWitts' money through false pretenses; and (2) it did not find that the DeWitts proved that Stewart obtained their money through false pretenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Intent to Deceive Element\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   The most compelling evidence regarding Stewart's intent to deceive is Lessard's testimony that he was \"not proud\" of his conduct or that of the other Boardwalk employees in connection with the DeWitt project. He admitted that they had been \"elusive or deceitful,\" that they were \"blowing a lot of smoke and clouds\" to conceal Boardwalk's financial problems, and that Stewart directed them to start milestones for the purpose of generating payments for Boardwalk's benefit. He also testified that leveraging of subcontractors never occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   This evidence contradicts the bankruptcy court's findings that: Stewart \"[n]either intended to convey false information to the DeWitts [n]or to deceive them\"; and that Stewart did not \"intend[ ] to mislead the DeWitts when he discussed leveraging subcontractors.\" Based on the totality of this record, we have \"a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Stewart's statements regarding his intended application of the DeWitts' funds, his plans to use their monies to leverage subcontractors, and his representation regarding his relationships with subcontractors, were all made with the intent to deceive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Reliance Element\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   On appeal, Stewart does not challenge the DeWitts' assertion that they relied on his false representations. Therefore, he has waived on appeal any issue relating to the elements of actual and justifiable reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

The Injury Element\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Because it concluded that Stewart was not guilty of any misrepresentations, the bankruptcy court did not make any findings regarding the injury element. Nonetheless, the record amply supports a conclusion that the DeWitts-who paid 90% of the contract price for a renovation project only 45% complete-suffered harm. Indeed, on appeal, Stewart does not challenge the DeWitts' assertion that they were harmed, except that he maintains that any harm was not deliberate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The DeWitts Satisfied Their Burden\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   In light of the record reviewed in its entirety, the bankruptcy court's account of the evidence is implausible. The foregoing analysis establishes that the DeWitts proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) Stewart explicitly misrepresented that he would use their money only on their project, that making milestone payments in advance would enable him to leverage subcontractors for the benefit of their project, and that he had excellent relationships with subcontractors; (2) Stewart intended to deceive the DeWitts; (3) Stewart intended to induce the DeWitts to rely on his misrepresentations; (4) the DeWitts actually relied on Stewart's misrepresentations; (5) the DeWitts' reliance was justifiable; and (6) the DeWitts were harmed. Thus, the appellate record demonstrates that each and every element of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) is present and has been proven, and that the bankruptcy court committed clear error when it concluded that \"any liability Stewart owes to the DeWitts should not be excepted from discharge pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Piercing the Corporate Veil\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Although we conclude that the bankruptcy court committed reversible error when it determined that Stewart did not make any false representations, that conclusion does not automatically result in a determination that Stewart owes a nondischargeable obligation to the DeWitts. We are still left with the issue of Boardwalk's corporate status and whether Stewart, under a veil-piercing theory, has personal liability to the DeWitts that may be excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). As noted,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , that statute provides that \"[a] discharge under section 727 ... does not discharge an individual debtor from\n   <em>\n    any debt\n   </em>\n   for money, property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the extent\n   obtained by false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Under New Hampshire law, corporate officers, directors, and shareholders are not liable for a corporation's debts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Antaeus Enters., Inc. v.

Moreover, the record establishes that Stewart was the sole officer, director and shareholder of Boardwalk. From the inception of his relationship with the DeWitts, Stewart used the corporate identity of Boardwalk to induce the DeWitts into doing business with him through Boardwalk. Indeed, when the parties first met, Stewart was promoting Boardwalk at a booth he erected at a home show. At that time, Stewart represented that Boardwalk was well qualified to undertake a renovation project of the magnitude of the DeWitts', that Boardwalk's business was thriving, and that Boardwalk had the ability to retain subcontractors. On the basis of Boardwalk's purported professional and financial qualifications, the DeWitts entered into both the Design Agreement and the Purchase Agreement with Boardwalk, and paid all of the milestone payments and deposits to Boardwalk. Stewart then deposited those monies into Boardwalk's general account and, instead of applying those sums solely to the DeWitts' project, he used a significant portion to satisfy the corporate obligations of Boardwalk, to pay himself a salary, and to pay his wife's credit card debt. Thus, the record shows that Stewart used Boardwalk's corporate form to promote an injustice against the DeWitts. Under these circumstances, the record supports piercing Boardwalk's corporate veil under New Hampshire law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the Judgment as to Counts I and VIII,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including, but not limited to, the entry of judgment in favor of the DeWitts as to those Counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    As discussed,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , although the DeWitts contracted with Boardwalk North (\"Boardwalk\"), in the underlying adversary proceeding they sought to impose personal liability upon Stewart by piercing Boardwalk's corporate veil.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, all references to \"Bankruptcy Code\" or to specific statutory sections are to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     etseq\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    Because we conclude the record establishes that the DeWitts satisfied their burden under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), we do not examine the propriety of the bankruptcy court's findings and rulings under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    Throughout this opinion, dollar amounts are frequently rounded to the nearest dollar.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    These milestones included, for example, the \"start of master bedroom addition demolition,\" the \"start of master bedroom addition excavation,\" the \"start of kitchen cabinets installation,\" and the \"start of kitchen appliance delivery,\" to name a few.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    The counts in the Amended Complaint are: (I) piercing the corporate veil; (II) breach of contract; (III) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (IV) negligence; (V) conversion; (VI) fraudulent misrepresentation and actual fraud; (VII) violation of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20358\">\n     N.H.

On August 18, 2016, the bankruptcy court granted Stewart's motion for summary judgment as to Counts IX (\u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) ) and X (\u00a7 523(a)(4) ), but deferred entering a final judgment on those Counts until after trial. (The Final Judgment which is the subject of this appeal includes Counts IX and X, as discussed on page 429-30,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    ). On November 22, 2016, the court further pared the claims under consideration when it issued a scheduling order that deferred the trial on the state law counts, based on jurisdictional concerns. That order provided:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n    The Court will hear the \u00a7\u00a7 523 and 727 counts first. At that time, the Court will hear all evidence necessary to determine whether the Debtor is entitled to a discharge and whether the Debtor's debts to the Plaintiffs are dischargeable. During this first phase of the trial the Court will not hear evidence that is exclusively relevant to the state law counts and will not hear evidence on the liquidation of the amount of any money damages. All evidence relating to the state law counts and any evidence necessary for the Court to enter a money judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs will be deferred until the second phase of the trial. At the conclusion of the first phase of the trial, the Court will enter a ruling on the \u00a7\u00a7 523 and 727 counts and will thereafter schedule the second phase of the trial if the Court finds it necessary and appropriate.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-249\">\n    On February 23, 2017, the bankruptcy court entered an order granting Stewart's motion for judgment on partial findings with respect to the DeWitts' claims under \u00a7 727(a)(2) (Count XII) and \u00a7 727(a)(4) (Count XIII), and denying that motion with respect to the DeWitts' claims under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) (Count VIII) and \u00a7 523(a)(6) (Count XI).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-250\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    testimony of Brian Lessard,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , indicating those relationships were actually strained.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-251\">\n    Although Mrs. DeWitt testified that the contract price was $1,650,000, the actual price stated on the Purchase Agreement was $1,649,936.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-252\">\n    The DeWitts claim that this email was \"ghost-written\" by Stewart.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-253\">\n    This testimony is an excerpt from Lessard's deposition, which he read into the record upon request during the trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-254\">\n    The record is unclear as to whether the contemplated bankruptcy filing was for Boardwalk as well as Stewart, individually.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-255\">\n    As noted,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of Stewart on Count IX, the DeWitts' \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    n.8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-256\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bezanson v.

The DeWitts repeatedly testified that they would not have hired Boardwalk had they understood its true financial condition and that they would not have made payments had they known their money was not being applied exclusively to their project. Furthermore, in concluding that the DeWitts did not satisfy their burden on the reliance element, the bankruptcy court overlooked the First Circuit's guidance in\n    <em>\n     Goguen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    .
