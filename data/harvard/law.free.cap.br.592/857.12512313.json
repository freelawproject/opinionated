Section 523(a)(9) relates to operation of a vehicle while intoxicated and does not apply to context of the plan in this case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Plan language regarding post-petition interest is not contrary to the existing contracts between the parties, or the applicable federal regulations and the Plan does not seek to discharge Debtors' student loan debts. The only provision in the Plan that seeks to modify Debtors' obligations to ECMC relates to payments, noting \"the Trustee shall pay dividends, to the extent possible, to allowed unsecured, non-priority claims on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   basis.\" 11-60127-BPH, ECF. No. 17, \u00b6 2(f), March 30, 2011. In effect, this provision modified the payment terms of the debts under the Plan,\n   but left the remaining contract terms intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   ECMC filed Claims 5 and 6 in Debtors' main bankruptcy case in the amounts of $74,347.32 and $11,901.93, respectively. The Claims note that they are unsecured and are not subject to priority, meaning the claims would be paid based on the\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   treatment referenced within the plan. Notably, Debtors' Chapter 13 plan contains no language modifying the application of payments to ECMC's loans. Since the Plan does not modify the application of funds to ECMC's loans, the terms of the underlying contracts between Debtors and ECMC that are consistent with the Plan remain in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

While ECMC cannot collect additional funds from the bankruptcy estate, ECMC properly applied the payments to its underlying debt obligation, and the remaining outstanding balance is not discharged under \u00a7 523 and remains an outstanding obligation payable by Debtors to ECMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Debtors, citing\n   <em>\n    In re Pardee,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11854747\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/218/916/#p930\">\n    218 B.R. 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir.

The\n   <em>\n    Pardee\n   </em>\n   Court correctly found that \u00a7 502(b)(2) disallows claims and recovery of unmatured interest from the bankruptcy estate. Ultimately, the\n   <em>\n    Pardee\n   </em>\n   Court held that the debtor's obligation was discharged based on the express language included in the plan. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Pardee\n   </em>\n   , the\n   Plan in this case does not contain express language purporting to discharge Debtors' student loan obligations, so the\n   <em>\n    Pardee\n   </em>\n   holding does not reach the issue before us and is inapplicable to the present analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court is similarly not persuaded by Debtor's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Educ.

Such cases are distinguishable. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Kirkland\n   </em>\n   , the 4th Circuit Court of appeals reviewed a Bankruptcy Court's determination regarding post-petition interest and collection costs. The Fourth Circuit's analysis related to whether post-petition interest claims fall within the Bankruptcy Court's subject matter jurisdiction. The Court acknowledged that post-petition interest cannot be claimed against the bankruptcy estate, but ultimately found that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to deny collection costs and award post-petition interest. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Kirkland\n   </em>\n   noted that the creditor could not include post-petition interest in its bankruptcy proof of claim, but the Court did not address the present matter: whether application of payments by the estate to interest, first, then to the outstanding principal balance, is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shelbayah\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   all assert that post-petition interest is not allowed as a claim against the bankruptcy estate. The\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shelbayah\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   courts all acknowledge that post-petition interest on student loans remains an obligation of the debtor at the conclusion of the plan, but none of the cases cited directly state that post-petition interest is the only obligation that remains outstanding following completion of a Chapter 13 plan. None of the cases referenced above reach the issue here relating to the application of plan payments to interest, then outstanding principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The Plan specifically provides that interest would continue to accrue post-petition on Debtors' nondischargeable student loan debt. Further, Debtors have not asserted undue hardship in this case. Since the undisputed facts provide no exception to \u00a7 523(a)(8), ECMC's debts remain outstanding and enforceable against Debtors following completion of the Chapter 13 plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that ECMC properly applied the payments made by the Trustee first to the interest, and then the principal of its underlying debts, consistent with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20682.209\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Further, nothing in the Plan nor \u00a7 502, alters this analysis. As a result, there remain outstanding amounts owing by Debtors to ECMC, and those amounts are attributable a student loan\n   debt and are not dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(8). Therefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that the Court will enter a separate order denying Debtors' motion for summary judgment and granting ECMC's motion for summary judgment.
