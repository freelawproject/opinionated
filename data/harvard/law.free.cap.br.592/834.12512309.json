The body of the document reads, in its entirety, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   WHEREAS, Beverly Kinser Swope died on March 4, 2013; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   WHEREAS, by will dated May 14, 1993, and subsequently probated in the Hamilton County Chancery Court, Beverly Kinser Swope bequeathed the residue of her estate to her children in equal shares; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   WHEREAS, Nekolia Beverly Grace Burke has not accepted any portion of the aforesaid inheritance due to her under Paragraph 3 of her mother's will;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-1-103\">\n    Tenn.

Nekolia Beverly Grace Burke hereby swears or affirms that she has not accepted, used or benefitted from any portion of the residuary estate of Beverly Kinser Swope.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff, who is the trustee for the chapter 7 bankruptcy estate of Nekolia Burke, seeks to recover the inheritance that Ms. Burke would have received from the estate of her deceased mother, Beverly Kinser Swope, under two theories. First, the Disclaimer of Interest effected a transfer of property of the debtor that is avoidable as a fraudulent transfer under subparagraphs\n   (A) and/or (B) of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Second, the Disclaimer of Interest was invalid under Tennessee law. The movants seek to dismiss the complaint as to the first theory pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), contending that the Disclaimer of Interest was not a transfer of the debtor's property. The movants seek to dismiss the second theory pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), contending that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over that count. The court will address the movants' arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Transfer of an Interest of the Debtor in Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With respect to the \"fraudulent conveyance\" theory, the movants assert that there was no transfer of the debtor's property, relying on section 31-1-103(c) of the Tennessee Code Annotated. That provision, in conjunction with section 32-3-105 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, provides that, when an interest in an inheritance is disclaimed, the interest passes to the issue of the disclaimer \"as if the person disclaiming had predeceased the decedent\" unless the testator's will provides otherwise. This provision codifies the relation-back doctrine. Under this doctrine, when a beneficiary under a will disclaims an inheritance, the disclaimer relates back to the time of the testator's death such that the testator's estate does not vest in the disclaiming heir but, instead, passes directly to the heirs of the disclaiming heir. Applying this statutorily prescribed legal fiction to this case, if the Disclaimer of Interest is valid, the portion of Ms. Swope's estate that Ms. Burke stood to inherit is deemed to have vested directly with Ms. Burke's issue, the movants, so that Ms. Burke never held a legal or equitable property interest in the probate estate. The movants maintain that, as Ms. Burke never held an interest in her mother's estate, the Disclaimer of Interest did not effect a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property that is subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   All five federal courts of appeals to address the issue have reached that very conclusion.\n   <em>\n    Gaughan v.

There, the Supreme Court addressed a circuit split over the ownership of rents. Some circuits followed state law in determining who received post-petition rents, whereas other circuits fashioned a federal rule of equity to allow mortgagees to receive the rents. Ultimately, the Court rejected the federal equity rule, explaining that \"Congress has generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt's estate to state law.\" Thus, \"[u]nless some federal interest requires a different result, there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Applying the principle of\n   <em>\n    Butner\n   </em>\n   to similar disclaimers, several appellate courts have found \u00a7 548 inapplicable. For example, the Seventh Circuit took a broad view of\n   <em>\n    Butner\n   </em>\n   , explaining that\n   \"[a]ll applicable state law must be construed to determine whether a debtor possesses a property interest,\" including the relation back rule. The contrary view, the court found, \"fail[ed] to give full application to the relation back doctrine under applicable state laws.\" Based on this deferential approach to state law, the\n   <em>\n    Atchison\n   </em>\n   court concluded that a disclaimer was not a \"transfer of an interest in property\" subject to avoidance under \u00a7 548(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Costas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047136,5584336\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/790/\">\n    555 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   794 (citing and quoting\n   <em>\n    Butner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179364\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/48/\">\n    440 U.S. at 51-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179364\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/48/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Atchison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507308,1789189\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/209/\">\n    925 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   211-12 ) (additional citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff, on the other hand, urges the court not to follow this line of cases. Instead, the plaintiff urges the court to follow cases relying on the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Drye v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476074\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/49/\">\n    528 U.S. 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476074\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/49/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476074\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/49/\">\n    145 L.Ed.2d 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) and holding that a declaimer of an inheritance is a transfer of the disclaiming heir's property. The Ninth Circuit fully addressed that argument as well:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   , a tax debtor inherited his mother's estate after the IRS had obtained a tax lien on all his \"property and rights to property.\" Relying on Arkansas' relation-back disclaimer rule, Drye disclaimed his inheritance and argued that he had no property to which the IRS lien could attach. The Supreme Court, however, rejected Drye's theory and held that the tax lien attached to disclaimed property despite state law relation-back rules. After discussing the breadth of federal tax lien law, the Court described its analysis: \"We look initially to state law to determine what rights the taxpayer has in the property the Government seeks to reach, then to federal law to determine whether the taxpayer's state-delineated rights qualify as 'property' or 'rights to property' within the compass of the federal tax lien legislation.\" Although Drye asserted that he had nothing but the right to reject a gift, the Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that a rejected gift returns to the donor, whereas a disclaimer channels the property to another person. Finding this power to channel a sufficient state law interest to constitute \"property\" under the federal tax lien provisions, the Court held that the lien attached despite Drye's refusal to take the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Trustee urges us to extend\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   to the bankruptcy context and recognize the \"right to channel\" as an \"interest ... in property\" for purposes of the Code. The Trustee's argument is that\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   recognizes a \"right to channel\" interest that constitutes \"property\" not just for tax lien cases, but as a matter of federal law. Further, the Trustee suggests that\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   accords with bankruptcy policy by increasing the size of the debtor's estate. In contrast, Costas requests that we adhere to the more deferential approach of\n   <em>\n    Butner\n   </em>\n   and treat the disclaimer as Arizona would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The Trustee's argument has some force: if the \"right to channel\" has been recognized as a \"property\" interest for one federal statute, why not for the other? Nevertheless, we believe that\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable, both factually and legally, and that its adoption in the bankruptcy context would, in any event, be inappropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   First,\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable based on timing issues. Although\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   , like this case, involved a collision between federal law and state relation back doctrines, the impact between the two occurred at a different time. In\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   , the tax lien was already in place prior to the execution of the disclaimer. Thus, before the taxpayer attempted to execute his disclaimer, the federal government already had an interest in the subject property. Application of the state law\n   fiction would have stripped the government of this interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In contrast, the disclaimer here occurred pre-petition, meaning that the retroactive divestment of property interests occurred prior to the bankruptcy estate gaining any interests in the right to disclaim. Therefore, the state law did not operate to defeat any pre-existing interests. Rather, the situation in\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   is more analogous to a post-petition disclaimer, where a debtor invokes the disclaimer protections of state law only after the creation of the bankruptcy estate. In cases of post-petition disclaimers, courts have generally included disclaimed property in the estate, reasoning that the right to disclaim itself belongs to the estate as of the time of filing. This context mirrors\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   because in both situations full deference to the state's disclaimer rules would strip parties of pre-existing interests. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   accords well with the post-petition situation, but not with pre-petition disclaimers where no prior interests exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable based on its legal context. Indisputably,\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   is, first and foremost, a tax lien case....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Admittedly, similarities exist between the tax lien statute and the Code, as both broadly rely on state law to define \"property.\" Nevertheless, tax lien rules do not translate directly into bankruptcy rules. In the tax lien context, collection is the primary focus. This vital function often \"justifies the extraordinary priority accorded federal tax liens....\" Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly construed tax lien provisions to permit the government to reach property beyond the grasp of other creditors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   This purpose contrasts sharply with the policy of bankruptcy law, which largely respects substantive state law rights, neither granting a creditor new rights in the debtor's property nor taking any away. Indeed, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Butner\n   </em>\n   expressly invoked this goal of achieving \"[u]niform treatment of property interests by both state and federal courts within a State ....\" By replicating state law rights, the Court hoped to (1) reduce uncertainty, (2) discourage forum shopping, and (3) \"prevent a party from receiving 'a windfall merely by reason of the happenstance of bankruptcy.' \" Extending the rule in\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   to the bankruptcy context, however, would undermine all of these goals. Uncertainty would increase because disclaimers, though generally valid, would lose effect in bankruptcy. Second, forum shopping would increase because creditors of disclaimants would have an incentive to push for bankruptcy in order to gain an interest in otherwise protected property. Finally, many creditors, including those in this case, would receive a windfall: although the disclaimed property was absolutely protected under state law, they would receive a share of the property solely because Costas filed for bankruptcy within two years of her disclaimer. Thus, based on the concerns set out in\n   <em>\n    Butner\n   </em>\n   , little justification exists for permitting creditors to reach property that, but for the fortuity of a bankruptcy filing, would remain beyond their grasp.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Further, the inappropriateness of extending\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   is reinforced by comparing the Code's treatment of exemptions to the treatment under the federal tax lien statute. In\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   , the Court stressed the breadth of \"property\" under \u00a7 6331 of the Internal Revenue Code by noting that the tax lien statute recognized only a narrow range of exemptions, none of which mentioned disclaimers. On this ground, the Court distinguished the gift tax statute, which explicitly incorporates an exception for disclaimers. While the Code lacks an express exemption for\n   disclaimers like \u00a7 2518(a), its exemptions are nonetheless quite broad, allowing a debtor to take advantage of all available state law exemptions. Again, this highlights the key difference between \"property\" for purposes of tax collection and for bankruptcy: the former largely trumps state law, the other tries to incorporate it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   For these reasons, we find that Drye is distinguishable and we refuse to extend its logic to the bankruptcy context. Instead, we apply the principles of\n   <em>\n    Butner\n   </em>\n   and hold that a disclaimer, properly executed under Arizona law, is not a \"transfer ... of an interest of the debtor in property\" for purposes of \u00a7 548.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Costas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047136,5584336\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/790/\">\n    555 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   794-97 (citing and quoting\n   <em>\n    Drye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476074\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/49/\">\n    528 U.S. at 52-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476074\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/49/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Butner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179364\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/48/\">\n    440 U.S. at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179364\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/48/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (additional citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laughlin v.

Application of the relation-back doctrine to defeat a fraudulent conveyance action serves this important public policy. Surely Ms. Swope did not intend for her assets to be distributed to her daughter's creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nor does application of the relation-back doctrine frustrate the expectations of Ms. Burke's creditors. There are no allegations that her creditors extended credit in reliance upon Ms. Burke's inheritance. Thus, allowing Ms. Burke's disclaimer does not deprive them of the benefit of any contractual bargain. In fact, had Ms. Burke encumbered or pledged the property she stood to inherit, the right to disclaim the inheritance may have been precluded.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-1-103\">\n    Tenn.

Section 31-1-103(b) of the Tennessee Code Annotated provides that, for a disclaimer of an inheritance to be effective, it must be \"unqualified\" and the interest must pass \"without any direction on the part of the person making the disclaimer.\" The disclaimer signed by debtor Nekolia Burke irrevocably disclaimed and renounced her entire interest in the estate, but did so \"subject to her intention and expectation that said interest shall pass to her issue, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-3-105\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 32-3-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" The words \"subject to\" are words of condition, limitation, qualification, or restriction. Thus, the quoted phrase can be read as providing that Ms. Burke disclaimed her interest only if the effect of the disclaimer was for her children to receive her interest and that, if the will provides for someone else - such as Ms. Burke's siblings - to receive her interest had she died before her mother, then Ms. Burke was not renouncing her interest. If the disclaimer is so interpreted, the trustee contends, it is invalid under state law and Ms. Burke's interest in the probate estate is property of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and available for distribution to Ms. Burke's creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The movants do not maintain at this juncture that the Disclaimer of Interest is valid as a matter of law. Instead, they contend that such a determination should be made by the probate court and that this court lacks jurisdiction to determine the validity of the Disclaimer of Interest pursuant to the \"probate exception\" to federal court jurisdiction. The probate exception is a judicially created limitation on the jurisdiction of federal courts, including the bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

This count of the complaint does not assert a transitory tort claim against the defendants. The plaintiff is not seeking an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   judgment against the heirs of Ms. Burke. Instead, she asks the court to enjoin Samples, Jennings, Clem &amp; Fields, PLLC, from transferring the assets received from Ms. Swope's probate estate to the heirs of Ms.\n   Burke and declare that such assets are property of the bankruptcy estate. Thus, the plaintiff would have this court administer at least a portion of Ms. Swope's probate estate and, to that extent, interfere with the administration of the probate estate by the probate court. Further, determining whether the Disclaimer of Interest is void would require the construction and application of Tennessee probate law, particularly\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-1-103\">\n    Tenn.

In short, while declaring the Disclaimer of Interest void and enjoining Samples, Jennings, Clem &amp; Fields, PLLC, from distributing proceeds of the probate estate may not strictly speaking \"dispose of property that is in the custody of the state probate court,\" such a ruling would disturb the probate court's disposition of that property and interfere with \"the administration of a decedent's estate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The plaintiff's attempt to invalidate the Disclaimer of Interest falls squarely within the probate exception to federal jurisdiction.
