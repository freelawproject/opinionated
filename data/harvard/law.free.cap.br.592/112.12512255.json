In the alternative, the Trustee Complaint seeks injunctive relief against further action on the Pride Complaint through\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Trustee filed an Emergency Motion to Enforce the Automatic Stay and/or for a Temporary Restraining Order, which was heard by the Court on January 22, 2018. The Court denied the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and scheduled hearings on the Motion to Enforce the Automatic Stay and for Preliminary Injunction on February 7, 2018. P-13. The Court afforded the parties time to file additional briefs: Trustee's brief was due on January 31, 2018, and Pride's brief was due on February 2, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On January 30, 2018, Trustee filed a Motions for Stipulated Protective Order and to File Its Brief Under Seal. P-16, 17. The Court approved those Motions on February 1, 2018. P-18 and 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On February 7, 2018, hearing on the request for preliminary injunctive relief occurred. P-29. The Court afforded the parties time to file additional briefs and continued the hearing to April 11, 2018. Pride's brief was filed under seal on March 1, 2018, and Trustee's was filed on March 26, 2018. P-35 and 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At the hearing on April 11, 2018, the parties asked for a continuance to negotiate settlement. The Court continued the matter to June 13, 2018. P-57. The parties did not reach an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On May 17, 2018, Trustee submitted a letter of complaint against LaPorte to the Society of Louisiana Certified Public Accountants. Exh. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Trustee seeks preliminary injunctive relief under Bankruptcy Rule 7065 against Pride's prosecution of any claims against LaPorte arising from or related to the failure of FSW or any of the obligations owed by FSW to Pride. Trustee contends all damages incurred by Pride are derivative from causes of action FSW holds against LaPorte; as such, they are property of the bankruptcy estate. Alternatively, if any of the claims contained in the Pride Complaint are not derivative of FSW, Trustee seeks an injunction against Pride through the exercise of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Pride argues its injuries result from its personal reliance on the FSW and Pride\n   Audits. As such, it avers that the causes of action are direct and independent of the claims held by FSW and are not property of the estate. It also argues against the imposition of an injunction from the pursuit of those claims on the same basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Pride alleges that it relied upon the FSW Audits in making corporate investments, guarantees, or loans. It asserts that the FSW Audits did not fairly reflect the financial condition of FSW when these decisions were made because of material misstatements in the financial statements; FSW's noncompliance with laws and regulations; and significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in FSW's internal controls. As a result, Pride allegedly suffered particular losses separate and apart from its investment in FSW or the obligations owed to it prior to the issuance of the FSW Audits. Specifically, Pride avers that LaPorte failed to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   1. Discover FSW losses of $10-15 million in 2015, rather than the profit previously recorded and accepted by FSW Audit 2;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   2. FSW Audit 2 failed to disclose an existing default on the loans between FSW and Iberia. That default is alleged to have occurred in June of 2015;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   3. LaPorte failed to discover an overstated inventory valuation allowance causing an inflated calculation in income for 2013-2014; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   4. Numerous deficiencies in FSW's accounting systems, internal controls, and other matters that were significant to the oversight of the financial reporting process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Pride has alleged damages as a result of these deficiencies. Its damages fall into five (5) broad categories:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   1. Rebate Costs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   2. $5,715,061.20 in payments to Iberia on guarantees executed after the FSW Audits;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   3. Loans, Licensing, Marketing, Operation and Payroll Costs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   4. $100,130.81 in advances to Saturn; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   5. Vendor Guarantees\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   P-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Pride Complaint also alleges inaccuracies in the Pride Audits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   1. LaPorte incorrectly concluded that FSW's members and not Pride were the primary beneficiaries of financial support provided by Pride to FSW. Therefore, it did not recommend consolidation of FSW and Pride's financial returns under a variable interest entity theory;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   2. LaPorte failed to discover and identify unauthorized advances made by Pride to customers of FSW for manufacturer rebates earned but not yet paid;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   3. LaPorte failed to discover and identify unauthorized guarantees issued by Pride to FSW manufacturers/vendors for products ordered; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   4. LaPorte failed to disclose FSW's default on the Iberia Bank loan guaranteed by Pride.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As a consequence of these alleged actions, Pride argues that the following damages were incurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   1. The issuance of additional guarantees to Iberia Bank for $5,000,000.00 resulting in payments of $5,715,061 on FSW's default;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   2. $7,003,733.78 in payments on FSW vendor manufacturer guarantees issued by Pride's CFO or CEO and which exceeded their authority;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   3. The loss of $1,204,054.79 in advances to FSW customers for earned but unpaid vendor manufacturer rebates owed FSW. Pride alleges that these advances\n   exceeded the authority of Pride's CEO and CFO; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   4. $100,130.81 in advances to Saturn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As a threshold matter, Trustee challenges Pride's assertion that it holds any causes of action against LaPorte. Trustee argues Pride has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Pride States a Cause of Action Against LaPorte\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Pride Complaint alleges two overarching causes of action: one against Laporte for damages resulting from its reliance on the FSW Audits and the other for breach of contract and negligence in connection with the Pride Audits. To state a cause of action, Pride must allege \"enough facts to state a claim that relief is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1973,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Pride Audits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Pride contracted with LaPorte for its audit services. All of LaPorte's engagement letters with FSW and Pride contained the same language. Under those agreements, LaPorte obligated itself to audit the financial statements of Pride including balance sheets, statements of operations, changes in members' equity, cash flows, related notes to financial statements, and any supplemental information. Exh. 8, 18, 34, 35. LaPorte's objective was to \"express[ ] an opinion on the financial statements.\" Exh. 35, p. 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The engagement letters require that LaPorte \"plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The engagement letters between Pride and LaPorte provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   In making our risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company's preparation, and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. However, we will communicate to you in writing concerning any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control relevant to the audit of the financial statements that we have identified during the audit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   We will also communicate to the board of directors (a) any fraud involving senior management and fraud (whether caused by senior management or other employees) that causes material misstatement of the financial statements that becomes known to us during the audit, and (b) any instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations that we become aware of during the audit (unless they are clearly inconsequential).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   La. R.S. 37:91(B)(1) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   B. No action based on negligence may be brought against any defendant licensee, or any employee or principal of a defendant licensee, unless the plaintiff claims to have been injured as a result of their justifiable reliance upon financial statements or other information examined, compiled, reviewed, certified, audited, prepared pursuant to a preparation of financial statement engagement, or otherwise prepared, reported or opined on by the defendant licensee or in the course of the defendant licensee's engagement to provide other services\n   and at least one of the following conditions apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (1) The plaintiff is the issuer or successor of the issuer of the financial statements or other information examined, compiled, reviewed, certified, audited, prepared pursuant to a preparation of financial statement engagement, or otherwise prepared reported, or opined on by the defendant licensee, and such plaintiff has engaged the defendant licensee to examine, compile, review, certify, audit, prepare pursuant to a preparation of financial statements or to provide other services....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Pride identifies several facts which if true might constitute professional negligence in the preparation of the Pride Audits. Specifically, Pride alleges that it retained LaPorte to investigate and document not only its financial status, but also review its internal controls over operations and financial affairs. In connection with this retention, Pride asserts that LaPorte failed to discover actions by its officers which exceeded their authority and increased Pride's losses. Specifically, Pride points to guarantees granted to FSW vendors in order to secure purchases on credit. Pride asserts it lost over $7,000,000.00 after FSW failed to pay these accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Pride also alleges that its officers exceeded their authority by advancing FSW funds to pay customers for earned but unpaid rebates owed by FSW vendors. Pride's losses in connection with these activities are alleged to exceed $1,200,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Pride claims that LaPorte's advice concerning its ability to consolidate financial returns with FSW cost it an additional, undisclosed amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Finally, Pride asserts approximately $100,000 in amounts due to it by Saturn, a subsidiary of FSW but an independent and unrelated claim to those asserted against FSW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The allegations asserted by Pride with regard to LaPorte's alleged failure to discover the transgressions of its officers fall directly within the confines of its contract with LaPorte. In total, Pride asserts that the\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   actions of its officers resulted in unrecorded direct or contingent debt exceeding $8,000,000. In addition, LaPorte's failure to report FSW's default on the Iberia loan resulted in a material misstatement on the status of Pride's contingent debt to Iberia. LaPorte's alleged malpractice in connection with its advice regarding the ability of Pride to file consolidated financial returns also potentially falls within LaPorte's duties under its contract with Pride. Any failure to professionally discharge that commitment could result in liability for LaPorte. As a result, Pride has stated a cause of action against LaPorte for breach of contract or professional negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The FSW Audits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Pride has alleged that a large share of its advances to FSW were made because it relied on LaPorte's opinion in the FSW Audits. Trustee argues that Pride has no cause of action against LaPorte in connection with the FSW Audits. La.R.S. 37:91(B)(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   B. No action based on negligence may be brought against any defendant licensee, or any employee or principal of a defendant licensee, unless the plaintiff claims to have been injured as a result of their justifiable reliance upon financial statements or other information examined, compiled, reviewed, certified, audited, prepared pursuant to a preparation of financial statement engagement, or otherwise prepared, reported or opined on by the defendant licensee or in the course of the defendant licensee's engagement to provide other services\n   and at least one of the following conditions apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (2) The defendant licensee was aware at the time the engagement was undertaken that the financial statements or other information were to be made available for use in connection with a specified transaction by the plaintiff who was specifically identified to the defendant licensee, was aware that the plaintiff intended to rely upon such financial statements or other information in connection with the specified transaction, and had direct contact and communication with the plaintiff and reliance on such financial statements or other information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Clearly, Louisiana law provides a cause of action for parties in Pride's position.

In state law fraudulent conveyance actions, the recovery of assets wrongly transferred by a debtor to a third party for the sole benefit of a creditor offends these principles. State law avoidance claims pursue damages for injuries to the debtor, not directly to the creditor.

S.I. filed a Motion for Sanctions for violation of the automatic stay seeking protection for both Abel and its registered agent. The Fifth Circuit summarized \"three guiding principles\" from its decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Mortgage America\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   (1) a section 362(a)(3) stay applies to a cause of action that under state (or federal) law belongs to the debtor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   (2) a section 362(a)(3) stay applies to a cause of action that seeks to recover property of the estate where the property is held or controlled by a person or entity other than the debtor; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   (3) in applying the above rules we do so by keeping in mind the Bankruptcy Code's general policies of securing and preserving the debtor's property and of ensuring equal distribution of the debtor's assets to similarly-situated creditors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <em>\n    S.I.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6124234,1671446\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/817/1142/\">\n    817 F.2d at 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fifth Circuit ruled that because the state court suit was \"premised solely upon the theory that the defendants therein are controlling entities or persons of a chapter 11 debtor,\" the automatic stay applied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6124234,1671446\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/817/1142/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6124234,1671446\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/817/1142/\">\n    at 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Eastway's alter ego cause of action belonged to the debtor because the claim could have been brought by any creditor of S.I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Matter of Educators Group Health Trust\n   </em>\n   , the Educators Group Health Trust (\"EGHT\") provided benefits to teachers in small school districts. EGHT filed a Voluntary Petition for Relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the school districts became creditors of the estate. Seven (7) of the school districts filed suit in state court against the administrator of EGHT charging that direct solicitations by the administrator to them were fraudulent. The chapter 7 trustee sought to enjoin the districts from pursuing their state court suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   There is no question that the losses sustained by the districts were a part of the losses sustained by the county. Nevertheless, the Court found that some causes of action were property of the estate while others were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The Court concluded that any actions based on negligent management of EGHT, breach of contract, or breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the administration of the county's fund were generalized claims derivative of the injury to EGHT. Because these wrongs were perpetrated on EGHT, they were not specific to the district participants in the EGHT fund and the harm experienced by any individual district was derivative of the harm inflicted on EGHT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   On the other hand, claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations directly to the districts by the defendants were based on specific conduct against them. As such, those claims were not property of the estate. Although the damages alleged by the individual districts were included in the damages sustained by EGHT, the claims were not derivative, and the Fifth Circuit held this fact did not justify enjoining their pursuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Pride Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Based on the case law cited above, the Court concludes that some of the claims asserted by Pride are derivative of FSW and, thus, property of the estate. Beginning with Pride's claims under La.R.S. 37:91(B)(2), Pride must detail facts to establish its reliance on the FSW Audits and LaPorte's knowledge that the FSW Audits would be used as support for Pride's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Pride has failed to articulate facts supporting LaPorte's knowledge that the FSW Audits would be relied upon by Pride in advancing funds or resources for FSW's operating costs. This applies to losses sustained as a result of Payroll, Operation, Licensing or Market Costs, and Loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Pride has also failed to articulate a direct claim against LaPorte in connection with its Rebate Costs or Vendor Guarantees. Pride alleges that the guarantees and rebate advances exceeded the authority of its officers or were\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   . That allegation by its very nature refutes that the advances were knowingly made by Pride and dependent on the FSW Audits. Nevertheless, should Pride assert this claim in the alternative, (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that the officers were induced to participate in both of these programs based on the FSW Audits) Pride has not asserted a sufficient nexus between the FSW Audits, LaPorte's knowledge that Pride would rely on the Audits for these advances, and Pride's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In short with regard to these damages, the Pride Complaint fails to state how the FSW Audits created a unique loss to Pride, differing from the losses sustained by any other creditor. All creditors advanced funds, credit, or resources to FSW prior to collapse. In order to distinguish Pride's actions from those of other creditors, Pride must detail facts that outline both Pride's reliance on the FSW Audits to make these advances and LaPorte's knowledge that its audits were being used for this purpose. It has failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The only claim alleged by Pride under La.R.S. 37:91(B)(2) that contains allegations of specialized injury concerns Pride's decision to increase its guarantee of FSW's loan to Iberia. Pride has stated a unique claim based on its reliance of the FSW Audits. Those Audits were conducted by FSW in an effort to secure additional financing for expanded operations. Pride's guarantee was critical to additional funding by Iberia. As a result, the Court finds that this claim is both specific and direct as to Pride (\"FSW Audit Direct Claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Additionally, Pride's claims under La.R.S. 37:91(1) brought in connection with the Pride Audits are Pride's property. Because the estate is not in privity with LaPorte on the Pride Audits, nor has it asserted or could assert any claims based on those audits, the causes of action are separate and distinct. The Court finds that allegations pertaining to Saturn, Rebate Costs or Vendor Guarantees all constitute direct claims held by Pride. These claims rely not on the FSW Audits, but the failure of LaPorte to discover and report unauthorized\n   conduct within the management of Pride while it was conducting the Pride Audits (\"Pride Audit Direct Claims\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   By the same token, the Court cannot find any articulated reason LaPorte's conduct in connection with the Pride Audits would create any liability for the expenses or resources advanced by Pride to FSW for Loans, FSW's Payroll, Licensing, Marketing or Operating Costs. Therefore, it finds that these claims have not been sufficiently tied to LaPorte's conduct in connection with the Pride Audits. Instead, they appear to be an attempt to shoehorn additional losses into a claim against LaPorte under 37:91(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The debtor held identical claims. Because the proceeds of the D &amp; O insurance policy or the individual assets of the board members would flow to the estate and benefit all creditors, the Court enjoined the suit to prohibit one creditor, with generalized damages, from receiving more than others in the same position. This concept has more recently been articulated as the direct versus derivative analysis.

The administration of the case\n   will not be affected by Pride's pursuit against LaPorte. Further, the Pride Audit Direct Claims are unrelated to the bankruptcy case or the claims held by Pride against FSW. Pride holds claims associated with advice given by LaPorte concerning consolidated financial statements. It also seeks damages related to amounts advanced to Saturn, a subsidiary of FSW, but not FSW. Finally, Prides asserts that through a breach of LaPorte's duties to it under the Pride Audits, the\n   <em>\n    ulta vires\n   </em>\n   conduct of its officers or directors was not discovered. It also holds claims based on LaPorte's conduct in connection with the guarantee increase. Conduct specific to Pride and not FSW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Zale\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit found that the distribution of the D &amp; O policy proceeds were sufficiently related to the Zale estate so was to create related to jurisdiction over the policy and those that might seek recompense from its limits. This case is different. The policy in question belongs to a third party, LaPorte, was paid for by LaPorte, and is designed to compensate those with claims against LaPorte. In contrast, the Zale D &amp; O policy belonged to Zale. Its premiums were paid by Zale to insure it against claims against the company for actions of Zale's officers and directors. The claims against LaPorte are based on LaPorte's conduct, not that of the debtor. The assets available to satisfy them are those belonging to LaPorte and do not involve the estate. As a result, the claims held by Pride against LaPorte will not be decided by the claims resolution process in FSW's case. Bankruptcy jurisdiction does not extend to the Pride Direct Claims as they are neither claims against the debtor nor its property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Trustee argues Pride's pursuit against LaPorte might jeopardize the estate's claims should Pride and Trustee take conflicting positions. He also argues that LaPorte has insufficient insurance and resources to satisfy both Pride's and the estate's claims. Trustee's position argues that irreparable harm may occur to the estate if Pride is allowed to compete with the estate for limited resources. He also contends that most of Pride's alleged damages accruing as a result of the Pride Direct Claims stem from monies advanced to FSW; therefore, they are included in the universe of claims that will be paid should Trustee succeed against LaPorte.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trustee argues that as a result, the potential injury to the estate is outweighed by any injury Pride may suffer should its Direct Claims be enjoined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Trustee asks this Court to exceed the bounds of law. As previously explained, a large portion of Pride's Direct Claims have no relationship to FSW, specifically those related to accounting advice or Saturn. Further, the claims for LaPorte's failure to discover the mismanagement of Pride's officers or directors is also unrelated to FSW's case. Pride and the estate each hold claims against the same third parties and their insurers, and they will by necessity compete for payment from these defendants. However, because neither the patrimony of the third parties nor their insurers are property of the estate and bankruptcy jurisdiction does not extend to these claims, enjoining their progress takes an extraordinary showing of damage to the estate. The power to enjoin third party actions is generally utilized to protect officers or key employees from outside\n   litigation while their attention and effort are needed to reorganize a debtor. This case is factually in opposite to those decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The right of a party to pursue its own cause of action cannot be abridged by a bankruptcy court with no interest or jurisdiction over the claim simply because it may compete with the Trustee for recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Trustee also asserts that Pride should be enjoined because in his opinion, Pride cannot succeed on the merits. Trustee invites an examination of Pride's evidence prior to allowing Pride any opportunity to conduct discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This amounts to prejudging the viability or probability of Pride's success on the merits. Trustee has offered no authority for the assertion that this Court should weigh the merits of Pride's claims as a factor supporting the denial or grant of injunctive relief. The Court declines the invitation to exert control over property belonging to a creditor against an unrelated non-debtor in this factual circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   For the reasons assigned above, the following claims by Pride against LaPorte and related to the FSW Audits are property of the estate, and the automatic stay pursuant to section 362 prohibits Pride from pursuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   1. Pride's claims for damages resulting from advances $1,204,054.79 to FSW customers for manufacturer rebates earned by FSW but unpaid, Rebate Costs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   2. $3,762,677.53 in loans to FSW, Loans;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   3. $50,811.50 in payroll advances to FSW, Payroll Costs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   4. $84,995.79 in advances of cash or resources to FSW for operation of its licensing program, Licensing Costs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   5. $1,258.42 in advances of cash or resources to FSW for operation of its market source operating division, Marketing Costs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   6. $398, 276.53 in advances to FSW for general operating expenses, Operating Costs; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   7. $7,003,733.78 in payments to vendors of FSW on invoices guaranteed by Pride, Vendor Guarantees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The following claim against LaPorte, although related to the FSW Audits, is not property of the estate and Pride may pursue it: $5,715,061.20 in additional guarantees to Iberia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Additionally, claims brought by Pride under La. R.S. 37:91(B)(1) for damages sustained as a result of LaPorte's conduct in connection with the Pride Audits may be pursued because they are not property of the estate. These claims include LaPorte's failure to discover and report the alleged unauthorized conduct of Pride's officers in granting guarantees to FSW vendors or funding manufacturer rebates earned by FSW but not yet paid. In addition, LaPorte's failure to report advances to Saturn are directly held by Pride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Pride may not pursue any claim for its more generalized damages sustained as a result of Loans to FSW, advances of resources or cash to FSW in connection with Payroll, Licensing, or Marketing or Operating Costs. Pride has failed to articulate a claim under LaR.S.37:91 that is sufficiently grounded in the Pride Audits or in LaPorte's knowledge of Pride's reliance on the FSW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The Court will enter a separate Judgment in accord with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    The last name of \"Mini\" is not in the email.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    Exh. 35 includes engagement letters dated June 19, 2014, and June 19, 2015, that contain identical language.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    Section 544 gives the trustee the power to assert general causes of action on behalf of creditors.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n    Except as provided in subsection (e)(2), notwithstanding any Act of Congress that confers exclusive jurisdiction on a court or courts other than the district courts, the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    The Court found, even though the same transaction was at issue and the same resources were being pursued, if the claim alleged a direct injury to the creditor, it belonged to the creditor.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n     at 1286\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    A debtor may only pursue property of the estate while in the position of a debtor-in-possession and even then, only for the benefit of the estate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kane v.
