Geltzer, the Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estate of Estella Brizinova and Edward Soshkin,\n   <em>\n    aka\n   </em>\n   Eduard Soshkin (together, the \"Debtors\"), commenced this adversary proceeding by filing a complaint (the \"Complaint\"), against defendants Estella Brizinova and Edward Soshkin. The Trustee seeks to recover alleged estate property that, he asserts, the Defendants have improperly refused to turn over, in violation of Bankruptcy Code Section 542. The Trustee also seeks declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and compensatory and punitive damages pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Sections 362(a) and 362(k), based on the Defendants' alleged transfer of estate property in violation of the automatic stay. And the Trustee seeks an award of compensatory and punitive damages based on a theory of common law conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As this Court has discussed previously\n   in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova (In re Brizinova)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923024\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/554/64/\">\n    554 B.R. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Brizinova I\n   </em>\n   \"), the Trustee alleges that pursuant to Section 542, the Defendants are required to turn over post-petition sale proceeds in the amount of $250,000 (the \"Post-Petition Sale Proceeds\") from ENSI Consulting, Inc. (\"ENSI\"), an auto supply parts company listed by the Debtors on Schedule B - Personal Property as owned one hundred percent by Ms. Brizinova. The Trustee also alleges that the estate is entitled to recover damages under Bankruptcy Code Sections 362(a) and 362(k) for violations of the automatic stay arising from the Defendants' post-petition transfer of some or all of their interest in ENSI. And the Trustee alleges that the Defendants willfully and knowingly converted estate property, damaging the estate in the amount of $250,000, and seeks an award of punitive damages in an amount to be determined by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This is the Defendants' second attempt to obtain an order dismissing the Complaint. In\n   <em>\n    Brizinova I\n   </em>\n   , this Court denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss (the \"Motion to Dismiss\"), and sustained the Trustee's turnover and stay violation claims.\n   <em>\n    Brizinova I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923024\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/554/64/\">\n    554 B.R. at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also denied in part the Motion to Dismiss with respect to the Trustee's conversion claim, to the extent that he sought to recover the Defendants' ownership interest in ENSI. But the Court dismissed the conversion claim with respect to conversion of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, on grounds that the Trustee did \"not adequately allege[ ] that the Defendants converted specifically identifiable funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Brizinova I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923024\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/554/64/\">\n    554 B.R. at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court granted leave to replead, but the Trustee did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, the Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding by filing a complaint against Zlata Soshkin,\n   <em>\n    aka\n   </em>\n   Zlata Polukhina, the Defendants' daughter-in-law, (the \"\n   <em>\n    Soshkin\n   </em>\n   Complaint\") seeking to recover the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds (the \"\n   <em>\n    Soshkin\n   </em>\n   Adversary\").\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Soshkin (In re Brizinova)\n   </em>\n   , Adv. Pro. No. 17-01157, ECF No. 1. There too, the Trustee asserted claims for turnover, stay violations, and conversion of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds. Ms. Soshkin moved to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Soshkin\n   </em>\n   Complaint, and argued, for the first time, that the property at issue is property of another entity, not property of the estate, and on July 20, 2018, the Court entered an order dismissing the\n   <em>\n    Soshkin\n   </em>\n   Complaint, and granting the Trustee leave to replead.\n   <em>\n    In re Brizinova\n   </em>\n   , Adv. Pro. No. 17-01157, ECF No. 20 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Soshkin\n   </em>\n   Decision\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Now, asserting these new grounds, the Defendants again seek to dismiss the Complaint in this adversary proceeding. They move for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), made applicable here by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012, and for the entry of an order dismissing the Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h), also made applicable here by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The questions posed by this motion are whether this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the Complaint, and if so, whether the Defendants are entitled to judgment on the pleadings on the claims for turnover of property of the estate, violations of the automatic stay, and conversion of estate property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As noted, this is the second time that the Court has been asked to adjudicate a dispositive motion by the Defendants in\n   this adversary proceeding, and familiarity with the proceedings is assumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A brief background narrative sets the scene. The Defendants are husband and wife who filed this joint bankruptcy petition on April 24, 2012. The Trustee was appointed on that date. On Schedule B, the Defendants indicate that as of the petition date, Ms. Brizinova held one hundred percent of the stock of ENSI, a New York corporation. According to Schedule B, the value of Ms. Brizinova's interest in the ENSI shares as of the petition date was zero. The Defendants' Statement of Financial Affairs states that ENSI was a business \"in which the debtor owned 5 percent or more of the voting or equity securities within six years immediately preceding the commencement of this case.\" Petition at 37, ECF No. 1 (Statement of Financial Affairs). On Schedule I - Current Income of Individual Debtor(s), the Defendants indicate that Mr. Soshkin was employed by ENSI as a bookkeeper and customer service representative, and had been so employed for the past ten years. Also on Schedule I, the Defendants indicate that Ms. Brizinova was a packer for ENSI, and had similarly held that position for ten years. On the Statement of Financial Affairs, the Defendants indicate that between 2010 and 2012, they together received income from ENSI's operations in the total amount of $19,620. The Defendants received a discharge more than six years ago, on July 24, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 13, 2014, the Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding against Nick Soshkin and Igor Soshkin, the Defendants' sons, seeking to recover allegedly fraudulent transfers by the Defendants to their sons of certain interests in real and personal property located in Florida. The parties resolved the Trustee's claims by entering into a stipulation of settlement, which was approved by this Court on December 12, 2014. This action followed some six months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The Allegations of the Complaint\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 23, 2015, more than three years after the petition date, the Trustee commenced this adversary proceeding. The Trustee alleges that prior to the petition date, Ms. Brizinova held a one hundred percent ownership interest in ENSI which, as the Defendants testified at the Section 341 meeting of creditors, was in the business of selling auto parts over the internet. According to the Trustee, subsequent to the petition date, the Defendants continued to operate ENSI on at least two websites,\n   <em>\n    autoaccessorystore.com\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    mimousa.com\n   </em>\n   , and generated the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds from the operation of those websites. The Trustee alleges that those Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are property of the Defendants' estate, and that despite his demands, the Defendants have not turned them over to the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In his First Claim for Relief, asserted under Bankruptcy Code Section 542, the Trustee alleges that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are estate property that the Defendants have failed to turn over notwithstanding his demand. He seeks an order directing the Defendants to turn over the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, in an amount to be proven at trial, which the Trustee estimates to be at least $250,000, plus interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In his Second Claim for Relief, asserted under Bankruptcy Code Sections 362(a) and 362(k), the Trustee alleges, upon information and belief, that despite the Defendants' knowledge that the bankruptcy estate had become the owner of their interest in ENSI, they transferred to one or more unnamed third parties some or all of their interest in ENSI, together with some or all of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, after the petition date. The Trustee further alleges that the Defendants took\n   these actions willfully and \"with their full knowledge\" that their actions violated the automatic stay. Compl. \u00b6 20, ECF No. 1. The Trustee seeks a declaratory judgment that the Defendants violated the automatic stay; an order enforcing the stay and enjoining the Defendants from making further transfers of the estate's interest in ENSI, including the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds; and damages under Bankruptcy Code Section 362(k) in an estimated amount of $250,000, plus interest and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his Third Claim for Relief, asserted under the common law doctrine of conversion, the Trustee alleges, upon information and belief, that as a result of the Defendants' actions, they \"willfully, knowingly, and wrongly\" converted property belonging to the Defendants' estate, \"namely the estate's 100% interest in ENSI and in the ... Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, to the exclusion and detriment of the Trustee, and have therefore improperly exercised dominion and control over such property.\" Compl. \u00b6 23. The Trustee seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial, in an estimated amount of $250,000, plus interest, and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     This Motion for Judgment\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 30, 2018, the Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings dismissing this adversary proceeding (the \"Motion for Judgment\"). As Ms. Soshkin argued in her motion to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Soshkin\n   </em>\n   Complaint, the Defendants argue here that the corporate assets of ENSI are not assets of the Debtors and do not form any part of the estate, but belong to ENSI, an independent corporation that is not a debtor. The Defendants argue that, although they did not raise this defense in the Motion to Dismiss, they are permitted by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) to assert it now. The Defendants argue that \" 'a defense of failure to state a claim may be raised in a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, and when this occurs the court simply treats the motion as if it were a motion to dismiss.' \" Mot. for Judg. at 1, ECF No. 103-1 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Pharm. Mfrs., Inc. v. Ayerst Labs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792526\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/904/\">\n    850 F.2d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 909 n.2 (2d Cir. 1988) ). The Defendants also argue that the law of the case doctrine is inapplicable here, because the denial of the motion to dismiss in\n   <em>\n    Brizinova I\n   </em>\n   is an \"interim, or tentative ruling[ ],\" and as such \"do[es] not establish a law of the case.\" Reply at 4, ECF No. 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Defendants also argue that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Complaint, that there is no bankruptcy jurisdiction over non-debtor ENSI, and that the Trustee lacks standing to recover the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, because the property of ENSI does not belong to the estate. And the Defendants note that \" Rule 12(h)(3) allows a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to be raised 'at any time' in the litigation.\" Reply at 7 (citation omitted). According to the Defendants, \"[t]here is no actual controversy here [because] there is no estate asset involved,\" so \"there is no jurisdiction.\" Reply at 9. The Defendants assert that \"[s]ince the alleged sale proceeds happen[ ] to be that of a third party and not a debtor ... [t]he court [lacks] subject matter jurisdiction.\" Reply at 6. And \"parties ... may not waive objections to subject matter jurisdiction by consenting to federal jurisdiction where it does not in fact exist.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792526\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/904/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Separately, the Defendants argue that \"[t]he plaintiff disavowed the entire case\" when he filed the\n   <em>\n    Soshkin\n   </em>\n   Complaint. Mot. for Judg. at 6. The Defendants assert that the Trustee has \"in the most unequivocal ways, disavowed [his] claims against the defendants by instituting the second complaint against the defendants' daughter in law.\" Mot. for Judg. at 8. They assert that\n   \"tossing the blame, from one party to the other, is a classic example of judicial estoppel,\" and that it is time to \"hold the trustee accountable to his acts and stances\" by invoking that doctrine \" 'to protect the judicial system from being whipsawed with inconsistent arguments.' \" Mot. for Judg. at 7 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The Trustee's Opposition\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Trustee opposes the Motion for Judgment. He responds that the Defendants did not argue in the Motion to Dismiss that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds were not property of the estate, and that \"[m]ore importantly, this Court made holdings in [\n   <em>\n    Brizinova I\n   </em>\n   ] that the Trustee had adequately alleged that such proceeds were property of the bankruptcy estate - holdings which constitute the law of this adversary proceeding.\" Opp. Mem. at 2, ECF No. 111. And the Trustee argues that in addition, \"pertinent case law ... clearly demonstrates that the [Post-Petition Sale Proceeds] constitute property of the Debtors' bankruptcy estate.\" Opp. Mem. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition, the Trustee asserts that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding because in\n   <em>\n    Brizinova I\n   </em>\n   , \"this Court explicitly held that it had jurisdiction over the Trustee's claims for turnover, conversion, and violation of the automatic stay.\" Opp. Mem. at 8. And the Trustee asserts that the Defendants' jurisdictional argument is based on the \"clearly erroneous assertion\" that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are not property of the estate. Opp. Mem. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The Supplemental Briefing\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On July 30, 2018, the Court held a preliminary hearing on the Motion for Judgment, and set August 10, 2018, as the date by when the Defendants \"may file a supplementary memorandum of law,\" and August 24, 2018, as the date by when \"the Plaintiff may file a supplementary memorandum of law.\" Scheduling Order, ECF No. 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On August 9, 2018, the Defendants filed a supplemental brief titled \"Amended Motion for Summary Judgment\" (the \"Supplemental Memorandum\"). Like the Motion for Judgment, it seeks an order dismissing this Complaint. Supp. Mem., ECF No. 121. Thereafter, on August 22, 2018, the Plaintiff filed a supplemental memorandum of law in opposition, ECF No. 122, and on August 23, 2018, the Defendants filed a reply, ECF No. 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the Supplemental Memorandum, the Defendants supplement the record with legal authority and argument in support of the Motion for Judgment. But they also attempt to request additional relief, and submit an \"Affirmation in Support of Summary Judgment.\" Supp. Mem. at 1, ECF No. 121-1. There, for the first time, the Defendants seek summary judgment dismissing the Complaint, on grounds that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Trustee opposes the additional relief sought in the Supplemental Memorandum, on grounds, among others, that the Defendants are precluded from seeking such relief after the expiration of the Court's May 16, 2018 deadline. The Trustee also argues that even if the Defendants could seek summary judgment at this stage in these proceedings, \"their supplemental papers fall woefully short of what is required for such a motion,\" because they are not supported by a separate statement of undisputed material facts as required by the Local Bankruptcy Rules for this District, or evidence in the form of an affirmation or affidavit. Pl's Supp. Mem. at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The opportunity to submit supplemental briefing permitted the parties to augment their legal arguments with respect to the Motion for Judgment, particularly in light\n   of the Court's\n   <em>\n    Soshkin\n   </em>\n   Decision. It did not permit the parties to expand their request for relief. The Defendants elected to seek dismissal of the Complaint pursuant to Rules 12(c) and 12(h), the parties availed themselves of opportunities to brief the issues raised by the Motion for Judgment, and the deadline to seek summary judgment has passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For these reasons, the Court declines to deem the Defendants' Supplemental Memorandum as a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    The Hearings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On July 30, 2018 and September 17, 2018, Court held pretrial conferences and heard argument on the Motion for Judgment at which the Trustee and the Defendants, each by counsel, appeared and were heard. At the September 17, 2018 hearing, the parties waived further argument, and the Court closed the record and reserved decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Defendants assert that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to determine this dispute because \"ENSI has not filed for bankruptcy.\" Mot. for Judg. at 5. They also assert that the Trustee \"lacks standing, as the property of [ ] ENSI did not belong to the estate,\" and so he has not suffered an injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792526\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/904/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Defendants argue that as a result, there is no \" 'case or controversy' between himself and the defendants within the meaning of Art.

They do not dispute the Trustee's allegations that the bankruptcy estate owns a one hundred percent interest in the ENSI shares.

That is, the Trustee alleges that the property at issue - the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds generated from ENSI - is in the possession, custody, or control of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For these reasons, and based on the entire record, the Court concludes that Trustee adequately alleges the first element of a claim under Section 542 for turnover, that the property at issue is in the possession, custody or control of another entity, because he alleges that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are in the possession of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Trustee Adequately Alleges that the Property at Issue Is Property that He May Use, Sell, or Lease\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The second element that the Trustee must allege to state a Section 542(a) claim is that the property at issue is property that the Trustee may use, sell, or lease under Bankruptcy Code Section 363. Such property is defined broadly by Section 541 and includes \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case\" as well as \"[p]roceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits of or from property of the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (a)(6).

But the parties have not cited, and the Court has not found, controlling or persuasive authority to support the Trustee's assertion that in these circumstances, the proceeds of a sale of a non-debtor corporation's\n   <em>\n    assets\n   </em>\n   should be afforded the same treatment as the proceeds of a sale of its\n   <em>\n    shares\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   This is consistent with principles that are long and well established. Courts in New York recognize that there is a difference between ownership of a corporation's shares and ownership of its assets. Long ago, the New York Court of Appeals observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [T]he corporation in respect of corporate property and rights is entirely distinct from the stockholders who are the ultimate or equitable owners of its assets ... even complete ownership of capital stock does not operate to transfer the title to corporate property and ... ownership of capital stock is by no means identical with or equivalent to ownership of corporate property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Brock v.

But here too, because ENSI is not a debtor, and because the Trustee does not adequately allege that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are \"proceeds of or from property of the estate,\" he does not adequately allege the third element of his claim under Bankruptcy Code Section 362 for a stay violation, that the conduct in question violates the automatic stay, because actions with respect to property that is not property of the estate simply do not violate the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In sum, the Court has carefully considered each of the arguments advanced by the Defendants with respect to whether the Trustee adequately alleges the Second Claim for Relief, for a declaratory judgment that they violated the automatic stay, an order enforcing the stay and enjoining further transfers of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, damages in the amount of at least $250,000, plus interest. The Court concludes that the Trustee adequately alleges the first element of his stay violation claim, that the automatic stay was in effect at the time of the alleged violation.
