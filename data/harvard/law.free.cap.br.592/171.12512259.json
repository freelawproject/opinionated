Corzin, the duly-appointed Chapter 7 trustee (the \"Trustee\") in the underlying bankruptcy case from which this adversary proceeding arises, has filed a complaint for determination and avoidance of an allegedly preferential transfer involving the Debtor Jason E. Myers (the \"Debtor\"), Debtor's father-in-law John Thomas (\"Mr. Thomas\"), and Defendant Emergency Medical Transport, Inc. (the \"Defendant\"). In the complaint, the Trustee alleges that, while insolvent, the Debtor transferred an interest in property to the Defendant on account of an antecedent debt on or 90 days before the date the Debtor filed for Chapter 7 relief. (Compl. \u00b6 4-9). Thus, the Trustee seeks judgment on his complaint for the amount transferred, $3,756.03. (Compl. \u00b6 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Currently before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Motion\"). [Docket No. 26] filed on December 22, 2016. The Trustee filed a Response to Defendant's Motion [Docket No. 29] on January 12, 2017, and Defendant filed a Reply in Support of its Motion [Docket No. 30] on January 27, 2017. In its Motion, the Defendant seeks judgment as a matter of law on the Trustee's complaint, arguing that because the transfer at issue did not concern property of the Debtor, it does not constitute an avoidable preferential transfer under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Docket No. 23). The following undisputed facts are derived from that stipulation, the deposition of the Debtor (Docket No. 28), and the Court's own docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 7, 2015, the Defendant Emergency Medical Transport, Inc. obtained a judgment against the Debtor in the Canton Municipal Court in the amount of $2,613.19, plus interest and costs, for funds previously advanced in connection with the Debtor having attended paramedic school while employed by the Defendant. One week later, on August 14, 2015, the Defendant sought court-ordered garnishment of funds located in the Debtor's JPMorgan Chase Bank account in order to satisfy the judgment, which the Canton Municipal Court granted and put into effect on August 19, 2015. The Debtor discussed the garnishment with Mr. Thomas shortly thereafter and, per Debtor's sworn deposition, Mr. Thomas \"said that he would help us out by forwarding the money or loaning us the money to pay the judgment that was rendered against us in full....\" (Docket No. 28, p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 24, 2015, Mr. Thomas-not the Debtor-purchased a cashier's check from PNC Bank, made payable to the Defendant in the amount of $3,756.03. The funds were drawn from Mr. Thomas's personal account and funds. The Debtor then met with Mr. Thomas at the latter's residence and signed his name alongside Mr. Thomas's on the check per the Defendant's counsel's instructions. Later on August 24, the Debtor delivered the cashier's check to the Defendant's attorneys, Day Ketterer Ltd., and received a receipt. The Defendant accepted the cashier's check as record satisfaction of its judgment against the Debtor on August 31, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Debtor, along with his wife, Tiffany Myers, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief on October 7, 2015 and did not list Mr. Thomas as a creditor in their bankruptcy schedules. Trustee Harold A. Corzin was subsequently appointed as acting trustee\n   on behalf of the Debtor's estate and filed the complaint underlying this adversary proceeding on June 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) to or for the benefit of a creditor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (3) made while the debtor was insolvent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (4) made-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (A) on or within 90 days before the filing of the petition; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (B) between ninety days and one year before the date of the filing of the petition, if such creditor at the time of such transfer was an insider; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (5) that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (A) the case were a case under chapter 7 of this title;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (B) the transfer had not been made; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (C) such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by provisions of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MBNA America Bank, N.A. v.

Significantly, Mr. Thomas had the issuing bank make the cashier's check payable to the Defendant prior to handing it to the Debtor, an act that, under Ohio law, effectively prevented the funds from ever becoming property of the Debtor or his estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439478\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app/110/219/#p221\">\n    110 Ohio App. at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=168%20N.E.2d%20910\">\n    168 N.E.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Leo Syntax Auto Sales, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20N.E.2d%2068\">\n    215 N.E.2d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Upon Mr. Thomas's purchase of the cashier's check, the only two entities with property interests in the check were the named payee (the Defendant) and the issuing bank. Thus, the Defendant's receipt of the cashier's check does not constitute a voidable preference because, even though it \"pass[ed] through the debtor's hands in getting to\" the Defendant, the cashier's check never became property of the Debtor given that it was clearly earmarked for payment to the Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524989,11649383\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/1389/\">\n    983 F.2d at 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stated differently, the Debtor's estate has not been diminished by Mr. Thomas's payment to the Defendant because, instead of bettering one creditor at the expense of others, \"[t]he transaction merely substituted one creditor for another without loss to the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550206,12258022\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/1067/\">\n    825 F.2d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By obtaining satisfaction of the judgment debt owed the Defendant, the Debtor now owes Mr. Thomas instead of the Defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to no detriment of other creditors or the Debtor's estate because the funds transferred would not \"have been part of the estate had [they] not been transferred before the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Begier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121653\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/53/#p58\">\n    496 U.S. at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121653,6118743\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/110/2258/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Trustee's argument based upon\n   <em>\n    Yoppolo v.

Unlike the case at hand, where the Debtor delivered to the Defendant a cashier's check drawn from a third party's bank account, the transfer at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dilworth\n   </em>\n   concerned a debtor's balance transfer between two personal credit cards in her name.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3430746,4082701\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/562/\">\n    560 F.3d at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put simply,\n   <em>\n    Dilworth\n   </em>\n   did not involve a true\n   third party transfer and is thus largely inapplicable to the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Trustee asserts that Mr. Thomas would have paid whichever creditor the Debtor chose and that, accordingly, the Debtor \"exercised total control\" over the funds transferred. However, this argument relies on an unsupported presumption. The Court finds the Trustee's assertion of the Debtor's control to be unconvincing because it involves evidentiary inferences that are wholly unsupported by the record, particularly in light of the Debtor's sworn testimony that Mr. Thomas \"said he would help us out....\" (Docket No. 28, p. 7);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dilworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3430746,4082701\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/562/\">\n    560 F.3d at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the defendant bank \"never claimed...that anyone other than [the debtor] made\" the decision to make the transfer then at issue). Plaintiff has proffered no evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that would allow the Court to find that Mr. Thomas was coerced or forced by the Debtor into paying the Defendant, such that the Debtor exercised sufficient indirect control over the cashier's check to make the transfer avoidable as a preference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mr. Thomas's payment and satisfaction of the Debtor's judgment debt via cashier's check did not constitute an avoidable preferential transfer of property because at no point during the transaction did the funds at issue become property that would have been property of the Debtor's estate had the transaction not occurred. Accordingly, because there was never a point where the funds transferred would have become property of the Debtor's Chapter 7 estate if he had filed earlier, they fall outside the purview of the Trustee's avoidance powers and the Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Trustee's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court will enter a separate form of judgment granting the Motion for Summary Judgment consistent with this Memorandum Decision. The Court's Order granting the Motion for Summary Judgment will not be deemed entered until the separate form of Order has been docketed by the Clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The Court recognizes that the Debtor did not list Mr. Thomas in his Petition and Schedules. However, this fact is irrelevant to whether the cashier's check payment constituted a preference.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
