Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mechanicsburg Fitness, Inc. (the \"Debtor\") is a defunct fitness center that initiated this chapter 7 case on April 29, 2016. Prior to filing its petition, the Debtor was defending a civil suit (\"Civil Suit\") brought by Keefer and Hildebrand in the Cumberland County Court of Common Pleas (the \"State Court\"). In the Civil Suit, Keefer and Hildebrand sought damages for the alleged breach of two agreements they entered into with the Debtor to provide personal training services at the Debtor's Mechanicsburg location (the \"Complaint\"). The Debtor filed preliminary objections\n   (\"Preliminary Objections\") to the Complaint in the Civil Suit, which were overruled without opinion on April 29, 2015 (the \"State Court Order\"). Thereafter, the Debtor filed an answer with new matter in the Civil Suit, to which Keefer and Hildebrand responded. The Debtor filed bankruptcy on April 29, 2016 before the Civil Suit could proceed further. The Trustee was also appointed on April 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the conclusion of the section 341 meeting, the Trustee filed a Notice of Change from a No Asset Chapter 7 Case to an Asset Chapter 7 Case (the \"Asset Notice\"). The Asset Notice instructed creditors to file a proof of claim on or before October 6, 2017 if they wished to share in the distribution of funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Three timely claims were filed in response to the Asset Notice. The first was filed by Hildebrand asserting a general unsecured claim in the amount of $130,950.00 (the \"Hildebrand Claim\"). The basis of the Hildebrand Claim is breach of contract arising from the same facts and circumstances asserted in the Civil Suit. The second claim was filed by Keefer asserting a general unsecured claim in the amount of $283,240.00 on similar grounds to the Hildebrand Claim (the \"Keefer Claim\"). The third and final claim was filed by Whiteley asserting a general unsecured claim in the amount of $1,973,856.21 for money loaned (the \"Whiteley Claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 19, 2018, Whiteley filed the instant Motion Seeking Leave to Object to the Claims of Hildebrand and Keefer (the \"Motion\"). The Trustee filed his Response to the Motion on February 5, 2018 (the \"Response\") and a hearing was conducted on February 6, 2018. During the hearing, and as set forth in his Response, the Trustee objected to the Motion on multiple grounds, many of which relate to Whiteley's standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee also asserted that absent his refusal to pursue possible objections to certain claims, he has the exclusive right to object to proofs of claim and leave to object should generally not be granted to a third party. In addition to the foregoing, the Trustee argued that Whiteley's proposed objections to the Hildebrand and Keefer Claims are barred by the doctrines of issue preclusion, claim preclusion, and by the Rooker-Feldman Doctrine. Finally, the Trustee argued that Whiteley's proposed objections were premature and not ripe at that time because there were no assets in the case other than a potential fraudulent transfer claim against Whiteley (the \"Asset\"), which had not yet been brought by the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response to the Trustee's last argument, and to provide him with the opportunity to determine whether pursuit of the Asset was appropriate, the court continued the hearing to a future date. On April 25, 2018, the Trustee demonstrated his intent to pursue the Asset by filing an adversary complaint pursuant to sections 548 and 550 naming Whiteley as Defendant (the \"Adversary Complaint\"). The Adversary Complaint seeks to avoid certain pre-petition transfers and to recover the value of same from Whiteley for the benefit of the Debtor's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A final hearing on the Motion was held on June 26, 2018 where additional arguments were heard. The matter is now ripe for a decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

This determination necessarily includes an examination of a creditor's standing under section 502(a). The meaning of section 502(a), and the rights it confers upon a chapter 7 creditor as a matter of law, is therefore the central question presented in this case. For the reasons that follow, this court concludes that Whiteley is a party in interest with the right to object to the Hildebrand and Keefer Claims pursuant to section 502(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Pa. 2014). Section 502, for example, governs the allowance of claims and interests and provides any \"party in interest\" with standing to object.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Unfortunately, the Bankruptcy Code does not expressly define who qualifies as a \"party in interest\" for purposes of\n   section 502. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, however, has stated that a \"party in interest\" is \"anyone who has a legally protected interest that could be affected by a bankruptcy proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Global Indus. Tech., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5652513,4180308\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/201/\">\n    645 F.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Careful examination of the above principles demonstrates that the assessment for standing under Article III coincides with the test for standing as a \"party in interest\" under the Bankruptcy Code. Indeed, the Third Circuit has observed that \"[p]ersuasive authority indicates that Article III standing and standing under the Bankruptcy Code are effectively coextensive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5652513,4180308\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/201/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5652513,4180308\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/201/\">\n    at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the relevant query for this matter is whether Whiteley has a legally protected interest that could be affected by this bankruptcy proceeding. This court has little difficulty concluding that she does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 502(a) provides statutory protection to any \"claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section 501 of this title\" by deeming it \"allowed, unless a party in interest ... objects.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Presently, no one has objected to Whiteley's Claim, proof of which was filed under section 501. As such, Whiteley's Claim is currently deemed \"allowed\". This allowed claim represents Whiteley's legally protected interest in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As indicated above, however, the inquiry does not end there. To have standing, Whiteley must also show that her legally protected interest could be affected by this bankruptcy proceeding. For the reasons that follow, this court resolves that Whiteley's legally protected interest could be affected by this bankruptcy proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Consider the application of section 726 to this case. Section 726 is the distribution section for liquidation cases. It dictates the order in which distribution of property of the estate will occur when there are funds available for distribution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20726\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Generally, property is first distributed among priority claimants as determined by section 507, and in the order prescribed by section 507.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20726\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Second, subject to certain exceptions not relevant here, property is distributed among general unsecured creditors.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20726\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). When the funds available are inadequate to pay all the allowed claims in full, distributions within a particular class are made pro-rata.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20726\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Applying the directives of section 726 to the present case demonstrates how Whiteley's legally protected interest could be affected by this proceeding. Initially, the court observes that the value of the Asset in this case is inadequate to pay in full the total value of the claims filed in this matter. Accordingly, any distributions that may occur in this case will be pro-rata. This observation reveals a dynamic that illustrates how Whiteley's legally protected\n   interest could be affected by this proceeding. Specifically, as the aggregate value of all allowed priority and general unsecured claims increases, the amount available for distribution to any one of the general unsecured claims decreases. As such, the legally protected interest of every general unsecured claimant can be affected by the value and viability of every priority and other general unsecured claim. This dynamic naturally operates as an incentive for general unsecured claimants to object to the claims of priority and other general unsecured claimants. This is precisely what Whiteley seeks to do here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Whiteley's legally protected interest and the potential for it to be affected by this bankruptcy proceeding qualifies her as a section 502(a)\"party in interest\" under the standard articulated by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Global Industrial\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court therefore concludes that Whiteley is a party in interest with standing to object to the Hildebrand and Keefer Claims pursuant to section 502(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Meaning of \u00a7 502(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Having established Whiteley's standing as a creditor to object to the Claims, the court turns to the central question regarding the meaning of section 502(a), and the rights it confers upon a chapter 7 creditor as a matter of law. Whiteley argues that the language of the statute clearly provides her with an \"unqualified right as a creditor to file objections to the ... proofs of claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. at p. 6, June 27, 2018, ECF No. 68.

As stated above, section 502(a) governs the allowance of claims and provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section 501 of this title, is deemed allowed, unless a party in interest, including a creditor of a general partner in a partnership that is a debtor in a case under chapter 7 of this title, objects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Initially, the court detects no language within section 502(a) that when read in its ordinary and natural sense is susceptible to an interpretation different from the one offered by Whiteley. It may be, however, that a closer examination of the language of section 502(a) will reveal such ambiguity. Before commencing this examination, though, the court notes that there is certain language within section 502(a) that is not in dispute. For instance, it is common ground that Keefer and Hildebrand have each filed their claims under section 501, and that the Debtor is not a partnership. Accordingly, the words \"proof of which is filed under section 501 of this title\" and \"including a creditor of a general partner in a partnership that is a debtor in a case under chapter 7 of this title\" are inconsequential to this review. The relevant language of section 502(a) in this matter is therefore limited to this: \"A claim ... is deemed allowed, unless a party in interest ... objects.\" This is the language that the court will study to determine if section 502(a) is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As with the court's initial impression of section 502(a) before the inconsequential words were removed, the court again senses no ambiguity in the remaining language of the provision. It plainly provides that a claim will be considered allowed except where a \"party in interest\" opposes it. The term \"party in interest\" has already been defined as \"a person or entity with a legally protected interest that could be affected by the bankruptcy proceeding\" and is thus not susceptible to a different interpretation. The other component terms of section 502(a) are also not susceptible to differing interpretations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Just like the initial reading of section 502(a) and the reading of its relevant language thereafter, the court perceives no ambiguity in the component words and terms when individually read in their ordinary and natural sense. This observation does not change when these component words and terms are reassembled utilizing their common understandings. Doing so yields a reconstructed section 502(a) that reads as follows: \"A right to payment is considered permitted except upon the condition that a person or entity with a legally protected interest that could be affected by the bankruptcy proceeding opposes it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The language of section 502(a) is clear and unambiguous. It plainly authorizes a party in interest to object to any claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section 501 of the Code. Nowhere is this right made subject to any other provision of the Code or to the Trustee's refusal to pursue possible objections to certain claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, there is no language requiring a party in interest to seek leave of court before pursuing such an objection. Indeed, the Trustee does not appear to contest these observations. He has not directed the court to any disputed language within section 502(a) that when read in its ordinary and natural sense is reasonably susceptible to a different interpretation. Nor can the court locate any such language within the provision. Plainly stated, the language of section 502(a) is entirely unambiguous in this regard. Because the language of section 502(a) is unambiguous, it is the sole function of this court to enforce it according to its terms, unless the disposition required by the text is absurd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Disposition Required by the Text of Section 502(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The disposition required by the text of section 502(a) is not absurd. To the contrary, the disposition required by the text is entirely consistent with the central purpose of the bankruptcy code as it relates to creditors-equality of distribution.\n   <em>\n    Union Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220686\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/151/#p161\">\n    502 U.S. at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6508288\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/112/527/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Begier v.

It is also consistent with the requirement that chapter 7 cases be closed as \"expeditiously as is compatible with the best interest of parties in interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Creditors, through their pre-petition relationship with a debtor, are often in the best position to evaluate the claims of other creditors and, where appropriate, promptly file objections thereto. Allowing creditors to proceed in this manner facilitates resolution of the claims reconciliation process, which is necessary to ensure prompt and equal distributions. The circumstances of this case clearly support this concept. The court also notes that the Trustee has not argued that application of the text of section 502(a) will yield absurd results. The cases cited by the Trustee also do not advance this argument. In view of the foregoing, this court concludes that the disposition required by the plain text of section 502(a) is not absurd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Section 502(a) as an Authorization Paragraph\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Trustee counters the above conclusion by arguing that section 502(a) is \"not an authorization paragraph\" at all and that all it actually says is that \"there could be a\n   circumstance where a court may allow a creditor to object ... but it does not say that they have an absolute right\" to do so. Tr. at p. 42, June 27, 2018, ECF No. 68. In other words, the Trustee reads ambiguity into the statute because of what it does not say, rather than reading it for what it plainly says. This argument is unpersuasive. If section 502(a) was not intended to grant a party in interest the right to object to claims or interests, contrary to the literal reading of the text, then Congress could have included language to that effect. It did not. Presuming that Congress \"says in a statute what it means and means in a statue what it says there\", this court concludes that the failure to include such language was intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Trustee's argument encounters even greater headwinds in the face of another canon of interpretation. His contention that section 502(a) does not authorize a party in interest to object to a claim implies the existence of another Code provision that does. That is, if section 502(a) is not an authorization paragraph as the Trustee argues, then the words \"unless a party in interest objects\" can only be interpreted as reciting an authority provided for elsewhere in the Code. The problem with this argument is that there is no other provision in the Code that provides this authority. As such, the Trustee's interpretation of section 502(a) requires the court to construe the words \"unless a party in interest objects\" as inoperative and superfluous. Such a scenario violates one of the court's most basic interpretive canons which provides that \"[a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\"\n   <em>\n    Geisinger Cmty.

With a plain, non-absurd meaning in view, the court will not proceed this way. Instead, this court concludes that Congress must have intended that section 502(a) operate as an \"authorization paragraph\" because the key language \"unless a party in interest ... objects\" would not have any purpose or meaning if it did not. The most natural reading of section 502(a), then, is that it confers an unfettered right upon chapter 7 creditors to object to the claims or interest of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Ans. at \u00b6 2, Feb. 05, 2018, ECF No. 57. Because this court believes that the most natural reading of section 502(a) is that a creditor has an unrestricted right under section 502(a) to object to claims or interests in a chapter 7 case, the Trustee's burden to persuade the court otherwise is \"exceptionally heavy\".

Instead, the Trustee relies upon \"the way this section has been interpreted by the case law\" to support his position. Tr. at 43, June 27, 2018, ECF No. 68. To this end, the Trustee cites two cases in support of his argument.

Next, and notwithstanding the clear mandate to end the judicial inquiry there, the cases continue their examination into the controversial realm of legislative intent and policy consideration. No explanation is offered to justify the departure from the unambiguous text of the statute. Thereafter, the decisions cite policy considerations described in a leading bankruptcy treatise\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a 1983 Advisory Committee Note to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 3007 (\"Advisory Committee Note\") as sources of support for the decision to limit a creditor's right to object to a claim pursuant to section 502(a).

Ex A, Ans. at \u00b6 11, Jan. 03, 2018, ECF No. 46-1. In contrast, the issue presented to this court is whether Whiteley is authorized under federal bankruptcy law to file objections to the Keefer and Hildebrand Claims in the Debtor's bankruptcy case. This issue is entirely distinct from the issue raised in the State Court. The State Court was tasked with deciding whether Keefer and Hildebrand had pled sufficient facts to establish a viable claim against the Debtor under state law. Unlike that task, the issue before this court is whether Whiteley (not the Debtor) is authorized under section 502(a) of the Bankruptcy Code to file objections to the Keefer and Hildebrand Claims, independent of the merits or viability of those Claims. The latter has nothing to do with the former. Accordingly, the first element of issue preclusion-that the issues presented be identical-has not\n   been established by the Trustee in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Additionally, it is settled law in Pennsylvania that an order denying preliminary objections is not a \"final judgment\" on the merits. See\n   <em>\n    Creighan v. City of Pittsburgh,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1274017\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/389/569/\">\n    389 Pa. 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20A.2d%20867\">\n    132 A.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 870 (1957)\n   <em>\n    ;\n   </em>\n   see also Pa.R.A.P. 341(b). The State Court Order at issue in this matter involves the denial of preliminary objections and therefore does not represent a final judgment on the merits. The court notes that the Trustee has conceded this point. Tr. at p. 40, June 27, 2018, ECF No. 68. As such, it is admitted that the second element necessary to invoke the doctrine of issue preclusion-that there be a final judgment on the merits-is not met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, it is not disputed that the Civil Action was stayed by this bankruptcy proceeding before discovery was commenced and before the parties otherwise had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in question in that matter. Tr. at p. 40, June 27, 2018, ECF No. 68. As such, it is admitted that the fourth element necessary to invoke the doctrine of issue preclusion-that the party against whom it is asserted has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in question in a prior action-is not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Rooker-Feldman Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The doctrine of\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   likewise has no application to this matter. Here, the Trustee argues that Whiteley's Motion cannot be granted without violating the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine because it requires this court to review and reverse the State Court Order denying the preliminary objections. This argument fails because \"the narrow ground occupied by\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   \" does not apply to this case.\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus.

For the reasons that follow, this court concludes that the Trustee has not met his burden of proving the elements necessary to warrant application of the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Regarding the first element, the \"losing party\" in the State Court Civil Suit is the Debtor Mechanicsburg Fitness, Inc. In contrast, the \"federal plaintiff\" (or its functional equivalent) in this matter is Whiteley, not the Debtor. Since the losing party in the State Court Civil Suit is different from the party seeking relief in this court, the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine cannot apply here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, even if the Trustee could establish equivalence of the federal plaintiff\n   and the party that previously lost in state court, the Trustee has also failed to establish the second and fourth elements of the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine. The fourth element is not met here because Whiteley is not inviting this court to \"review and reject\" the state court judgment. In this context, the Third Circuit has characterized the term \"review and reject\" as synonymous with \"appellate review\".\n   <em>\n    Great Western\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709928\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/159/#p166\">\n    615 F.3d at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The term \"appellate review\", in turn, is defined by the Third Circuit as any \"review of the proceedings already conducted by the 'lower' tribunal to determine whether it reached its result in accordance with law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709928\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/159/#p166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Stated another way, if the federal court's review does not concern the bona fides of the state court's judgment, then the federal court is not conducting an appellate review and the \"review and reject\" component required to invoke the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine is not met.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709928\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/159/#p166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In such a situation, the second element of\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   is also not met because the plaintiff is not \"complaining of legal injury caused by a state court judgment because of a legal error committed by the state court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709928\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/159/#p166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As set forth above, the relief sought by Whiteley in this matter is entirely distinct from the relief sought by the Debtor in the State Court Civil Matter. The former seeks permission to file objections to the Keefer and Hildebrand Claims pursuant to section 502(a) of the Bankruptcy Code while the latter sought to dismiss the Civil Suit with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under Pennsylvania law. Considering and deciding Whiteley's Motion in no way requires this court to review the proceedings already conducted by the State Court or to determine whether it reached its result in accordance with law. In other words, this court's review of Whiteley's Motion does not concern the bona fides of the State Court Order dismissing the Preliminary Objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Considering these facts within the context of the framework established by the Third Circuit as referenced above, this court finds that the Trustee has not proven the first, second or fourth elements necessary to invoke the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine. Accordingly, this court concludes that the doctrines of claim preclusion, issue preclusion and Rooker-Feldman do not apply to this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Adhering to conventional doctrines of statutory interpretation, this court concludes that the clear and unambiguous language of section 502(a) authorizes a party in interest to object to any claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section 501 of the Code. Nowhere is this right made subject to any other provision of the Code or to the Trustee's refusal to pursue possible objections to certain claims. Additionally, the court finds that there is no language requiring a party in interest to seek leave of court before pursuing such an objection. Finally, this court finds that the doctrines of claim preclusion, issue preclusion, and\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   do not apply to this matter. Whiteley's Motion Seeking Leave to Object to the Claims of Hildebrand and Keefer, though unnecessary in view of these findings, will be granted for purposes of clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   An appropriate Order will follow.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, all future statutory references are to the Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    et seq.
