Catherine J. Furay, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Tristan and Lynnae McGough (\"Tristan,\" \"Lynnae,\" or \"Debtors\") filed a chapter 13 in this Court. Three creditors filed claims asserted to be secured by the Debtors' home. These claims, in order of the dates of their recording, are:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-10\">U.S. Bank National Association $176,516.33 Citibank, N.A. $52,968.34 First Tennessee Bank National Association $15,666.25</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtors objected to Citibank, N.A.'s (\"Citibank\") claim, stating (1) the claim of First Tennessee Bank National Association (\"First Tennessee\") is superior to the claim of Citibank because a release of the Citibank mortgage should have been filed,\n   and (2) the combined value of the U.S. Bank National Association (\"U.S. Bank\") and First Tennessee loans exceeds the value of the home and so Citibank is unsecured. Debtors later argued the Citibank mortgage was defective and invalid based on the lack of notarization of Lynnae's signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following an evidentiary hearing, the Court determined the value of the home is $190,000. The first position lien of U.S. Bank is undisputed. As a result, there is $13,483.77 in equity available for the second priority lien. Briefs have been submitted on the issue of priority and effect of the missing notarization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ADDITIONAL FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2005, Tristan borrowed $139,125.00 from World Savings Bank (\"World Savings\"), obtained a HELOC from Citibank (\"Citibank HELOC\") with a credit limit of $46,375.00, and granted both lenders mortgages in property located at 108 West Ridge Circle, Cambridge, Wisconsin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citibank recorded its mortgage on August 4, 2005, in the Dane County Register of Deeds Office. Both Tristan's and Lynnae's signatures appear on the mortgage conveyance, but only Tristan's is notarized. ECF No. 101-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 26, 2007, Debtors refinanced through First Tennessee. A Title Insurance Commitment was prepared (\"Commitment\"). The Commitment contained a requirement for satisfaction of both the World Savings and Citibank mortgages. The World Savings mortgage was paid at closing. A payment was also made on the Citibank HELOC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First Tennessee received two mortgages: one for the pay-off of the first mortgage to World Savings and another for paying down the Citibank HELOC. Both of those mortgages were recorded on October 1, 2007, in the Dane County Register of Deeds Office. ECF No. 101-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First Tennessee never obtained a release or satisfaction of Citibank's lien, nor did Citibank ever close the HELOC. On September 20, 2007, Debtors signed a letter to Citibank asking Citibank to \"[p]lease close the ... Line of Credit.\" ECF no. 101-2 at 38. Tristan did not personally deliver the letter, nor does he recall how it was sent to Citibank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 5, 2007, Citibank sent a letter to Tristan acknowledging receipt of funds to be applied to the HELOC. Citibank also stated that if he wanted to have the lien released, \"the attached form must be signed and returned ....\" ECF No. 97-6. The form also warned, \"If CitiMortgage does not receive this form within thirty (30) days, all funds received will be considered a pay down and the account will remain open. Additional account fees may be incurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Debtors did not fill out or return the form. As a result, the account remained open and Citibank did not release its lien. Between February 2008 and 2012, Tristan drew on the Citibank HELOC in the amount of $45,837.19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   First Tennessee assigned its first mortgage to Nationstar and then to U.S. Bank. U.S. Bank and Citibank entered into a stipulation confirming U.S. Bank's mortgage has priority over Citibank's.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   No. 99 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This Court ruled the fair market value of Debtors' homestead is $190,000.00. There is $13,483.77 in equity remaining after the U.S. Bank claim. If First Tennessee's mortgage has priority over Citibank, First Tennessee is secured in the amount of $13,483.77, and Citibank is wholly unsecured. If Citibank has priority over First Tennessee, Citibank is secured in the amount of $13,483.77 and First Tennessee is unsecured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Citibank holds a valid mortgage\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A valid mortgage enables Citibank to enforce its rights against the Debtors. Wisconsin Statutes section 706.02 outlines the formal requirements for a mortgage to be valid. Conveyances of real property will not be valid unless evidenced by a conveyance that satisfies all of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (a) identifies the parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (b) identifies the land;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (c) identifies the interest conveyed, and any material terms, conditions, or contingencies upon which the interest is to arise;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (d) is signed by or on behalf of each grantor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (f) is signed by or on behalf of each spouse, if the conveyance alienates any interest of a married person in a homestead; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (g) is delivered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20706.02\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 706.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a)-(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Citibank's mortgage satisfies those statutory requirements. It is evidence of a transaction between Citibank and Debtors. It identifies the parties, land, and interest conveyed. The grantors signed it. The document was undisputedly signed by both Tristan and Lynnae. ECF No. 101-6. The mortgage was delivered. The mortgage lien is valid as between Citibank and Debtors. The importance of recording concerns notice to future lenders who seek security in the same real estate. It has no effect on the relationship between the Debtors and lender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Citibank's mortgage should be considered recorded and perfected notwithstanding its failure to authenticate Lynnae's signature, and Citibank's claim is superior to First Tennessee's\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Chapter 706 of the Wisconsin Statutes contemplates that conveyances satisfying the formal requisites will be recorded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seelen v.

Debtors are not a competing or subsequent claimant, nor are they trying to protect\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   interest. In sum, Debtors cannot make First Tennessee's argument for it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   If there is an innocent third party, it is Citibank. The controversy over who holds a second mortgage and whose lien may be avoided is a problem of Debtors' and First Tennessee's own making. Debtors knew they had not closed the Citibank HELOC. They did not return the required forms and were aware failure to do so would mean the HELOC remained open. They knew the HELOC was secured by a mortgage they both signed. They continued to make withdrawals against the HELOC. Based on Debtors' failure to fill out the close out authorization form, Citibank understood those draws to be secured by its second priority mortgage. First Tennessee remitted funds toward payment of the Citibank HELOC without ever obtaining a release or satisfaction. It did not follow up with the title insurer to confirm a release was obtained. It knew the Citibank mortgage secured a HELOC and that future advances were possible. Had First Tennessee obtained a release, the Citibank HELOC would have been closed and the mortgage satisfied. The parties would then not be litigating this issue before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Citibank holds a valid, perfected mortgage against the Debtors' homestead. Debtors are not the proper party, if any, to argue subrogation on First Tennessee's behalf. Because Wisconsin is a race-notice jurisdiction and Citibank recorded its mortgage before First Tennessee, Citibank's claim is superior to First Tennessee's. The balance of the equities favors Citibank and subrogation, therefore, is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This decision is made without prejudice to the right of First Tennessee, if timely and appropriate, to seek to address any claims it may assert vis-\u00e0-vis Citibank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This decision shall constitute findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 7052 and Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A separate order consistent with this decision will be entered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Title may initially have been in Tristan's name alone, although no copy of the original title was presented.
