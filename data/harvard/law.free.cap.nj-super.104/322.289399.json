H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation, 7</em>7 <em>N. J. Super, </em>155 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962), affirmed <em>o. b. </em>41 N. <em>J. 3 </em>( 1963), we sustained the Director\u2019s right to revise a taxpayer\u2019s inventory from a Lifo to a Pifo basis, but the question as to whether sound accounting principles would require as a concomitant thereof the allowance of a reserve for accompanying increase of income tax liability was not considered by the court because not raised by the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The State\u2019s contention that the Director\u2019s mere administrative action in this matter will not actually increase the taxpayer\u2019s income tax liability for the years in question is irrelevant. Since the Director has departed from <em>actual </em>book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>inventory for present franchise tax purposes, he must assume, for such purposes, the hypothetical state of facts in relation to the taxpayer\u2019s income tax liability which sound accounting principles, according to the evidence in this case, would require to be reflected on the taxpayer\u2019s books concomitantly with a substitution of Eifo for Lifo inventory figures. <em>Cf. American Can Co. v. Director of Div. of Tax., </em>87 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 <em>(App. Div. </em>1965), certification denied 44 <em>N.
