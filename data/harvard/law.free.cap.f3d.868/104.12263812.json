PARKER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b131-18\">This appeal requires us to determine whether an ordinance passed by the Town of Oyster Bay to regulate the road-side solicitation of employment complies with the First Amendment. The district court concluded it did not and granted injunctive relief to Plaintiffs-Appellees the Workplace Project (\u2018Workplace\u201d) and Centro de La Comunidad de Hispana de Locust Valley (\u201cCentro\u201d), two entities that work to advance the interests of day laborers in the area. We affirm.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-19\">In 2009, the Town of Oyster Bay\u2019s board passed an ordinance titled \u201cSolicitation from Streets and Sidewalks Prohibited\u201d (the \u201cOrdinance\u201d), which principally imposed the following restriction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-20\">It shall be unlawful for any person standing within or adjacent to any public right-of-way within the Town of Oyster Bay to stop or attempt to stop any motor vehicle utilizing said public right-of-way for the purpose of soliciting employment of any kina from the occupants of said motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-21\">Joint Appendix on Appeal (\u201cApp\u2019x\u201d) 466-67.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Ordinance exempts the solicitation of a wide variety of \u201c[sjervice related activities such as taxicabs, limousine service, public transportation vehicles, towing operations, ambulance service and similar uses.\u201d App\u2019x 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-22\">The Ordinance\u2019s stated objective is to protect residents from \u201cthe dangers of ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>struction, distraction and delays of traffic caused by the solicitation of employment by pedestrians.\u201d App\u2019x 466. The record reflects that the actual impetus for the Ordinance was a desire to regulate day laborers seeking employment in, Oyster Bay. Specifically, the Town of Oyster Bay sought to restrict the effects of daily gatherings of usually 20-30, but sometimes 50, day laborers soliciting employment along a four-block stretch of Oyster Bay\u2019s Forest Avenue (known as the \u201cForest Avenue shape-up- site\u201d). At an initial public meeting, Oyster Bay residents complained that the day laborers were causing dangerous, congestive, unhygienic, and unsightly con-ditiong. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 734., At a subsequent public hearing, residents spoke both in favor of and against a proposed version of the Ordinance. Certain residents discussed traffic problems created by the laborers\u2019 solicitation, <em>see </em>App\u2019x 801, while others premised their objections on their views as to the laborers\u2019 immigration status, <em>see </em>App\u2019x 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Prior to the Ordinance\u2019s enactment, an investigation was conducted at the direction of Oyster Bay Town Supervisor and Defendant John Venditto. In furtherance of that investigation, Oyster Bay\u2019s Commissioner of Public Safety visited the Forest Avenue shape-up site \u201cbetween 15 and 20\u201d times, and, among the \u201cnumerous and repeated\u201d issues he observed caused by the day laborers\u2019 activities were: (i) automobile and pedestrian traffic^ congestion leading to hazards, delays, and noise disturbance; (ii) 20 to 30 day laborers \u201cswarm[ing]\u201d passing cars; and (iii) impeding and forced re-routing of school busses. App\u2019x 1029-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The Ordinance was unanimously adopted by the town board in September 2009. However, it has never been enforced and no person has been charged with violating it. App\u2019x 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In May 2010, Plaintiffs sued the Town of Oyster Bay and Town Supervisor Venditto (together, the \u201cTown\u201d) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to enjoin the Ordinance on the ground that it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. App\u2019x 128. The District Court found that the Ordinance likely violated the First Amendment and entered \u00e1 temporary restraining order that was converted into a preliminary injunction. The Town appealed to this Court contending'that Plaintiffs\u2019 members who were subject to the Ordinance were illegal immigrants engaging in illegal speech that was not protected by the First Amendment and, alternatively, that the Ordinance was narrowly tailored and therefore complied with the First Amendment. We affirmed on the ground that the district court had not abused its discretion in converting the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction and remanded to the District Court because the record on appeal contained no factual development. <em>Centro de la Comunidad Hispana de Locust Valley v. Town of Oyster Bay, </em>420 Fed.Appx. 97 (2d Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">On remand, the Town moved for partial summary judgment on the ground that Centro lacked standing. The court denied the motion, concluding that Centro adequately established that the Ordinance would impose actionable injuries to Centro as an organization. <em>Centro de La Comunidad Hispana de Locust Valley v. Town of Oyster Bay, </em>954 F.Supp.2d 127, 135-36 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). Subsequently, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted. <em>Centro de La Comunidad Hispana de Locust Valley v. Town of Oyster Bay, </em>128 F.Supp.3d 597 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). That ruling rejected the Town\u2019s argument that Workplace lacked standing, and, after finding that the Ordinance violated the First Amendment, permanently enjoined the Town from enforc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ing it. The district court\u2019s basis for finding the Ordinance unconstitutional was that although the Ordinance served a legitimate Town interest, it was insufficiently narrow to serve that interest and consequently could not pass muster under the First Amendment commercial speech framework of <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York, </em>447 U.S. 557, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u201cWe review de novo both a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and its determination of standing.\u201d <em>Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. U.S. Food &amp; Drug Admin., </em>710 F.3d 71, 79 (2d Cir. 2013). Summary judgment is proper only where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as- a matter of law.\u201d Fed, R. Civ. P. 56(a). We must \u201cconstru[e] the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw[ ] all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>Costello v. City of Burlington, </em>632 F.3d 41, 45 (2d Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The Town\u2019s main argument on appeal is that Workplace and Centro lack standing because they are essentially disorganized ad-hoc interest groups that aim to vindicate generalized grievances rather than redress concrete and imminent harms. The district court concluded that both organizations have standing to challenge the Ordinance because they both established that enforcement of the Ordinance would pose a \u201cperceptible impairment\u201d to their activities. 954 F.Supp.2d at 134-37 (Centro); 128 F.Supp.3d at 607-09 (Workplace).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">We conclude that the district court correctly held that Workplace has standing. Because this conclusion is a sufficient predicate for federal jurisdiction, we are not called on to consider, and therefore do not reach, the question of whether Centro has standing. It is well settled that where, as here, multiple parties seek the same relief, \u201cthe presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy Article Ill\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement.\u201d <em>Rumsfeld v. Forum of Acad. and Inst. Rights, Inc., </em>547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006); see <em>also Doe v. Bolton, </em>410 U.S. 179, 189, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973); <em>Bowsher v. Synar, </em>478 U.S. 714, 721, 106 S.Ct. 3181, 92 L.Ed.2d 583 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">It is undisputed that Workplace is an incorporated membership organization based in Nassau County, New York, the same county in which Oyster Bay is located. App\u2019x 990. Its mission is to \u201cend the exploitation of Latino immigrant workers on Long Island and to achieve socioeconomic justice by promoting the full political,, economic and cultural participation of those workers in the communities in which they live.\u201d App\u2019x 990. Workplace furthers its mission \u201cwith the participation of Latino immigrant workers on Long Island through community organizing, legal support, education, leadership development, and building worker cooperatives.\u201d App\u2019x at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">To establish standing, Workplace, as an organization, bore the burden of showing: (i) an imminent \u201cinjury in fact\u201d to itself as an organization (rather than to its members) that is \u201cdistinct and palpable\u201d; (ii) that its injury is \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to enforcement of the Ordinance; and (iii) that, a favorable .decision would redress its injuries. <em>Nnebe v. Daus, </em>644 F.3d 147, 156 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)); <em>see also Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2334, 2342, 189 L.Ed.2d 246 (2014) (\u201cThe party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing standing\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Supreme Court has held that an organization establishes an injury-in-fact if it can show that it was \u201cperceptibly impaired\u201d by defendant\u2019s actions. <em>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, </em>455 U.S. 363, 379, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982). Consequently, we have repeatedly held that \u201conly a \u2018perceptible impairment\u2019 of an organization\u2019s activities is necessary for there to be an \u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d <em>Nnebe, </em>644 F.3d at 157 (quoting <em>Ragin v. Harry Macklowe Real Estate Co., </em>6 F.3d 898, 905 (2d Cir. 1993)); <em>N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., </em>684 F.3d 286, 294 (2d Cir. 2011); <em>N.Y. State Citizens\u2019 Coal. for Children v. Velez, </em>629 Fed.Appx. 92, 94 (2d Cir. 2015). Moreover, we have held that where, as here, a party seeks review of a prohibition prior to its being enforced, \u201csomewhat relaxed standing\u201d rules apply. <em>Nat'l Org. for Marriage, Inc. v. Walsh, </em>714 F.3d 682, 689 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The Town challenges only the district court\u2019s determination as to the first standing prong, arguing that Workplace failed to establish injuries that were concrete or imminent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">A. Workplace Established Concrete Injuries</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Workplace asserted that enforcement of the Ordinance will injure it in three ways. First, enforcement will adversely impact its ability to organize day laborers because the Ordinance will necessarily disperse and reduce the number of day laborers gathering in Oyster Bay. Second, enforcement will require Workplace to divert resources from other of its activities to combat the effects of the Ordinance. And third, enforcement will expose its advocates to risk of arrest because those enforcing the Ordinance cannot- differentiate between advocacy activities and the day laborers\u2019 solicitation. Tellingly, the Town essentially concedes that those injuries could confer standing, but argues primarily that Workplace has not shown they have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">But the Supreme Court has been clear that in a pre-enforcement action such as this \u201cthe injury required for standing need not be actualized. A party facing prospective injury has standing to sue where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct.\u201d <em>Davis v. F.E.C., </em>554 U.S. 724, 734, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). Workplace has met this standard. It presented evidence identifying the concrete and particularized injuries that the Ordinance will impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">The record demonstrates that Workplace\u2019s activities include traveling to day laborer sites in Oyster Bay to speak with laborers and if the Ordinance achieves one of its principal objectives \u2014 disbursement of day laborers \u2014 Workplace will inevitably face increased difficulty in meeting with and organizing those laborers. App\u2019x 991. We have held that an organization shows injury-in-fact where, as here, a \u201cpolicy has impeded, and will continue to impede, the organization\u2019s ability to carry out [its] responsibilities].\u201d N.Y. <em>Civil Liberties Union, </em>684 F.3d at 295; <em>see also Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, </em>657 F.3d 936, 943 (9th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">Relatedly, it is also clear that the Ordinance will force Workplace to divert money from its other current activities to advance its established organizational interests (ie., if the laborers are dispersed, it will be more costly to reach them). In fact, Workplace offered unrebutted testimony that it has already had to devote attention, time, and personnel to prepare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>its response to the Ordinance. App\u2019x 956-57. And, where an organization diverts its resources away from its current activities, it has suffered an injury that has been repeatedly held to be independently sufficient to confer organizational standing. <em>See Havens Realty Corp., </em>455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct. 1114 (a \u201cconcrete and demonstrable injury to [an] organization\u2019s activities\u2014 with the consequent drain on the organization\u2019s resources \u2014 constitutes far more than simply a setback to the organization\u2019s abstract social interests\u201d); <em>see also Olsen v. Stark Homes, Inc., </em>759 F.3d 140, 158 (2d Cir. 2014); <em>Nnebe, </em>644 F.3d at 157; <em>Ragin, </em>6 F.3d at 905. Significantly, the Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed <em>Havens Realty's, </em>holding that a nonprofit organization establishes an injury-in-fact-if, as here, it establishes that it \u201cspent money to combat\u201d activity that harms its organization\u2019s core activities. <em>Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1296, 1303, 197 L.Ed.2d 678 (2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Finally, Workplace offered evidence that those responsible for enforcing the Ordinance are likely to confuse the conduct of Workplace\u2019s activists with that of the day laborers. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 727-78 (testimony from a Town law enforcement officer that he is unable to distinguish day laborers from activists in a photo taken at a shape-up site); App\u2019x 958-60 (testimony from Workplace activist that she fears her activism will be mistaken for conduct prohibited by the Ordinance). As the district court concluded, not only might this create a risk of erroneous arrest, it makes it \u201cperceptible that enforcement of the Ordinance would prevent Workplace from engaging in counseling at shape-up sites within the Town and thus impair its advocacy activities.\u201d 128 F.Supp.3d at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">As discussed, each of Workplace\u2019s demonstrated injuries are sufficient to constitute an injury-in-fact. In light of these considerations, we conclude that Workplace has shown that the Ordinance threatens the requisite \u201cperceptible impairment\u201d of its activities and thus imposes concrete injuries for purposes of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">B. Workplace Established Imminent Injuries</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The Town next argues that even if the Ordinance could affect advocates working on behalf of day laborers in the ways Workplace asserts, Workplace has not shown that it will conduct such work within the relevant area of Oyster Bay. Br. of Appellants 33-34. Consequently, according to the Town, any potential injury to Workplace is not imminent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">The record establishes that Workplace had substantially more than an imminent intention to engage in the activity that would subject it to the injuries it asserted. Workplace has actively worked in Oyster Bay and actively campaigned against the Ordinance on behalf of its members. This conduct amounted to much more than a \u201c \u2018some day\u2019 intention\u201d or a \u201cvague desire\u201d to engage in the activities that will subject it to its asserted injuries. <em>See Summers v. Earth Island Inst., </em>555 U.S. 488, 496, 129 S.Ct. 1142, 173 L.Ed.2d 1 (2009). The case law makes clear that Workplace\u2019s injuries are sufficiently imminent. In <em>Davis, </em>554 U.S. at 734, 128 S.Ct. 2759, for example, Justice Alito, writing for a majority of the court, held that a political candidate faced injury sufficiently imminent to challenge campaign disclosure requirements by simply declaring his intention to run for office and to spend more than the amount for which disclosure was required. Here, Workplace has done at least as much as what passed muster in <em>Davis </em>and, as a consequence, has established imminent injuries. In sum, Workplace established its standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We now turn to the constitutionality of the Ordinance under the First Amendment. Our preliminary task is to determine if the Ordinance is even subject to the First Amendment by asking if it restricts speech based on its content. We conclude that the Ordinance is a content-based restriction, specifically, a restriction on commercial speech. So finding, we then assess whether the Ordinance, survives the <em>Central Hudson </em>test applicable to commercial speech restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The district court, applying <em>Central Hudson, </em>concluded that the Ordinance is a content-based commercial speech restriction that was not narrowly drawn and, as a consequence, violated the First Amendment. Specifically, it concluded that the Ordinance targets speech concerning lawful activity; that the Town\u2019s interest is substantial; that the Ordinance directly advances that interest; but that the Ordinance was not narrowly tailored to serve that interest. <em>See Central Hudson, </em>447 U.S. at 566, 100 S.Ct. 2343.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We arrive at essentially the same conclusion as the district court. Specifically, we agree that: (i) the Ordinance restricts speech based on its content and is therefore subject th the First Amendment; and (ii) the Ordinance fails the <em>Central Hudson </em>test because it is an overbroad commercial speech prohibition. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">A. The Ordinance Is a Content-Based Restriction</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Workplace is correct that the Ordinance implicates the First Amendment because it restricts speech based on its content. Although the Ordinance has a conduct component \u2014 the attempted stopping of a vehicle \u2014 the Ordinance only punishes such conduct if done \u201cfor the purpose of soliciting employment.\u201d Consequently, Town officials must monitor and evaluate the speech of those stopping or attempting to stop vehicles and they may sanction the speaker only if a suspect says the wrong thing, for example, \u201chire me\u201d as opposed to \u201ctell me the time.\u201d This' is a content-based restriction and it is well settled that such restrictions implicate the First Amendment. For example, in <em>Police Department of the City of Chicago v. Mosley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), the Supreme. Court assessed a city ordinance which prohibited peaceful picketing unless it was aimed at a school labor-management dispute. The Court invalidated the ordinance as content-based because \u201cit describefd] permissible picketing in terms.of its subject matter,\u201d in that, as here, the \u201coperative distinction [between the permissible and impermissible conduct] is the message.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">B. <em>Central Hudson </em>Test for Commercial Speech</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">The district court correctly concluded that, 'because the Ordinance restricts speech only if it constitutes soliciting of employment, the speech targeted by the Ordinance is commercial speech. It is well 's\u00e9ttled that speech that is no more than a proposal of possible employment is a \u201cclassic example\u201d of commercial speech. <em>Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>413 U.S. 376, 385, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973); <em>see also Maldonado v. Holder, </em>763 F.3d 155, 173 (2d Cir. 2014) (Lynch, J., dissenting;). Because the Ordinance targets commercial speech, which is afforded less protection than other constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression, it is subject to the <em>Central Hudson </em>analysis, to which we now turn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>In contrast to the strict scrutiny applied to, for example, core political speech restrictions, the <em>Central Hudson </em>test for commercial speech restrictions is a form of intermediate scrutiny. <em>See Safelite Grp., Inc. v. Jepsen, </em>764 F.3d 258, 261 (2d Cir. 2014). It requires us to ask: (i) if the Ordinance restricts speech that concerns lawful activity; (ii) if the Town\u2019s asserted interest is substantial; (iii) if the Ordinance directly advances that interest; and (iv) if the Ordinance is more extensive than necessary to serve that interest? <em>Central Hudson, </em>447 U.S. at 566, 100 S.Ct. 2343. The government bears the burden of justifying the restriction. <em>Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., </em>463 U.S. 60, 71 n.20, 103 S.Ct. 2875, 77 L.Ed.2d 469 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">i. The Restricted Speech Concerns Lawful Activity</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u201cFor commercial speech to come within [the protection of the First Amendment], it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.\u201d <em>Central Hudson, </em>447 U.S. at 566, 100 S.Ct. 2343. The district court concluded that the speech targeted by the Ordinance \u2014 -the solicitation of employment \u2014 \u201cis not in and of itself illegal,\u201d and therefore the speech prohibited by the Ordinance is protected by the First Amendment. 128 F.Supp.3d at 614. We too conclude that the Ordinance restricts First Amendment protected speech that \u201cconcem[s] lawful activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The Supreme Court has offered guidance on what it means for speech to \u201cconcern lawful activity.\u201d Notably, in <em>Pittsburgh Press, </em>it held a prohibition against gender-based placement of help-wanted ads restricted speech that did not concern lawful activity, concluding that the ads were entitled to no First Amendment protection because \u201c[discrimination in employment ... is illegal commercial activity.\u201d 413 U.S. at 388, 93 S.Ct. 2553; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cWe have no doubt that a newspaper constitutionally could be forbidden to publish a want ad proposing a sale of narcotics or soliciting prostitutes.\u201d). The basis for stripping such speech of all First Amendment protection was that \u201cthe commercial activity itself is illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 93 S.Ct. 2553. Our cases decided after <em>Pittsburgh Press </em>offer additional clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">In <em>Swedenburg v. Kelly, </em>358 F.3d 223 (2d Cir. 2004), <em>rev\u2019d on unrelated grounds, </em>544 U.S. 460, 125 S.Ct. 1885, 161 L.Ed.2d 796 (2005), we assessed a New York statute prohibiting unlicensed persons from sending into the state \u201cpublicationfs] of any kind containing an advertisement or a solicitation of any order for any alcoholic beverages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240. New York law prohibited unlicensed persons from shipping alcohol into' the state, and New York argued that it interprets its prohibition to apply only to the solicitation of such illegal orders. However, we affirmed invalidation of the statute because its \u201cbroad language\u201d also restricted the <em>advertisement </em>(and not just solicitation) of alcoholic beverages. <em>Id. </em>at 240-41. Consequently, because the statute could be applied to restrict speech promoting lawful activity, we held the restricted speech \u201cconcerns lawful activity\u201d per <em>Central Hudson. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">In <em>Alexander v. Cahill, </em>598 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2010), we interpreted the \u201cnot be misleading\u201d component of <em>Central Hudson\u2019s </em>first prong. There, we held attorney advertising restrictions that prohibited \u201cpotentially misleading ads\u201d were subject to <em>Central Hudson. Id. </em>at 89. We noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201c \u2018States may not place an absolute prohibition on certain types of potentially misleading information ... if the information also may be presented in a way that is not deceptive.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89 (quoting <em>In re R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. 191, 203, 102 S.Ct. 929, 71 L.Ed.2d 64 (1982)). Although not addressing <em>Central Hudson's </em>\u201cconcem[s] lawful activity\u201d language, <em>Alexander </em>shows that commercial speech is not categorically removed from the First Amendment on a specified basis if that basis is not applicable to all manifestations of the restricted speech. <em>See id. </em>at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Educational Media Co. at Virginia Tech, Inc. v. Swecker, </em>602 F.3d 583 (4th Cir. 2010) is also instructive. To combat underage drinking, Virginia\u2019s Alcoholic Beverage Control Board prohibited \u201ccollege student publications\u201d from advertising alcoholic beverages. Two student newspapers sued. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the prohibition was a restriction on commercial speech that concerned lawful activity. It concluded as such because even though the newspapers\u2019 readers were <em>primarily </em>under the legal drinking age, the restriction applied to ads that could be viewed by those who were of age:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">On its face, \u00a7 5-20-40(B)(3) does not restrict commercial speech <em>solely </em>distributed to underage students; rather, it applies <em>to </em>commercial speech that, though <em>primarily </em>intended for underage students, also reaches of-age readers. Therefore, the commercial speech regulated by \u00a7 5-20-40(B)(3) concerns lawful activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5v\"><em>Id. </em>at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The Ninth Circuit has addressed <em>Central Hudson\u2019s </em>\u201cconcerns lawful activity\u201d component specifically in the context of a day labor solicitation restriction. <em>Valle Del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, </em>709 F.3d 808, 821 (9th Cir. 2013). In <em>Valle, </em>the government argued that the speech concerned unlawful activity because the prohibition only applied to solicitation \u201cwhen associated with the unlawful activity of blocking or impeding traffic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court rejected the argument, and held plaintiffs met their burden of demonstrating that their solicitation concerns lawful activity, \u201cbecause it is legal to hire or be hired for day labor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">In sum, the First Amendment offers no protection to speech that proposes a commercial transaction if consummation of that transaction would <em>necessarily </em>constitute an illegal act. However, if, as here, there are plausible ways to complete a proposed transaction lawfully, speech proposing that transaction \u201cconcerns lawful activity\u201d and is therefore protected commercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">The Town argues that because each proposed employment transaction by a day laborer whom the Ordinance targets would be an under-the-table illegal employment arrangement, in violation of immigration, tax, and labor laws, that solicitation of those transactions does not and cannot \u201cconcern lawful activity.\u201d Br. of Appellants at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">This argument lacks merit. It is without question that the Ordinance could be applied to prohibit speech proposing no illegal transaction. As the district court correctly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">[The Ordinance] extends to any individual soliciting employment positioned on property \u201cadjacent to\u201d the Town\u2019s streets and sidewalks \u2014 even if that individual does not enter the roadway and is a U.S.\" citizen, who appropriately discloses all his income to federal, state and local income tax authorities, and is the only person in the immediate area on a lightly traveled road with ample parking spaces for any solicited vehicle to lawful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ly pull over. In other words, it reaches speech that is potentially lawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">128 F.Supp.3d at 615. We are in accord, and, consequently, we conclude that the Ordinance restricts speech concerning lawful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">ii. The Town\u2019s Asserted Interest is Substantial</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The Town\u2019s asserted interest in the Ordinance \u201cis to protect the health, safety and welfare of motorists and pedestrians using public rights-of-way in the Town of Oyster Bay from the traffic and other dangers brought about by street side solicitation.\u201d Dkt. 10-cv-02262, No. 132-1 at 32 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2014). This interest is substantial under <em>Central Hudson. See, e.g., Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, </em>453 U.S. 490, 507, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">iii. The Ordinance Directly Advances That Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The third step of <em>Central Hudson </em>concerns the relationship between the harm underlying the Town\u2019s interest and the means identified by the Town to advance that interest. <em>Greater New Orleans Broad. Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 173, 188, 119 S.Ct. 1923, 144 L.Ed.2d 161 (1999) cautions that the speech restriction must \u201cdirectly and materially advance[] the asserted government interest.\u201d For good reason, this prong is largely unchallenged by Workplace. Clearly, prohibiting individuals from stopping traffic to seek employment furthers the interest of traffic and pedestrian safety. Moreover, the Town offered evidence of the hazards caused by laborers\u2019 congregation at the Forest Avenue shape-up site. Although the Ordinance may be underinclusive, \u201cin the commercial speech context, the Supreme Court has made clear that underinclusiveness will not necessarily defeat a claim that a state interest has been materially advanced.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Treadwell, </em>294 F.3d 453, 463 (2d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">iv.The Ordinance is Not Narrowly Drawn</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">Under <em>Central Hudson\u2019s </em>fourth prong, the Town bore the burden of establishing that the Ordinance is \u201cnarrowly drawn to further the interests served.\u201d <em>United States v. Caronia, </em>703 F.3d 149, 167 (2d Cir. 2012). The Town did not have to show that it chose the least restrictive means of advancing its asserted interests, nor that there was no conceivable alternative. Rather, its obligation was to establish that the regulation not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further its legitimate interests. <em>Safelite Grp., Inc., </em>764 F.3d at 265; <em>Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. v. City of New York, </em>594 F.3d 94, 104 (2d Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">The district court correctly concluded that the Town failed to meet this obligation. It held that the Ordinance is' \u201cextremely far-reaching,\u201d in that it prohibits speech that \u201cpose[s] [no] threat to safety on the Town\u2019s streets and sidewalks.\u201d 128 F.Supp.3d at 618. It then found that the Town had available to it \u201cless burdensome alternatives available to address street and sidewalk safety,\u201d citing to numerous state and local public safety laws. <em>Id. </em>at 619-20. On those bases, the district court concluded that the Ordinance fails <em>Central Hudson\u2019s </em>fourth prong. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">The Ordinance does not require any connection between the prohibited speech\u2014 solicitation of employment \u2014 and the asserted interest \u2014 traffic and pedestrian safety. There are numerous ways in which an individual, \u201cadjacent to any public right-of-way,\u201d might \u201cattempt to stop [a] motor vehicle utilizing said public right-of-way for the purpose of soliciting employment\u201d that would cause no threat whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>to public safety. The district court-offered several apt examples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">[The Ordinance] reaches a lone person standing on the sidewalk, away from the curb, who attempts to make known to the occupants of vehicles his availability for work even if it does not result in a car stopping in traffic or double parking. It reaches children selling lemonade at the end of <em>a </em>neighbor\u2019s driveway (which is, after all, \u201cadjacent to\u201d a public right of way), the veteran holding a sign on a sidewalk stating \u201cwill work for food,\u201d and students standing on the side of a road advertising a school carwash. Even a person standing on the sidewalk holding a sign \u201clooking for work \u2014 park at the curb if you are interested in hiring me\u201d would violate the ordinance as it contains no specific intent element and no requirement that the \u201cattempt to stop\u201d result in traffic congestion, the obstruction of other vehicles, or double parking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Town argues at the outset that this reasoning by the district court was faulty because it erroneously assessed the impact of the Ordinance on individuals not before the court <em>(ie., </em>day laborers or lemonade stand vendors). Specifically, the Town posits that because Workplace only established organizational (rather than representational) standing, it was . error for the district court to- evaluate the impact of the Ordinance on anyone but Workplace as an organization. <em>See </em>Br. of Appellants at 6-7 (describing this as a \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d). The Town\u2019s argument appears to depend on the'principle announced in <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 497, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982), that it \u201cis irrelevant whether [an] ordinance has an overbroad scope encompassing protected commercial speech of other persons, because the overbreadth doctrine does not apply to commercial speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYF\">This argument fails because the Supreme Court has been clear that overbreadth challenges to commercial speech restrictions may be' brought if the prohibition \u201creach[es] some noncommercial speech.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trs. of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, </em>492 U.S. 469, 482, 109 S.Ct. 3028, 106 L.Ed.2d 388 (1989). Here, it is without question that Workplace\u2019s activities impacted by the Ordinance constitute core First Amendment activity. <em>See Vill. of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Env't., </em>444 U.S. 620, 632, 100 S.Ct. 826, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980) (basic First Amendment activities include \u201ccommunication of information, the dissemination and propagation of views and ideas, and the advocacy of causes\u201d); <em>see also N.A.A.C.P. v. State of Ala. ex rel. Patterson, </em>357 U.S. 449, 462, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958) (First Amendment activities of advocacy groups are particularly sensitive \u201cwhere a group espouses dissident beliefs\u201d). Because of the Town\u2019s restriction on commercial speech, Workplace\u2019s ability to engage in those core First Amendment activities will be directly and adversely impacted in the manners we previously described, <em>supra </em>109-12. Accordingly, the Ordinance clearly \u201creach[es] some noncommercial speech,\u201d and the district court was free to assess its broader impact on hypothetical individuals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And we agree with the district court that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Ordinance\u2019s impact on the commercial speech of those hypothetical individuals is too broad to survive <em>Central Hudson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We also find it significant that the Ordinance does not apply to the most common forms of solicitation involving the stopping of vehicles on public rights of way, such as the hailing of a taxi or a public bus. These exemptions strongly suggest that in the great majority of situations, stopping a vehicle on a public right of way creates no inherent safety issue. Entirely prohibiting one speech-based subset of an activity that is not inherently disruptive raises the question whether the Town\u2019s actual motivation was to prevent speech having a particular content, rather than address an actual traffic and pedestrian congestion issue. <em>See Glickman v. Wileman Bros. &amp; Elliott, Inc., </em>521 U.S. 457, 493, 117 S.Ct. 2130, 138 L.Ed.2d 585 (1997) (Souter, J. dissenting) (\u201c \u2018[Exemptions and inconsistencies\u2019 in alcohol labeling ban \u2018bring into question the purpose of the ... ban,\u2019 such that it does not survive the <em>Central Hudson </em>test\u201d) (quoting <em>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., </em>514 U.S. 476, 489, 115 S.Ct. 1585, 131 L.Ed.2d 532 (1995)); <em>The Florida Star v. B.J.F., </em>491 U.S. 524, 540, 109 S.Ct. 2603, 105 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (\u201c[T]he facial un-derinclusiveness of \u00a7 794.03 raises serious doubts about whether Florida is, in fact, serving, -with this statute, the significant interests which appellee invokes.\u201d). And, as discussed below, it is relevant to the \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d analysis if the\" Town was principally motivated in restricting a particular category of speech, rather than the \u201ctraffic safety\u201d interests it has asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The Town responds by arguihg that the Ordinance is narrowly drawn despite its broad exemptions because the Ordinance is aimed at the specific situation at the Forest Avenue shape-up site, which, unlike a singular taxi hailer for example, involves large numbers of people gathered, in groups to stop cars. But the Ordinance does not limit solicitation of employment when done in large groups, it broadly extends to all types- of solicitation. Therefore, the Ordinance is not \u201cnarrowly drawn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Finally, it is an \u201cimportant consideration\u201d to the \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d requirement if there existed \u201cnumerous and obvious less-burdensome alternatives to the restriction on commercial speech\u201d <em>Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., </em>515 U.S. 618, 632, 115 S.Ct. 2371, 132 L.Ed.2d 541 (1995). The district court cited to \u201ca number of less burdensome alternatives' to address street and sidewalk safety.\u201d 128 F.Supp.3d at 619. As one notable example, Section 173-4 of the Town\u2019s Code prohibits a \u201csolicitor\u201d from (i) \u201coccupying] any stationary location in any street or any public property\u201d; or (ii) \u201csoliciting] in any congested place or an area when or where such activity may impede or inconvenience the public or add to the congestion of such place or area.\u201d Section 173-4 is probative not only because it is an example of a less content-based tool than the Ordinance to stop the precise harm the Town claims motivated the Ordinance; It also demonstrates how the Town could have drawn the' Ordinance' such that it would advance 'its asserted interest while limiting the impact \u00f3n constitutionally'protected speech by tying the prohibition to a manifestation of the harm sought to be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The Town argues that the regulations identified by the district court do \u201cnot address the full panoply of dangers that have arisen and are concomitant with a bustling street-side labor market.\u201d Br. of Appellants at 60. Even assuming, <em>arguen-4o, </em>this to be true, it is of no moment. The Ordinance does not prohibit a \u201cbustling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>street-side labor market\u201d; it broadly prohibits any attempt to stop a vehicle to solicit employment anywhere in Oyster Bay irrespective of its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">It is therefore clear that the Ordinance simply adds a speech-based component to an already existing prohibition. This is another indication that the principal interest the Town aimed to serve was the suppression of that particular speech, rather than the interests in traffic and pedestrian safety that it asserted before the district court. We refuse to conclude that the Ordinance is narrowly drawn where it broadly impacts protected speech and only narrowly addresses the Town\u2019s stated interest. In <em>Edenfield v. Fane, </em>507 U.S. 761, 768, 113 S.Ct. 1792, 123 L.Ed.2d 543 (1993), the Court cautioned that under <em>Central Hudson, </em>courts should not \u201cturn away if it appears that the stated interests are not the actual interests served by the restriction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that the district court correctly held that the Ordinance is an unconstitutional restriction of commercial speech in violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Finally, we note that the dissent faults us for affirming the invalidation of the entire Ordinance, including subdivision D, rather than severing subdivision C. Dissenting op. at 124-25. This contention is the exclusive concern of our dissenting colleague, not of the parties. Plaintiffs have sought invalidation of the entire Ordinance since the inception of this litigation. During the seven years that this litigation has been pending, the Town has never raised the prospect of severing the Ordinance, not in its pleadings, not during extensive summary judgment proceedings, and not in the two appeals taken to this Court. If the Town wanted severance as an alternative remedy it, presumably, would have said so. In any event, the law is well settled that arguments as to severability are waived where, as here, a party fails to raise the issue. See, <em>e.g., Redondo Beach, </em>657 F.3d at 951 n.10; <em>Bishop v. Smith, </em>760 F.3d 1070, 1095 (10th Cir. 2014); <em>Lozano v.

Because we conclude that the Ordinance fails even assuming the restricted speech is commercial speech, which is \"affordfed] less protection\u201d than political speech, <em>Connecticut Bar Association v.

I would therefore order dismissal for lack of standing. Beyond that (if one can get beyond that), the injunction entered by the district court is more broad than the First Amendment violation found can justify, and is obviously formulated to remedy harms that were not found and were in any event not inflicted on these plaintiffs. The mess is unusually thick.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">An Ordinance of the Town of Oyster Bay bars pedestrians from soliciting work from areas adjacent to a roadway and bars drivers from pulling over to pick them up. The complaint alleges that the Ordinance, which seems clearly aimed at conditions created by the recruitment of day laborers, violates rights of free speech, equal protection, and due process. The district court found that the bar on solicitation violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the First Amendment and declined to reach other claimed grounds for relief. Unaccountably, however, the district court enjoined the enforcement of the entire Ordinance \u2014 including its regulation of drivers, which has no First Amendment ramification. The majority on appeal affirms the injunction in whole, and finds jurisdiction on the basis that one of the organizations had standing (without reaching the standing of the other). Because I would dismiss for lack of standing, I reach the standing question as to both plaintiff organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">According to the complaint, plaintiff Centro de la Comunidad Hispana de Locust Valley (\u201cCentro\u201d) is an \u201cunincorporated membership organization.\u201d That is a boast. It has no organization to speak of: no charter, no bylaws, no bank accounts, no funding, no expenditures. And it seems to have no members: anybody who shows up at a meeting (if there are any) is deemed a member; the only member identified in the record is one Luz Torres, who is the chairperson of whatever it is; and she conceded at deposition that \u201cwe don\u2019t have membership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">This supposed organization was formed (according to Torres) at a community meeting a few months after the Town of Oyster Bay adopted the challenged Ordinance. Although Torres says that Centro has some other generalized reasons to exist, she admits that the Ordinance was \u201cthe principal reason\u201d it was formed. App. 529. That is easily demonstrated. There has been for twenty years an organization of similar name (Centro Cultural Hispano de Oyster Bay y Vecindades), of which Torres was a co-founder; Torres proposed that it sue the Town over the Ordinance; and only after at least some portion of the board disapproved did Torres think of creating a new organization.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A document memorializing a community meeting shortly before (new) Centro\u2019s supposed formation includes bullet points of items discussed: the first bullet point is \u201cCreate an organization that is responsible and will support us\u201d; and the third bullet point is \u201cFile the lawsuit.\u201d (The second and fourth agenda items are \u201cBe united to reach our goals\u201d and \u201cAttend Meetings.\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Aside from Torres, attendees of the formational meeting are described in the record only generically, and prominently among them are \u201cthe lawyers.\u201d App. 541. The record does not say what the lawyers were doing there, but they were evidently not helping Centro to incorporate, since it is unincorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">Everything supports the inference that Centro is a special-purpose litigation vehicle, created to bring this lawsuit. It is unclear whether it has done anything else in the seven years since it filed the complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This pretext does not satisfy Article III, which requires that \u201cthe decision to seek [judicial] review ... be placed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>hands of those who have a direct stake in the outcome,\u201d and not' \u201cin the hands of concerned bystanders, who will use it simply as a vehicle for the vindication of value interests.\u201d <em>Diamond v. Charles, </em>476 U.S. 54, 62, 106 S.Ct. 1697, 90 L.Ed.2d 48 (1986) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Centro cannot suffer actual or threatened injury if it exists only as the vehicle for this litigation, or as the alter-ego of some concerned bystander.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">XI</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The second plaintiff, The Workplace Project, was apparently enlisted as a hedge against the court\u2019s realization that Centro lacks standing. Workplace is a real organization that has existence and function outside this litigation. But it is not based in the Town of Oyster Bay; it is in the' Town of Hempstead, which is (of course) not subject to the challenged Ordinance. It claims nevertheless that .the scope of its mission encompasses all of Long Island, and it asserts standing on three grounds. Of the three, the district court premised standing solely on the idea that the Ordinance might be (erroneously) enforced against Workplace or its agents if its organizing and counseling activities are mistaken for roadside employment solicitation. The district court did not consider the other two other injuries claimed by Workplace as a pretext for standing: that the Ordinance harms its mission to serve day laborers by either dispersing them or reducing their number; and that its effort to fight the Ordinance diverts resources from its other activities. The majority is convinced that each of these thre\u00e9 purported injuries is real and independently sufficient to confer standing. But none of them constitutes \u201can \u2018injury in fact\u2019 \u2014 an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or: imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (internal citation and quotation marks removed). .</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The risk of mistaken enforcement against the organization\u2019s advocates' is a fihe example of a conjectural and hypothetical harm \u2014 I suppose it could materialize, but it has not, and it might never. That is no \u201cactual or imminent\u201d injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The supposed interference with the organizational mission of serving day laborers is conjectural, vague, and generalized. Worse, if it were sufficient, a pop-up organization could gin up standing by alleging a mission to oppose any law it wished to challenge. The majority is persuaded that by dispersing Oyster Bay\u2019s day laborers, the Ordinance will make it harder for Workplace to meet with them; but .this would be an indirect and remote consequence, even assuming that Workplace operates in the Town of Oyster Bay. These arguments fail to establish \u201cthe irreducible constitutional minimum of standing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The argument that the Ordinance injures Workplace by diverting its resources from other activities relies on a line of cases beginning with <em>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, </em>455 U.S. 363, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982), and culminating in <em>Nnebe v. Daus, </em>644 F.3d 147 (2d Cir. 2011). The thrust of those cases (as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>organizational standing) is that even the slight diversion of resources to remedy some harm or to fight some harmful conduct or policy can constitute an injury-in-fact sufficient to confer standing if the injury is perceptible, concrete, and demonstrable. In those cases, however, the organizational plaintiff did not put itself in the way of harm as a pretext to achieve standing; rather, the challenged conduct or policy came unbidden to the organizational plaintiff, and diverted its limited resources. The distinction raises the problem of \u201cmanufactured\u201d standing that is identified by the court in <em>Nnebe. </em>Synthetic standing was not found in that case; but it is present in this one, and the majority therefore distorts rather than applies those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In <em>Havens Realty, </em>the organizational plaintiff provided housing counseling services to homeseekers of limited \u25a0 means, and investigated complaints of discrimination. The\u2019Supreme Court held that if the defendants\u2019 alleged racial-steering practices \u201cperceptibly impaired\u201d the organization\u2019s ability to provide its counseling and referral services, then \u201cthere can be no question that the organization has suffered injury in fact. Such concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization\u2019s activities \u2014 -with the consequent drain on the organization\u2019s resources \u2014 constitutes far more than simply a setback to the organization\u2019s abstract social interests.\u201d 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct. 1114 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In <em>Nnebe, </em>the organizational plaintiff was a taxi-drivers\u2019 union; it had standing to challenge a license-suspension policy of the Taxi and Limousine Commission because it counseled those of its own members who were potentially affected, helped them obtain lawyers, and impressed upon the lawyers the heightened stakes that resulted from the policy. 644 F.3d at 157. We reasoned that the union needed to allocate resources to assist its members once the city initiated proceedings against them, and that need \u2014 which the union did not invite, choose, or provoke \u2014 created an injury sufficient for standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The organizational plaintiffs in those cases had their activities perceptibly impaired by the conduct or policy they challenged, and they diverted at least some of their limited resources to remedy the harm that the conduct or policy imposed. That is, the challenged conduct or policy arrived-at the organization\u2019s door and either created new work for it or burdened the work it was already doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">In this case, the only evidence that the Ordinance touched Workplace in any way is: the testimony of two people who worked for Workplace and who believe that some third employee visited day laborers in Oyster Bay at some time in the past, though they are vague about when and where and for ,what purpose, App. 937-38, 944-51; that some Workplace personnel attended a rally against the Ordinance, <em>id. </em>947-48; and that Workplace \u201chad to put some time into finding out about the ordinance\u201d and tried \u201cto support [Centro]\u201d and \u201cwork on that issue to some degree,\u201d <em>id. </em>956.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">None of that is a cognizable injury to Workplace. The crucial question is whether any of it required curtailing Workplace\u2019s normal work; but as to that, the testimony was \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d <em>Id. </em>957. The Ordinance may represent \u201ca setback to [Workplace]\u2019s abstract social interests,\u201d <em>Havens Realty, </em>455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct. 1114, but mere organizational opposition does not constitute organizational injury. Even if Workplace invokes the \u201cperceptible impairment\u201d standard of <em>Havens Realty </em>and <em>Nnebe, </em>those eases do not relieve plaintiffs of the constitutional requirement of showing injury that is \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and \u201cactual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>imminent.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In sum, the majority opinion premises standing on purported organizational injury that is speculative and generalized, and \u2014 to the extent that it exists \u2014 both elective and negligible. Workplace has not shown that the Ordinance inflicts unbidden injury on it as an organization, and it therefore does not have standing as an organization to bring this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">This case, of course, is not about injury to any organization. To the contrary, the complaint affirmatively alleges that this is \u201ca civil rights action about the ability of predominantly Latino, immigrant day laborers to exercise their right to solicit work on the streets and sidewalks of their towns and villages without fear of being targeted because of their race and national origin,\u201d App. 115. In other circuits, an organization composed of members with standing (such as day laborers in Oyster Bay) can itself have standing in cases under the Civil Rights Act; but the precedent of this Circuit forecloses such representational standing. Since we (and apparently we alone) prevent representational standing, we require that in such cases the organization show injury to itself <em>as </em>an organization. The result has been an erosion over time of what constitutes institutional injury as we try to replicate representational standing by other means. This distortion explains what has happened in this case, in which \u201cperceptible\u201d impairment is treated merely as the opposite of \u201cimperceptible,\u201d and in which we dispense altogether with the constitutional requirement of injury that is both \u201cconcrete\u201d and \u201cdemonstrable,\u201d and either \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cimminent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The rule in this Circuit \u2014 that an organization lacks standing to sue under the Civil Rights Act for violations of the rights of its members \u2014 was adopted over forty years ago in a case that may have outlived its usefulness. In <em>Aguayo v. Richardson, </em>473 F.2d 1090 (2d Cir. 1973), this court reasoned that the statute \u201cconfers a cause of action on \u2018any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof who has been deprived under col- or of state law \u2018of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,\u2019\u201d and that \u201c[njeither this language nor the history\u201d of the statute suggests that organizations can sue in the place of others. <em>Id. </em>at 1099. The court cited <em>Hague v. CIO, </em>307 U.S. 496, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939), in which the Supreme Court dismissed organizational plaintiffs (while affirming a holding in favor of individual plaintiffs) on the ground that the Privileges and Immunities Clause, 307 U.S. at 514, 59 S.Ct. 954, and the liberty guarantee of the Due Process Clause, <em>id. </em>at 527, 59 S.Ct. 954, apply only to \u201cnatural, not artificial, persons.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\"><em>Hague </em>thus suggests that organizations cannot sue on their own behalf (because they lack the rights they would seek to vindicate);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but it says nothing about whether they can stand in the place of their members. And two years after <em>Aguayo, </em>the Supreme Court observed (albeit in dicta) that \u201c[e]ven in the absence of injury to itself, an association may have standing solely as the representative of its members\u201d if its members are harmed. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 511, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Supreme Court later cited <em>Warth </em>when it formulated a three-part test for this \u201crepresentational\u201d or \u201cassociational\u201d standing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APi\">an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise hqve standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><em>Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Did <em>Warth </em>and <em>Hunt </em>abrogate <em>Aguayol Hunt </em>was not a \u00a7 1983 case, though it relied on <em>Warth, </em>which was; and the relevant portion of <em>Warth </em>is dicta. Nevertheless, several of our sister circuits, unburdened by <em>Aguayo, </em>have applied the <em>Hunt </em>test for representational standing in \u00a7 1983 cases. <em>See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Blind of Mo. v. Cross, </em>184 F.3d 973, 981 (8th Cir. 1999); <em>Retired Chi. Police Ass\u2019n v. City of Chicago, </em>7 F.3d 584, 600-07 (7th Cir. 1993); <em>Contractors Ass\u2019n of E. Pa., Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, </em>945 F.2d 1260, 1264-66 (3d Cir. 1991); <em>Md. Highways Contractors Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. State of Maryland, </em>933 F.2d 1246, 1251-53 (4th Cir. 1991); <em>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Coal. for Econ. Equity, </em>950 F.2d 1401, 1405-09 (9th Cir. 1991). The Fifth and Sixth Circuits have expressly held that organizations possess standing to sue under \u00a7 1983 for violations of the rights of their members in such circumstances. <em>See Church of Scientology v. Cazares, </em>638 F.2d 1272, 1276-77 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Memphis Am. Fed\u2019n of Teachers v. Board of Educ., </em>534 F.2d 699 (6th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">This Circuit has adhered to <em>Aguayo </em>without ever expressly considering the impact of <em>Warth </em>or <em>Hunt. See League of Women Voters v. Nassau County Board of Supervisors, </em>737 F.2d 155, 160-61 (2d Cir. 1984) (\u201cThis Circuit has restricted organizational standing under \u00a7 1983 by interpreting the rights it secures to be personal to those purportedly injured.... Necessarily, we adhere to our prior decisions .... \u201d). <em>Nnebe </em>likewise followed <em>Aguayo </em>(this time over the objection that it had been cast into doubt by <em>Warth), </em>observing in a footnote that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad1\">we reaffirmed the <em>Aguayo </em>rule in <em>League of Women Voters </em>nine years after <em>Warth </em>and have not since reconsidered it. Accordingly, we are bound by the <em>implicit determination of </em>prior panels that the rule survives <em>Warth </em>\u2018until such time as [our prior decisions] are overruled either by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlK\">644 F.3d at 156 n.5 (quoting <em>United States v. Wilkerson, </em>361 F.3d 717, 732 (2d Cir. 2004)) (emphasis</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">We continue to rely on that \u201cimplicit determination.\u201d <em>Nnebe </em>posits that we await Second Circuit in banc review to overrule <em>Aguayo </em>(or, presumably, even to consider for the first time explicitly whether its rule is abrogated by <em>Warth </em>and <em>Hunt). </em>But that may be a vain hope given the desuetude of our in banc practice. In the meantime, our indulgence of increasingly tenuous and pretextual claims of injury to organizations themselves now threatens to swallow Article III limitations: the majority opinion holds, in essence, that an organization can achieve standing to challenge a law relevant to its mission by \u201callocating resources\u201d to learn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ing about the law and attending a protest rally.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The plaintiffs preserve by footnote the argument that they have representational standing, noting that <em>\u201cAguayo </em>is contradicted by subsequent Supreme Court authority ... and is inconsistent with the principles underlying \u00a7 1983.\u201d Appellee Br. 51 n.16, They may be right about <em>Aguayo, </em>and a time may come when we rethink organizational standing, or when the Supreme Court does an intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Since on this record no plaintiff has shown standing, I would go no further. The majority does go further, however; and while there is appreciable merit to its analysis, it affirms a remedy considerably broader than that analysis can support.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The consistent focus of the majority opinion is the First Amendment rights of people\u2019 soliciting work while standing at the roadside. The speakers whose rights are at issue are the people who are saying (as the majority puts it), \u201chire me,\u201d Op. Ill, and the restriction on that commercial speech is the premise for all that follows (right up to the examples of a lemonade stand, and the veteran who will work for food), Op. 114-15. This, it seems to me, is sound as far as it goes. Even the \u201cconduct component\u201d of attempting to stop vehicles is essentially expressive since alia pedestrian can do from the, lawful vantage of a sidewalk is signal availability to passing drivers. The persuasive force of this analysis has bearing on subdivision C of the Ordinance, which restricts the conduct of persons adjacent to the roadside. It does not, however, support an injunction against enforcement of the Ordinance as a whole, which in subdivision D regulates traffic, and in particular the conduct of the truck-drivers, who are not engaged in speech.</p>\n<p id=\"A9Q\">\u201c[T]he normal rule [is] that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course,\u201d <em>Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., </em>472 U.S. 491, 504, 105 S.Ct. 2794, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985), and we therefore \u201cshould refrain from invalidating an entire statute when only portions of it are objectionable.\u201d Nat<em>'l Advert. Co. v. Town of Niagara, </em>942 F.2d 145, 148 (2d Cir. 1991). Severance is a question of state, law, and New York follows- the standard described by Justice Cardozo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">The principle, of division is not a principle of form. It is a principle of function. The question is in every case whether the Legislature, if partial invalidity had been foreseen, would have wished the statute to be enforced with the invalid part exscinded, or rejected altogether. The answer must be reached pragmatically, by the exercise of good sense and sound judgment, by considering how the statutory rule will function if the knife is laid- to the branch, instead of at the roots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\"><em>People ex rel. Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Knapp, </em>230 N.Y. 48, 60, 129 N.E. 202 (1920). The Ordinance contains separate commands, separately lettered, and the separate command' of subdivision D can operate independently. It can hardly be doubted that the Town would wish to enforce this traffic rule: as the majority opinion' recognizes, the Town\u2019s asserted interest is substantial, Op. 113, and the Ordinance directly advances that interest, Op. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">\u25a0 According to the Town, the goal of the Ordinance is to fix the traffic and safety problems that arise when trucks stop along a roadway, to pick up day laborers. This problem is addressed directly by subdivision D, which applies to drivers only. And since driving is not speech, subdivision D does not burden speech \u2014 and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>raises no thorny problems (arguably raised by subdivision C) such as the uncertain scope of proscribed conduct or discriminatory enforcement. This is fully consistent with the majority\u2019s analysis; the conclusion that the Ordinance is overbroad would be strengthened by the observation that the Town can advance its important governmental purpose just as well without the offending subsection C.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">True, the parties have not argued or briefed severability, but severance is' unlike ordinary defenses, which are abandoned unless raised; a severance issue arises only when a court finds a statutory infirmity and must craft a remedy, and the issue inheres in the judicial act of ordering a remedy. Sua sponte invocation of this prudential rule may be a case-by-case decision, but when a plaintiff seeks an injunction more broad than necessary to remedy the wrong that is found, it is prudent to tailor the injunction (or revisit it) even if the defendant imprudently made all-or-nothing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Waiver is a prudential doctrine, and its invocation here would conflict with the \u201cgeneral rule [that] a court should refrain from invalidating an entire statute when only portions of it are objectionable.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Advert. Co., </em>942 F.2d at 148. \u201cOur right to destroy is bounded by the limits of necessity. Our duty is to save unless in saving we pervert.\u201d <em>Alpha Portland Cement Co., </em>230 N.Y. at 62-63, 129 N.E. 202. The Supreme Court has instructed that, ordinarily, \u201cpartial, rather than facial, invalidation is the <em>required </em>course.\u201d <em>Brockett, </em>472 U.S. at 504, 105 S.Ct. 2794 (emphasis added). The ap-pellees\u2019 brief in <em>Brockett </em>argued that the appellants should be precluded from raising severability because they failed to raise it below <em>(Brockett, </em>Appellees Br. at 44 (1984 WL 565782)); yet <em>Brockett </em>did not consider waiver, and held that \u201cseverability is no obstacl\u00e9 to partial invalidation, which is the course the Court of Appeals <em>should have pursued.\u201d </em>472 U.S. at 507, 105 S.Ct. 2794 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">If some plaintiff had standing, and if the majority were correct at every other point in its opinion, the proper remedy would be severance and an injunction limited to subdivision C of the Ordinance. Of course, the overbreadth of the injunction here is no drafting error. The transparent purpose of seeking an injunction to protect the expressive rights of day laborers is to enable the open-air traffic in day labor; and the complaint seeks to vindicate the Equal Protection and Due Process rights of those day laborers against what the plaintiffs allege is the discriminatory motive of the Town. The enjoining of subsection C\u2014 which is the appropriate remedy for the First Amendment infirmity found \u2014 would be an insufficient means to those broader ends. However, the district court did not rule bn the Equal Protection or Due Process claims, and the majority now affirms an injunction suited to claims that were never reached.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">. It is unclear whether the board formally declined to sue the Town or if Torres voluntarily withdrew the proposal after encountering opposition.
