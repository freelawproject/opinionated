IKUTA, Circuit Judges,</author>\n<p id=\"AF-\">concurring in the denial of rehearing:</p>\n<p id=\"acw-dedup-0\">After careful consideration of this case, including a close review of the decision of the Arizona Supreme Court, <em>State v. Clabourne, </em>194 Ariz. 379, 983 P.2d 748 (1999) (en banc), we entered a unanimous opinion that concluded that the Arizona. court \u201cgave Clabourne\u2019s mental illness some nonstatutory mitigating weight but ultimately held that the mitigating circumstances were insufficient to warrant lenienr cy.\u201d <em>Clabourne v. Ryan, </em>745 F.3d 362, 369-70 (9th Cir. 2014). After explaining the basis for our determination that the Arizona Supreme Court had given mitigating weight to Clabourne\u2019s mental deficiencies, we concluded, at 373;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akk-dedup-0\">We cannot construe the court to have violated <em>Eddings [v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982) ] by giving Clabourne\u2019s mental health is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>sues \u201cno weight by excluding such evidence from their consideration.\u201d <em>Eddings, </em>[at 115]. The Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s decision under review was not contrary to federal law, because it considered Clabourne\u2019s mental health condition as mitigating evidence. <em>Eddings </em>requires no more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Although there have been developments in our court\u2019s precedents since we filed our opinion, none alter our assessment of what the Arizona Supreme Court did in resolving Clabourne\u2019s appeal. We do not doubt the sincerity of Judge Berzon\u2019s current view, but we conclude that our previous analysis of that court\u2019s action, which she joined, remains correct.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b778-5\">BERZON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"apy-dedup-0\">dissenting from the denial of rehearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">I dissent from the denial of rehearing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">We held the rehearing petition in this case for <em>McKinney v. Ryan, </em>813 F.3d 798 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 39, 196 L.Ed.2d 197 (2016), an en banc opinion of this court issued after our panel opinion, and then ordered supplemental briefing about the impact of <em>McKinney. See </em>Order to File Supplemental Briefs, <em>Clabourne v. Ryan, </em>745 F.3d 362, 371 (9th Cir. 2014) (No. 09-99022). Ignoring both that briefing and <em>McKinney </em>itself,' the panel majority now refuses to rehear the case. I am convinced that we are obligated to do so and, in light of <em>McKinney, </em>to grant the petition for habeas corpus with regard to the penalty phase. <em>See, e.g., Hedlund v. Ryan, </em>815 F.3d 1233, 1236 (9th Cir. 2016), <em>amended and superseded on denial of rehearing en banc, </em>854 F.3d 557 (9th Cir. 2017) (withdrawing original panel opinion and reconsidering a petitioner\u2019s claim in light of the intervening decision in <em>McKinney).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">In <em>McKinney, </em>an en banc panel of this court stated unequivocally that, from the late 1980s to 2002, the \u201cSupreme Court of Arizona articulated and applied a \u2018causal nexus\u2019 test for nonstatutory mitigation that forbade as a matter of law giving weight to mitigating evidence, such as family background or mental condition, unless the background or mental condition was causally connected to the crime.\u201d 813 F.3d at 802. That causal nexus test, we held, violated <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 114, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), which bars a sentencing court in a capital case from refusing as a matter of law to consider any relevant mitigating evidence. <em>McKinney, </em>813 F.3d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\"><em>McKinney </em>emphasized repeatedly the consistency with which the Arizona Supreme Court articulated and applied the unconstitutional causal nexus rule during the relevant period. <em>Id. </em>at 824 (\u201c[T]he Arizona Supreme Court, during a period of just over fifteen years, consistently insisted upon and applied its causal nexus test to nonstatutory mitigation. In no case during this period did the court give any indication that the causal nexus test was not the law in Arizona, or any indication that it had the slightest doubt about the constitutionality of the test.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 803, 815, 826. It was in 1999 that the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed Clab-ourne\u2019s death sentence, which, like the timing of the decision in <em>McKinney, </em>was \u201croughly in the middle of the fifteen-year-plus period during which it insisted on its unconstitutional nexus test for nonstatuto-ry mitigation.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">Of course, <em>McKinney </em>does not dispose of Clabourne\u2019s petition for rehearing outright. But <em>McKinney\u2019s, </em>holding that the Arizona Supreme Court consistently applied an unconstitutional rule at the time it reviewed Clabourne\u2019s sentence provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the baseline from which we must review the decision in <em>State v. Clabourne, </em>194 Ariz. 379, 983 P.2d 748 (1999) (en banc) <em>(\u201cAz Claboume\u201d), </em>and interpret any ambiguity therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Critically, <em>McKinney </em>also overruled the requirement established in <em>Schad v. Ryan, </em>671 F.3d 708, 724 (9th Cir. 2011), that a federal habeas court may grant a petitioner relief on an <em>Eddings </em>claim only if there is a \u201cclear indication in the record\u201d that a state court refused as a matter of law to consider relevant nonstatutory mitigation evidence. <em>McKinney, </em>813 F.3d at 819. <em>McKinney </em>held instead that a federal ha-beas court examining a claimed <em>Eddings </em>error need give a state court decision only the normal deference required under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>In adhering to Schad\u2019s \u201cclear indication\u201d test, <em>see Clabourne v. Ryan, </em>745 F.3d 362, 371, 373 (9th Cir. 2014), the panel opinion thus depends upon a standard that an en banc panel of this court expressly rejected as \u201can inappropriate and unnecessary gloss on the deference already required under\u201d AED-PA, <em>see McKinney, </em>813 F.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In short, by denying Clabourne\u2019s petition for rehearing and leaving the opinion in this case unamended, the panel majority does not grapple with the significance of the intervening decision in <em>McKinney, </em>with regard either to its holding that the Arizona Supreme Court consistently applied an unconstitutional causal nexus rule during the relevant period or to its rejection of Schad\u2019s heightened standard of review. At a minimum then \u2014 whatever the proper outcome \u2014 the panel opinion\u2019s reasoning as it stands is inconsistent with the current law of this circuit and should be reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">But, the problem is not, in my view, one that can be simply papered over by revisions to the existing panel opinion. Rather, if the reliance on <em>Schad </em>is eliminated, as it must be, and <em>McKinney </em>is properly applied, we must change the outcome of this case by granting the petition for habeas corpus with regard to the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">In light of <em>McKinney\u2019s </em>review of Arizona case law during the period <em>Az Clab-oume </em>was decided, and absent the <em>Schad </em>mandate that we find a \u201cclear indication in the record\u201d that the state court committed <em>Eddings </em>error, I am convinced that <em>Az Claboume </em>applied the unconstitutional causal nexus test identified in <em>McKinney </em>by declining to consider evidence of Clab-ourne\u2019s schizophrenia as a nonstatutory mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">The Arizona Supreme Court initially addressed Clabourne\u2019s mental health conditions in the context of statutory mitigation under Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 13-703(G)(1), impaired capacity. <em>Az Clabourne, </em>194 Ariz. at 385, 983 P.2d 748. Statutory mitigation based on impaired capacity is available in Arizona only when mental illness is a <em>\u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d </em>of the defendant\u2019s conduct <em>and </em>the substantive requirements of (G)(1) are met. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citation omitted). Substantively, \u201c[t]he statute calls for \u2018significant\u2019 impairment of one of two specific abilities: (1) the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of conduct or (2) the capacity to conform conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-703(G)(1) (current version at Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-751(G)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">In considering whether Claboume was entitled to statutory mitigation for impaired capacity, the Arizona Supreme Court first recounted the evidence related to Claboume\u2019s mental health. Two mental health experts believed Claboume suffered from mental illness, probably schizophre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>nia, and another believed he had a personality disorder. <em>Az Clabourne, </em>194 Ariz. at 385, 983 P.2d 748. Nevertheless, these experts agreed \u201cthat there was no evidence of Clabourne\u2019s state of mind at the particular time of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In particular, the experts \u201ccould [not] say whether [Clabourne] was \u2018psychotic,\u2019\u201d and none had \u201cstated or implied a causal relationship between Clabourne\u2019s mental health and the murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cNeither did any nonexpert party, including Clabourne, indicate that Cl\u00e1bourne had lost contact with reality or acted abnormally when he participated in the crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">After emphasizing the requirement that mental illness be a <em>\u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d </em>of the defendant\u2019s conduct for a finding of impaired capacity under the statute, the court held Clabourne\u2019s \u201cstatus of being mentally ill alone [ ] insufficient to support a (G)(1) finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The Arizona Supreme Court then proceeded to consider, still in the context of statutory mitigation, Clabourne\u2019s argument that \u201chis mental illness causes a passivity and paranoia that allowed Langston to control him, and therefore he .was unable to resist Langston\u2019s pressure to rape and kill Webster.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, 983 P.2d 748. The court had earlier in its discussion of impaired capacity noted that \u201c[t]he record does demonstrate that Langston was a manipulative and frightening man who, for the most part, choreographed the crime and urged Clabourne to kill Webster.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 983 P.2d 748. Accordingly, whereas the court rejected Clabourne\u2019s status of being mentally ill because there was no causal link, the court rejected Clabourne\u2019s passive personality and paranoia as a basis for mitigation under subsection (G)(1) because Clabourne had not satisfied the statute\u2019s <em>substantive </em>standard. That is, Clabourne . had not, demonstrated \u201cthat his capacity to conform his conduct to the .requirements of the law was significantly impaired\u201d because he had shown neither that \u201che was passive or paranoid to any degree of impairment [n]or that he had actually.lost any control over his conduct when he committed the murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, 983, P.2d 748; <em>see </em>Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-703(G)(1) (current version at Ariz. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 13.751(G)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">When the Arizona Supreme Court turned to Clabourne\u2019s mental health in the context of <em>nonstatutory </em>mitigating circumstances, it addressed only the specific fact that \u201cClabourne has a passive personality and that he is impulsive and easily manipulated by others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 983 P.2d 748. As the. court had indicated earlier, there was a plausible causal connection between <em>these </em>personality traits and the crime, given Langston\u2019s manipulative personality and his leadership role in Webster\u2019s murder. <em>See id. </em>at 385, 983 P.2d 748. So, under the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s causal nexus standard, those traits required weighing as to nonstatutory mitigation. The court recognized Olabourne\u2019s passive personality and related characteristics to be \u201crooted to some degree in his mental health problems,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 387, 983 P.2d 748, but, as I have explained, it considered those problems distinct from his schizophrenia diagnosis. It was thus only as to the specific \u201cmental and personality deficiencies\u201d of passive personality, impulsiveness, and \u25a0manipulability \u2014 which <em>did </em>have a connection to the crime \u2014 that the court \u201cafforded] some nonstatutory mitigating weight.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">That the court gave some nonstatutory mitigating weight only to <em>these </em>specific mental and personality deficiencies, and <em>not </em>to his schizophrenia, is further evidenced by the court\u2019s justification (in the very next sentence) for ultimately granting those characteristics little mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>weight. <em>See id. </em>The court highlighted Clab-ourne\u2019s \u201cactive participation throughout the six-hour ordeal and the fact that he personally strangled and stabbed Webster,\u201d holding that those facts \u201crender[ed] negligible any mitigating effect [of] Clab-ourne\u2019s problems and the traits they manifest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Clabourne\u2019s active involvement in a lengthy crime was pertinent to weighing the evidence that Clabourne had a passive, impulsive, and manipulable personality, but that active involvement would have no bearing on what mitigating weight to give a schizophrenia diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">To hold that the Arizona Supreme Court refused to consider Clabourne\u2019s schizophrenia at the nonstatutory mitigation phase thus does not, as the panel opinion suggests, require reaching the \u201cillogical [.] conclusion] that the Arizona Supreme Court considered [Clabourne\u2019s schizophrenia] diagnosis and explicitly referenced it in one portion of its opinion but forgot it when considering nonstatutory mitigation, discussed just a few pages later in the opinion.\u201d <em>Clabourne, </em>745 F.3d at 374. The better inference, in light of <em>McKinney </em>and based on the reasoning and structure of <em>Az Clabourne, </em>is that the Arizona Supreme Court applied its causal nexus test \u2014 which, <em>McKinney </em>held, was its governing standard at the time, consistently applied \u2014 to exclude Clabourne\u2019s schizophrenia from consideration as a nonstatutory mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">This understanding is bolstered by the fact that the Arizona Supreme Court expressly applied the causal nexus standard in the very next subsection of the nonstat-utory mitigation discussion. The court rejected Clabourne\u2019s evidence of his dysfunctional family background because \u201c[w]hatever .the difficulty in Clabourne\u2019s family life, he has failed to link his family background to his murderous conduct or to otherwise show how it affected his behavior.\u201d <em>Az Clabourne, </em>194 Ariz. at 387, 983 P.2d 748 (citing <em>State v. Spears, </em>184 Ariz. 277, 293-94, 908 P.2d 1062 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">The conclusion that the Arizona Supreme Court applied the unconstitutional causal nexus test to preclude consideration of Clabourne\u2019s schizophrenia diagnosis, as a nonstatutory mitigating factor is further supported by the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s citation to its own decision in <em>Az Clab-oume </em>in later cases when applying the causal nexus standard. <em>See, e.g., State v. Carlson, </em>202 Ariz. 570, 586, 48 P.3d 1180 (2002) (en banc); <em>State v. Ca\u00f1ez, </em>202 Ariz. 133, 164, 42 P.3d 564 (2002) (en banc). Those later citations to <em>Az Clabourne </em>for the causal nexus standard are relevant in light of McKinney, To the extent <em>Towery v. Ryan, </em>673 F.3d 933, 946 (9th Cir. 2012), limited our review in habeas cases to the record in the case before us, barring consideration of post-hoc characterizations of a decision by a state court, <em>Towery </em>is inconsistent with <em>McKinney </em>and so does not control. <em>McKinney </em>looked freely beyond the record of the case before it, examining Arizona Supreme Court decisions in numerous other cases to establish that court\u2019s pattern of applying an unconstitutional rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Of course, later Arizona (Supreme Court citations to <em>Az Clabourne </em>for the causal nexus standard are not dis-positive, as a federal habeas court may grant relief only based on an error in the decision adjudicating a petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). But those later' decisions do corroborate what a careful reading of the opinion, in light of <em>McKinney, </em>demonstrates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Again, that <em>Az Claboume </em>applied the unconstitutional nexus test disapproved in <em>McKinney </em>is no wonder. As <em>McKinney </em>held, the Arizona courts applied the unconstitutional nexus test <em>consistently </em>during the period it decided <em>Az Claboume. </em>\u201cA good court [] does not apply an established rule erratically, enforcing it arbitrarily in some cases but not in others. We have great respect for the Supreme Court of Arizona, whose institutional integrity is demonstrated, <em>inter alia, </em>by the consistent application of the causal nexus test during the fifteen-year period it was in effect.\u201d <em>McKinney, </em>813 F.3d at 826. To hold, as does the current panel opinion, that the Arizona Supreme Court for some unexplained reason did not apply its own prior precedents in this case alone is to disregard not only <em>McKinney </em>but the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s own later references to this case as one in which the nexus requirement <em>was </em>applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">In sum, after <em>McKinney, </em>I see no choice but to grant Clabourne\u2019s petition and remand this case for resentencing. There is just no principled way to reconcile the panel opinion\u2019s reasoning and holding with this court\u2019s en banc opinion. I would rehear this case and grant the petition for habeas corpus with regard to the penalty phase. I therefore strongly dissent from the panel\u2019s refusal to do either.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\">. <em>McKinney </em>also held <em>Towery </em>was wrongly decided as to the <em>Eddings </em>issue in that case, further undermining <em>Towery\u2019s </em>persuasive value. <em>See McKinney, </em>813 F.3d at 824.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-12\">. Similarly, the prosecutor\u2019s arguments at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Clabourne\u2019s resentencing hearing regarding a causal nexus confirm that Arizona law required such a nexus at the time Claboume was resentenced, as <em>McKinney </em>held.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
