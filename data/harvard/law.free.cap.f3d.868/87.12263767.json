NYS-DEC denied the application on the ground that Constitution had not provided sufficient information. In its petition, Constitution contends principally (1) that NYSDEC exceeded the \u00a7 401(a) time limitations for the State\u2019s review of the application and that NYSDEC must therefore be ordered to notify the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cUSACE\u201d or \u201cArmy Corps of Engineers\u201d or \u201cArmy Corps\u201d) that the State has waived its right to act upon Constitution\u2019s \u00a7 401 certification application, thereby allowing USACE to issue a permit to petitioner under \u00a7 404 of the Clean Water Act, <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(a); and (2) alternatively, that Constitution submitted sufficient information and that NYSDEC\u2019s decision should be vacated on the ground that its denial of the application was arbitrary, capricious, and ultra vires, and that NYSDEC should be ordered to grant the requested \u00a7 401 certification. To the extent that Constitution challenges the timeliness of the NYSDEC decision, we dismiss the petitiop for lack of jurisdiction. As to the merits, we conclude that NYSDEC\u2019s actions were within its statutory authority and that its decision was not arbitrary or capricious, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AdP\">Constitution proposes to construct a 121-mile interstate natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania and New York, approximately 98 miles of which would be in New York. In connection with this project (the \u201cProject\u201d), Constitution applied for, to the extent pertinent here, a \u201ccertificate of public convenience and necessity\u201d from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(c), a CWA \u00a7 401 water quality certification (or \u201cWQC\u201d) from New York State that the Project would comply with State water quality standards <em>(see </em>6 N.Y.C.R.R. parts 701 to 704), and a CWA \u00a7 404 permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to allow discharges into United States navigable waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">A. <em>Proceedings Before FERC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">In September 2012, FERC announced that it would prepare an environmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) for Constitution\u2019s Project and asked Constitution to submit a feasibility study explaining how it would install the pipeline across waterbod-ies (generally using that term to refer to streams but not wetlands). For such installations, there is a trenched method \u2014 a dry open-cut crossing \u2014 which involves diverting a stream, digging a trench through the banks and stream bed, installing and burying the pipeline, and then allowing the stream to resume flowing in the stream bed. <em>(See, e.g., </em>FERC Final Environmental Impact Statement (\u201cFEIS\u201d) pages 2-21 to 2-22.) There are also trenchless crossing methods \u2014 including Horizontal Directional Drill (or \u201cHDD\u201d), Direct Pipe (or \u201cDP\u201d), and conventional bore \u2014 which involve digging pits on either side of a waterbody and boring or drilling underneath the stream. FERC asked Constitution to provide information with regard to trenchless construction methods for crossing several categories of streams, including those classified by the states as sensitive or high quality and those greater than 30 feet wide where a dry construction method would not be feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">1. <em>Constitution\u2019s Trenchless Feasibility Study</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Constitution submitted to FERC a study discussing trenchless crossing methods. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>(See </em>Constitution, Feasibility Study: Trenchless Construction Methods for Sensitive Environmental Resource Crossings (Nov. 2013) (\u201cConstitution 2013 Feasibility Study\u201d or \u201cStudy\u201d) pages 1-3 to 1-5.) Trenchless methods do not disturb soil or organisms in the stream banks, stream bed, or in the stream itself, but require disturbing surrounding areas to clear space for installation pits; there are also risks of mid-project drill breakage, with leakage of .drill fluid into the waterbody. <em>(See </em>Constitution 2013 Feasibility Study page 2-3; FEIS page 2-24.) Use of the trenched method does not require' as much installation space or present the risk of drill failure; but it requires stream diversion and digging into the stream bed and banks. <em>(See, e.g., </em>FEIS pages 2-21 to 2-22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The Constitution feasibility study dealt principally with locations where the water-body was designated by New York or Pennsylvania as sensitive or high quality. <em>(See </em>Constitution 2013 Feasibility Study pages 2-2 to 2-3.) As a result, Constitution eliminated from consideration for trench-less crossings all but 89 of the 251 New York waterbodies that would be crossed by the pipeline or affected by pipeline construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The remaining 89 locations were addressed in three phases. The Study\u2019s \u201cPhase I[] Desktop Analysis\u201d <em>(id. </em>pt. 1.0 page 1-1) further reduced the number of New, York waterbodies considered by Constitution for trenchless crossings from 89 to 26, in part by eliminating streams less than 30 feet wide, even if they were classified by New York as sensitive or high-quality <em>(see id. </em>pages 2-1, 2-3). Constitution stated that trenchless crossings for such narrower waterbodies would potentially require workspace requirements significantly greater than those generally needed for a conventional dry crossing method. <em>(See id. </em>page 2-3.) Thus, unless such a waterbody was immediately associated with a larger wetland and/or waterway complex crossed by the Project or was located in the immediate vicinity of a proposed rail or roadway crossing, \u201cConstitution did not evaluate waterbody crossings less than 30 feet in width\u201d, (id.).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Phase II was a \u201cCost/Time/Construction Workspace Impact Analysis.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>page 3-1; <em>see also id. </em>pt. 1.0 page 1-1 (\u201cTrenchless construction methods are limited\u201d not only by such matters as \u201cunderlying geology, available workspace, [and] available time,\u201d but also by \u201cavailable finances budgeted for a capital project.\u201d).) This phase eliminated waterways from trenchless-crossing consideration largely on the basis of expense; as a result, there remained only 13 waterbody crossings in New York for which Constitution planned to investigate a \u201cformal trenchless constructioh design.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>pages 3-2 to 3-4 &amp; tbl.3.2-1.) The Study stated that Phase III, a \u201cgeotechnical field analysis\u201d of each of the 13 locations, was' in progress. <em>(Id. </em>page 5-1.) Constitution thus planned to use the trenched method for 238 of the 251 New York wa-terbodies to be crossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">2. <em>NYSDEC Comments and the FEIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">In connection with FERC\u2019s announcement of a planned EIS for the Constitution pipeline \u2014 and its subsequent draft EJIS (\u201cDEIS\u201d) \u2014 NYSDEC submitted numerous letters to FERC. The first noted that NYSDEC\u2019s preferred method for crossing waterbodies is a trenchless method, in particular</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) because it has the advantages of <em>minimizing land disturbance, avoiding the need for dewatering of the stream, leaving the immediate stream bed and banks intact, and reducing erosion, sedimentation and Project-induced watercourse instabilities.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>(November 7, 2012 Letter from NYSDEC to FERC at 3 (emphasis added).) Stating that the DEIS should identify the New York classification of each stream the proposed pipeline would cross, NYSDEC urged FERC to \u201cevaluate cases where other methods are proposed\u201d and have Constitution <em>\u201cexplain why HDD will not work or is not practical for that specific crossing.\u201d (Id. </em>(emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">A May 2013 letter again stated that \u201cNYSDEC\u2019s preferred methodology for <em>all stream crossings </em>is ... (HDD)\u201d; that letter also stated that \u201c[wjithin stream crossings, pipelines should be buried at least 6\u2019 below a stream bottom. Minimum cover depth is not subject to variance based on field conditions.\u201d (May 28, 2013 Letter from NYSDEC to FERC (\u201cNYSDEC May 2013 Letter\u201d) at 1-2 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In September 2013, NYSDEC wrote to join a request by the Army Corps for additional analysis of whether the Constitution pipeline could be routed along a certain interstate highway, a route referred to as \u201cAlternative M.\u201d (September 25, 2013 Letter from NYSDEC to FERC at 1.) Constitution responded by arguing that Alternative M would have greater environmental impact than Constitution\u2019s proposed route and noting likely difficulties in obtaining highway agencies\u2019 approvals. <em>(See </em>October 22, 2013 Letter from Constitution to.NYSDEC at 2-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">In 2014, FERC issued its DEIS, which drew criticism from several sources including NYSDEC. <em>(See,,e,g., </em>March ,24, 2014 Letter from NYSDEC to FERC and Army Corps at 1-2 (urging a revised DEIS to include \u201cgeotechnical feasibility studies for <em>all trenchless crossing locations,\u201d </em>as well as \u201csite specific blasting plans that include protocols for in-water blasting and the protection of aquatic resources and habitats\u201d (emphasis added)); April 7, 2014 Letter from NYSDEC to FERC and Army Corps (\u201cNYSDEC April 2014 Letter\u201d) at 1-5 (adding additional comments and requesting additional analysis of Alternative M which, in NYSDEC\u2019s view, would reduce the amount of disturbance of higher-quality waterbodies).)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">FERC issued its FEIS in 2014 without significantly expanding on several aspects of the DEIS. It did not address NYS-DEC\u2019s concern that Constitution had not developed site-specific blasting plans. <em>(See </em>FEIS pages 4-15 to 4-16; DEIS page 4-16.) The FEIS added discussion of two new versions of Alternative M proposed by NYSDEC <em>(see </em>FEIS pages 346 to 3-47), but rejected them without analyzing disturbances to. high-quality waterbodies <em>(compare id. </em>pages 3-32 to 3-47 <em>with </em>NYS-DEC April 2014 Letter at 3-4). And the FEIS stated that the pipeline would be buried 60 inches below streams in normal soil conditions and 24 inches in areas of \u201cconsolidated rock\u201d (FEIS page 2-16), as contrasted with the NYSDEC May 2013 Letter\u2019s statement that the pipe needed to be- buried \u201cat least 6\u2019 below a stream bottom\u201d (NYSDEC May 2013 Letter at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">The FEIS expanded on the DEIS\u2019s wa-terbody crossing information but repeateS DEIS explanations for why relatively few crossings were slated to be crossed by trenchless techniques, stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[according to Constitution, trench-less crossing methods are not practical [except in limited circumstances] for wa-terbody crossings less than 30 feet in width\u201d and that \u201cConstitution indicated that such crossings would be impractical due to minimum length requirements, depth of pipeline considerations, and workspace requirements,\u201d ,and describing the areas that would be required for trenchless crossing \u201c [according to Constitution\u201d (FEIS page 4-50). The FEIS stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>[t]he potential impacts on waterbodies associated with the use .of conventional bore or Direct Pipe trenchless crossing methods are considered minimal when compared to other crossing methods. </em>The waterbody and its banks, and typically the entire immediate riparian zone, would not be disturbed by clearing or trenching; rather, the pipe would be installed below the feature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><em>{Id. </em>page 4-56 (emphasis added).) FERC added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\"><em>We concur with Constitution\u2019s assessment that it is not practicable to use trenchless crossing methods </em>where wa-terbodies were listed as ephemeral or intermittent (because these waterbodies are likely to be dry at the time of crossing) or <em>for waterbodies less than 30 feet in width (as extra workspaces needed would offset potential </em>benefits)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARi\">(FEIS, App\u2019x S, page S-52 (emphases added).) The FEIS noted that Constitution had completed geotechnical feasibility studies at only two New York sites. <em>(See </em>FEIS page 4-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">B. <em>Proceedings Before NYSDEC</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEr\">While its application to FERC for a certificate of public convenience and necessity was pending, Constitution submitted an application to the Army Corps for a CWA \u00a7 404 permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material while constructing the pipeline and to NYSDEC for a CWA \u00a7 401 certification that the Project would comply with State water quality standards. In December 2014, NYSDEC issued a notice that Constitution\u2019s application was complete; but on December 31, it asked Constitution for more information about stream crossings. In January-March 2015, Constitution submitted more information to NYSDEC, and on April 27, 2015, at NYSDEC\u2019s request, Constitution withdrew and resubmitted its \u00a7 401 application. (Constitution had also withdrawn and resubmitted its \u00a7 401 application at NYS-DEC\u2019s request in May 2014.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">1. <em>Stream-Crossing Information Requests by NYSDEC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">On January 23, 2015, staff from Constitution and NYSDEC met to discuss trenchless stream-crossing methods <em>(see </em>January 14, 2015 email from NYSDEC Project Manager Stephen M. Tomasik to Constitution engineering consultant Keith Silliman; January 27, 2015 email from To-masik to Constitution Environmental Project Manager Lynda Schubring (\u201cNYS-DEC January 27, 2015 email\u201d)). Prior to that meeting, Constitution wrote to NYS-DEC stating that it had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">conducted subsurface geotechnical investigations at the majority of the proposed ... (HDD) and ... (DP) trenchless locations. Results of the subsurface geo-technical investigations revealed crossing locations that present a high risk of failure if a trenchless method is used. As a result, trenchless crossing locations with a high risk of failure are not feasible and have been modified to a dry open cut design. Since the last ... submissions to the USACE, three (3) HDD or DP locations affecting six (6) wetlands or waterbodies have changed to an open cut construction method....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">(January 22, 2015 Letter from Schubring to Tomasik at 1.) Constitution also stated that six other originally proposed trench-less crossings would be crossed by a trenched method, \u201cto address various concerns raised by [state and local] authorities relative to the trenchless crossings of specific public roadways and associated infrastructure.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at 2.) After the January 23 meeting, NYSDEC requested additional documents that Constitution personnel had said informed its decision to use the trenched crossing method at two locations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>as well as \u201cinformation about stream crossings that we requested on 12/31/2014.\u201d (NYSDEC January 27, 2015 email).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">In response, Constitution submitted feasibility evaluations based on geotechnical studies for four locations: two wetlands crossings and two waterbody crossings. One of the waterbody feasibility evaluations concluded that using either HDD or DP was infeasible due to subsurface soil conditions; the other did not address the feasibility of trenchless crossing methods, and instead discussed only a contingency open-cut crossing to be used if the proposed DP crossing failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In February 2015, Constitution submitted to NYSDEC a document titled \u201cDraft Trenchless Feasibility Study Edits\u201d (\u201cConstitution 2015 Feasibility Draft\u201d) that appears to be a version of part of the 2013 trenchless feasibility study that Constitution had submitted to FERC, merely expanding on the manner in which each trenchless method operates. Again there was no discussion of stream crossings site-by-site. The Constitution 2015 Feasibility Draft stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">Constitution recognizes that, <em>in general, </em>performing ... (HDD) for streams less than 30 feet in width causes greater net environmental impacts than a dry open cut method and this threshold is an <em>industry recognized standard. </em>Constitution has not identified any NYSDEC regulation, formally adopted policy or guidance document that would warrant-deviating from this standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\"><em>(Id. </em>at 1 (emphases added).) It also discussed the Direct Pipe method, stating that \u201cit is <em>likely </em>that additional forest will require clearing to perform DP for <em>most </em>of the protected stream crossings,\u201d and that <em>\u201c[m]any\u201d </em>streams are in valleys whose slopes make the DP method infeasible. <em>(Id. </em>at 2-3 (emphases added).) In addition, the Constitution 2015 Feasibility Draft stated that DP technology is of \u201climited availability,\u201d leading Constitution to conclude that using \u201cDP technology for ... streams less than 30 feet in width is <em>not a realistic or viable expectation within a reasonable period of time.\u201d (Id. </em>at 3 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">In March 2015, NYSDEC sent Constitution a list of 20 waterbody locations that NYSDEC \u201cwants crossed via HDD,\u201d stating that NYSDEC \u201cis <em>still expecting an evaluation as to whether an HDD is technically feasible for each of these streams.\u201d </em>(March 17, 2015 email from NYSDEC Major Project Management Unit Chief Christopher M. Hogan to Silliman (emphasis added).) In April 2015, as indicated above, Constitution withdrew and resubmitted its \u00a7 401 WQC request.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">2. <em>Subsequent Discussions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">In May 2015, NYSDEC noted that it had agreed to \u201celiminate\u201d four streams from \u201cfurther consideration for trenchless crossing methods.\u201d (May 22, 2015 email from Tomasik to Schubring, Silliman, et al.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">In July 2015, a member of NYSDEC\u2019s staff emailed to certain Army Corps staff members a \u201cConfidential\u201d message attaching a \u201cVERY PRELIMINARY version of a Constitution permit\u201d (July 20, 2015 email from Tomasik to Kevin J. Bruce et al., Army Corps), which included a table of 19 locations that \u201cshall be crossed using a trenchless construction method\u201d \u2014 unless an \u201cexperienced and qualified engineer\u201d concludes that the techniques are \u201cnot con-structible or not feasible\u201d (Confidential Draft NYSDEC Certification Conditions at 17). The draft, however, required Constitution, <em>\u201c[p]rior to beginning construction of any trenchless stream crossing,\u201d </em>to <em>\u201csubmit </em>a[ ] ... \u2018Trenchless Crossing <em>Plan\u2019 for each </em>trenchless stream crossing,\u201d including \u201cdetailed engineering plans\u201d for each location. <em>(Id. </em>at 18 (emphases added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>In September 2015, Constitution submitted to NYSDEC an Environmental Construction Plan, attached to which was a Blasting Plan. <em>(See </em>Constitution, Environmental Construction Plan 50 (Aug. 2015).) This plan listed 253 \u201c[a]reas of shallow depth to bedrock crossed by the [pipeline]\u201d in New York, but stated that \u201c[a] final determination on the need for blasting will be made at the time of construction.\u201d (Constitution, Blasting Plan (Aug, 2015) (\u201cBlasting Plan\u201d) pages 1-1,1-2 <em>&amp; </em>tbl.1.2-2, 4-1.)

Because the Department\u2019s review concludes that Constitution did not provide sufficient detailed information including site specific project plans regarding stream crossings <em>(e.g. </em>geo-technical borings) the Department has determined to deny Constitution\u2019s WQC Application for failure to provide reasonable assurance that each stream crossing will be conducted in compliance with 6 NYCRR \u00a7 608.9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">NYSDEC Decision at 12; <em>see </em>6 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 608.9(a)(2) (\u201cThe applicant\u201d for a CWA \u00a7 401 certification \u201cmust demonstrate compliance with sections 301-303, 306 and 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as implemented by ... water quality standards and thermal discharge criteria set forth in Parts 701, 702, 703 and 704 of this Title....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">II.

For the reasons that follow, we (1) conclude that Constitution\u2019s first contention, which would have us treat NYSDEC\u2019s Decision as an act that is void, lies beyond the jurisdiction of this Court, and (2) conclude that NYSDEC\u2019s Decision was n\u00f3t ultra vires, arbitrary, or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>A. <em>Constitution\u2019s Argument that NYS-DEC Waived Its \u00a7 \u215b01 Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The Natural Gas Act (or \u201cNGA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717-717z, sets out provisions with respect to, <em>inter alia, </em>the construction of transportation facilities for natural gas, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 717f. Such projects are also subject to restrictions under other federal statutes, including provisions of the Clean Water Act, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>\u00a7 717b(d)(3). Section 401 of the CWA requires an applicant for a federal permit to conduct any activity that \u201cmay result in any discharge into the navigable waters\u201d of the United States to obtain \u201ca certification from the State in which the discharge ... will originate ... that any such discharge will comply with,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>the state\u2019s water quality standards. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">As to petitions for review relating to such applications, \u00a7 717r of the NGA divides jurisdiction between the Circuit in which the facility is proposed to be constructed and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">(1) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">The United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which a facility subject to ... section 717f of this title is proposed to be constructed ... <em>shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for the reriew of an order or action of a </em>Federal agency (other than [FERC]) or <em>State administrative agency acting pursuant to Federal law to </em>issue, condition, or <em>deny any </em>permit, license, concurrence, or <em>approval </em>(hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cpermit\u201d) <em>required under Federal law....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">(2) Agency delay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\"><em>The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for the revieiv of an alleged failure to act by a </em>Federal agency (other than [FERC]) or <em>State administrative agency acting pursuant to Federal law to issue, condition, or deny any permit required under Federal </em>law....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717r(d)(l)-(2) (emphases added). We regard subsection (2) \u2014 titled \u201cAgency delay\u201d \u2014 as encompassing not only \u201can alleged failure to act\u201d but also an allegation that a failure to act within a mandated time period should be treated as a failure to act. This is the nature of Constitution\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">Constitution points out that CWA \u00a7 401 provides that \u201c[i]f \u2019 a \u201cState ... agency\u201d from which an applicant for a federal permit has sought a water quality certification \u201cfails or refuses to act .on [the] request for certification, within a reasonable period of time (which shall not exceed one year) after receipt of such request, the certification requirements of this subsection shall be waived with respect to such Federal application.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1). Constitution argues that NYSDEC did not issue its Decision until 32 months after Constitution submitted its initial application, 16 months after NYS-DEC issued notice that that initial application was complete, 15 months after the deadline imposed by FERC, <em>nearly </em>a year (\u201c359 days\u201d) after Constitution\u2019s 2015 withdrawal-and-resubmission of its application \u2014 and eight months after Constitution claims it was advised by NYSDEC that NYSDEC \u201chad everything it needed to issue a Section 401 Certification.\u201d (Constitution brief in support of Petition at 28-29.) Constitution argues that NYSDEC \u201cwaived its right\u201d to rule on the certification application and must be required to so notify the Army Corps. <em>(Id. </em>at 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">We note first that there is nothing in the administrative record to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>NYSDEC received the information it had consistently and explicitly requested over the 'course of several years \u2014 much less anything to support \u2018Constitution\u2019s claim that NYSDEC said \u201cit had\u201d all of the information it required \u201cto issue\u201d the requested certification <em>(id. </em>at 29). Although Constitution proffered in this Court non-record declarations from certain of its personnel,- those \u201coutside-the-record declarations and associated portions of [Constitution's brief\u2019 were stricken. <em>Constitution Pipeline Co. v. Seggos, </em>No. 16-1568 (2d Cir. Oct. 3, 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Second, Constitution\u2019s \u201cwaive[r]\u201d argument is that the NYSDEC Decision must be treated as a nullity by reason of NYS-DEC\u2019s <em>\u201cfailing to ad </em>within the prescribed time period under the CWA\u201d (Constitution brief in support of Petition at 37 (emphasis added)). Such a failure-to-act claim is one over which the District of Columbia Circuit would have \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(2). <em>See generally Weaver\u2019s Cove Energy, LLC v. Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, </em>524 F.3d 1330, 1332 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Accordingly, we \" dismiss Constitution\u2019s timeliness argument for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">B. <em>Constitution\u2019s Challenge to the Merits of NYSDEC\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s denial of a CWA \u00a7 401 certificate is limited to grounds set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706. We review the agency\u2019s interpretation of federal law <em>de novo; </em>if the agency correctly interpreted federal law, we review its factual determinations under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>Islander East Pipeline Co. v.

(Constitution brief in support of Petition at 37, 39.) We disagree that NYSDEC\u2019s action was preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Although NEPA requires federal-agency review of virtually. any possible environmental effect that a proposed action may have, <em>see generally </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.16, it does not 'impose substantive standards. <em>See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, </em>490 U.S. 332, 350, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989). \u201c[TJhrough a set of action-forcing procedures,\u201d NEPA \u201crequire[s] that' agencies take a hard look at environmental consequences,\u201d but it is \u201cwell settled'that NEPA itself does not mandate particular results[; it] simply prescribes the necessary process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, NEPA states, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]othing'in section 4332 or 4333 of this title shall in any way affect the specific statutory obligations of any Federal agency ... to act, or refrain from acting contingent upon the recommendations or certification of any ... State agency.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4334.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">We note also that while the Natural Gas Act generally preempts state laws, it states that \u201c[e]xc\u00e9pt as specifically provided[,] ... nothing\u201d in the NGA \u201caffects the rights of States under ... the [CWA] (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 et seq.),\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717b(d). CWA \u00a7 511, in turn, preserves the states\u2019 authority to determine issues of a planned project\u2019s effect on water quality. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1371(c)(2)(A). CWA \u00a7 401(a)(1) requires that an entity such as Constitution, proposing to construct an interstate pipeline, obtain from each state in which the pipeline is to be constructed a certification that \u201cany ... discharge\u201d from a proposed activity \u201cwill comply with the applicable provisions of [33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 ] 1311, 1312, 1313, 1316, and 1317.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1). Sections 1311, 1312, 1316, and 1317 establish, and allow the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to establish, standards governing numerous aspects of water quality; and \u00a7 1313 allows states to develop their own water quality standards and submit them to the EPA for approval. If the EPA approves a state\u2019s water quality standards, it publishes a notice of approval and they become the state\u2019s EPA-approved standards, regulating water quality in that state. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1313(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The New York State water quality standards, approved by the EPA, <em>see generally </em>42 Fed. Reg. 56,786, 56,790 (Oct. 28, 1977), are found in 6 N.Y.C.R.R. parts 701 to 704, and were invoked by the NYSDEC Decision, which stated that \u201c[d]enial of a WQC may occur when an application fails to contain sufficient information to determine whether the application demonstrates compliance with the above stated State water quality standards and other applicable State statutes and regulations due to insufficient information.\u201d NYSDEC Decision at 7; <em>see also id. </em>at 12 nn,10-11 and accompanying text (quoted in Part I.C. above). The State standards classify waterbodies in terms of, <em>inter alia, </em>potability and their suitability for various activities such as swimming and fishing, <em>see </em>6 N.Y.C.R.R. pt. 701; they set standards for characteristics such as water odor, color, and turbidity, <em>see id. </em>pt. 703; and they regulate thermal discharges into waterbodies, <em>see id. </em>pt. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Thus, the relevant federal statutes entitled NYSDEC to conduct its own review of the Constitution Project\u2019s likely effects on New York waterbodies and whether those effects would comply with the State\u2019s water quality standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">CWA \u00a7 401(a)(1), as pertinent here, states that \u201c[n]o license or permit shall be granted if [a \u00a7 401] certification has been denied by the State,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1). Thus, we have indeed referred to \u00a7 401 as \u201ca statutory scheme whereby a single state agency <em>effectively vetoes </em>an energy pipeline that has <em>secured approval from a host of other federal and state agencies.\u201d Islander East II, </em>525 F.3d at 164 (emphases added); <em>accord Keating v. FERC, </em>927 F.2d 616, 622 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (\u201cThrough [the \u00a7 401 certification] requirement, <em>Congress intended that the states would retain the power to block, for environmental reasons, local water projects that might otherwise win federal approval.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Constitution also argues that NYSDEC\u2019s demands for information with regard to, <em>e.g., </em>possible alternative routes for the planned pipeline <em>(see, e.g., </em>NYS-DEC Decision at 3 (NYSDEC \u201casked Constitution to analyze alternative routes that could have avoided or minimized impacts to an extensive group of water resources\u201d)), as well as Constitution\u2019s planned blasting sites and the depth at which the pipe would be buried, exceeded NYSDEC\u2019s authority (Constitution brief in support of Petition at 38). We need not address all of these contentions. A state\u2019s consideration of a possible alternative route that would result in less substantial impact on its waterbodies is plainly within the state\u2019s authority, <em>See, e.g., Islander East II, </em>525 F.3d at 151-52. And where an agency decision is sufficiently supported by even as little as a single cognizable rationale, that rationale, \u201cby itself, war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>rants our denial of [a] petition\u201d for review under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">2. <em>Application of the Arbitrary-and-Capricious Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard, \u201c[a] reviewing court may <em>not </em>itself weigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Islander East II, </em>525 F.3d at 150. \u201cRather,\u201d we \u201cconsider! ] whether the agency \u2018relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150-51 (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass\u2019n of the United States, Inc. v.

If there is \u201csufficient evidence in the record to provide rational support for the choice made by the agency,\u201d we must uphold its decision. <em>Id. </em>at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Usually, the agency\u2019s choice concerns whether the applicant\u2019s submission of the relevant information warrants the granting of the application. In the present case, as summarized in Part I.C. above, NYSDEC denied Constitution\u2019s application because Constitution refused to provide information that NYSDEC had repeatedly requested with regard to, <em>inter alia, </em>issues such as those just discussed in Part II.B.1. above, and issues as to the feasibility, site-by-site, of trenchless methods for most of the 251 stream crossings planned in New York. Constitution does not contend that those requests were not made. Indeed, in its own brief in this Court, Constitution acknowledges that the NYSDEC Decision (the \u201cDenial\u201d) explained that NYSDEC had requested but had not received sufficient information with regard to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">\u2666 construction methods and site-specific project plans for stream crossings (Denial at 8-11 ...);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">\u2666 alternative routes <em>(Id. </em>at 11 ...);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-11\">\u2666 pipeline burial depth in stream beds <em>(Id. </em>at 12-13 ...);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">\u2666 procedures and safety measures Constitution would follow in the event that blasting is required <em>(Id. </em>at 13 ...);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">\u2666 Constitution\u2019s plans to avoid, minimize, or mitigate discharges to navigable waters and wetlands <em>(Id. </em>at 13-14 ...); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">\u2666 cumulative impacts <em>(Id. </em>at 3, 5, 7, 14 ...).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">(Constitution <em>brief in </em>support of Petition at 21-22.) Nowhere does Constitution claim to have provided the above categories of information; rather, it insists that it provided NYSDEC with \u201csufficient\u201d information <em>(id. </em>at 52-62) because use of trenchless crossing methods for streams less than 30 feet wide is not \u201can industry recognized standard\u201d (Constitution 2015 Feasibility Draft at 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-17\">However, in order to show that an agency\u2019s decision \u2014 or its request for additional information as to alternative methods \u2014 is arbitrary and capricious, \u201cit is not enough that the regulated industry has eschewed a given [technology].\u201d <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Farm, </em>463 U.S. at 49, 103 S.Ct. 2856. Industry preferences do not circumscribe environmental relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">In <em>Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, </em>490 U.S. 360, 109 S.Ct. 1851, 104 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989), the Supreme Court considered whether a federal agency, presented with new evidence, should have been required to file a new supplemental environmental impact statement; the Court stated that the matter of whether additional information is \u201csignificant\u201d is \u201ca classic example of a factual dispute the resolution of which implicates substantial agency expertise,\u201d as to which the courts \u201cmust defer to the informed discretion of the responsible ... agencies,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 376-77, 109 S.Ct. 1851 (internal quotation marks omitted). We cannot conclude that any less deference is due an agency\u2019s determination that it should not grant a permit application where it has already determined that additional information is needed, and the applicant refuses to supply it. <em>Cf. University of Iowa Hospitals &amp; Clinics v. Shalala, </em>180 F.3d 943, 955 (8th Cir. 1999) (where agency regulations required substantiation of costs for which reimbursement was sought, denial of reimbursement based on inadequate documentation was not arbitrary and capricious); <em>Mendoza v. Secretary, DHS, </em>851 F.3d 1348, 1356 (11th Cir. 2017) (denial of visa application where applicants declined to answer relevant questions relating to eligibility was not arbitrary and capricious; the applicants \u201cwere free to refuse to answer [the agency\u2019s] questions ... but they did so at their own peril\u201d). Indeed, an agency\u2019s decision may be found \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d for <em>\u201cissuing </em>a permit with insufficient information.\u201d <em>Utahns For Better Transportation v. United States Department of Transportation, </em>305 F.3d 1152, 1192 (10th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Here, the record amply shows, <em>inter alia, </em>that Constitution persistently refused to provide information as to possible alternative routes for its proposed pipeline or site-by-site information as to the feasibility of trenchless crossing methods for streams less than 30 feet <em>wide </em>\u2014 ie., for the vast majority of the 251 New York waterbodies to be crossed by its pipeline\u2014 and that it provided geotechnical data for only two of the waterbodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In sum, NYSDEC is responsible for evaluating the environmental impacts of a proposed pipeline on New York waterbod-ies in light of the State\u2019s water quality standards. Applying the arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review, we defer to NYSDEC\u2019s expertise as to the significance of the information requested from Constitution, given the record evidence supporting the relevance of that information to NYSDEC\u2019s certification determination. We conclude that the denial of the \u00a7 401 certification after Constitution refused to provide relevant information, despite repeated NYSDEC requests, was not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">We have considered all of Constitution\u2019s arguments and have found in them no basis for granting the petition for review. Insofar as the petition contends that the NYSDEC Decision is a nullity on the ground that it was untimely, the petition is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction; to the extent that the petition challenges the NYSDEC Decision on the merits, the petition is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"AyG\"> 6 NYCRR \u00a7 703.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b122-5\"> 6 NYCRR \u00a7 701.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
