United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016). For the following reasons, the motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-20\">Under \u00a7 2255, a person in custody under sentence of a federal court may move to vacate his sentence on the ground; <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe sentence was imposed in violation <em>Of </em>the Constitution or laws of the United States,\u2019\u201d- 28 U.S.C: \u00a7 2255(a); a \u201csecond or successive [such] motion\u201d on a ground not previously presented is allowed only if the appropriate court of appeals certifies that the motion is based on either</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-21\">(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2244(a), 2244(b)(3). <em>See generally Corrao v. United States, </em>152 F.3d 188, 191 (2d Cir. 1998) (after a \u00a7 2255 motion has been decided on the merits, a subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion raising a challenge to the same judgment or sentence that was challenged in the prior motion is \u201c\u2018second or successive\u2019\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In 2014, Washington moved under \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence on the ground that the district court had erred in ruling that he was a career offender within the meaning of Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1, a motion that was denied on the merits. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>Civil No. 3:14CV114, 2014 WL 2566068, at *5 (D. Conn. May 23, 2014). Washington seeks permission to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, noting in his petition that he does not rely on newly discovered evidence but contending that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Mathis </em>established a new rule that makes the court\u2019s 2011 sentencing determination unconstitutional. His view of <em>Mathis </em>is without merit, as its holding was not based on the Constitution and was based on a rule applied for decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In <em>Mathis, </em>the Court dealt with the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (\u201cACCA\u201d), which, like the advisory Guidelines career-offenders provision that was applied to Washington, calls for enhanced punishment when a defendant has previously been convicted of certain types and numbers of offenses, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). In such cases, proper determination of whether the defendant\u2019s prior convictions are of the type that constitute proper predicates for enhancement either requires a \u201ccategorical\u201d approach, in which the sentencing court compares the category of enhancing offenses with the statutory elements of the prior offenses, or \u2014 -with respect to statutes having multiple alternative elements \u2014 requires a \u201c \u2018modified categorical approach,\u2019 \u201d in which the \u201csentencing court looks to a limited class of documents (for example, the indictment, jury instructions, or plea agreement and colloquy) to determine what crime, with what elements, a defendant was convicted of.\u201d <em>Mathis, </em>136 S.Ct. at 2248-49 (quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), and citing <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)). The <em>Mathis </em>Court confronted the question of whether the lower courts\u2019 use of the modified categorical approach was appropriate when the defendant had previously been convicted not under a statute that had multiple, alternative elements but rather under one that \u201clist[ed] multiple, alternative means of satisfying one (or more) of its elements.\u201d 136 S.Ct. at 2248.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The Supreme Court concluded that its \u201cprecedents\u201d made the answer \u201cstraightforward\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzR\">For more than 25 years, we have repeatedly made clear that application of ACCA involves, and involves only, comparing elements.... [T]hat rule does not change when a statute happens to list possible alternative means of commission ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-11\"><em>Mathis </em>136 S.Ct. at 2257; <em>see id. </em>(\u201cthe elements-based approach remains the law\u201d). \u201cUnder ACCA, <em>Taylor </em>stated,\u201d because \u201cit is impermissible for \u2018a particular crime [to] sometimes count towards enhancement and sometimes not, depending on the facts of the case,\u2019 \u201d the \u201csentencing judge may look only to \u2018the elements of the [offense], not to the facts of [the] defendant\u2019s conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mathis, </em>136 S.Ct. at 2251 (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 601, 110 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>2143); <em>see also Mathis, </em>136 S.Ct. at 2252 (citing, as examples of its consistent application of this principle, <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 19, 125 S.Ct. 1254; <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 214, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), <em>overruled on other grounds by Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2563, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015); <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 1, 7, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), <em>overruled on other grounds by Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2563, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015); <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S. 254, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2283, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In sum, the <em>Mathis </em>Court was interpreting ACCA, not the Constitution. <em>Accord Dawkins v. United States, </em>829 F.3d 549, 551 (7th Cir. 2016) <em>(\u201cMathis </em>... is a case of statutory interpretation.\u201d). And although the <em>Mathis </em>Court noted that its ACCA interpretation had been based in part on constitutional concerns, <em>see </em>136 S.Ct. at 2252-53, those concerns did not reflect a new rule, for <em>\u201cTaylor </em>set out the essential rule governing ACCA cases more than a quarter century ago,\u201d <em>Mathis, </em>136 S.Ct. at 2251.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Washington\u2019s motion for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
