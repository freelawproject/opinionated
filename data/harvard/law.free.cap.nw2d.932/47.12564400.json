Respondent/appellant Casey Daniel Bauer challenges the convictions, arguing that the district court erred in (1) failing to instruct the jury on the statutory definition of \"great bodily harm\" and (2) entering a judgment of conviction for third-degree assault. Appellant/respondent State of Minnesota challenges the sentence imposed for second-degree assault, arguing that the district court abused its discretion when it granted a downward dispositional departure. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   J.F. was in his garage opening the rear door of his car when he heard footsteps behind him. As he turned to look, he realized that he was being struck by something. He was hit twice on the side of his head and then on the side of an ear. J.F. turned around and saw a person wearing a mask.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The person in the mask tripped over a bicycle and fell on top of J.F., who had fallen to the floor on his back. The two struggled, and J.F. was able to get the mask off the person, whom J.F. recognized as respondent/appellant Casey Daniel Bauer. Bauer threatened J.F. and, among other things, said, \"You're going to die.\" J.F. feared that Bauer would harm him, and he struggled to get out from under Bauer. J.F. had a folding knife clipped to his right side pocket. He opened the knife, pushed upward with it, and struck Bauer four or five times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The struggle continued until a neighbor peeked into the garage, and J.F. said to her, \"Help me. He's trying to kill me.\" The neighbor saw J.F. lying on the floor and a person standing over him. She left and went as fast as she could to her apartment to call for help. When she got to her apartment, she heard a noise behind her. She turned and saw J.F. She helped him get into her apartment, called 911, and tended to his injuries. She described J.F. as \"unsteady,\" with blood \"kind of running\n   in different areas down his face\" and with \"swelling in a couple of areas on his head.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.F. was taken to a hospital emergency room, and the doctor who examined him testified that J.F. was talking fast, but he was coherent, and his injuries were not life threatening. The doctor did not find any bruising and did not see any signs of fractures of J.F.'s arms or legs. There were two cuts on the top of J.F.'s head. J.F. told the doctor that he was assaulted with a baseball bat\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that he was hit with the bat in the head, neck, chest, and abdomen. The doctor testified that J.F.'s statement was consistent with the injuries that he observed. The doctor explained that \"a blunt object like a bat with enough force could cause what we call a 'burst laceration.' That's where the-when the skin and tissues are impacted hard enough they will literally just split apart like, you know, as a laceration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Bauer was charged with second-degree assault (dangerous weapon-substantial bodily harm), in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.222\">\n    Minn.

Stat. \u00a7 609.713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, Bauer claimed that he went to J.F.'s home to talk to him, and J.F. initiated the physical altercation by stabbing him twice \"before [Bauer] could even do anything.\" Bauer argued to the jury that he hit J.F. purely in self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before giving the case to the jury, the district court heard requests from both parties about what the jury instructions should include. Neither the state nor Bauer argued that the jury should be instructed on the statutory definition of \"great bodily harm,\" and the jury instructions did not define \"great bodily harm.\" The jury found Bauer guilty on both assault counts and not guilty on the threats-of-violence count. The district court entered convictions for both assault counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court initially denied Bauer's request to be released pending sentencing. However, after Bauer made a second request, the district court granted him a 72-hour furlough from jail because Bauer's mother had late-stage terminal cancer. Bauer was released on April 3, 2018, and was required to return on April 6, 2018, but he failed to return as required, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Police arrested Bauer on April 12, 2018. Bauer explained that he did not return to jail as required because his mother died on April 5, and her funeral was scheduled for April 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At sentencing, all parties recognized that third-degree assault (substantial bodily harm) is a lesser-included offense of second-degree assault (dangerous weapon-substantial bodily harm). However, the transcript indicates that the parties believed that it was appropriate for Bauer to be convicted of both counts, as long as he was sentenced for only the more serious count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The presumptive sentence for Bauer's second-degree-assault conviction was 27 months, executed, with a sentence ranging between 23 and 32 months. Bauer moved for a downward dispositional departure, asking that he receive probation instead of an executed sentence, so that he could attend the Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge Program, a 13- to 15-month program\n   that would help Bauer address his mental-health and chemical-dependency issues. Over the state's objection, the district court granted Bauer's motion on the condition that Bauer successfully complete the long-term Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge Program. The district court found that Bauer was particularly amenable to probation because he was willing to spend a significant period of time in treatment to address significant chemical-dependency and mental-health issues. The district court imposed a stayed 32-month sentence and placed Bauer on probation for seven years. In addition to requiring Bauer to complete treatment, the district court imposed various other restrictions. These cross-appeals follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Bauer concedes that he did not object to the jury instructions at trial. \"A defendant generally forfeits the right to contest jury instructions on appeal when the defendant fails to object at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Stat. \u00a7 609.222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 2 (emphasis added). Consistent with this statute, the district court instructed the jury that \"under Minnesota law whoever assaults another with a dangerous weapon and inflicts substantial bodily harm is guilty of a crime.\" Thus, to find Bauer guilty of second-degree assault, the jury needed to determine whether the bat he used during the assault was a dangerous weapon and whether the injuries he inflicted constituted substantial bodily harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Dangerous weapon\" and \"substantial\n   bodily harm\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   are terms defined by statutes.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Dangerous weapon\" means any firearm, whether loaded or unloaded, or\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   device designed as a weapon and capable of producing death or great bodily harm, any combustible or flammable liquid or\n   <em>\n    other device or instrumentality that, in the manner it is used\n   </em>\n   or intended to be used,\n   <em>\n    is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm\n   </em>\n   , or any fire that is used to produce death or great bodily harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.02\">\n    Minn.

The language of CRIMJIG 13.10 originally duplicated the language of the statute. However, the definition was challenged for being unconstitutionally vague.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Court of Appeals expressed concern that the statute's use of the term \"likely\" could be interpreted to improperly dilute the State's burden of proof. CRIMJIG 13.10 was amended, and its language changed to clarify the State's burden of proof. The Court noted with approval the model penal code definition of \"deadly weapon,\" and the Committee has therefore modified the definition of dangerous weapon to conform to these holdings of the Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, in order to conclude that the bat was a dangerous weapon without speculating over the meaning of the elements of second-degree\n   assault, the jurors would need to know the statutory definition of great bodily harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under the statute, \" '[G]reat bodily harm' means bodily injury which creates a high probability of death, or which causes serious permanent disfigurement, or which causes a permanent or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ or other serious bodily harm.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.02\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 8 (2014). The jury instructions did not include the statutory definition of great bodily harm. Instead, the district court instructed the jury that if the court had not defined a word or phrase, the jury \"should apply the common, ordinary meaning of that word or phrase.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The common, ordinary meaning of great is \"[l]arger in size than others of the same kind\" or \"[r]emarkable or outstanding in magnitude, degree, or extent.\"\n   <em>\n    The American Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   792 (3d ed. 1992). Under this meaning, \"great bodily harm\" would be harm that is worse than other bodily harm in degree or extent. But, unlike the statutory definition of \"great bodily harm,\" which emphasizes permanent or protracted injury or impairment, this common meaning does not identify a degree or extent of harm at which bodily harm becomes great bodily harm. Thus, the common, ordinary meaning of \"great bodily harm\" differs from the meaning of the statutory definition, and the jury instructions did not explain the elements of second-degree assault. The failure to instruct on the statutory meaning was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (b) The error was plain\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"An error is plain if it is clear or obvious, which is typically established if the error contravenes case law, a rule, or a standard of conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But, we must consider this possibility in light of the evidence about the manner in which the bat was used. Bauer used the bat to hit J.F. in the head at least three times, and the doctor who treated J.F. testified that the bat hit J.F. with sufficient force to cause the skin and tissue to split apart. Given this evidence, which is sufficient to show that the bat was used in a manner that was capable of killing J.F., there is not a reasonable likelihood that failing to instruct the jury about the definition of great bodily harm had a significant effect on the jury's verdict. We, therefore, conclude that, although the failure to instruct was a plain error, the error did not affect Bauer's substantial rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

In its on-the-record consideration of Bauer's departure motion, the district court heavily relied on the fact that Bauer took the initiative to get assessed and conditionally accepted by the long-term Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge Program, which the discussion on the record shows is a 13- to 15-month program that helps individuals address mental-health and chemical-dependency issues and build life skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because the sentencing guidelines explicitly recognize that a permissible reason for a downward departure is that an offender \"is particularly amenable to probation,\" the state's argument is essentially that the district court abused its discretion when it determined that Bauer's initiative in getting assessed and conditionally accepted by a relevant treatment program made him particularly amenable to probation. The state cites no authority that supports its argument that these facts are insufficient to allow a district court to determine that a defendant is particularly amenable to probation. Accordingly, this argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The state next argues that the district court's reasoning was insufficient because the district court failed to adequately consider the circumstances for and against departing. But the record shows that the district court did consider circumstances for and against departing. When the state argued that Bauer's failure to return to jail as required shows that Bauer is not amenable to probation, the district court responded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   But in fairness to Mr. Bauer, his mother was dying of cancer. And if you could think of a situation that would mitigate your failure to return to jail, if you tried to think of the best circumstances, I suspect that's one of the best things you could come up with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Yes, [Bauer] didn't obey my order, and part of me says, \"Well, yeah, I should hold that against [Bauer].\" But it's difficult under those circumstances to hold that against [Bauer].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   There is no requirement that the district court must expressly consider all\n   <em>\n    Trog\n   </em>\n   factors in determining that \"substantial and compelling circumstances\" exist, or that a defendant is \"particularly amenable to probation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 2011). Therefore this argument also fails. Because the district\n   court's decision to depart was within its discretion, there is no need for this court to independently analyze the\n   <em>\n    Trog\n   </em>\n   factors, and we affirm the district court's order granting appellant's motion for a downward dispositional departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.
