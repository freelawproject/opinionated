His application also claimed newly discovered evidence showed the affidavit supporting the issuance of a search warrant for his residence contained false and intentionally misleading statements, and the BCI lacked jurisdiction to investigate him.

The court correctly noted Kovalevich was aware of the receipts and had complete access to the receipts before trial. Kovalevich could have raised this issue at trial or at the very latest, in his April 2017 application for post-conviction relief when he made a similar claim relating to the July 2012 Canad Inn receipt. Furthermore, we agree with the court that the hotel receipts, which Kovalevich argues would impeach the victim's testimony, would not likely result in an acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b620] Kovalevich claims newly discovered evidence exists showing that a BCI agent's affidavit supporting the issuance of a search warrant for Kovalevich's residence contained statements which were known to the agent to be false and misleading. Kovalevich states that after trial, he received Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) reports containing information about him that differed from the information included in the affidavit in support of a search warrant. Kovalevich argues the BCI agent had knowledge of the information in the reports and because of that, the agent provided knowingly false information in his affidavit supporting the issuance of a search warrant for Kovalevich's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b621] The district court concluded Kovalevich could not prove the weight and quality of the alleged newly discovered evidence would result in an acquittal.

First, he claims the affidavit states Kovalevich lived in Cando in 2010, but the BIA reports, which contain his known address history, do not show a Cando address in 2010. Second, he contends the affidavit states Kovalevich was found in the shower with a\n   minor at a casino, but the BIA reports state only that he looked like he had just gotten out of the shower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b623] After reviewing the BIA reports and the affidavit in support of the search warrant, we conclude the alleged newly discovered evidence is not material to the issues at trial, and the weight and quality of the evidence would not likely result in an acquittal. There is no evidence the agent knowingly provided false information in his affidavit. The affidavit discusses the agent's November 2012 interview with the victim where she stated she began a dating relationship with Kovalevich in 2010 when she went to his apartment in Cando. That the address information in the BIA reports differed from the affidavit does not establish the agent knowingly provided false information. The agent simply stated what the victim told him in the interview. Additionally, the information in the affidavit about Kovalevich being in the shower with a minor is included in the BIA reports. We conclude Kovalevich's argument on this issue is without merit, and the district court did not err in dismissing this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b624] Kovalevich argues newly discovered evidence exists showing the BCI lacked jurisdiction to investigate him.
