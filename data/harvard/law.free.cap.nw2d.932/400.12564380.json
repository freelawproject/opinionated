Esenberg. The report recommends that we accept Attorney Thomas D. Vaitys' petition for consensual license revocation, order him to pay restitution, and revoke his license to practice law in Wisconsin. Attorney Vaitys is the subject of an Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR) disciplinary complaint alleging that he committed 19 counts of professional misconduct in several client matters. He is also the subject of two pending grievances that have not yet been fully investigated by the OLR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 We agree that both revocation and restitution are appropriate, and we agree that Attorney Vaitys shall pay the costs of this proceeding, which are $4,703.85 as of July 10, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Attorney Vaitys was admitted to the practice of law in Wisconsin in 2004. He currently resides in Sonora, California. He has not previously been subject to professional discipline. His law license has been suspended, however, for failure to pay State Bar dues, failure to provide a required trust account certification, and for failure to comply with CLE reporting requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 On June 28, 2017, the OLR filed a disciplinary complaint charging Attorney Vaitys with 19 counts of professional misconduct. Referee Esenberg was appointed on July 24, 2017. On September 18, 2018, Attorney Vaitys filed a petition for consensual license revocation pursuant to Supreme Court Rule (SCR) 22.19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 Attorney Vaitys states that he cannot successfully defend himself against the professional misconduct alleged in the complaint or the pending investigations, and states he will make appropriate restitution. On September 18, 2018, the OLR filed a recommendation, supporting Attorney Vaitys' petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 The referee issued a report on January 8, 2019, recommending revocation and restitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   No appeal has been filed in this matter, so our review proceeds pursuant to SCR 22.17(2). We revoke Attorney Vaitys' Wisconsin law license effective the date of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b67 The first 12 counts of the OLR's disciplinary complaint arise from Attorney Vaitys' representation of T.A. T.A. is an individual with a \"wide range of cognitive and comprehension difficulties, including difficulty reading and/or understanding written information.\" In February 2012, T.A. hired Attorney Vaitys and Attorney Thomas Napierala, a lawyer with another firm, to set aside a mediation agreement and settlement that T.A. had entered in a Milwaukee County Circuit Court case involving\n   the estate of T.J.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If they succeeded in setting aside the settlement, the two lawyers would then commence litigation to establish that T.A. was entitled to inherit the T.J. estate. If not, they intended to appeal and, perhaps, seek review in this court. The legal work was to be paid from settlement funds that T.A. had received from the T.J. estate (the Probate Award). Work commenced in February of 2012, but no written fee agreement was signed until November 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b68 The fee agreement limited what the lawyers could charge for appellate work. It established a $25,000 \"Appellate Fund\" trust account. Fees and costs related to this appellate work were only to be paid from the Appellate Fund, not from the remainder of the Probate Award. The balance of the Probate Award was to be held in Attorney Vaitys' IOLTA trust account. It was agreed there would be an accounting of any other work previously performed for T.A. Other than the anticipated appeals, the fee agreement covered no other matters or any subsequent work on the T.J. estate matter. With respect to non-appellate work, the fee agreement provided that one-third of all fees would be paid to Attorney Vaitys, and two-thirds would be paid to Attorney Napierala. Work performed by Attorney Napierala was to be billed to and the charges approved by Attorney Vaitys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b69 On November 26, 2012, Attorney Vaitys received a check for $161,269.23 representing the settlement funds from the T.J. estate. Attorney Vaitys deposited the funds in his general IOLTA trust account. He then transferred $25,000 to the Appellate Fund trust account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b610 Thereafter, Attorney Vaitys failed to keep proper records of disbursements, commingled funds, improperly withdrew funds from both the Probate Award in his general IOLTA trust account and from the Appellate Fund trust account, misrepresented account balances, converted funds, improperly billed, made then-prohibited internet banking transactions, failed to make a proper accounting, and failed to file a timely reply brief. Essentially, Attorney Vaitys improperly took a substantial portion of T.A.'s funds and kept T.A. in the dark about the balance of funds held by Attorney Vaitys and the charges against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b611 Based on the foregoing, the OLR alleged that Attorney Vaitys' handling of the T.A. matter violated a number of the rules of professional conduct, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Count One\n   </strong>\n   : By failing, prior to November 12, 2012, to communicate in writing to T.A. the scope of the representation and the rate and basis of Attorney Vaitys' fees and expenses, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:1.5(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Two:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to clearly and accurately communicate with T.A. about the specific amounts Attorney Vaitys disbursed from T.A.'s funds, the total amount of fees Attorney Vaitys believed were due and owing, and the total amount of T.A.'s funds remaining in the trust accounts, so as to provide T.A. with an accurate understanding of Attorney Vaitys' handling of his funds and the total amount of such funds in Attorney Vaitys' possession, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:1.4(a)(3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and SCR 20:1.4(a)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Three:\n   </strong>\n   By converting T.A.'s funds to his own use or benefit, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Four:\n   </strong>\n   By charging T.A. $275 per hour for services that were not reasonably billable to T.A., Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:1.5(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Five\n   </strong>\n   : By using T.A.'s funds to pay obligations to other clients or third parties, thereby failing to safeguard and hold those funds in trust, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:1.15(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Six:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that Attorney Napierala's billing statements were accurate before paying the same from T.A.'s funds, thereby failing to safeguard and hold those funds in trust, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:1.15(b)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Seven:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to provide T.A. with accurate, written accountings upon request, Attorney Vaitys violated former SCR 20:1.15(d)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Eight:\n   </strong>\n   By making multiple internet banking transactions related to either T.A.'s appellate trust account or his IOLTA trust account, at a time when such transactions were prohibited, Attorney Vaitys violated former SCR 20:1.15(e)(4)c.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Nine:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to timely file T.A.'s reply brief or to timely file for an extension of time in which to file the reply brief, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:1.3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Ten:\n   </strong>\n   By holding himself out as trustee of T.A.'s special needs trust, when no such trust existed and Attorney Vaitys was not trustee of any trust related to T.A., Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Eleven:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to cooperate in the OLR's investigation of the grievance, including making misrepresentations to the OLR during the investigation and by willfully failing to fully and fairly disclose all facts and circumstances pertaining to his alleged misconduct after having been notified by the OLR of the matter, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 22.03(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and SCR 22.03(6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Twelve:\n   </strong>\n   By making misrepresentations to the OLR during the OLR's initial evaluation of these grievances, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b612 The remaining seven allegations in the complaint relate to misconduct that the OLR identified in the course of investigating the T.A. grievance. These include accounting anomalies affecting other clients, and misrepresentations that Attorney Vaitys made to the OLR in an effort to hide his misconduct. The OLR audited Attorney Vaitys' banking records during the period he represented T.A. and identified at least seven occasions between February 6, 2013 and February 12, 2014 when Attorney Vaitys made other internet banking transfers from the Appellate Fund trust account or general IOLTA trust account to his business account. These transactions were prohibited at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b613 During the investigation, Attorney Vaitys represented to the OLR that billing statements were supported by contemporaneously created ledgers that he claimed to have gone over with T.A. on a monthly\n   basis. Attorney Vaitys later admitted that these statements and ledgers were fabricated to conceal his misuse of T.A.'s funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b614 Attorney Vaitys also misrepresented the terms of the fee agreement, falsely stating that it provided for up to $43,000 in fees and costs for appellate work, and falsely claiming that he obtained T.A.'s authorization for every disbursement when he had not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b615 In addition, during the investigation, Attorney Vaitys procured an affidavit from Attorney Napierala stating that certain funds were not converted because he and Attorney Vaitys had an agreement by which Attorney Vaitys was authorized to offset these amounts against amounts owed to him by Attorney Napierala. However, Attorney Napierala later told the OLR that while there was such an agreement, it did not exist between November 2012 and May 2014 when the funds at issue were converted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b616 As noted, T.A. was not the only client affected by Attorney Vaitys' misconduct. The OLR found irregularities in legal matters related to former clients A.H., C.S.M., Y.E., and M.B. On numerous occasions, Attorney Vaitys received funds in which clients or a third party had an interest and failed to notify them; failed to promptly deliver to clients or third parties the funds to which they were entitled; or improperly transferred funds from his trust account into his business account, recorded the transaction as something else, and then never disbursed the funds to the owner. He also deposited funds belonging to clients and third parties into his business account rather than his IOLTA trust account or failed to hold client funds in his trust accounts. For example, in regards to A.H., Attorney Vaitys deposited client funds to his business account to avoid overdrafts of his business account, thereby converting A.H.'s funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b617 The C.S.M. matter involved efforts to collect on a $1,417,204.38 judgment involving the receipt of multiple garnishment checks, of which 66.7 percent would belong to C.S.M., 16.65 percent would belong to Attorney Napierala, and 16.65 percent to Attorney Vaitys. Attorney Vaitys repeatedly failed to promptly deliver received funds to C.S.M. and Attorney Napierala. Sometimes, he deposited the money in his business account and used all of the money for other purposes and never paid it to the rightful owner. On other occasions, he deposited funds belonging to C.S.M. and Attorney Napierala in his trust account but did not keep it there, transferring it to his business account or reserve line. The referee observed that amounts were not large-generally in the low to mid-hundred dollar range-but the occasions were frequent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b618 These allegations gave rise to seven additional counts of misconduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Thirteen:\n   </strong>\n   By converting client and third party funds to his own use or for the use of other clients or third parties, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Fourteen:\n   </strong>\n   By depositing client and third party funds into his Business Account, thereby failing to safeguard and hold client and third party funds in trust, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:1.15(b)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Fifteen:\n   </strong>\n   By depositing personal funds into his IOLTA trust account, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:1.15(b)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Sixteen:\n   </strong>\n   By causing Attorney Napierala to sign an affidavit containing false information, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Seventeen:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to provide clients and third parties with written notice of his receipt of funds in which they have an interest and by failing to promptly deliver to clients and third parties the funds that they were entitled to receive, Attorney Vaitys violated former SCR 20:1.15(d)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Eighteen:\n   </strong>\n   By making multiple internet banking transactions related to the IOLTA trust account at a time when such transactions were prohibited, Attorney Vaitys violated former SCR 20:1.15(e)(4)c.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Nineteen:\n   </strong>\n   By making misrepresentations to the OLR during the course of its investigation of OLR Matter No. 2016MA1162, including by presenting an affidavit to the OLR that contained a false assertion, Attorney Vaitys violated SCR 22.03(2) and SCR 22.03(6), both enforceable under the Rules of Professional Conduct via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b619 In addition to the allegations in the OLR complaint, when Attorney Vaitys filed his petition, the OLR was investigating two additional grievances filed by clients W.A. and M.B. The W.A. grievance involved neglect of a client matter. The OLR seeks restitution in this matter. The M.B. grievance also involved allegations of carelessness and neglect, but the OLR did not seek restitution for M.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b620 When reviewing a report and recommendation in an attorney disciplinary proceeding, we affirm a referee's findings of fact unless they are found to be clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Inglimo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8375091\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/305/71/\">\n    2007 WI 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8375091\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/305/71/\">\n    305 Wis. 2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8375091\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/305/71/\">\n    740 N.W.2d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The OLR supports Attorney Vaitys' petition. The referee determined,\n   based on Attorney Vaitys' petition and the OLR's response, by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence, that Attorney Vaitys has engaged in serious misconduct, and he recommends that we accept the petition, order restitution, and revoke Attorney Vaitys' license to practice law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b622 The referee observes that what is disturbing about this matter is not simply the exceedingly careless trust accounting, but the \"way in which Attorney Vaitys seemed to regard a vulnerable client as a 'cash cow'-someone whose settlement funds could be used for legal fees without regard to whether the legal services were worth it.\" The referee cites several cases in support of his conclusion that revocation is appropriate here, despite Attorney Vaitys' lack of prior professional discipline.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Mularski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001483\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/329/273/\">\n    2010 WI 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001483\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/329/273/\">\n    329 Wis. 2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001483\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/329/273/\">\n    787 N.W.2d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b623 Conversion of client funds may warrant revocation even where, as here, the attorney does not have a prior history of discipline.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Wynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322639\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/353/132/\">\n    2014 WI 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322639\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/353/132/\">\n    353 Wis. 2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322639\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/353/132/\">\n    845 N.W.2d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting petition for consensual license revocation filed by an attorney who admitted he used his law practice to misappropriate over three-quarters of a million dollars from dozens of clients);\n   <em>\n    Mularski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001483\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/329/273/\">\n    329 Wis. 2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001483\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/329/273/\">\n    787 N.W.2d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b624 Like Attorney Vaitys, Attorney Mularski had not been subject to prior discipline, but he used client money for his own purposes, commingled funds, made misrepresentations, fabricated documents in an effort to exonerate himself, and his trust account was in utter disarray.
