Morales argues a motion hearing, evidentiary hearing, and parts of his trial were closed to the public without the pre-closure analysis required by\n   <em>\n    Waller v. Georgia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/#p48\">\n    467 U.S. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/#p48\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/#p48\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), thus violating his right to a public trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. We reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62] During an argument with his ex-girlfriend, Morales stabbed her in the neck. Morales was initially charged with Criminal Attempt - Murder. After the victim died from her injuries, the district court dismissed the Criminal Attempt charge on the State's motion. The State then charged Morales with Murder. On appeal Morales argues his public trial right was violated by the district court's closures of a motion hearing on March 27, 2018; an evidentiary hearing on April 16, 2018; and parts of the jury trial on May 17-24, 2018. He also argues he was denied his right to represent himself at trial and the State's decision to dismiss the initial charge and file new charges a week later was made in bad faith in an effort to have a new judge assigned to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63] These court proceedings attracted significant public interest and media attention. Because of news media coverage, the trial judge expressed concern about tainting the jury and impairing Morales's right to a fair and impartial trial. In an attempt to mitigate the risk of tainting potential jurors, the court issued an expansive order on March 15, 2018, advising that \"all participants, including potential witnesse[s], are to refrain from making or authorizing extrajudicial comments to the media and the public\" encompassing all \"out-of-court comments\" and subject to \"sanctions against the offending individual, including contempt of court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b64] Morales argues the district court improperly closed the courtroom on eight separate occasions during the trial or pretrial hearings. Seven of the closures were initiated by the court, and one was requested by Morales. Before several of the closures, the court failed to conduct any of the analysis required by\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   . For some, the court discussed the\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   factors after the courtroom had already been closed. Before three of the closures, the court acknowledged the\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   factors but failed to articulate findings on all of the factors. In each of the eight closures, the public was excluded without the court giving consideration to whether the public could remain while the jury was excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b65] The district court closed two pretrial hearings to the public. The first, a March 27, 2018, hearing on Morales's pro se motion for new counsel, was closed by a written order issued prior to the hearing. The closure notice provided no explanation. The amended notice of hearing simply stated \"this hearing will be\n   <em>\n    CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC\n   </em>\n   \" with \"Per Judge\" as the only explanation. No findings supporting the closure were made at the hearing. Neither party objected to the closure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b66] The second closure was of an April 16, 2018, pretrial evidentiary hearing relating to admissibility of evidence under N.D.R.Ev. 404(b). At the close of the March 27 motion hearing, the district court stated its intent to close this hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I will have a new order clarifying on the pretrial being the first part of the April 16th and then we will clear the press out and we will go and deal with the 404(b). That will be a closed hearing for obvious reasons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Just before the court excluded the public from the courtroom, the State objected to the closure and reminded the court of the\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   requirements. Morales's trial counsel then expressed concern that Morales's right to a fair trial with an impartial jury would be diminished if the media reported on any inadmissible evidence that would be discussed in open court. The State suggested that by making this argument, Morales was waiving his right to a public trial. The State asked the court to make specific findings and adequately tailor the closure, reasserting that the State did not join in the requested closure. When asked whether Morales concurred with the requested closure, his attorney responded: \"Mr. Morales and I are apparently taking a different position, Judge. Mr. Morales will not waive his right to appeal on this issue should an appeal become necessary.\" Faced with objections from both the State and the defendant, the court then reflected on the level of media coverage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   There [have] been reports, I don't know if all the excessive details that have been reported are going to be admissible or not. And I don't want a jury to be needlessly tainted because somebody perceives that's the public's absolute right to know. The public does have a right to know, and that. It's just a question of balancing the matters of how soon they have a right to know if we are going to be able to have a justice system that works. Both sides are entitled to a fair and impartial jury, and that's what I want us to have here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After stating that \"I will follow this up with an additional written order,\" the court closed the courtroom without further pre-closure discussion of alternatives to closing the courtroom or whether the closure might be more narrowly tailored to protect the interest in an untainted jury pool without unnecessarily burdening the public trial right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] The first trial closure occurred just before the jury was given preliminary instructions. The bailiff gave the trial judge a note from a juror who wanted to alert the court he had family working at the hospital where the victim was treated. The district court closed the proceedings, stating: \"So if you are part of the public or the media I do ask that you leave temporarily. And just shut down your recording equipment.\" After closing the courtroom, the court found \"no alternatives to closing the courtroom\" and characterized the closure as \"what we would normally call a conference at the bench.\" The court then called in the juror who had written the note and questioned him in the presence of Morales and the State about an incident in which people unrelated to the trial had initiated conversation with the juror about the case. The court was satisfied that the juror had\n   complied with the court's admonishment against talking to people about the case, and excused the juror back to the jury room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b68] The second closure occurred on the first day of trial after the jury had been escorted out for a lunch recess. After a brief discussion with counsel about whether and in what form certain video clips would be played, the court closed the courtroom to the public. After the closure, the court reviewed graphic video clips of the crime scene for analysis under N.D.R.Ev. 403. There was no objection to the closure by Morales or the State, and the court made no findings under\n   <em>\n    Waller.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b69] At the beginning of the second day of the trial, the court closed the trial for a third time to have \"a full and candid conversation with the attorneys\" about a limiting instruction. The court stated it did not \"view that there is an alternative to\" the closure. During several closed sessions of court throughout the morning, the court discussed limiting instructions with Morales and the attorneys and also Morales's dissatisfaction with his trial attorney and desire to represent himself. The courtroom was reopened to the public when the jury returned at 1:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b610] The fourth closure was initiated by Morales when his trial attorney advised the court, \"Mr. Morales wishes to make a record. Can we close the court?\" At the time, the court had just returned from recess and the jury had not yet returned to the courtroom. Without making\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   findings or asking for a response from the State, the courtroom was closed to everyone other than Morales, the attorneys, and the court staff. After the courtroom was closed, Morales's attorney explained to the court that Morales \"wishes to make a record in regard to evidence that he wishes to offer that I am not going to.\" Morales explained his intent to take the stand and the reasons he had for doing so. The court explained its requirements for maintaining decorum and discussed whether Morales would testify in narrative form or would be questioned by his attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b611] Just before closing arguments, and before the jury was brought in, the district court closed the courtroom to the public for a fifth time to discuss a report that two jurors might have seen Morales brought into the courthouse in shackles. Again, there was no analysis or findings under the\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   factors. While the courtroom was closed to the public, the court and counsel discussed procedures for questioning the jurors to determine whether any juror had seen Morales in shackles and, if so, whether any impression made would affect the juror's ability to be fair and impartial. The court discussed with counsel whether such questioning should be in open court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b612] The courtroom was reopened to the public, and the jury panel was questioned as a group. After one juror raised her hand to indicate she had seen Morales outside the courtroom, the court closed the courtroom to the public for a sixth time to question the juror. The court explained that questioning an individual juror at this point into the trial would require \"a lot of sensitivity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b613] At oral argument, the State confirmed that there were members of the public in attendance who were excluded from the courtroom during these courtroom closures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b614] Morales argues that each of these closures violated his constitutional right to a public trial and requires reversal. A de novo standard of review applies to whether facts rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

When the district court ordered the second closure, the jury was at its lunch recess and was not in the courtroom. Naturally, the court must consider whether the probative value of evidence is outweighed by unfair prejudice without the jury observing the evidence or hearing the arguments. The court's reason to exclude the public is less clear. We could speculate that the court's reason was the same as its reason\n   for imposing the March 15 order restricting extrajudicial comments, but avoiding the need to speculate is precisely why\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   requires pre-closure findings. The scenario presented in\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   is particularly instructive here. There, the Supreme Court reversed a trial court's closure to the public of a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence. Like the suppression hearing in\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   , this closure involved hearing argument and discussing evidence which may or may not be admissible at trial. It is thus clear that more than a worry about jurors hearing prejudicial or inadmissible information is required to justify a closure. Considering a parallel concern asserted in support of closing jury selection, the Supreme Court has said: \"If broad concerns of this sort were sufficient to override a defendant's constitutional right to a public trial, a court could exclude the public from jury selection almost as a matter of course.\"\n   <em>\n    Presley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638961\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/209/#p215\">\n    558 U.S. at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638961\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/209/#p215\">\n    130 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Adherence to the\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   requirements focuses the district court's attention on whether there is an overriding interest requiring closure of the courtroom to the public and media that were observing the trial. Without findings articulated on the record, we are left to speculate whether the district court had an overriding interest in mind, considered any specific alternatives, or considered ways to limit the scope of any necessary closure.

The first closure was prompted by a note from an individual juror. The jury was not in the courtroom at the time. The district court stated that it saw no alternative and explained to the public attending the trial that they would have to leave for this \"bench conference.\" The court's brief pre-closure statements did not satisfy the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   . In essence, the court reasoned that this was not a closure but a bench conference that did not require\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   analysis. The fifth and sixth closures also involved midtrial questioning of jurors relating to potential prejudice arising from seeing the defendant in shackles outside the courtroom. We conclude that the public trial right is not implicated by the trial court's private questioning of an individual juror during a trial regarding potential misconduct. Should a similar situation occur on retrial, such questioning may be conducted in chambers or in a closed courtroom.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because there was no objection to the first pretrial closure, we review it as a forfeited error subject to obvious error review. In contrast, both Morales and the State objected to the second pretrial closure, preserving it for review on appeal. The district court's March 15th order restricting all participants in the trial from making \"extrajudicial comments\" on penalty of contempt is clear indication of the court's appropriate concern that Morales receive a fair trial by an impartial jury not tainted by media coverage. That concern, to the extent it expressed the district court's motivation in closing pretrial hearings in March and April, is not by itself sufficient. The U.S. Supreme Court addressed precisely this point in\n   <em>\n    Presley v. Georgia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   There are no doubt circumstances where a judge could conclude that threats of improper communications with jurors or safety concerns are concrete enough to warrant closing\n   <em>\n    voir dire.\n   </em>\n   But in those cases, the particular interest, and threat to that interest, must \"be articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638961\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/209/#p215\">\n    558 U.S. at 215-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638961\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/209/#p215\">\n    130 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Presley\n   </em>\n   , the first pretrial closure is error that is plain and thus satisfies the first two requirements for obvious error. And as a structural error immune to harmless error analysis, we also conclude it affects substantial rights. Accordingly, the first closure was also obvious error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b633] The second pretrial closure, which we review de novo, was also a violation of the public trial right. At the prior hearing the district court stated that at the pretrial evidentiary hearing it would \"clear the press out ... and deal with the 404(b). That will be a closed hearing for obvious reasons.\" On the record prior to closing the evidentiary hearing, the court stated, \"I don't know if all the excessive details that have been reported are going to be admissible or not.\"\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   would permit a closure even over the objection of both parties, but the court must articulate adequate findings supporting a closure. Compare\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   , which remanded for a new hearing on a motion to suppress, a hearing which necessarily includes discussion of evidence that may not be admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Where there is a particularized risk of tainting the jury pool by public proceedings relating to potentially inadmissible evidence,\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   tells us that the Sixth Amendment requires both tailoring any closure to be no broader than necessary to protect that interest and consideration of reasonable alternatives to closure. Should similar pretrial hearings be held on remand, the district court should make adequate findings under\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   before closing any hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b634] We do not lightly reverse a criminal conviction in the absence of any apparent prejudice to the defendant flowing from erroneous trial closures. It may appear that reversing a conviction for a public trial violation elevates form over function. Further, we acknowledge the trial court's motivation to preserve the defendant's right to a fair trial by limiting distribution of case information that may not be admitted at trial.
