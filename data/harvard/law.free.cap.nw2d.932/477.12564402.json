Stat. \u00a7 550.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), (2) an accounting, and (3) unjust enrichment. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled that Baxter permissibly applied ordinance 2016-023 against BPUC in accordance with Baxter's statutory authority. The parties stipulated to entry of final judgment, and Brainerd and BPUC appealed. The issues before this court are purely legal questions, and the facts are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1892, Brainerd established a utility to provide light and power. Via Brainerd's 1908 city charter, it operated the utility as the Brainerd Water and Light Department (BWLD) with a three-member board. In 1935, the BWLD extended its utility service into an area that incorporated as Baxter four years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 17, 1975, the Minnesota Public Service Commission, now known as the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC), assigned BWLD to be one of the exclusive providers of retail electric services to customers in Crow Wing County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This assignment order established an ongoing obligation that BWLD, and its successor BPUC, provide electricity in the northeastern portion of Baxter adjacent to Brainerd, both of which are in Crow Wing County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1985, Brainerd amended its city charter to establish BPUC and provided BPUC the responsibilities of the BWLD. Brainerd authorized BPUC to control, operate and manage its electrical service within the city. BPUC has the power to institute, prosecute and defend, in the name of Brainerd as it deems appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2013, Baxter commissioned a Pavement Management Plan study (PMP) about maintenance and funding of its city streets. The PMP determined Baxter needed to increase its maintenance budget for road infrastructure, and it identified utility-franchise fees as a possible funding source. Baxter requested that BPUC enter into a franchise agreement for BPUC's occupation and use of Baxter's right-of-way and BPUC's utility service to Baxter residents. BPUC never consented to a franchise agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Baxter notified BPUC of its intention to adopt a franchise-fee ordinance pursuant to Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 216B.02, and .36 (2018). Baxter identified its intent to use the franchise-fee funds for pavement management and street- and traffic-lighting activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After multiple city council meetings, Baxter adopted ordinance 2016-023, imposing its franchise fee on BPUC. The purpose section of ordinance 2016-023 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Baxter City Council has determined that it is in the best interest of the City to impose a franchise fee on those public utility companies that provide electric energy services within the City of Baxter to fund pavement management related and street and traffic lighting related activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Baxter's ordinance 2016-023 identified Minn. Stat. \u00a7 301B.01 (2018), as its statutory authority to impose the franchise fee on BPUC. The franchise fee imposed on BPUC was determined by applying the following schedule per customer premise/per month for metered service within Baxter:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-20\"><strong>Class:</strong> <strong>Monthly Fee:</strong> Residential $3.00 Commercial $13.00 Demand $52.00 Large Power $138.00</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ordinance 2016-023 does not identify that Baxter is requiring a franchise from appellants. In a letter dated June 9, 2016, Baxter provided ordinance 2016-023 to BPUC noting the ordinance became effective 60 days after receipt. On August 8, 2016, ordinance 2016-023 became effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   BPUC began to collect the franchise fee from their customers in accordance with ordinance 2016-023. BPUC made payment to Baxter, but Baxter determined the payments did not satisfy the amount owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 14, 2017, Baxter filed a complaint in Crow Wing County District Court against Brainerd and BPUC seeking enforcement of the franchise fee. Brainerd and BPUC argued Baxter lacks statutory authority to enforce ordinance 2016-023. Baxter cited Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 216B.36, 222.37, subd. 1, 301B.01, and the district court denied Brainerd and BPUC's motion for summary judgment, and it granted Baxter's motion for partial summary judgment, declaring that Baxter may impose a franchise fee pursuant to Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 216B.36, 301B.01, or 412.321, subd. 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties stipulated to entry of final judgment.

Chapter 216B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Baxter argues it has authority to enforce its franchise fee by ordinance pursuant to chapter 216B because: (1) a franchise fee may be imposed on a municipal utility providing service outside its border, and (2) BPUC is a separate entity from Brainerd and is therefore a \"public utility.\" Baxter's theories are unavailing because they are inconsistent with the statute's plain language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Pursuant to Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.36, a public utility that furnishes utility services to a municipality \"may be required to obtain a license, permit, right, or franchise in accordance with the terms, conditions, and limitations of regulatory acts of the municipality, including the placing of distribution lines and facilities underground.\" This requirement may include that the public utility \"pay to the municipality fees to raise revenue or defray increased municipal costs accruing as a result of utility operations, or both.\" Minn.

The plain language of Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 216B.02, subd. 4, and .36 unambiguously does not authorize the revenue-raising franchise fee imposed by Baxter in ordinance 2016-023 because BPUC is excluded from the definition of public utility by operation of section 216B.02, subdivision 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hutchinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9005563\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/707/223/#p227\">\n    707 N.W.2d at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding municipalities are exempt from application of chapter 216B unless an exception applies).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, Baxter asserts that Brainerd's establishment of BPUC as an independent commission deprives BPUC of a municipal-utility status. The undisputed facts show that Brainerd established BPUC to control, operate and manage the electric system. Although BPUC can act on its own to institute, prosecute, and defend on behalf of Brainerd, Brainerd continues to exercise control over BPUC. The Brainerd treasury retains revenue from BPUC's operation, the Brainerd city council approves BPUC's exercise of power to appoint and employ individuals to perform BPUC's duties, and the Brainerd city council exercises authority to approve BPUC's budget. Given the manner by which Brainerd controls BPUC, its existence as a separate entity does not deprive its status as a municipal utility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

BPUC has provided electrical service to a portion of what would become Baxter since 1935. When BPUC extended its electrical service, Baxter did not exist as an entity that could authorize a utility to operate. Baxter asserts that BPUC now needs to pay a franchise fee to operate as a preexisting utility in Baxter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Baxter relies on the supreme court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Village of Blaine\n   </em>\n   to argue that a municipality may exclude a utility from operating in its locality when it did not have a franchise and, therefore, Baxter may impose its revenue-raising fee at issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351997\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/272/343/\">\n    138 N.W.2d at 44-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, Blaine adopted an ordinance that permitted a particular gas utility to provide for the city but Independent School District No. 12 (ISD 12)-located within the Village of Blaine-sought bids from other gas utilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36. ISD 12 executed an agreement with the Circle Pines Utility Commission to provide gas to the school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. The supreme court recognized \"the type of utilities here involved may not operate in cities and villages without franchises from those cities and villages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. \"Our statutes prohibit unfranchised utilities from operating competitively in any city or village in this state and thereby [circumventing] governmental control of these essential services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. Because Circle Pines' natural gas system would be operating in Blaine if used by ISD 12, the supreme court held Blaine's refusal to provide a franchise to Circle Pines prohibited the gas operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Village of Blaine\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable from this case. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 301B.01 requires that a corporation-before operating-obtain a franchise from the city. Baxter did not exist at the time BPUC began to provide its electric utility to the area of Baxter. BPUC did not operate \"upon a street, alley, or other public ground of a city\" because no city existed at the time. This extension of service did not require a franchise from any city, and no city could have granted such authority. Since 1939, when Baxter incorporated, BPUC has continued to provide electrical service. The statute's plain meaning does not require BPUC to obtain an operating right when the city incorporated an area within which BPUC was already providing electrical service. Further, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Village of Blaine\n   </em>\n   where the city refused to permit Circle Pines to begin providing service, Baxter does not assert it is disallowing BPUC to operate without paying the franchise fee. Rather, Baxter demands payment from the utility. Therefore, the BPUC's preexisting operation in Baxter does not implicate the statutory framework in Minn. Stat. \u00a7 301B.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In addition to the statute not being implicated in this context, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 301B.01 provides that a city may require compensation from the corporation serving as its electrical utility. The statute's language provides that a corporation formed to supply or furnish power for the public use cannot \"construct, maintain, or operate a ... conduit, ... in or upon a street, alley, or other public ground of a city, without first obtaining from the city a franchise conferring this right and compensating the city for it.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 301B.01. Brainerd and BPUC argue that the statute authorizes a compensation requirement only as it relates to the construction, maintenance, or operation of the electrical system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Baxter again relies on\n   <em>\n    Village of Blaine\n   </em>\n   to assert the permissible scope of a franchise fee. The supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Village of Blaine\n   </em>\n   expressed that \"[t]he grant of a right to maintain public utilities within the\n   municipality and to exact compensation thereof is a franchise.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351997\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/272/343/\">\n    138 N.W.2d at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This broad language, however, does not define the nature of the compensation requirement authorized by section 301B.01.\n   <em>\n    Village of Blaine\n   </em>\n   did not address the nature of a franchise fee. It analyzed whether an entity, ISD 12, could contract with a third-party utility to provide service within the locality without permission from the municipality for that utility to operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We, therefore, must consider the term \"compensating\" in the context of the statute to determine whether Baxter's franchise fee functions as compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Raynolds' Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"259763\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/219/449/\">\n    219 Minn. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20N.W.2d%20238\">\n    18 N.W.2d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 241 (1945) (\"We are required to look beyond mere words and inquire into the operation of the statute.\").

Section 301B.01 provides such that a \"corporation ... may construct, maintain, or operate\" within a city only after first obtaining the right and compensating the city for it. Compensation, within this context, is tied to the three enumerated categories where the corporation affects the city's streets, alleys, or public grounds through its operation. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 301B.01. We disagree with Baxter's interpretation of section 301B.01 because it detaches the meaning of compensation from the statute's context, which is contrary to our principles of statutory construction. Ordinance 2016-023 does not seek compensation for constructing, maintaining, or operating the utility, rather Baxter identified its purpose as funding pavement management and street- and traffic-lighting related activities.
