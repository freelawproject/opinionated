Bolinske argues the hearing panel erred by finding he violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a), 1.15(e), and 1.16(e) and recommending he be suspended. We conclude clear and convincing evidence does not support finding Bolinske violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a) and 1.15(e). We conclude clear and convincing evidence established Bolinske violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.16(e) by failing to return case files to Carter and the Watsons after representation was terminated. We order Bolinske be reprimanded and pay partial costs and expenses of the disciplinary proceeding in the amount of $3,300. We remand File no. 20190110 to the hearing panel for determination whether Bolinske violated Rule 1.16(e) by failing to refund to the Watsons any unearned portion of the $10,000 fee they paid Bolinske.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Bolinske was admitted to practice law in North Dakota in 1975, but he is not currently licensed in this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] In June 2018, disciplinary counsel petitioned to discipline Bolinske, alleging he violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a) (reasonable fees), 1.15(e) (safekeeping of property), and 1.16(e) (terminating representation) in connection with his representation of Carter and the Watsons. Disciplinary counsel alleged Bolinske agreed to and collected unreasonable fees from Carter and the Watsons, he failed to properly maintain possession of property in which two or more persons claimed an interest until the dispute was resolved, he failed to return Carter's and the Watsons' files after\n   they terminated his representation, and he failed to refund unearned fees. Bolinske denied the alleged misconduct and requested the charges be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] After receiving testimony from Bolinske and admitting exhibits from both parties, the hearing panel found clear and convincing evidence Bolinske violated all three rules. The hearing panel recommended Bolinske be suspended from the practice of law for 30 days, refund unearned fees to Carter and the Watsons in the amount of $5,000 each, and pay the costs and expenses of the disciplinary proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b65] Bolinske argues the hearing panel erred by finding there was clear and convincing evidence he violated N.D.R.

The hearing panel found Carter and the Watsons signed their fee agreements, the clients each paid Bolinske $10,000, and Bolinske deposited the funds into his personal bank account which he also used as an operating account for his law practice. Based on Bolinske's testimony and discovery responses, the hearing panel found Bolinske appeared to be unaware of what type of retainer he was charging, but he claimed the payments were to ensure Carter and the Watsons \"had some skin in the game,\" and the fees were paid for Bolinske to investigate, prepare, and bring claims against Tesoro. The hearing panel found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[T]he internal inconsistency of Bolinske's fee agreements rendered the agreements unreasonable.

The fee agreements explain that there is a $10,000 retainer, that the retainer will be deducted from any contingent fee actually recovered, and that the client will owe nothing for the attorney's labor and time if no recovery is made.

Bolinske was the only witness and no evidence conflicts with his testimony about the complexity of the case or the amount of work he completed. Disciplinary counsel admits 33 1/3 percent is a standard contingent fee in North Dakota. Disciplinary counsel does not argue the amounts of the fees agreed to by Carter and the Watsons were unreasonable. Evidence established the combined fee was to investigate, prepare, and bring claims against Tesoro. The $10,000 non-refundable fee and the contingent fee combination is not unreasonable due to its structure. Nor is the fee agreement unreasonable due to the amount of work required in this type of case, and the uncertainty of recovery for that work.

The rule was not intended to be used to resolve routine contractual fee disputes between an attorney and client. When there is a legitimate, good faith dispute between an attorney and client over the agreed-upon fee to be charged, there are other avenues that may be better suited than disciplinary proceedings to resolve the civil contractual dispute between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.R.

Bolinske testified he did not record the time he spent working on the matter because it was a contingency fee case and he did not need to bill the clients. But he presented some evidence of work done for Carter and the Watsons, including copies of emails, letters, and dated notes from phone calls related to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [\u00b633] The record includes evidence of numerous phone calls with Carter, and emails and letters to Tesoro about Carter's claims. Bolinske testified he communicated\n   with Carter \"constantly.\" Additional significant documentary evidence shows Bolinske corresponded with Tesoro, including attempts to settle the dispute before engaging in mediation. Evidence established Bolinske represented Carter in mediation with Tesoro, which was held on July 27, 2016, and Bolinske completed a significant amount of legal work for Carter leading up to and including the mediation. From this record we conclude disciplinary counsel failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that any portion of the non-refundable fee Carter paid was not earned, and that Bolinske was required to refund any of the funds Carter paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\u00b634] The parties and the hearing panel generally applied the law and argued the facts as if Carter's and the Watsons' situations were the same. They were not. The Watsons hired Bolinske in August 2016, and terminated the representation on July 25, 2017. Their termination letter indicated they were unhappy with the services Bolinske provided, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \"I am writing this letter to bring to your attention my concern of the lack [of] action on your part that has been performed to move my case to the filing process in the Federal District Court of North Dakota.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \"This is in addition to your having provided no documentation, either verbal or in writing, for any transfer, movement or accountability regarding funds, case-related costs incurred or billable work regarding my case.

None of Bolinske's work leading up to and including the mediation was directly for the Watsons. While Bolinske had extensive communications with Carter, he testified he had very little contact with Gary Watson about this case. Little other evidence shows or explains the amount or nature of services Bolinske provided to the Watsons during the representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   [\u00b636] The record includes a copy of a March 4, 2017 letter to Tesoro on behalf of Carter and the Watsons. The letter explained Carter's and the Watsons' claims, contained an offer to settle the disputes, and stated they would prepare and serve a summons and complaint if Tesoro did not respond to the settlement offer by March 24, 2017. The record is devoid of other correspondence relating to the Watsons' claims against Tesoro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   [\u00b637] Based on this record, we are unable to determine whether clear and convincing evidence establishes Bolinske violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.16(e) by failing to refund any unearned fees to the\n   Watsons after they terminated his representation when all or substantially all of the services contemplated by the fee agreement had not been performed. We remand the Watson matter to the hearing panel for determination whether Bolinske violated Rule 1.16(e) by failing to refund unearned fees (and if so, in what amount). Given the state of the current record, and our clarification of the respective burdens of proof, the panel may need to receive additional evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [\u00b638] Having concluded Bolinske violated N.D.R.

Because we rejected the hearing panel's findings that Bolinske violated N.D.R.

Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 4.13, reprimand generally is appropriate when the lawyer is negligent in dealing with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client. Bolinske violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.16(e) by failing to send copies of client files to Carter and the Watsons. Bolinske testified he did not send the clients copies of their files because he believed they already had copies of the documents.
