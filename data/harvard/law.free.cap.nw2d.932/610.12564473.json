MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(i). MCL 750.413 does not authorize a fine. We REMAND case 16-006327-FH to the Midland Circuit Court for a determination of whether a DNA sample had already been submitted. If the trial court finds that a DNA sample meeting the requirements of MCL 28.176(3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   had previously been submitted, the trial court shall vacate that part of the September 22, 2017 judgment of sentence imposing a $60 DNA assessment. In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the remaining question presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
