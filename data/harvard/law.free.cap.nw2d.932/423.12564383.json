The truck got stuck in a ditch, blocking traffic, and was eventually towed out by the Town's highway department. A sheriff's deputy issued Central Transport a citation for operating a vehicle on the road in excess of the posted weight limit, in violation of TOWN OF DELAFIELD , WIS. , ORDINANCE \u00a7 7.01 (2010), adopting WIS.

It asserts, however, that a conflict arose in this case because the federal provisions \"protect Central Transport's reasonable access to a terminal/delivery address,\" but the Town's application of \u00a7 348.17(1) through its weight restriction \"denied Central Transport\n   <em>\n    all access\n   </em>\n   from the interstate to its terminal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) The record indicates otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b66 Section 31114(a) of Title 49 of the United States Code provides: \"Prohibition on denying access. A State may not enact or enforce a law denying to a commercial motor vehicle subject to this subchapter or subchapter 1 of this chapter\n   <em>\n    reasonable access\n   </em>\n   \" between\n   the Interstate and a terminal. (Emphasis added.) Similarly, \u00a7 658.19 of Title 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides in relevant part: \"No State may enact or enforce any law denying\n   <em>\n    reasonable access\n   </em>\n   to vehicles with dimensions authorized by the STAA between the [Interstate] and terminals.\" (Emphasis added.) Congress did not define \"reasonable access.\" As one court has observed, \"[d]espite their awareness that the resulting 'nonuniformity of access has become a considerable burden for trucking companies,' Congress did nothing to change the reasonable access provisions of the law to provide for a uniform, national definition of reasonable access.\"\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Freightways Corp. v.

Supp. 1479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1483-84 (M.D. Pa. 1986) (citation omitted). We reverse and remand because we conclude that the manner in which the Town applied WIS. STAT. \u00a7 348.17(1) and Town ordinance \u00a7 7.01 afforded Central Transport \"reasonable access\" and thus is not preempted by the STAA or the FHWA regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 At the trial on Central Transport's citation, the Town's highway superintendent testified that the six-ton weight limit is only in place on certain Town roads \"for a short amount of time\" during the \"spring thaw,\" in order to limit heavy vehicles on the roads when the roads are \"very vulnerable\" to damage from the weight \"because all the ground is not thawed so the roads are soft.\" The superintendent personally determines when the weight restriction should be posted and later removed, which determinations are based upon his direct examination of the roads, including \"movement\" he observes and \"frost coming out of the grounds and cracks.\" Once the roads are settled, he \"pull[s] the weight limits.\" He testified that he utilized this process in March 2016, the time relevant to the\n   citation issued to Central Transport, and that at that time, the weight restriction was only posted and in effect between March 4 and March 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 The superintendent acknowledged that the seasonal weight restriction would not necessarily be in effect during the same dates each year, but stated that it is common for companies to contact him around the time the restriction goes into effect. When asked what a company is supposed to do if it needs to make a delivery with a truck exceeding six tons during the time the weight restriction is in place, the superintendent responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   What they typically do at the Town they call in and the driver or the company comes into my office and I issue them ... a temporary permit to drive on the Town road and I give them a route that they have to travel so they're not traveling\n   on unnecessary roads ... to get to ... where they have to go.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   He confirmed that to the best of his knowledge, in the twenty-one years he had been employed with the Town, fifteen as superintendent, the Town had never denied access to anyone who needed an exception to the seasonal weight restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b69 The superintendent testified that in addition to the posted weight-restriction signs along designated roads, the weight restriction is also noted on the Town website, which provides his phone number and informs the reader to contact him if an exception to the restriction is needed. He confirmed that the restriction was posted on the website in March 2016, including \"the language about obtaining a permit\" and contacting him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610 The sheriff's deputy who cited the Central Transport driver also testified to his awareness of the\n   Town policy of issuing permits to allow exceptions to the weight restriction and indicated that companies routinely contact the sheriff's department to inquire about such local restrictions. Central Transport called no witnesses at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611 No evidence was presented indicating any carrier had ever been precluded from reaching its destination within the Town based upon how the Town executes the seasonal weight restriction and permit exception. Indeed, the testimony of the superintendent strongly suggests that no carrier has ever been denied access between the Interstate and a destination within the Town. As the circuit court found, the Town's weight restriction is in place for an \"undetermined\" but \"short\" period of time each year during the \"spring thaw.\" In this case, the restriction was in place for one week, and the evidence indicates that even during that week, Central Transport could have secured a permit that would have allowed it to travel on weight-restricted roads with, at most, minimal inconvenience, i.e., having to take a specific, Town-designated route to its customer in order to minimize road damage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Aux Sable Liquid Prods. v.

The evidence from trial indicates that in order to avoid a citation, Central Transport would have had to have made itself aware of the weight restriction and permit-exception option the Town had in place at the time. During argument following the trial, the circuit court seemed to express on this point that this is simply a \"[c]ost of doing business.\" We agree with this observation, in that it would appear to be a reasonably expected and normal part of a trucking company's business operation\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to make itself aware of the rules of the road in the area in which it intends to make a delivery, just as it must consider the most efficient route of travel and order for delivering products, traffic congestion, weather, and overpass heights, among other things.\n   \u00b613 No evidence was presented in this case suggesting it would be unreasonably burdensome for a trucking company such as Central Transport to develop an awareness of the Town's seasonal weight restriction. Indeed, the undisputed evidence indicates that had Central Transport merely checked the Town's website around the time of its scheduled delivery and/or contacted the Town directly, it could have easily procured a permit allowing it to legally and timely deliver the art supplies to its Town customer. We agree with the circuit court's additional expression that it \"doesn't seem unreasonable\" to expect a carrier sending a semi-truck to a residential area to inquire of the Town as to whether there are any laws that might affect its delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 On appeal, Central Transport relies most heavily upon the cases of\n   <em>\n    Aux Sable\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    A.B.F.

In addition, the record in this case shows a much simpler and timely process for procuring access to restricted roads than the process in\n   <em>\n    A.B.F.\n   </em>\n   , and there was no evidence presented here that Central Transport\n   could not timely service customers in the Town due to the Town's restriction and permitting process. Furthermore, unlike the approval rate of only sixty percent for new-road-access requests in\n   <em>\n    A.B.F.\n   </em>\n   , here, the superintendent testified he was not aware of anyone ever being denied a permit for access to a Town destination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 The plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031114\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) clearly demonstrates Congress allowed for state and local laws that may restrict a commercial motor vehicle's access between the Interstate and a terminal/delivery address, but required that such laws allow \"reasonable access.\" The record in this case indicates that commercial motor vehicles in excess of six tons have unfettered access to all Town destinations almost the entire year and even during the brief spring-thaw period of restriction still have access, so long as they\n   secure a permit from the Town-which permits appear to be fairly easy to procure and to have never been denied to any carrier-and follow the Town's preferred route of travel. Furthermore, the inherent requirement that a carrier make itself aware as to whether a government restriction, such as a weight limit, might affect its delivery is not an unreasonable \"cost of doing business.\" For these reasons, we conclude the Town's application of WIS. STAT. \u00a7 348.17(1) and TOWN OF DELAFIELD , WIS. , ORDINANCE \u00a7 7.01 through its seasonal weight-restriction and permit process did not deny Central Transport reasonable access between the Interstate and its Town customer and, therefore, did not conflict with \u00a7 31114.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, because Central Transport made\n   no attempt to secure a permit and undisputedly violated the six-ton weight limit, the court erred in dismissing the citation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    By the Court.\n   </em>\n   -Judgment reversed and cause remanded.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2017-18 version unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    A \"terminal\" \"means, at a minimum, any location where: Freight either originates, terminates, or is handled in the transportation process; or Commercial motor carriers maintain operating facilities.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20658.5\">\n     23 C.F.R. \u00a7 658.5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2018).
