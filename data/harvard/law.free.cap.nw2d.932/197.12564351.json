Gillette and Plumber's Portable Toilet Service. We reverse the court's order and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BASIC FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on December 5, 2016. It is undisputed that Gavino, who was three years old at the time, sustained injuries in the accident and was transported by ambulance to the hospital. Two days later, he returned because of pain in his left shoulder when he tried to lift his arm over his head. A CT scan showed that Gavino had an \"[o]blique fracture of the mid diaphysis of the left clavicle.\" He was prescribed a sling, told to use ibuprofen and ice as needed for discomfort, and told to follow up with his primary care physician for a checkup in one week. Gavino's pediatrician later prescribed a clavicle strap. Gavino's parents testified regarding how Gavino's life differed after the injury, but they also\n   testified that after three or four months, he was physically recovered from his injury and was able to resume his normal life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), arguing that Gavino's injury did not constitute a serious impairment of a body function because his injury required minimal treatment and only minimally restricted his lifestyle for a short period of time. At oral argument, defendants clarified that they were specifically arguing that plaintiff could not demonstrate that Gavino's injury affected his general ability to lead his normal life because after a three- or four-month period, he was no longer physically restricted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court noted that \"certainly when Gavino was in the sling he missed, you know, three to four-months of his normal life,\" adding that it is \"obvious that a sling is going to slow down anyone that wears it for four-months.\" Yet, the court concluded that because Gavino had returned to \"his probably very happy normal life as a four-year old,\" his injury did not rise to the level of a serious impairment of a body function. The court concluded that Gavino's normal life was \"running around and playing and focusing on his toys and other kids that might be around,\" and given that he was able to resume almost entirely his preaccident normal life, the injury did not constitute a serious impairment of body function. Accordingly, the court granted summary disposition in favor of defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.

To show that the impaired person's ability to lead his or her normal life has been affected, we compare the person's life before and after the injury.\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Dubose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077515\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/291/496/#p499\">\n    291 Mich.

Important to making this comparison is the fact that \"the statute merely requires that a person's general ability to lead his or her normal life has been\n   <em>\n    affected\n   </em>\n   , not destroyed.\"\n   <em>\n    McCormick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182986\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/487/180/#p189\">\n    487 Mich. at 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20517\">\n    795 N.W.2d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, \"courts\n   should consider not only whether the impairment has led the person to completely cease a pre-incident activity or lifestyle element, but also whether, although a person is able to lead his or her pre-incident normal life, the person's general ability to do so was nonetheless affected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, \"the statute only requires that some of the person's\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   to live in his or her normal manner of living has been affected, not that some of the person's normal manner of living has itself been affected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Lastly, as our Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    McCormick\n   </em>\n   , \"[w]hile the Legislature required that a 'serious disfigurement' be 'permanent,' it did not impose the same restriction on a 'serious impairment of body function.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 203,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20517\">\n    795 N.W.2d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting MCL 500.3135(1). Thus, there is no \"express temporal requirement as to how long an impairment must last in order to have an effect on the person's general ability to live his or her normal life.\"\n   <em>\n    McCormick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182986\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/487/180/#p189\">\n    487 Mich. at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20517\">\n    795 N.W.2d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, Gavino was a three-year-old child at the time he suffered the impairment. His parents testified that as a result of the impairment, he was unable to go to school for approximately two weeks and that when he did return to school he was unable to use the play equipment. Additionally, they testified that after the accident they had to help him go to the bathroom,\n   including by carrying him to the bathroom. His father testified that before the accident, Gavino could dress himself, but afterward he could not. There was also testimony that Gavino needed help going up and down stairs because his balance was negatively affected by his impairment. Further, at times, his ability to sleep without pain was also compromised; his father testified that on occasion Gavino would wake up complaining about shoulder pain. The record also reflects that before the accident Gavino liked to color, but after the accident he did not want to do so. And before the accident he rode his bicycle, played soccer, and played with his scooter in the basement, but after he was injured he was unable to do so. His mother testified that, generally, Gavino was \"cautious\" about physical activities after the accident. Viewing these facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, a jury could conclude that Gavino's general ability to lead his normal life was affected by the impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Still, defendants direct our attention to facts in the record showing that Gavino's impairment did not last the entire three-to-four-month period he was in a sling/clavicle strap, and there is also evidence that Gavino's inability to go to school was only limited for two weeks. Although certainly relevant, that evidence suggests that there is a factual conflict with regard to the nature and extent of his injury. In such cases, summary disposition is not appropriate. See\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077515\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/291/496/#p499\">\n    291 Mich.

The trial court agreed,\n   finding that although there was evidence that Gavino's general ability to lead his normal life was affected by the fracture to his clavicle, he was presently unaffected by the impairment, so he could not satisfy the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    McCormick\n   </em>\n   test. Yet, a person's ability to lead his or her general life does not have to be destroyed in order to constitute a threshold injury; it only needs to have been affected, and here the evidence allows for an inference that Gavino's general ability to lead his normal life was affected even though it was not completely destroyed. See\n   <em>\n    McCormick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182986\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/487/180/#p189\">\n    487 Mich. at 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.W.2d%20517\">\n    795 N.W.2d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, a serious impairment of body function-unlike a permanent serious disfigurement-does not have to be permanent, so the fact that the impairment to Gavino's important body function only lasted three or four months has no bearing on the question at hand. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, given that there is a genuine issue of material fact with regard to the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    McCormick\n   </em>\n   test, and given that the trial court erred in its application of the statute, summary disposition was not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.
