Scheffler requested waiver of court fees and costs,\n   and the district court denied his request. This appeal follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Did the district court err in denying Scheffler's request for waiver of fees and costs in his expungement action?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Scheffler was convicted of a petty misdemeanor seatbelt violation in 2010. He petitioned for expungement of the conviction in 2019, asserting that he had not been convicted of any crime since 2010. He sought relief under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609A.02, subd. 3(a)(3) (2018), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A petition may be filed under section 609A.03, to seal all records relating to an arrest, indictment or information, trial, or verdict ... if ... the petitioner was convicted of or received a stayed sentence for a petty misdemeanor or misdemeanor and has not been convicted of a new crime for at least two years since discharge of the sentence for the crime[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Scheffler's petition explained that he was seeking expungement because his \"[r]ecord looks too long\" and because \"[p]eople publicly access the record such as potential girlfriends and it looks like a lot to explain.\" Scheffler's petition indicated that his criminal record also includes convictions from 1994, 1998, and 2005 for driving while impaired; a conviction from 1995 for underage consumption; and a conviction from 1997 for reckless driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The expungement statute provides for the payment and waiver of a filing fee as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   An individual who is the subject of a criminal record who is seeking the expungement of the record shall file a petition under this section and pay a filing fee in the amount required under section 357.021, subdivision 2, clause (1). The filing fee may be waived in cases of indigency and shall be waived in the cases described in section 609A.02, subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clause (1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609A.03, subd. 1. Section 357.021 establishes a filing fee of $285.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20357.021\">\n    Minn.

Instead, he sought waiver under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20563.01\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 563.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which governs authorization of in forma pauperis (IFP) status in civil cases. The IFP statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (a) Any court of the state of Minnesota or any political subdivision thereof may authorize the commencement or defense of any\n   <em>\n    civil action\n   </em>\n   , or appeal therein, without prepayment of fees, costs and security for costs by a natural person who makes [an] affidavit stating (a) the nature of the action, defense or appeal, (b) a belief that affiant is entitled\n   to redress, and (c) that affiant is financially unable to pay the fees, costs and security for costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Upon a finding by the court that the action is not of a frivolous nature, the court shall allow the person to proceed in forma pauperis if the affidavit is substantially in the language required by this subdivision and is not found by the court to be untrue.

Stat. \u00a7 563.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 3(a), (b) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As support for his assertion that he is unable to pay fees and costs, Scheffler submitted documents indicating that he receives medical assistance and energy assistance, which are forms of public assistance referenced in section 563.01, subdivision 3(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20550.37\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 550.37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 14 (2018) (listing medical assistance and energy assistance as types of public assistance). The district court denied Scheffler's request for IFP status under section 563.01, using a form order and checking a single box indicating that \"[t]he applicant is not found to be indigent and is not entitled to proceed in forma pauperis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Scheffler contends that the district court \"had no discretion to ... deny the IFP\" because the IFP statute states that \"the court shall allow the person to proceed in forma pauperis if the affidavit is substantially in the language required,\" his affidavit met that requirement, and the affidavit was accompanied by \"government proofs of Medical Assistance and Energy Assistance.\" (Emphasis omitted.) In addition, Scheffler notes that after the district court denied IFP status in the underlying expungement action, another judge of the same district court granted Scheffler's request for IFP status in this appeal. In doing so, the district court once again used a form order, but this time it checked a box indicating that \"the applicant is financially unable to pay any fees and entitled to proceed in forma pauperis.\" Scheffler contends that \"[a] person is either a pauper or not; the statute's standards are the same on either end.\" Scheffler asks this court to reverse in a published decision clarifying the standards that govern an IFP determination in district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review a district court's denial of IFP status for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maddox v. Dep't of Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10658488\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/400/136/#p139\">\n    400 N.W.2d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 139 (Minn. App. 1987) (reviewing district court's determination whether to grant defendant IFP status on appeal under section 563.01, subdivision 3, for an abuse of discretion). A district court abuses its discretion if its decision is against logic and the facts in the record.\n   <em>\n    State v. Guzman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12329992\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/892/801/#p810\">\n    892 N.W.2d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810 (Minn. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We question whether the IFP statute, section 563.01, provides the relief that Scheffler seeks. By its own terms, section 563.01 applies to civil actions. Chapter 609A, which governs the expungement of criminal records, does not indicate whether such an expungement action is a criminal action or a civil action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 609A.01 -.04 (2018). And we are not aware of any precedential authority establishing that an expungement action under chapter 609A is a civil action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But we recognize that sections 563.01 and 609A.03 are consistent in that they provide for fee waiver in cases of indigency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20563.01\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 563.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 3(b) (stating that in civil cases the filing fee may be waived for a person \"who is represented by an attorney on behalf of a civil legal services program or a volunteer attorney program based on indigency\"); Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609A.03, subd. 1 (stating that in expungement cases \"[t]he filing fee may be waived in cases of indigency\"). We also recognize that, unlike section 563.01, section 609A.03 does not provide a standard for determining whether an individual is financially eligible for fee waiver. Lastly, we recognize that the district court considered and decided Scheffler's request for fee waiver under section 563.01, apparently without questioning whether section 563.01 applies in an action to expunge criminal records. For all of those reasons, we assume without deciding that an expungement action under chapter 609A is a \"civil action\" within the meaning of section 563.01 and that the standards for determining financial eligibility for fee waiver under section 563.01 may be used to determine whether a petitioner is indigent within the meaning of section 609A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As to the district court's determination that Scheffler is not indigent, Scheffler submitted two documents as proof of his financial circumstances: a document from Crow Wing County Social Services stating that he was \"still eligible for [health care] benefits,\" which referred to the \"program\" \"MA,\" and a document from Lutheran Social Services of Minnesota stating that he was eligible for an \"Energy Assistance grant [of] $343.00.\" There is no evidence in the record to contradict the information contained in those documents, and the district court's order does not provide any basis to reject those documents as proof of Scheffler's financial circumstances. Those documents indicate that Scheffler meets one of the standards for financial eligibility under section 563.01.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20563.01\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 563.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 3(b) (stating that a person is financially eligible for waiver if the person receives \"public assistance described in section 550.37, subdivision 14\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20550.37\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 550.37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 14 (listing medical assistance and energy assistance as types of public assistance). The district court therefore erred by determining that Scheffler is not indigent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But Scheffler's financial eligibility for fee waiver under the standards set forth in section 563.01 does not necessarily mandate fee waiver in his expungement action under chapter 609A. Section 609A.03 governs fee waiver in actions to expunge criminal records and mandates waiver only if \"all pending actions or proceedings were resolved in favor of the petitioner.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609A.03, subd. 1 ; Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609A.02, subd. 3(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 563.01 more generally governs fee waiver in civil actions and mandates waiver if the underlying civil action is not frivolous and the supporting affidavit contains certain language that is not found to be untrue.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20563.01\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 563.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 3(b). In the context of a request for IFP status, \"A frivolous claim is [one] without any reasonable basis in law or equity and [that] could not be supported by a good faith argument for a modification or reversal of existing law.\"\n   <em>\n    Maddox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10658488\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/400/136/#p139\">\n    400 N.W.2d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this case, Scheffler appears to be entitled to mandatory fee waiver under the general waiver provision in section 563.01 because his affidavit in support of waiver contained the necessary language, it was not found to be untrue, and his expungement action is not frivolous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20563.01\">\n    Minn.

But Scheffler is not entitled to mandatory fee waiver under section 609A.03 because the proceedings on his petty misdemeanor seatbelt violation were not resolved in his favor. Once again, assuming without deciding that an expungement action under chapter 609A is a \"civil action\" within the meaning of section 563.01, in this case the special mandatory-fee-waiver provision in section 609A.03 conflicts with the more general mandatory-fee-waiver provision in section 563.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the case of such a conflict, the legislature has provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [w]hen a general provision in a law is in conflict with a special provision in the same or another law, the two shall be construed, if possible, so that effect may be given to both. If the conflict between the two provisions be irreconcilable, the special provision shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision shall be enacted at a later session and it shall be the manifest intention of the legislature that such general provision shall prevail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.26\">\n    Minn.

We therefore hold that a decision whether to waive the filing fee in an action to expunge criminal records is governed by Minn.

Given the absence of any articulated standard for determining whether an expungement petitioner is indigent for purposes of fee waiver under section 609A.03, a district court does not err by relying on the financial standards in section 563.01 to determine whether such a petitioner is indigent.
