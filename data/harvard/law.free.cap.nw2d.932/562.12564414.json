In his subsequent direct appeal, \"[a]lthough Kalmio argued in the district court that the evidence was inadmissible hearsay and prior bad act evidence, he limit[ed] his argument on appeal to hearsay grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Kalmio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6969674\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/846/752/\">\n    2014 ND 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6969674\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/846/752/\">\n    846 N.W.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We, therefore, only examined in his direct appeal \"whether the district court abused its discretion in allowing hearsay testimony and in performing its relevancy analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6969674\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/846/752/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b611] Kalmio argues in this appeal that the sole reason for the witnesses' testimony to prior bad acts was to prejudice him and to tempt the jury to return a guilty verdict based on the prior bad acts testimony, rather than on any competent evidence presented at trial. He contends that there was no physical evidence or witnesses to testify he committed the crimes of murder and that all of the testifying witnesses the judge allowed prejudiced him. He claims his appellate counsel's deficient performance caused him to lose any relief that he could have won on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b612] While this Court previously decided his appellate counsel's performance in the direct appeal was deficient by failing to brief the prior bad acts issue, Kalmio broadly asserts that \"cumulative errors\" of his appellate counsel were \"deliberate and extremely\" prejudicial. He argues that his appellate counsel's testimony at the July 2016 post-conviction hearing revealed that both his appellate counsel and the prosecutor were attempting to minimize the \"damage\" by downplaying the \"cumulative errors\" regarding the prior bad acts testimony at trial. Rather than only two witnesses testifying at trial about prior bad acts, he claims that eleven witnesses testified about prior bad acts and at least ten testified about assaults that were irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b613] Kalmio argues that the district court erroneously construed our decision in\n   <em>\n    Kalmio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6969674\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/846/752/\">\n    2014 ND 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6969674\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/846/752/\">\n    846 N.W.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing testimony of eight of the witnesses and erred in limiting its analysis on remand to the remaining three witnesses-Kenzie Goodhouse, Natasha Hunts Along, and Laura Giberson. He claims the court erred because our prior\n   decision had not addressed any of the prior bad acts testimony. He further contends the jury was \"so enamored\" with the prior bad acts evidence that it was misled to ignore the State's overwhelming lack of credible evidence against him that would suggest he was involved in the murders. He argues \"the jury would have been very reluctant\" to return a guilty verdict without admission of the prior bad acts testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b614] The State argues, however, that the district court's findings on remand were not clearly erroneous. The State notes that although appellate counsel in the direct appeal raised the issue of admissibility of prior bad acts testimony on appeal but did not brief the issue, the State briefed the issue in the direct appeal. The State asserts that this Court sufficiently addressed the \"prior bad acts\" testimony of the other witnesses in the 2014 direct appeal and that the district court did not err on remand by focusing its analysis on the trial testimony of Kenzie Goodhouse and Natasha Hunts Along. The State contends that although the district court also analyzed Laura Giberson's testimony, Kalmio raised an issue with her testimony for the first time on remand, which was beyond the scope of our mandate and a misuse of process. The State argues the district court properly applied N.D.R.Ev. 404(b) and 403 in its analysis and its findings on each witness who gave testimony regarding prior bad acts are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b615] Here, the district court on remand found Kalmio failed to meet his burden to show he was prejudiced by his appellate counsel's unprofessional errors. The court essentially found his appellate counsel's errors would not have changed the result of his direct appeal because the court had properly considered N.D.R.Ev. 404(b) and 403. The court found this Court already concluded the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony of eight of the witnesses and specifically addressed the trial testimony of Kenzie Goodhouse, Natasha Hunts Along, and Laura Giberson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b616] The district court held it did not err in applying the three-step test to decide the testimony was admissible under N.D.R.Ev. 404(b) and 403, and further, this Court held ample evidence at trial supported his conviction. On the basis of its analysis, the district court found that if the prior bad acts issue had been argued on direct appeal, \"there would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be a reasonable probability that, but for his appellate counsel's failure to argue the point, the result of the appeal would have been [different.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b617] This appeal is unique in that Kalmio seeks to have us answer whether our decision in his 2014 direct appeal would have been different after further consideration of the district court's application of N.D.R.Ev. 404(b) and 403. A majority of this Court concluded the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting most of the witnesses' testimony, without analysis of the prior bad acts issue. The district court had conducted an analysis under N.D.R.Ev. 404(b) for each of the witnesses in its December 20, 2012, order on the State's notice of intent to introduce prior bad acts, and provided further analysis in its December 19, 2018, order on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b618] On this record, we conclude the district court on remand made sufficient findings for us to understand its decision to allow the prior bad acts testimony. We further hold the district court did not clearly err in finding Kalmio failed to establish he was prejudiced in his direct appeal. Rather than specify how the court misapplied N.D.R.Ev. 404(b) with respect to each of the witnesses, Kalmio merely offers conclusory assertions that all of the\n   prior bad acts testimony was prejudicial and erroneously admitted into evidence. Kalmio's blanket assertions do not create a reasonable probability of a different result in the direct appeal,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b619] We therefore conclude the district court's findings on remand are not clearly erroneous that Kalmio failed to establish prejudice showing a reasonable probability his appellate counsel's errors changed the result of his direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b620] Kalmio argues the district court erred in denying an evidentiary hearing on remand.
