The prosecution concedes that the trial court erred by assigning five points to Offense Variable (OV) 16. The Court of Appeals erred by affirming the score of 10 points for OV 4 where the record fails to adequately support a finding that the victim suffered a\n   <em>\n    serious\n   </em>\n   psychological injury. MCL 777.34(2). The defendant is thus entitled to resentencing.\n   <em>\n    People v.
