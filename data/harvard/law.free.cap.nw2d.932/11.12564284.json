We denied Essien's request to be reinstated because he had not established that he complied with Rule 26, RLPR.\n   <em>\n    In re Essien\n   </em>\n   , A19-0113, Order at 2-3 (Minn. filed July 18, 2019).

The Director filed an affidavit stating that she believes that Essien \"has now complied with the terms of the Court's suspension order and the Director's Office does not object to [Essien's] reinstatement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   1.
