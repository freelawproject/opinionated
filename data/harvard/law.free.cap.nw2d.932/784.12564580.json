The circuit court failed to apply the correct legal standard to the defendant's claim that the prosecution suppressed material and exculpatory evidence in violation of\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). See\n   <em>\n    People v. Chenault\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293766\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/495/142/#p150\">\n    495 Mich. 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 150,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=845%20N.W.2d%20731\">\n    845 N.W.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The circuit court also failed to address the defendant's claim that he is entitled to a new trial on grounds of newly discovered evidence. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12558511\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/918/676/#p565\">\n    502 Mich. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12558511\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/918/676/#p565\">\n    918 N.W.2d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). The motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, without prejudice to the defendant renewing his request in the circuit court. See MCR 6.505(A). The motion to remand is DENIED as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
