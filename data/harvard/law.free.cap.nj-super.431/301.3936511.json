Villanueva appeals from the entry of judgment for defendant Carmen DeRosa dismissing her personal injury complaint following a jury verdict that plaintiff did not sustain an injury proximately caused by the vehicle collision at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>issue in this litigation. Prior to trial, the per quod claim of Jose L. Villanueva was dismissed, and summary judgment was entered dismissing the complaint as to defendant Matthew J. Zimmer. Defendant DeRosa stipulated he was liable for the collision, and trial proceeded on the issues of proximate cause of injury and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">POINT [1] THE COURT BELOW ERRED IN EXCLUDING EVIDENCE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\u2019S DETERMINATION THAT PLAINTIFF WAS PERMANENTLY DISABLED AND UNABLE TO WORK.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">POINT [2J THE COURT BELOW ERRED IN DISALLOWING THE USE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\u2019S DETERMINATION IN THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF DEFENDANT\u2019S EXPERT WITNESSES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">POINT [3] THE COURT\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY WERE INADEQUATE WITH RESPECT TO ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE SSA\u2019S DETERMINATION THAT PLAINTIFF WAS DISABLED AND UNABLE TO WORK.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Having considered these arguments in light of the record and the applicable law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">We shall first set forth the facts derived from the trial record. Thereafter, we shall set forth the facts pertaining to the controversy arising from plaintiffs efforts to introduce at trial the Social Security Administration\u2019s determination that she was disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">On October 28, 2005, plaintiff was driving north on Route 287 in Hanover Township and had stopped due to heavy traffic. Zimmer was stopped in a pickup truck behind plaintiff when DeRosa, driving a van, struck the rear of Zimmer\u2019s truck, pushing it into the rear of plaintiffs vehicle. After the accident, plaintiff told the responding State police officer that she was \u201cokay\u201d and drove away from the scene. However, shortly thereafter, plaintiff began to feel sore and went to the emergency room at a local hospital, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>where she was examined and released. On a follow-up visit to the emergency room, plaintiff complained of difficulty walking and was given crutches.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Approximately four months after the accident, plaintiff began treatment with a chiropractor for back and neck pain. Feeling she was not getting relief, plaintiff was referred to Richard Kaul, M.D., a specialist in \u201cinterventional pain and minimally invasive spine surgery.\u201d Kaul opined that plaintiff had bilateral L5/S1 radiculopathy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and tears in the intervertebral discs at L4/5 and L5/S1. He treated plaintiff with caudal and epidural steroid injections in her lower back and undertook manipulation of her spine under anesthesia. These treatments afforded plaintiff only temporary relief, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Kaul recommended spinal fusion therapy to stabilize plaintiffs spine and relieve her back pain, but plaintiff declined the surgery, claiming she could not afford it. Michael D. Freeman, Ph.D., a forensic epidemiologist, opined that the accident of October 28, 2005, caused plaintiffs injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Plaintiff testified at trial that she did not return to work as a seamstress because of her pain and her inability to perform her job functions. She stated her job required her to stand for long periods, carry bolts of cloth and operate sewing machines with a foot pedal.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Three doctors testified for the defense at trial. Barry Levine, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon, testified that plaintiff was \u201cmassively obese\u201d and was 5'5\" tall and weighed over 300 pounds at the time of the accident. He stated he found no objective evidence of injuries resulting from the accident and that plaintiffs back problems and complaints of pain were common in overweight individuals. Roger Berg, M.D., a radiologist, stated that plaintiffs Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) films showed no evidence of any herniated discs, annular tears or disc displacement. He added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>that plaintiff did have age-related disc degeneration. Elliot Gross-man, M.D., a neurologist, testified that he found no evidence of any neurologic injury related to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">On June 24, 2007, the Social Security Administration (SSA) issued a four-page \u201cNotice of Award\u201d to plaintiff which stated \u201c[y]ou are entitled to monthly disability benefits\u201d and that \u201c[w]e found that you became disabled under our rules on October 28, 2005.\u201d The notice set forth the amount of the disability payments plaintiff would receive, and explained, \u201c[t]he decisions we made on your claim are based on information you gave us. If this information changes, it could affect your benefits.\u201d The notice also stated, \u201c[djoetors and other trained staff decided that you are disabled under our rules.... [T]his decision must be reviewed at least once every [three] years[,]\u201d and benefits would \u201cend if you are no longer disabled.\u201d However, the notice contained no findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Prior to trial, defense counsel raised a number of in limine motions, including, apparently, an objection to plaintiff introducing any evidence or testimony pertaining to the SSA disability determination. The trial judge reserved decision on a number of these motions. Nonetheless, during his opening statement, plaintiffs attorney stated, \u201cNow, as the result of the injuries [plaintiff] can\u2019t work. And how do you know she can\u2019t work? The Social Security Administration has determined that she is totally disabled[,]\u201d prompting an objection from defense counsel. The trial judge instructed counsel not to say anything further on the subject until she ruled on defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The next day, out of the presence of the jury, the trial judge ruled on defendant\u2019s motion to preclude reference to the SSA determination. Plaintiff, relying on <em>Golian v. Golian, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 781 A.2d 1112 (App.Div.2001), argued that the determination creates a rebuttable presumption that plaintiff was disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>and unable to work as a consequence of the accident. The trial judge disagreed and stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">[The SSA] did not have the benefit of ... the medical reports ... of the defense doctors here. And what this case involves is plaintiffs claim that she suffered a permanent injury as a result of this accident that resulted in her inability to work. Those are the issues that this jury needs to determine based on the evidence presented here, not evidence of a determination that was made by ... [the SSA] that did not have the benefit or the evidence that might have suggested that this disability is not^or was not caused by this accident. That being said so, it cannot come in for the proposition to establish that the plaintiff is presumed to be permanently disabled which is what the plaintiff wants to use this finding for____ What plaintiff needs to establish for this jury is that she did in fact sustain a permanent injury. Plaintiff has the proofs of that contention with the testimony of Dr. Kaul, but it\u2019s for this jury to determine whether she does in fact have a permanent injury that was caused by this collision and that resulted in her disability____[Plaintiff is] allowed to testify that she has not been able to return to work. She has not returned to work. She\u2019s been unable to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Plaintiff then argued she should be allowed to use the determination to cross-examine defendant\u2019s orthopedic expert, but the trial judge again disagreed and advised counsel that she would not allow through the \u201cback door [what] you can\u2019t get in through the front door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">The trial judge also denied plaintiffs subsequent motion for reconsideration, as well as defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on plaintiffs reference to the SSA determination on the opening statement. Counsel did not request a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">During his closing argument, defense counsel repeatedly stressed that plaintiff presented no medical testimony that she was unable to work, and stated, \u201c[n]o one but the plaintiff says that she can\u2019t work anymore.\u201d He added that plaintiff \u201cfreely admits\u201d she never looked for a job after the accident, and did not produce a vocational expert. Before his closing argument, plaintiffs counsel addressed the judge out of the presence of the jury and, referring to the defense closing, stated, \u201cthe evidence of [plaintiffs] disability was prevented from coming in in the form of Social Security on the very arguments [defense counsel] just made.\u201d He then requested, \u201cSocial Security said she\u2019s disabled and that\u2019s a finding ... now I need a charge from your honor that says that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>After hearing argument from both counsel, the trial judge ruled, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">[Although something can be determined to be inadmissible, if a party opens the door, by\u2014unfairly, using either evidence or comments, even in argument, unfairly comments on the evidence such that the door is opened to what would otherwise be inadmissible evidence, the Court has an obligation to recognize as much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">[Defense counsel] has chosen to attack the plaintiffs credibility extensively regarding the idea that she\u2019s not seeking work for reasons unrelated to a lack of ability to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">And for that reason, I find the door has been opened for the jury----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">I\u2019m going to be very specific as to what the jury can be told and that is that the Social Security Administration based on submissions provided by the plaintiff, found that the plaintiff became disabled on October 28th, 2005. That is what the jury will be permitted to hear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Plaintiffs counsel then requested the trial judge to charge the jury the SSA determination gives rise to a presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">Judge, I understand your Honor\u2019s ruling. For the record, I think the proper way to do it is to charge the jury on presumptions, whatever that Evidence Rule is or whatever the model jury charge on presumptions and tell them that the presumption is rebuttable that the Social Security determination is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">The judge declined the request and advised the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">Ladies and Gentlemen, before we proceed with the plaintiffs closing argument, I want to instruct you with respect to certain comments that were made during the defendant\u2019s closing arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-14\">You heard some comments regarding plaintiffs alleged disabilities or inabilities. I want to instruct you that you can consider, although it is ultimately your determination to make, as to what if any, abilities plaintiff does or doesn\u2019t have as a result of the accident or collision that occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">In other words, you need to determine what, if any, effect the collision had on plaintiffs abilities. But you are permitted and I am instructing now that you should be informed that the Social Security Administration has found that the plaintiff became disabled on October 28, 2005 based on submissions plaintiff had made and that\u2014however, that determination is reviewed periodically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-16\">And again, it is for you to determine however, whether any ability or disability or\u2014or lack of ability resulted from the collision that is the subject of this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-17\">But Social Security has made a ... determination, a finding that the plaintiff became disabled and that is subject to periodic review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-18\">During his summation, plaintiffs counsel stated, \u201cwhat\u2019s the best evidence you have that [plaintiff] can\u2019t go back to work? What the judge just told you, the Social Security Administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>has decided that she is disabled.\u201d He added that \u201cto buy defendant\u2019s case[,]\u201d the jury would have to believe plaintiff lied and that \u201cSocial Security screwed up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Following the judge\u2019s charge on the law, the jury returned its unanimous verdict, finding that plaintiff did not \u201csustain an injury as a proximate result of the collision on October 28, 2005.\u201d Judgment was entered for defendant and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Relying primarily upon <em>Golian, supra, </em>plaintiff argues that the SSA determination \u201cwas admissible and created a presumption ... as to the fact issues which the defense had contested as part of its case\u2014plaintiffs disability and inability to work.\u201d Plaintiff also argues that the trial judge erred in denying her request to \u201cuse the SSA determination in examining defendant\u2019s witnesses concerning their opinions that plaintiff had suffered no injury[.]\u201d Plaintiff adds that the jury was \u201centitled to hear what explanation [defendant\u2019s] experts may have had for suggesting, completely contrary to the fact that [the] SSA has determined plaintiff to be disabled, that plaintiff was not injured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Finally, plaintiff argues that the trial judge erred in her instruction to the jury on the SSA determination following defendant\u2019s closing. Plaintiff asserts that the instruction failed to advise the jury that the determination must be considered as presumptive \u201cprima facie evidence of one\u2019s inability to work and to earn income,\u201d subject to rebuttal by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">While we ordinarily review a trial court\u2019s evidence ruling for an abuse of discretion, <em>Hisenaj v. Kuehner, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>6, 12, 942 A.2d 769 (2008), our review is de novo when the trial court \u201cfails to apply the proper test in analyzing the admissibility of proffered evidence.\u201d <em>Konop v. Rosen, </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 401, 41 A.3d 773 (App.Div.2012) (citing Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>Rules, </em>comment 4.6 on <em>R. </em>2:10-2 (2012)). Given the arguments raised on appeal, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling in this case under the stricter, de novo standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">At the outset, we should observe that we are not dealing with the concepts of res judicata or collateral estoppel. Defendant was neither a party, nor in privity with a party, to the proceedings before the Social Security Administration. Res judicata is a broad common-law doctrine encompassing the modern-day theories of claim preclusion and issue preclusion. <em>Velasquez v. Franz, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>498, 505, 589 A.2d 143 (1991); <em>Innes v. Carrascosa, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453, 488-89, 918 A.2d 686 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>73, 926 A.2d 857 (2007). \u201cThe doctrine evolved in response to the specific policy concerns of providing finality and repose for the litigating parties; avoiding the burdens of relitigation for the parties and the court; and maintaining judicial integrity by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions regarding the same matter.\u201d <em>Velasquez, supra, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>at 505, 589 A.2d 143 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u201cIn essence, the doctrine of res judicata provides that a cause of action between parties that has been finally determined on the merits by a tribunal having jurisdiction cannot be relitigated by those parties or their privies in a new proceeding.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Roberts v. Goldner, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>82, 85, 397 A.2d 1090 (1979)). Put differently, \u201c \u201cwhen a controversy between parties is once fairly litigated and determined it is no longer open to relitigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Culver v. Ins. Co. of N. Am,., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>451, 460, 559 A.2d 400 (1989) (quoting <em>Lubliner v. Bd. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>428, 435,165 A.2d 163 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Collateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, is a \u201c \u2018branch of the broader law of res judicata which bars relitigation of any issue which was actually determined in a prior action, generally between the same parties, involving a different claim or cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tarus v. Borough of Pine Hill, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>497, 520, 916 A.2d 1036 (2007) (quoting <em>Sacharow v. Sacharow, </em>177 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>N.J. </em>62, 76, 826 A.2d 710 (2003)). The application of collateral estoppel \u201c \u2018means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 501, 927 A.2d 569 (App.Div.2007) (quoting <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>436, 443, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1189, 1194, 25 L.Ed.2d 469, 475 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In <em>Olivieri v. Y.M.F. Carpet, Inc., </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>511, 897 A.2d 1003 (2006), the Court explained that while collateral estoppel can apply to issues decided by administrative tribunals if all the requirements for the doctrine are found to exist, nonetheless, the doctrine, being equitable in origin, \u201cwill not be applied when it is unfair to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521-22, 897 A.2d 1003 (citation and quotation marks omitted). There, the Court declined to apply the doctrine to preclude the defendant in an action under Conscientious Employee Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -8, from arguing that plaintiff voluntarily left her employment, despite a contrary finding by the Board of Review on plaintiffs unemployment claim. <em>Id. </em>at 525, 897 A.2d 1003. The Court based its determination on the differences \u201cin the quality and extensiveness of the procedures followed\u201d in administrative unemployment determinations and in Law Division actions. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In the case before us, plaintiff expressly eschews reliance upon either res judicata or collateral estoppel, recognizing the critical absence of the element of identity of parties or privies. Rather, as noted, relying primarily upon <em>Golian, supra, </em>plaintiff argues that she is entitled to bring before the jury the fact that she had been declared disabled through an SSA determination, and to have that determination declared presumptive evidence of disability and inability to work, subject only to rebuttal by the defense. We begin our analysis with the <em>Rules of Evidence </em>and the principle that \u201chearsay statements that do not conform to the exceptions specifically enumerated in the <em>Rules of Evidence </em>are not admissible.\u201d <em>State v. Rose, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>141, 175, 19 A.3d 985 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>It is clear that the SSA determination is hearsay and was proffered explicitly for the truth of the finding therein. \u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>801(c). <em>See Muench v. Twp. of Haddon, 255 N.J.Super. </em>288, 305-06, 605 A.2d 242 (App.Div.1992) (holding that a report of findings by the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights did not qualify for any hearsay exception in a discrimination case brought under the LAD); <em>Phillips v. Erie Lackawanna R.R.

R. </em>63(15), the predecessor to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(8). We held that the factual conclusions of a hearing examiner of the Public Utility Commission respecting the hazards posed by a particular grade crossing, and the Board\u2019s decision and order directing installation of protective lights and bells at the crossing, were hearsay and were not admissible under <em>Evid. R. </em>63(15) in a civil damage action arising out of an accident at the crossing. Judge Conford writing for the court, noted, \u201c[t]he broad subject of admissibility of official statements containing factual conclusions derived from investigatory proceedings has constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>a controversial area in the law of evidence and has evoked differing points of view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 259 A.2d 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Judge Conford explained that the historical background preceding the adoption of <em>Evid. R. </em>63(15) \u201cdemonstrate[d] clearly the intent of the drafters not to allow in evidence conclusionary material resulting from official investigations embodied in statements or reports of the official or agency involved.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A review of the development of our present <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(8) makes very clear, as described by Judge Conford, <em>id. </em>at 595-99, 259 <em>A.2d </em>719, that in New Jersey we explicitly rejected the proposal in the Uniform Rules of Evidence that official investigatory conclusions should be included as admissible hearsay. As he observed, the deliberative and drafting process precedent to adoption constituted an \u201coutright desertion of the principle of admissibility of all investigatory findings or conclusions and a reversion to the limitation to statistical findings\u201d only. <em>Id. </em>at 598, 259 A.2d 719. Judge Conford concluded his detailed analysis in <em>Phillips </em>by remarking on the \u201cunmistakable intent to exclude from evidence factual findings or conclusions, aside from statistical findings, by official investigatory bodies, insofar as admissibility is posited upon the exception to the hearsay rule constituted by <em>Rule </em>63(15).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 259 A.2d 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Similarly, in <em>Muench, supra, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>288, 605 A.2d 242, we held that the trial court did not err in refusing to admit into evidence the probable cause determination of the Division on Civil Rights in plaintiffs later action for sexual harassment. Construing the predecessor to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(8), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in excluding the probable cause determination. Clearly, it is not a written statement \u201cof an act done,\u201d or an \u201cevent observed\u201d by a public official. <em>Evid. R. </em>63(15) (emphasis added). It is conclusory material compiled by an investigator for the Division solely for the purpose of determining whether there was any basis for continuing the administrative process. Further, the jury might well have placed undue significance on the investigator\u2019s \u201cconclusion,\u201d when in fact the investigator makes no findings, but simply determines that the matter should proceed further. Moreover, we presume all of the evidence presented to the investigator will be presented to the jury for its ultimate and independent resolution based on its judgment of the evidence presented during trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>[Id. at 305-06, 605 A.2d 242.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The federal analogue of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(8)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is in some ways more expansive than our Rule, but the federal courts have reached determinations about the admission of administrative conclusions very similar to our courts in applying our Rule. <em>FedR.Evid </em>803(8)(c) provides, in relevant part, that the following items are exceptions to the hearsay rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">Records, reports, statements or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth ... (C) in civil actions and proceedings and against the government in criminal cases, <em>factual findings </em>resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In <em>Beech Aircraft v. Rainey, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that, as long as the finding in question is based upon a factual investigation and satisfies the trustworthiness requirements of <em>Fed.R.Evid. </em>803(8)(c), it is admissible along with other portions of the report. 488 <em>U.S. </em>153, 170, 109 <em>S.CL </em>439, 451, <em>102 L.Ed.2d </em>445, 463 (1988). At the same time, the Court specifically declined to decide whether legal conclusions are admissible under the Rule. <em>Id. </em>at 170 n. 13, 109 <em>S.CL </em>at 451 n. 13, 102 L.Ed.2d at 463 n. 13 (the Court \u201cexpressed] no opinion on whether legal conclusions contained in an official report are admissible as \u2018findings of fact\u2019 under <em>[Fed.R.Evid] </em>803(8)(C)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The consensus among the various federal districts and circuits appears to favor the view that legal conclusions are not admissible as \u201cfindings of fact\u201d under the Rule. <em>See, e.g., Starceski v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>54 A.3d 1089, 1099 n. 12 (3d Cir.1995) (excluding EEOC determination that the claim lacked probable cause); <em>Martin v. Cavalier Hotel Corp., </em>48 A.3d 1343, 1357-58 (4th Cir.1995); <em>Hines v. Brandon Steel Decks, Inc., </em>886 A.2d 299, 303 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cLegal conclusions are inadmissible because the jury would have no way of knowing whether the preparer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the report was cognizant of the requirements underlying the legal conclusion and, if not, whether the preparer might have a higher or lower standard than the law requires.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>971, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1587, 118 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992); <em>In re Plywood Antitrust Litigation, </em>655 F.2d 627, 637 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Spruill v. Winner Ford of Dover Ltd., </em>175 <em>F.R.D. </em>194, 198 (D.Del.1997); <em>Brom v. Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, Inc., </em>867 <em>F.Supp. </em>686, 692 (N.D.Ill.1994); <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita, </em>505 <em>F.Supp. </em>1125, 1144 (E.D.Pa.1980) (\u201ca finding [under the Rule] does not include legal conclusions that may have been reached by an investigator\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>723 F.2d 238 (3d Cir.1983), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>574, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Further, trustworthiness is the cornerstone of the public records exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Crispin v. Volkswagenwerk AG, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 552-53, 591 A.2d 966 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>385, 599 A.2d 162 (1991). Hence, a court must be cautious about the use of an administrative determination that may be predicated upon a different, more lenient, standard, or sets forth no factual findings. <em>See Beech Aircraft, supra, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>at 170, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 451, 102 L.Ed.2d at 463; <em>cf. Olivieri, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 524-25, 897 A.2d 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Guided by these principles, we hold <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(8) does not authorize the admission of an SSA determination of disability as a hearsay exception in the circumstances of this case. The plain terms of the rule simply do not authorize the admission of an SSA determination that plaintiff is disabled, to be utilized as substantive evidence in a personal injury action where plaintiff has the burden of proving she suffered an injury caused by an accident and that the injury impaired her ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The conclusion of a federal administrative law judge (ALJ) or the SSA itself that a person is disabled is neither an \u201cact done by the official\u201d nor is it \u201can act, condition or event observed by the official.\u201d The history of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(8) clearly distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>guishes an \u201cact done\u201d or an \u201cevent observed,\u201d on the one hand, and an administrative \u201cconclusion,\u201d on the other. <em>Muench, supra, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 305, 605 A.2d 242; <em>Phillips, supra, 107 N.J.Super. </em>at 598, 259 A.2d 719. \u201cFindings\u201d by a public official are only admissible under the rule if they are statistical\u2014a qualifier obviously inapplicable to an SSA disability determination. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(8)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">An SSA disability determination is of dubious probative value in a personal injury action, in any event. The lack of a meaningful adversarial process with respect to the cause, existence and extent of a plaintiffs alleged disability renders the SSA\u2019s conclusions on that issue unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In Social Security disability<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> claim hearings, the ALJ has an affirmative obligation to assist the claimant in developing the facts. <em>See, e.g., Taybron v. Harris, </em>667 F.2d 412, 414-15 (3d Cir.1981); <em>Kephart v. Richardson, </em>505 F.2d 1085, 1090 (3d Cir.1974); <em>Hess v. Sec\u2019y of Health, Educ. and Welfare, </em>497 F.2d 837, 840-41 (3d Cir.1974) (\u201cAlthough the burden is upon the claimant to prove his disability, due regard for the beneficent purposes of the legislation requires that a more tolerant standard be used in this administrative proceeding than is applicable in a typical suit in a court of record where the adversary system prevails.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In evaluating whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings, \u201cleniency [should] be shown in establishing the claimant\u2019s disability, and that the Secretary\u2019s responsibility to rebut it [should] be strictly construed____\u201d <em>Dobrowolsky v. Califano, </em>606 F.2d 403, 407 (3d Cir.1979) (internal quotation marks omitted). The \u201cspecial nature of proceedings for disability benefits,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 406, undermines the probative value of an SSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>determination of disability in an adversarial trial where plaintiff bears the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Conversely, defendant may suffer real and significant prejudice from the admission of the SSA disability determination. Introduction of the determination could cause the jury, despite the questionable utility of the determination with respect to causation, to inappropriately give weight, based on the fact that the SSA is a government agency, to its conclusions that plaintiff suffered a disability and was unable to work and to find, therefore, that this was due to defendant\u2019s negligence. That issue was, in fact, the sole contested issue in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Also, an SSA disability determination must be periodically reviewed and is subject to being overturned. A jury, however, cannot be asked years later to reverse itself based on an SSA disability determination that was later overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Our colleagues in <em>Golian, supra, </em>limited their holding to the facts presented, which are distinguishable from this ease. There, the plaintiff appealed from a decision by the Family Part pertaining to certain financial matters, such as alimony, equitable distribution of property and counsel fees, which were predicated on imputation of income to her. 344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 338, 781 A.2d 1112. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that her disability status should have resulted in a presumption of inability to work and the burden should have been on defendant to rebut that presumption, particularly since the defendant assisted plaintiff in obtaining the award and benefited from it prior to the divorce proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 341-42, 781 A.2d 1112. We reversed and remanded the matter to the Family Part to consider the effect of plaintiffs Social Security disability determination. <em>Id. </em>at 343, 781 A.2d 1112. However, the holding in <em>Golian </em>was explicitly restricted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\"><em>In the circumstances of this case, </em>we hold that the SSA adjudication of disability constitutes a prima facie showing that plaintiff is disabled, and therefore unable to be gainfully employed, and the burden shifts to defendant to refute that presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">[344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 342-43 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>By contrast, defendant here was not involved in the SSA proceedings, had no input with respect to the determination of disability, and did not submit any defense medical reports to the ALJ. Accordingly, plaintiffs reliance on <em>Golian </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Lastly, the SSA determination is unduly prejudicial and is likely to mislead the jury under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403 (relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of [ ] undue prejudice, confusion of issues, or, misleading the jury____\u201d). \u201cThe admission of public officials\u2019 fact findings from a hearing present special problems [because] ... [t]he admission of such findings may be significantly more prejudicial than those in a public official\u2019s own report, yet less probative of the issues to be determined at trial.\u201d Steven P. Grossman &amp; Stephen J. Shapiro, <em>The Admission of Government Fact Findings Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(C): Limiting the Dangers of Unreliable Hearsay, 38 U. Kan. L.Rev. </em>767, 777 (1990). Such a determination \u201cadds nothing to the jury\u2019s deliberation, other than the conclusion of another fact finder arrived at through a process similar to the one that the trial is undergoing.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Given our conclusion that the SSA disability determination was properly excluded by the trial judge, we have no need to address the remainder of plaintiffs arguments, which we determine are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). With respect to plaintiffs argument that she should have been permitted to cross-examine defendant\u2019s experts with the \u201ccontrary conclusions\u201d of the SSA, we add only that the argument assumes that the determination would be otherwise admissible, which we hold it is not. Also, it is generally improper to cross-examine an expert about inadmissible hearsay documents upon which the expert has not relied in forming his opinion. <em>See Corcoran v. Sears Roebuck and Co., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 130, 711 A.2d 371 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Because defendant has not cross-appealed from the trial judge\u2019s ruling that he \u201copened the door\u201d to the SSA determination by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>closing argument, we have no occasion to review that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\"> \"Radiculopathy\u201d is a \"disorder of the spinal nerve roots.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>1622 (28th ed.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> \u201cThe 1991 Supreme Court Committee Comment to this Rule makes clear that 'other law' refers to statutory and constitutional law.\u201d Biunno, Weissbard &amp; Zegas, <em>Current N.J.
