The Association maintains it is not a public agency; therefore, OPRA did not require it to permit plaintiff to inspect its records. The trial court agreed and dismissed plaintiffs verified complaint to compel access. As we conclude that the Association is a public agency under OPRA, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">In order to determine whether the Association is a \u201cpublic agency\u201d under OPRA, we must review in some detail the Association\u2019s powers, funding, and mission, as set forth in relevant statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">The Association was established pursuant to an 1885 statute. <em>L. </em>1885, c. 122, \u00a7 24. The Association was organized by the several incorporated local firemen\u2019s relief associations, whose mission was to provide assistance to indigent firefighters and their families. <em>Ibid. </em>The Association was authorized to conduct an annual convention, and to oversee activities of the local associations. <em>L. </em>1885, c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>122, \u00a7\u00a7 26-28. The local associations were funded with the direct payment of a tax on premiums of fire insurance companies not organized under New Jersey law, but doing business here. <em>L. </em>1885, c. 240, \u00a7 1. The amount collected was deemed part of the reciprocal tax collected by the State\u2019s tax authorities. <em>L. </em>1885, c. 240, \u00a7 8. Local associations were required to file an annual report of their organization\u2019s officers and finances with the State and the Association. <em>L. </em>1885, c. 122, \u00a7 28. The Association in turn was required to report to the State regarding local associations\u2019 compliance with the law. <em>L. </em>1885, c. 122, \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The powers and role of the Association changed over time, as a result of amendatory statutes, Department of Banking and Insurance regulations, and a judicial decision, <em>Szabo v. New Jersey State Firemen\u2019s Association, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 553 A.2d 371 (Ch.Div.1988). The plaintiff in <em>Szabo </em>alleged the mechanism for funding the Association and local associations was an unconstitutional donation of money under <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. VIII, \u00a7 3, \u00b6 3, and the grant of power to the Association was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, contrary to <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. IV, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1. <em>Szabo, supra, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 268-69, 553 A.2d 371. Szabo claimed the Association was a \u201c\u2018private\u2019 rather than a public body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285 n. 15, 553 A.2d 371. \u201cDefendant [the Association] dispute[d] that characterization.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The court did not decide whether the Association was a private or public body. <em>Ibid. </em>The court construed the statute governing the local associations, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-1 to -39, and the Association, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:17\u201440 to \u201447, to avoid a constitutional challenge. The court required the Association to adopt regulations governing the local associations\u2019 benefit decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 290, 553 A.2d 371. The court also required greater State governmental oversight of the Association and local associations. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 553 A.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The Association was later delegated expanded powers to oversee and regulate the activities of local associations. The governance of local associations must comply with rules and regulations adopted by the Association\u2019s executive committee. <em>L. </em>1996, c. 151, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u00a7 8, <em>codified at N.J.S.A </em>43:17-10. Decisions by local associations regarding requests for financial assistance shall also comply with the executive committee\u2019s rules and regulations. <em>L. </em>1996, <em>c. </em>151, \u00a7 21, <em>codified at N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-24. The Association has the power to seize control of a local association\u2019s assets and management if the local association violates the law or the Association\u2019s regulations. <em>L. </em>1996, c. 151, \u00a7 24, <em>codified at N.J.S.A </em>43:17-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The Association also exercises oversight over the expenses incurred by local associations at the Association\u2019s annual convention. <em>L. </em>1996, c. 151, \u00a7 25, <em>codified at N.J.S.A </em>43:17-29. The Association is expressly authorized to make direct benefit payments. <em>L. </em>1996, c. 151, \u00a7 33, <em>codified at N.J.SA </em>43:17-41. Even before this enactment, the Association in practice directly administered burial fund benefits, generally without regard to financial need. <em>See Szabo, supra, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 273, 275, 553 A.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Insurers not organized under New Jersey law or their agents are now required to pay the two percent tax on fire insurance premiums directly to the Association, which it then disburses to local associations, and as benefit payments. <em>L. </em>1997, c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, <em>codified at N.J.S.A. </em>54:18-1 and -2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Likewise, agents of surplus lines carriers are required to pay the three percent tax on fire insurance premiums directly to the Association. <em>L. </em>2009, <em>c. </em>75, \u00a7 4, <em>codified at N.J.SA. </em>17:22-6.59.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Association in turn disburses funds to the local associations in proportion to the premiums collected in the municipality served by the local associa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>tion. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:18-2; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>ll:l-38.5(a)(3). The Association\u2019s executive committee \u201cshall have the supervision and power of control of the funds\u201d of local associations and shall report to the Banking and Insurance Commissioner whether local associations have complied with the law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-45. Only local associations in compliance may receive their share of premium tax revenue. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The Department of Banking and Insurance codified procedures for the review and auditing of local associations\u2019 financial reports. <em>See </em>28 <em>N.J.R. </em>1384(a) (Mar. 4,1996) (adopting regulations, codified at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:1-38.1 to -6, governing the Association\u2019s oversight of local associations). The rules were intended to \u201chelp ensure that monies in the possession of and under the control of the Firemen\u2019s Relief Associations are properly expended for public purposes reasonably related to the benevolent programs that they conduct, in accordance with the intent of the Legislature and the decision of the court in <em>Szabo.\u201d </em>27 <em>N.J.R. </em>635 (Feb. 21,1995). In its regulatory flexibility analysis, the Department characterized the local associations as \u201cquasi-public entities created by statute[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Surplus lines producers are required to report fire premiums and taxes payable to the State Association and the Insurance Department. <em>SeeN.J.A.C. </em>11:19-3.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The Association also disburses revenues\u2014generated by premiums collected in municipalities that lack a local association\u2014in support of the New Jersey Firemen\u2019s Home (Firemen\u2019s Home). <em>L. </em>1997, c. 41, \u00a7 7, <em>codified at N.J.S.A </em>54:18-8. The Association is authorized to approve or disapprove funding of capital projects for the Firemen\u2019s Home, subject to appeal and review by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. <em>Ibid. </em>Previously, funds for the Firemen\u2019s Home were paid to the State Treasurer, who disbursed them to the Firemen\u2019s Home.

The Association maintains a private pension plan for its employees, which is not a part of any public pension system, such as the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System. There has been at least one significant reported instance- of misconduct involving the handling of the Association\u2019s funds. <em>See State v. Pulasty, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>356, 358, 642 A.2d 1392 (1994) (describing indictment charging Association\u2019s treasurer with embezzling over $600,000 from the Association, and the defendant\u2019s 1986 guilty plea to second-degree theft by deception).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Although we ground our decision principally on the Association\u2019s statutory powers, we also rely on undisputed facts regarding the Association\u2019s activities. The Association includes 538 local associations, representing over 76,000 volunteer and career firefighters. To qualify for benefits under the General Relief Fund, a firefighter must be between the ages of eighteen and forty-five at the time of joining. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-9. In order to qualify for a burial benefit, a firefighter must have served seven years, and answered sixty percent of the alarms in his or her municipality over a designated time period. <em>See Szabo, supra, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 284, 553 A.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The Association disbursed over $7.6 million for 799 burial benefit claims in 2010. The benefits ranged in 2011 from $6000 to $10,000\u2014depending on years of qualified service. However, when a death occurred in the line of duty, the burial benefit was tripled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The local associations paid just under $5 million in relief payments in 2010. Also, the local associations incurred almost $2.5 million in expenses for the annual Association convention that year.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the revenue side, almost $25 million in premium tax receipts were distributed in 2010. Total assets of the local associations in 2010 exceeded $144 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Plaintiff is a life -member of the Association. In September 2011, he asked the Association for an OPRA records request form, and requested access to pension records of the Association\u2019s executive committee members, and bills for legal services the Association received in March 2011. The Association responded it was not a \u201cpublic agency\u201d and therefore was not subject to OPRA requirements. Although the Association provided plaintiff some of the requested documents based on his membership status, it did not provide an OPRA form and refused access to the individual pension records of the executive committee. Plaintiff then filed his verified complaint against the Association. He alleged the Association failed to respond timely to his document request; failed to have a required request form and designated records custodian; and violated OPRA by denying access to records. He also alleged a common law right of access to records, which is not a subject of his appeal. The court entered an order compelling the Association to show cause on January 6, 2012 why requested relief should not be granted. In response, the Association moved to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">After hearing oral argument on the return date, the court entered an order on February 17, 2012 dismissing the complaint. The court concluded in a written decision that OPRA did not govern the Association. The court rejected plaintiffs principal argument that the Association was a public agency because it was an instrumentality created by a combination of political subdivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>sions. The court denied a motion to reconsider, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The sole issue before us is whether the Association is a \u201cpublic agency\u201d under OPRA. If the Association is not a \u201cpublic agency,\u201d then it is not subject to the obligations under OPRA to promulgate a records request form, <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:lA-5(f); to designate a records custodian, <em>see N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-1.1; or to provide public access to records not governed by an exemption. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1, - 1.1, -9, and -10.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We review this legal question de novo. <em>See Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm, of Twp. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995) (\u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d); <em>see also K.L. v.

The terms also mean any political subdivision of the State or combination of political subdivisions, and any division, board, bureau, office, commission or other instrumentality within or created by a political subdivision of the State or combination of political subdivisions, and any independent authority, commission, instrumentality or agency created by a political subdivision or combination of political subdivisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">[N.J.S.A 47:1A-1.1]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Reading the provision in light of the Legislature\u2019s intent, we conclude that the Association is an \u201cindependent State ... instrumentality\u201d subject to OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>We do not write on a clean slate. Our Supreme Court has, in three cases, provided guidance for determining whether an entity is encompassed by the \u201cpublic agency\u201d definition. In <em>Sussex Commons Associates, LLC v. Rutgers, the State University, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>531, 46 A.3d 536 (2012), the Court determined that while Rutgers and its law schools were public agencies whose records were subject to OPRA, a law school environmental law clinic was not. In <em>Fair Share Housing Center, Incorporated v. New Jersey State League of Municipalities, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>489, 504, 25 A.3d 1063 (2011), the Court held that the League of Municipalities, a nonprofit, unincorporated association, created pursuant to statute to secure concerted action by municipalities, was a public agency, even if the League did not perform a \u201ctraditional governmental task.\u201d In <em>The Times of Trenton Publishing Corporation v. Lafayette Yard Community Development Corporation, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>519, 535-36, 874 A.2d 1064 (2005), the Court held that a private, nonprofit corporation authorized to issue tax exempt bonds, and redevelop an urban site, was a public agency; it was controlled by the city, and created with its essential approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The Court has been guided by the statutory command that OPRA \u201c \u2018shall be construed in favor of the public\u2019s right of access.\u2019 \u201d <em>League of Municipalities, supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 501, 25 A.3d 1063 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1). Where the statute is unclear, the Court has construed it in a way consistent with its broad purpose. <em>Rutgers, supra, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>at 541, 46 A.3d 536; <em>cf. League of Municipalities, supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 502, 25 A.3d 1063. \u201cOPRA\u2019s clear purpose ... is \u2018to maximize public knowledge about public affairs in order to ensure an informed citizenry and to minimize the evils inherent in a secluded process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Educ. Law Ctr. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>274, 284, 966 A.2d 1054 (2009) (quoting <em>Mason v. City of Hoboken, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>51, 64, 951 A.2d 1017 (2008)). \u201cOPRA\u2019s promise of accessible public records enables \u2018citizens and the media [to] play a watchful role in curbing wasteful government spending and guarding against corruption and misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rutgers, supra, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>at 541, 46 A.3d 536 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>(quoting <em>Burnett v. Cnty. of Bergen, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>408, 414, 968 A.2d 1151 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The Court has acknowledged that the definition of \u201cpublic agency\u201d is broad. <em>Rutgers, supra, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 46 A.3d 536. Moreover, a court must look behind the technical form of an entity to consider its substantive attributes. The cases demonstrate that determining whether an entity is a public agency involves a fact-sensitive inquiry. The Court in <em>Lafayette Yard, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 535, 874 A.2d 1064, refused to focus on the fact that the redevelopment corporation technically was incorporated by private citizens. The Court stated that to do so would \u201celevate form over substance to reach a result that subverts the broad reading of OPRA as intended by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In <em>League of Municipalities, supra, </em>the Court noted that OPRA did not define \u201cinstrumentality\u201d of the State or a political subdivision, as used in the \u201cpublic agency\u201d definition. 207 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 25 A.3d 1063. The Court assigned it the generally accepted meaning as \u201c \u2018[a] thing used to achieve an end or purpose\u2019 and, alternatively, as \u2018[a] means or agency through which a function of another entity is accomplished, such as a branch of a governing body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>814 (8th ed.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The Court expressly noted that OPRA, unlike the Open Public Meetings Act (OPMA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-6 to -21, enacted before it, does not expressly require that an entity perform a traditional governmental function to qualify as a public agency. <em>Id. </em>at 505-06, 25 A.3d 1063. \u201cThe definition of \u2018public agency\u2019 is far more encompassing [than \u201cpublic body\u201d under OPMA] and specifically lacks a governmental-function test. The more sweeping language of \u2018public agency\u2019 interdicts creative efforts that might thwart the public\u2019s efforts to access governmental records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, 25 A.3d 1063 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">It may be sufficient to establish that an entity was created and controlled by a political subdivision. In <em>League of Municipalities, supra, </em>the Court found it sufficient that the municipalities created the League as their instrumentality. <em>Id. </em>at 503-04, 25 A.3d 1063. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The Court in <em>Lafayette Yard, supra, </em>found it dispositive that the City of Trenton controlled the redevelopment corporation, and it could only have been created with the city\u2019s approval. 183 <em>N.J. </em>at 535-36, 874 A.2d 1064; see <em>also League of Municipalities, supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 507, 25 A.3d 1063 (stating that in <em>Lafayette Yard, </em>\u201c[t]he creation test, not the governmental-function test, controlled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The <em>League of Municipalities </em>Court viewed proof that an entity performs a public governmental function to be an \u201cadditional qualification\u201d in OPMA that was not imported into OPRA. 207 <em>N.J. </em>at 506, 25 A.3d 1063. While proof of governmental function is not necessary to qualify an entity as a public agency, the Court did not preclude the possibility that such proof would be relevant and perhaps sufficient to qualify the entity. Indeed, one of OPRA\u2019s principal aims is to improve governmental operations through public access. \u201cBy its very terms, OPRA seeks to promote the public interest by granting citizens access to documents that record the workings of government in some way. That important aim helps serve as a check on government action.\u201d <em>Rutgers, supra,, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>at 546, 46 A.3d 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In <em>Rutgers, </em>the Court considered significant that \u201c[cjlinical legal programs ... do not perform any government functions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Also pertinent, neither the University nor any government agency \u201ccontrolled] the manner in which clinical professors and their students praetice[d] law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547, 46 A.3d 536. Consequently, the Court concluded public access would not further OPRA\u2019s purposes. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cUnlike a request for documents about the funding of a clinic or its professors\u2019 salaries, which are discoverable under OPRA, case-related records would not shed light on the operation of government or expose misconduct or wasteful government spending.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>On the other hand, disclosure would undermine the goals and effectiveness of clinical education. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the Association\u2019s formation, structure, and function render it a public agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>under OPRA. Although organized by delegates of the local associations, <em>L. </em>1885, c. 122, \u00a7 24, to say the Association is merely a creature of private non-profit relief associations is as misleading as characterizing the redevelopment corporation in <em>Lafayette Yard </em>as a creation of local citizens. The Association owes its existence to state law, which authorized its creation, granted it powers, including powers over local associations, and barred the creation of a competing state association. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The Association\u2019s financial activities implicate OPRA\u2019s aim to shed light on the fiscal affairs of government, and to combat waste, misconduct and corruption. The Association is the direct recipient of substantial revenues generated from specific taxes imposed on insurance premiums. It is delegated authority to assure those funds are spent in accord with statutory strictures. It disburses funds directly in the form of burial benefits, and both regulates and oversees the disbursement of relief benefits by local associations to which it distributes funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In a formal opinion, the Attorney General relied on a volunteer fire company\u2019s receipt of substantial municipal financial support in determining that the fire company was an \u201cagency\u201d or \u201cauthority\u201d of a municipality, and'a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d of the State under the Destruction of Public Records Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:3-15 to -32. Attorney General Formal Opinion No. 5-1964 (Formal Opinion). The absence of a legislative response to an Attorney General\u2019s formal opinion \u201cstrongly suggests that the views expressed therein were consistent with the legislative intent.\u201d <em>State v. Son, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>549, 555, 432 A.2d 947 (App.Div.1981) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The Formal Opinion is particularly persuasive because the Destruction of Public Records Law applies to \u201cpublic records\u201d received for filing, indexing or reproduced by \u201cany officer, commission, agency or authority of the State or of any political subdivision thereof!.]\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>47:3-16. This language closely mirrors that of OPRA\u2019s definition of \u201cgovernment records.\u201d Here, the Association receives substantial financial support from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>public. Nearly $25 million in premium tax receipts were distributed in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The management of these revenues and expenditures\u2014and the management of the accumulated assets exceeding $100 million\u2014is an issue of public interest that OPRA was intended to address. The Association\u2019s financial management in turn is subject to the oversight of both the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance and the State Treasurer. Its benefit decisions are also subject to judicial review. The past instance of embezzlement of these publicly-sourced funds reinforces our conclusion that subjecting the Association to OPRA would fulfill the legislative intent to inform citizens interested in combating misconduct and corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We reject as specious the Association\u2019s argument that it does not receive tax revenues. Beginning in 1885, the Legislature has recognized that the Association and local associations were beneficiaries of a tax, and the statutes so expressly state. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>54:18-2 (stating that the Association\u2019s treasurer \u201cshall allocate the tax monies received to the appropriate local firemen\u2019s relief association\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:18A-2 (stating that \u201ctaxes paid to the treasurer of any firemen\u2019s relief association\u201d shall be included in the tax imposed on non-life and non-marine insurance companies); <em>L. </em>1885, c. 240, explanatory note to \u00a7 1 (describing payment to relief associations as a \u201ctax on premiums\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Our courts have also recognized that the Association \u201cis the recipient of tax moneys from the State of New Jersey.]\u201d <em>Taffey, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 353-54, 192 <em>A. </em>725. Indeed, in a prior case, the Association apparently argued that its revenues are taxes. <em>Magnus, supra, </em>14 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>at 428, 185 <em>A. </em>658 (noting \u201c[ajppellant\u2019s [the Association\u2019s] second point is that the moneys received by it are in the nature of tax moneys\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Further support that the Association is a public agency is found by examining the Association\u2019s functions. The Association serves numerous governmental functions aside from the receipt and management of tax revenues. It provides welfare benefits to a significant number of public servants\u2014paid and volunteer fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>fighters. Like other governmental relief and benefit programs, the benefits provide rewards and incentives for individuals who choose to serve their communities as firefighters. The Association also regulates the activities of other corporate entities\u2014the local associations\u2014and can exercise the power to seize a local association\u2019s assets. In these respects, it is reasonable to apply the definition of \u201cinstrumentality\u201d that the Court used in <em>League of Municipalities, supra, </em>that is, the Association is \u201cused to achieve an end or purpose,\u201d of the State, or is \u201c[a] means ... through which a function [of the State] ... is accomplished.\u201d 207 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 25 A.3d 1063 (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The governmental purpose exists, notwithstanding that most recipients are volunteers, and many recipients serve on fire companies that are not direct units of local government. <em>See Schwartz v. Stockton, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>141, 151, 160 A.2d 1 (1960) (\u2018While such organizations are independent, incorporated as associations not for pecuniary profit, ... they may, and generally do, have definite relationships with municipal governing bodies, ... thereby giving them a kind of semi-official status.\u201d (citation omitted)). Members of volunteer fire companies serve \u201cunder the supervision and control of [a] municipality and in performing fire duty shall be deemed to be exercising a governmental function[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A.T4-68; <em>cf. State v. Quezada, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 953 A.2d 1206 (App.Div.2008) (holding that a volunteer firefighter is a \u201cpublic servant\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:27-l(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Additional evidence of the Association\u2019s public agency status is found in the regulations governing the local associations, which refer to the \u201cpublic purposes reasonably related to the benevolent programs\u201d conducted by the local associations. 27 <em>N.J.R. </em>635. The Department of Banking and Insurance characterized the local associations as \u201cquasi-public entities created by statute.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Association itself previously argued that it was a public body, when faced with a challenge that it was the private recipient of unconstitutional gifts or donations. <em>Szabo, supra, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 285 n. 15, 553 A.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>In sum, the Association, as an independent State instrumentality, is a public agency whose records are subject to inspection under OPRA. Given our conclusion, we need not reach plaintiffs alternative argument that the Association is an independent instrumentality created by a combination of political subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Reversed and remanded.
