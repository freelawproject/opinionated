After review of the parties\u2019 arguments, in light of the record and applicable law, we affirm the orders entered by Judge Raehelle L. Harz on September 9, 2011 denying the parties\u2019 motions. Consequently, the September 23, 2011 Amended Order for Judgment will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">At trial, plaintiff related the facts and circumstances regarding decedent\u2019s condition prior to and on the date of his death. Decedent became ill on September 9, 2007, complaining he felt tired and had a fever. By September 12, his exhaustion persisted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>his temperature had climbed to 103.6 degrees. Decedent also noticed white spots on his throat, felt weak and had no appetite.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Concerned for her husband\u2019s condition, plaintiff called defendant, the family\u2019s physician, and left a voicemail message explaining decedent\u2019s symptoms. Nidia Bedoya, a secretary at defendant\u2019s office, returned plaintiff\u2019s call around 12:30 p.m. Plaintiff restated decedent\u2019s symptoms and, after being placed on hold, again spoke to Bedoya, who explained she \u201cspoke with Dr. Wry, they pulled out [deeedent]\u2019s file, and [Dr. Wry] told me that because he had similar symptoms back in January ... they were going to prescribe him antibiotics, and that he should take th\u00e1t ... to make him feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">According to plaintiff, Bedoya rejected her request for an appointment with Dr. Wry to examine decedent, stating, \u201cDr. Wry was very busy and had no openings for the day, and that she couldn\u2019t see him that day.\u201d Plaintiff asked to speak with defendant directly, but was told \u201cDr. Wry was busy seeing patients and couldn\u2019t come to the phone.\u201d An authorization for a prescription for Augmentin was recorded on decedent\u2019s chart maintained by defendant\u2019s office; however, the chart includes no record of plaintiffs call or any notation of decedent\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Later that afternoon, decedent felt more energetic. He picked up his children from school and stopped by the pharmacy. However, by the time he returned home, between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m., he was pale and weak. Decedent bathed, ate soup, took the Augmentin, and went to sleep around 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Plaintiff checked on decedent at 8:30 p.m., discovered his feet and lips were blotchy and blue, and he was unresponsive. She called 9-1-1 and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Decedent was transported via ambulance to Saint Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Paterson, where he was pronounced dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">An autopsy revealed decedent\u2019s cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia due to focal myocarditis of the right ventricle. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle known to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>cardiac arrhythmia, an electrical instability or abnormality of the heart. If a virus traveling in the bloodstream enters the heart muscle or myocardium, it can infect the heart, causing myocarditis. Typically, myocarditis is asymptomatic; sometimes, however, it is preceded by a viral syndrome, which may include body aches, fever, malaise, and fatigue, and may present symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmia, severe shortness of breath, and simple exhaustion. Focal myocarditis is limited to one, localized area of the heart, as contrasted with acute myocarditis, which is more widespread throughout the heart muscle.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The pathologist performing decedent\u2019s autopsy examined ten tissue samples from decedent\u2019s right heart ventricle and six from his left. Two samples from the right ventricle revealed limited inflammation causing focal necrosis, or \u201ccell death.\u201d No inflammation was found on the left ventricle, supporting the pathologist\u2019s conclusion decedent suffered from focal myocarditis, rather than a widespread inflammation evincing diffuse myocarditis.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Bedoya\u2019s trial testimony explained the policy and practice of defendant\u2019s office. When patients called, they would be offered same-day appointments for sick visits, or \u201c[i]f they couldn\u2019t be seen that day, they\u2019d be offered an appointment for ... the next day.\u201d Also, when a patient \u201cstart[ed] talking about their symptoms and <em>going on, then they </em>would be transferred to a nurse.\u201d Once a call was transferred to a nurse, Bedoya generally \u201cwouldn\u2019t be involved.\u201d She also acknowledged defendant or a nurse would occasionally prescribe a medication over the phone without first examining the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Bedoya had no recollection of this matter. She could not recall speaking with plaintiff, defendant, or a nurse on September 12, 2007, nor whether she had even worked on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Defendant\u2019s testimony confirmed Bedoya\u2019s explanation of office policy regarding patient scheduling, and refuted any suggestion a patient requesting an office visit would be told time was unavailable. Defendant explained the facility \u201callotted time on a schedule\u201d as a matter of practice, \u201cin ease someone called in that day\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>to schedule a sick visit. Defendant asserted a patient presenting with a very high fever, fatigue, and body aches \u201cwould have been told to come in for an appointment[.]\u201d Further, she noted Wednesday was her \u201clate night,\u201d when she would stay \u201c[a]nywhere from 6:30 to 7:30 [p.m.], occasionally, rarely, 8:00 [p.m.,]\u201d thus allocating \u201ceven more time to accommodate sick visits\u201d on that day of the week.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Defendant acknowledged decedent\u2019s file included a note written by Mary Patricia Donnalley, a nurse at the facility, which stated: \u201ccalled [pharmacy for a] new [prescription] for Augmentin 875mg bid x 10 days # 20 no refills per Dr. Wry/M. Donnalley RNBS.\u201d Defendant testified she would prescribe antibiotics without examining a sick patient only \u201cif the patient asked and couldn\u2019t come in[,]\u201d when the patient was \u201cgoing on a trip[,]\u201d or \u201cas a favor\u201d when \u201csomeone pleaded f[or] one[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Both parties also presented extensive expert medical testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff two experts discussed her contention defendant was negligent in failing to examine decedent, obtain a history of his symptoms, or diagnose his heart condition, which warranted follow-up hospital care. Defendant\u2019s three experts refuted the suggestion defendant\u2019s conduct contributed to decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Plaintiff first presented Lionel Grossbard, M.D., an internist, whose practice was devoted primarily to hematology and oncology, not cardiology, with approximately ten to twenty percent devoted to internal medicine. Defendant objected to Dr. Grossbard \u201cgiving opinions about myocarditis[,] either its diagnosis or treatment[,]\u201d asserting he lacked expertise on the subject. The court overruled the objection, concluding Dr. Grossbard held qualifications and foundational knowledge as an expert in the field of internal medicine, and the extent of his familiarity with myocarditis could be explored during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>After his review of the materials, Dr. Grossbard rejected the autopsy findings, instead concluding decedent died of viral myocarditis. Relying on plaintiffs description of events, he noted \u201cpatients with acute myocarditis in whom a myocarditis is due to a virus, there are several days of flulike symptoms[,]\u201d preceding the onset of the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Dr. Grossbard opined defendant deviated from the standard of care for a physician practicing internal medicine when she \u201cprescribed an antibiotic over the phone without any professional speaking to [decedent,]\u201d because the prescribed medication could \u201cmask the underlying disease.\u201d Also, he opined defendant should have examined decedent in light of the expressed symptoms. Dr. Grossbard asserted a physical examination of decedent could have disclosed \u201ccertain abnormalities\u201d pointing to a cardiac problem, such as an irregular heartbeat or rhythm, and possibly muffled sounds related to inflammation in the heart muscle. Once cardiac abnormalities were detected, a hospital referral for an electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood tests would follow and lead \u201cto a diagnosis of a cardiac condition.\u201d Certain blood tests detect troponin, a chemical the heart releases when there is damage to the heart, which a \u201cmajor hospital\u201d will detect \u201cgenerally in about 30 to 60 minutest,]\u201d then admit \u201cthe patient to the cardiac care unit.\u201d Dr. Grossbard reasoned had defendant examined decedent, the chain of events would follow such that \u201cthere [was] a very good chance, significantly greater than 50 percent,\u201d decedent would have survived. Dr. Grossbard concluded defendant\u2019s failure to speak to or examine decedent, under the circumstances increased the risk posed by the disease and was a significant contributing factor causing his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">On cross-examination, Dr. Grossbard clarified his opinion, explaining he \u201cnever\u201d opined defendant \u201cshould have\u201d diagnosed decedent with myocarditis. Rather, he concluded the standard of care required defendant to speak to her patient to take a history of his symptoms and/or examine him. Dr. Grossbard also made clear that the individual acts of prescribing an antibiotic over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>phone and declining to talk to the patient if an office visit were offered, did not, standing alone, represent deviations; however, not talking to the patient and not offering an office visit breached the acceptable standard of care. Finally, he agreed \u201c[i]f the patient were offered a visit and didn\u2019t come in, there would be no deviation\u201d from the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Dr. Grossbard also conceded myocarditis does not always present with an irregular heartbeat, electrocardiogram, abnormalities, or even flu-like symptoms of fever, body aches, and malaise. Further, he conceded the disease was typically difficult to diagnose because it was asymptomatic and insensitive to traditional diagnostic testing. He concurred with the proposition that not all patients suffering from myocarditis have abnormal EKGs and less than thirty-four percent demonstrate low troponin levels. Finally, he acknowledged a \u201chigh percentage\u201d of sudden, unexpected deaths resulted from myocarditis.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Plaintiff also presented Gerald J. Melnick, M.D., an expert in emergency medicine. Dr. Melnick had formal training in the diagnosis and treatment of myocarditis during his one-year, post-medical school internship, and attended continuing medical education lectures on various cardiac pathologies, including myocarditis.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Defendant objected to Dr. Melnick\u2019s testimony on what the likely results of an EKG would have been, had defendant examined decedent and performed the test on September 12, 2007. The court overruled the objection, noting \u201cit\u2019ll be up to the jury to determine the value to place on his testimony based upon his knowledge, skill, and training [i]n this particular area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Dr. Melnick testified \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical probability\u201d that had decedent gone to an emergency room, he would have been tachycardic, which he was reasonably certain would have triggered the need for an EKG, revealing \u201cevidence of the electrical problems from the inflammation[.]\u201d Also, decedent \u201chad significant muscle soreness and pain[,]\u201d which would have alerted an emergency room physician that blood screening tests were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>necessary. Because the autopsy reported \u201cinflammation and ... a degree of ... cardiac muscle damage,\u201d Dr. Melnick projected blood tests likely would have shown elevated cardiac enzymes, including troponin. On cross-examination, Dr. Melnick, like Dr. Grossbard, conceded the diagnostic tests might not have led to the discovery of the myocarditis, because the condition commonly presents asymptomatically.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Defendant\u2019s first expert was Edward Julie, M.D., a cardiologist, whose testimony was limited to decedent\u2019s \u201cclinical presentation and how it relates to the ultimate autopsy diagnosis of myocarditis.\u201d Although acknowledging decedent likely suffered from a systemic virus that traveled through his bloodstream to his heart that was possibly responsible for the myocarditis, Dr. Julie opined a cardiovascular examination of decedent \u201cwould have been normal\u201d because decedent\u2019s physical complaints did not include \u201cchest pain or shortness of breath or palpitations!,]\u201d and the autopsy results showed \u201cfocal inflammation of the right ventricle in a very small area, [with] no generalized involvement of the heart.\u201d Dr. Julie maintained, not only would an exam fail to detect abnormalities, but also had he been examined, decedent\u2019s described symptoms would not have resulted in his hospitalization because they suggested he was suffering from a virus. Dr. Julie emphasized the autopsy results unequivocally showing focal myocarditis that involved only \u201ca small degree\u201d of the heart muscle\u2019s right ventricle. Consequently, he opined, decedent would not show \u201csignificant signs or symptoms\u201d of heart disease; blood work would not have detected elevated troponin levels and an EKG, \u201cwould have been completely normal.\u201d Moreover, decedent\u2019s \u201ccardiac sudden death by no means would have been prevented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Kenneth M. Granet, M.D., an internist, next testified for the defense. Following his review of a document file, he asserted defendant complied with the acceptable standards of care because the \u201coffice procedures and policies in place____ offerfed] somebody who was sick a visit.\u201d He also opined had decedent come into the office for an examination, his \u201cconstellation of symptoms\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>would have supported a diagnosis of a virus and would not have led to further heart examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Defendant\u2019s final expert was Stephen Factor, M.D., an expert in the field of cardiovascular pathology. Dr. Factor analyzed the autopsy samples of decedent\u2019s heart. He concluded cardiac enzyme tests and an EKG would not have revealed the myocarditis \u201cbased on the limited extent of ... inflammation in the ... two out of ten pieces of myocardium from the right ventricle[.]\u201d He explained \u201cthe diagnosis of myocarditis would not have been made clinically\u201d; and even if it were, the outcome would be unchanged because decedent would have suffered \u201csudden death in the hospital ... or in [defendant\u2019s] office, rather than at home.\u201d However, on cross-examination, Dr. Factor admitted it was possible additional samples of decedent\u2019s heart could have shown more widespread inflammation and necrosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">At the close of evidence, defendant moved for a directed verdict, arguing plaintiffs evidence on \u201cthe issue of proximate cause was not supported by ... experts that were appropriately qualified to give that testimony.\u201d The trial judge disagreed and denied the motion. Plaintiff also moved for a directed verdict, arguing defendant failed to present proofs showing \u201capportionment with respect to the ultimate injury[.]\u201d She requested \u201cthe jury be instructed that the defendant has failed to prove that some portion of the plaintiffs ultimate injury would have occurred even if the defendant\u2019s treatment was proper.\u201d After considering the parties\u2019 arguments on this issue, the judge reserved her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The charge explained the jury\u2019s obligation to make credibility determinations for all witnesses, including those qualified as experts. The judge instructed the jurors they were \u201cnot bound by the testimony of an expert\u201d; rather, they were entitled to \u201cgive it whatever weight [they] deem[ed] ... appropriate^\u2019 and accept or reject \u201call or part of an expert\u2019s opinion[ ].\u201d The jury was told that when \u201cexamining each expert\u2019s opinion, you may consider the person\u2019s reasons for testifying ... and the believability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>expert, including all the considerations that generally apply when you are deciding whether or not to believe a witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Addressing the specific facts of the case, the court informed the jury it must determine the applicable standard of care and then consider whether defendant complied with or breached that standard. The judge advised: \u201c[I]f you find that defendant has deviated from the standard of care resulting in injury or damage to plaintiff, then you should find defendant negligent and return a verdict for plaintiff.\u201d The instructions detailed the respective burdens of proof and explained the parties\u2019 theories regarding defendant\u2019s conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">[TJhe plaintiff must first prove that the defendant\u2019s negligence increased the risk of harm posed by plaintiffs preexisting condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">\u201e Second, the plaintiff must prove that the increased risk was a substantial factor in producing the ultimate harm, which was his death. If the negligence was only remotely or insignificantly related to [docedentj\u2019s death, then the negligence does not constitute a substantial factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">However, the defendant\u2019s negligence ... need not be the only cause, or even a primary cause, of his death for the negligence to be a substantial factor in producing the ultimate harm. Whether the increased risk was a substantial factor is to be reflected in the apportionment of damages between the increased risk and the pre-existing condition____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">[Pllaintiff does not have to prove offering the office appointment or having the conversation on the phone with [decedent] would have resulted in avoiding the harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">If you find that the plaintiff has proven that the defendant was negligent, the plaintiff is not required to quantify or put a percentage on the extent to which the defendant\u2019s negligence added to all of plaintiffs final injuries. In cases where the defendant\u2019s negligence accelerated or worsened the plaintiffs pre-existing condition, the defendant is responsible for all of plaintiffs injuries, unless the defendant is able to reasonably apportion the damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">If the defendant claims that all or part of plaintiffs injuries would have occurred anyway, then the defendant and not the plaintiff has the burden of proving what percentage of plaintiffs injuries would have occurred, even if the defendant had not been negligent. If the injuries can be so apportioned, then the defendant is responsible only for the amount of ultimate harm caused by the negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>On the other hand, if you find that the defendant has not met the burden ... of proving that plaintiffs injuries can be reasonably apportioned, then the defendant is responsible for all of plaintiffs harm or injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The jury was given a verdict sheet that included five questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">1) Did the [pjlaintiff, Ozlem Koseoglu, prove that the [defendant, Dr. Wry deviated from accepted standards of medical practice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">2) Did [pjlaintiff, Ozlem Koseoglu, prove that Dr. Wry\u2019s, deviation increased the risk of harm posed by Mr. Koseoglu\u2019s preexisting condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">3) Did the defendant prove that some portion of the plaintiffs ultimate injury would have occurred, even if the defendant\u2019s treatment was proper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">4) State whether the increased risk [was] a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs damages by stating, in percentages, what portion of the ultimate injury is a result from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">A. The pre-existing condition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">B. Dr. Wry\u2019s deviation from the standard of care</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">5) What amount of money would fairly and reasonably compensate each [p]lain-tiff[?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff, responding affirmatively to questions one, two and three. In allocating liability, the jury determined eighty percent of the ultimate injury was related to the pre-existing condition, while twenty percent was a result of defendant\u2019s deviation. The jury valued plaintiffs total loss at $1,000,000, as divided between plaintiff and her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">Plaintiff moved for JNOV, arguing the jury\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s defense of no-increased-risk rendered defendant unable to satisfy her burden regarding apportionment. Accordingly, plaintiff sought to set aside the jury\u2019s allocation of liability in favor of awarding her the entire amount of damages. Defendant filed a cross-motion for JNOV, arguing plaintiffs evidence- was insufficient to establish defendant\u2019s conduct increased the risk of ultimate harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">Judge Harz denied the motions and on September 23, 2011, entered an amended order for judgment in favor of plaintiff in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>amount of $220,254.79, inclusive of pre-judgment interest. These cross-appeals ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Our review of a trial judge\u2019s determination on a motion for JNOV, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:40-2, is \u2018\u201cquite a mechanical one.\u2019\u201d <em>Sons of Thunder v. Borden, Inc., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>396, 415, 690 A.2d 575 (1997) (quoting <em>Dolson v.

Accord Riley v. Keenan, </em>406 <em>N.J.Super. </em>281, 298, 967 A.2d 868 (App.Div.) (citing <em>Lanzet v.

Plaintiff seeks to set aside the apportioned verdict. She argues the evidence established defendant\u2019s negligent treatment increased the risk of decedent\u2019s death from myocarditis, but the defense failed to prove a basis supporting allocation. Accordingly, she asserts, the jury\u2019s finding that eighty percent of the \u201cultimate injury\u201d resulted from the preexisting condition was mere speculation. Defendant maintains plaintiffs medical witnesses lacked expertise to address causation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>and plaintiff otherwise presented no competent, credible proof supporting causation. Understanding these issues are intertwined, we will consider defendant\u2019s claims prior to addressing plaintiffs. We first recite the requirements to sustain a plaintiffs verdict in a medical negligence action involving a pre-existing condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u201cA medical malpractice ease is a Mnd of tort action in which the traditional negligence elements are refined to reflect the professional setting of a physician-patient relationship.\u201d <em>Verdicchio v. Ricca, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>1, 23, 843 A.2d 1042 (2004). Generally, \u201c[t]o establish a prima facie case of negligence in a medical-malpractice action, a plaintiff must present expert testimony establishing (1) the applicable standard of care; (2) a deviation from that standard of care; and (3) that the deviation proximately caused the injury[J\u201d <em>Gardner v.

Therefore, if the witness can be qualified as an expert based on \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or educationf,]\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702, the trial court should allow admission of the testimony for the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>Espinal v.

Dr. Grossbard, an internist like defendant, had encountered myocarditis infrequently, but had diagnosed patients with the disease, and was extensively familiar with medical literature on its diagnosis and treatment. Similarly, Dr. Melnick, a certified emergency medicine physician who was also certified in advanced cardiac and trauma life support, had treated emergency room patients with myocarditis and had formal train<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ing and education regarding the disease. The experts\u2019 training, past experiences, and limited past treatment of patients with myocarditis were subjects thoroughly explored during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Next, defendant argues plaintiffs experts\u2019 opinions regarding causation were speculative and should not have reached the jury. Plaintiffs theory of liability contended defendant was negligent in not offering an appointment to examine decedent. Had defendant done so, plaintiff asserted, she would have been alerted to decedent\u2019s heart-related problems and referred him for hospitalization, where steps could have been taken to diagnose and treat the condition. Both Drs. Grossbard and Melnick addressed how defendant\u2019s omission precluded diagnostic testing that likely would have revealed decedent\u2019s heart arrhythmia. Defendant was decedent\u2019s regular family physician, so she presumably knew he was a young, otherwise healthy man. All the experts agreed decedent\u2019s myocarditis resulted from the viral syndrome. As plaintiff described when she called defendant\u2019s office, decedent\u2019s symptoms, especially his high fever and lack of energy, were significantly persistent and severe. Further, Dr. Grossbard discussed the statistical success of treatment if administered. Whether an examination would have triggered a cardiac diagnosis will never be known because of defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Defendant also suggests her experts were authorities in myocarditis, emphasizing Drs. Julie, Granet, and Factor all agreed the myocarditis was localized to one area of decedent\u2019s heart such that cardiac abnormalities would not have been present even had defendant examined him. Defendant\u2019s challenge is directed to the credibility and weight to be given the experts\u2019 testimonial evidence, two subjects squarely left for the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The jury alone determines whether and how much of an expert\u2019s testimony to accept. \u201cAn expert\u2019s skill or knowledge go to the weight to be accorded the expert testimony.\u201d <em>Espinal, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 59, 916 A.2d 1081 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The weight to which an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>opinion is entitled to receive rests with \u201cthe unique role of the jury[,]\u201d which is charged with assessing the credibility of all witnesses and determining the weight to be given to their testimony. <em>City of Long Branch v. Jui Yung Liu, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>464, 491, 4 A.3d 542 (2010). <em>See also Espinal, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 59, 916 A.2d 1081 (\u201cDeficiencies in the qualification of an expert is a matter to be weighed by the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Drs. Grossbard\u2019s and Melnick\u2019s substantive testimony relied upon foundational facts from plaintiffs testimony and decedent\u2019s autopsy. Each opined on defendant\u2019s conduct and what would likely have transpired had decedent been examined by defendant when plaintiff called for an appointment. They sufficiently explained the bases for their conclusions that defendant\u2019s negligence deprived decedent of a chance to survive myocarditis. Viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiff, the properly admitted expert testimony provided sufficient evidence for the jury to find there was an increased risk of the ultimate injury resulting from defendant\u2019s negligence, which was a substantial factor in contributing to decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Citing <em>Verdicchio, supra, </em>plaintiff challenges the proof supporting the allocation of damages. She asserts the judge erred in denying her motion for JNOV seeking to disregard the jury\u2019s verdict on the third jury question. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">We note the jury instructions and interrogatories are taken from our Model Civil Jury Charges. <em>See Model Jury Charge (Civil), </em>5.50E, \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u2014Increased Risk/Loss of Chance\u2014Proximate Cause\u201d (2010). The jury charge clearly described plaintiffs burden of proof and the jury found defendant deviated from the accepted standard of care, which increased the risk of harm posed by decedent\u2019s pre-existing myocarditis. The first two jury questions on the verdict sheet were directed to these issues. Question three then asked the jury to determine whether defendant showed some portion of the ultimate harm would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>occurred anyway. Notwithstanding this shift away from plaintiffs proofs, plaintiff retained the burden to show defendant\u2019s negligent deviation, which increased the risk of harm, was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs harm. <em>Verdicchio, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 24, 843 A.2d 1042.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We also reject plaintiffs argument challenging, as unsupported, the jury\u2019s finding defendant successfully proved some portion of the ultimate injury would have resulted despite defendant\u2019s negligence. Notwithstanding the principal defense advocating defendant\u2019s conduct was not a substantial factor contributing to decedent\u2019s death, sufficient evidence was presented to allow the jury to determine whether and to what extent defendant\u2019s negligence contributed to the ultimate harm. Further, we concur with Judge Harz\u2019s distinction between the problematic expert testimony in <em>Verdicchio </em>and the testimony in this matter by Drs. Julie, Granet, and Factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The defense experts relied on plaintiffs report that decedent was not <em>experiencing </em>chest pains, along with the autopsy findings, to support their conclusion decedent\u2019s myocarditis was so localized that cardiac abnormalities would not have been evident even had defendant examined him. Dr. Factor detailed his actual review of the autopsy tissue samples and discussed his findings of a very small necrotic area in the right ventricle, which would not have caused an abnormal EKG. Unlike the \u201cwholly eonclusory\u201d inade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>quate expert testimony in <em>Verdicchio, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 37-38, 843 A.2d 1042, the defense experts presented opinions supported by detailed facts, which allowed the jury to weigh the loss attributable to defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Despite plaintiffs urging that defendant was solely liable for decedent\u2019s death, it was undisputed decedent suffered from myocarditis when he sought treatment from defendant. Even plaintiffs experts agreed myocarditis can be asymptomatic, making it difficult to diagnose, which is why it often results in death. Also, decedent\u2019s symptoms did not include typical heart-related signs, such as chest pains and shortness of breath. These facts support apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Defendant\u2019s trial strategy\u2014suggesting the ultimate outcome would have been unchanged had she given decedent an appointment and conducted an examination\u2014does not alter the hotly contested question of whether an office visit would have revealed decedent had more than the flu. The experts disagreed on whether decedent\u2019s symptoms would trigger further consideration of a heart condition. Such a determination was not clear-cut, but was at the heart of the jury\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Not surprisingly, the jury took \u201ca more moderate position than propounded by either of the parties,\u201d and chose to \u201caccept or reject so much of each side\u2019s evidence as it found credible or not credible.\u201d <em>Boryszewski, supra, </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 384-85, 882 A.2d 410. The jury\u2019s partial rejection of defendant\u2019s evidence does not mean defendant failed to meet her burden of proof on the issue of apportionment. Rather, it reflects the jury\u2019s diligent response to the court\u2019s proper instructions to discern whether the ultimate outcome would have occurred had defendant not been negligent. The jury exercised its responsibility to consider all evidence, fix credibility, accept or reject the testimony presented, and decide all material issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">As noted by Judge Harz, the record reflects defendant presented sufficient evidence to allow the jury to rationally and fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>quantify the percentage of damages proximately caused by defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>See Dafler v. Raymark Indus., Inc., </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>17, 36, 611 A.2d 136 (App.Div.1992), <em>aff'd o.b. </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>96, 622 A.2d 1305 (1993). Accordingly, we conclude there is no basis to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict. The orders denying the motions for JNOV were properly denied, and the final judgment remains unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-13\"> Plaintiff also presented a survivorship claim that was dismissed, without objection, at the close of evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\"> Plaintiff also presented an expert economist regarding the economic loss, which we need not discuss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\"> As an observation, the Model Charge recites each element of plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof, including a plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove defendant deviated from the accepted standard of care, which increased the risk of harm posed by decedent\u2019s pre-existing condition, and defendant's negligent act constitutes a substantial factor in causing the harm. However, we cannot explain why the jury interrogatories separate these elements of a plaintiff\u2019s case. As noted questions one and two reflect the first two elements a plaintiff must prove, then question three shifts to defendant\u2019s proofs. More important, question four conflates defendant's obligation with respect to apportionment of damages with plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove defendant's negligence was a substantial factor in the resultant harm. Although not an issue in this case, the jury interrogatories as drafted, and consequently as used by trial courts, seem problematic and likely to misdirect the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
