Among his other claims, defendant argues that his written rejection of PCR counsel for his initial PCR petition did not conform to the constitutionally required knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel. The State argues that defendant did not have a constitutional right to counsel. Because defendant was precluded from raising the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, we agree that he had a constitutional right to effective counsel at his initial PCR hearing, and that his written request to represent himself was insufficient to waive counsel. We therefore reverse and remand for appointment of counsel and consideration of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">Defendant was convicted by a jury of first-degree aggravated sexual assault upon a six-year-old child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(l), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>and various other related charges. He was sentenced to an aggregate term of twenty-eight years in prison subject to the provisions of the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2. In an unpublished opinion we affirmed his conviction, indicating that we would not decide the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel as it was more properly raised in a PCR petition. <em>State v. Quixal, </em>No. A-5879-07, 2010 <em>WL </em>5419109 (App.Div. Apr. 19, 2010). We remanded for resentencing to allow the judge to explain further why he imposed consecutive sentences. <em>Id. </em>(slip op. at 6). The Supreme Court denied certification. <em>State v. Quixal, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>94, 999 A.2d 463 (2010). Defendant was subsequently resentenced to the same term on June 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Defendant worked at a garden center where he sexually assaulted the victim when her mother brought her along to have some plants repotted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Immediately after the incident, the victim told her mother that defendant had kissed her on the lips and licked her, pointing to her vaginal area. Subsequent forensic testing confirmed DNA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the victim\u2019s underwear that matched defendant\u2019s DNA. Defendant was immediately arrested at the garden center and admitted to the police that he sexually assaulted the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In December 2010, defendant filed his first PCR petition. On February 14, 2011, the judge\u2019s law clerk wrote defendant a letter advising him of his right to counsel and instructing him in detail how to apply for the appointment of a public defender. Defendant was told that he could also represent himself if he notified the court in writing of his desire to do so. Five weeks later defendant wrote back, rejecting the offer of legal assistance from the public defender and seeking to represent himself. He also requested that his application be heard \u201con the papers.\u201d He signed a waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>of his right to be present in court. His PCR petition was denied, and defendant did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In March 2012 defendant filed a second PCR petition alleging that his first petition, which he claimed raised \u201cfrivolous\u201d issues, had been prepared and filed by an unnamed fellow inmate without his consent. The judge concluded that \u201cthere was no good cause entitling the assignment of counsel on the application____\u201d <em>See R. </em>3:22-6(b) (\u201cUpon any second or subsequent petition filed pursuant to this Rule attacking the same conviction, the matter shall be assigned to the Office of the Public Defender only upon application therefor and showing of good cause.\u201d). Defendant did not deny signing the waiver of appearance for his first PCR petition but claimed that because he did not speak English and was not well-educated, his first petition was \u201cimproperly fil[ed].\u201d The judge denied this second PCR petition because he determined that defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the first petition was not available to a defendant who had represented himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">On appeal defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\"><em>POINT I: </em>DEFENDANT MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF <em>[RULE </em>] 3:22-4(b) AND THEREFORE THE PCR COURT ERRED BY BARRING THE DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\"><em>POINT II: </em>THE DEFENDANT WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL GUARANTEED BY THE SIXTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE 1 PARAGRAPH 10 OF THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-11\">A. DEFENDANT WAS DEPRIVED OF THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL, AS COUNSEL FAILED TO ARGUE THAT BASED UPON DEFENDANT\u2019S VIDEOTAPED STATEMENT HE WAS NOT GUILTY OF AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT BECAUSE HE KISSED [THE VICTIM] \u201cABOVE\u201d AND NOT \u201cON\u201d THE VAGINA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-12\">B. COUNSEL FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATE THE SCENE OF THE ALLEGED CRIME, AND VERIFY WHETHER THERE WERE CAMERAS THAT MAY HAVE CAPTURED WHAT TRULY OCCURRED IN THE AREA OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-13\">C. COUNSEL FAILED TO OBTAIN READ[I]LY AVAILABLE WITNESSES THAT WERE WILLING TO TESTIFY THAT THE ARRESTING OFFICERS HAD PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED THE DEFENDANT AT THE SCENE OF THE ALLEGED CRIME.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The legal principles that govern our analysis of a defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel are settled. <em>State v. Parker, </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>269, 279, 58 A.3d 652 (2012) (citing <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 58, 519 A.2d 336 (1987)). To prevail on such a claim, not only must a defendant overcome a \u201cstrong presumption that [defense] counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance[,]\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 689, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2065, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674, 694 (1984), but defendant must also prove that counsel\u2019s performance was \u201cdeficient\u201d and \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 693. <em>See also United States v. Cronic, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>648, 653-57, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2039, 2043-46, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>657, 664-67 (1984) (discussing the requirements of effective counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Defendant argues for renewed consideration pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:22-4 because his representation on his first PCR was ineffective. <em>R. </em>3:22-4(b)(2)(C). <em>\u201cRule </em>3:22-6(d) imposes an independent standard of professional conduct upon an attorney representing a defendant in a PCR proceeding.\u201d <em>State v. Hicks, </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 376, 986 A.2d 690 (App.Div.2010); <em>see also State v. Webster, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>254, 257, 901 A.2d 338 (2006) (stating that PCR counsel must investigate claims urged by a client and \u201cshould advance all of the legitimate arguments that the record will support\u201d); <em>State v. Rue, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18, 811 A.2d 425 (2002) (recognizing \u201cthe critical nature of faithful and robust representation of a defendant at a PCR proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Ineffective assistance of counsel is unavailable, however, to a defendant who represents himself. <em>State v. Crisafi, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>499, 509, 608 A.2d 317 (1992). The Court Rules provide that an individual bringing a first PCR will be assigned to the Office of the Public Defender \u201cunless [a] defendant affirmatively states an intention to proceed pro se,\u201d as defendant did here in writing. <em>R. </em>3:22-6(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Defendant argues that his waiver of counsel for his first PCR was not knowing and intelligent. As Judge Baime wrote in enforcing the right to counsel to argue a motion for a new trial, based in part on ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">Both the federal and State constitutions guarantee the right to an attorney in a criminal case. <em>U.S. Const. </em>Amend. VI; <em>N.J. Const </em>Art. 1, \u00b6 10. The right to counsel \u201cconstitutes a vital ingredient of due process, tracing its paternity to the landmark case of <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 <em>U.S. </em>45, 53 <em>S.Ct </em>55, 77 <em>L.Ed, </em>158 (1932).\u201d <em>State v. Slattery, </em>[239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>534, 543-44, 571 A.2d 1314] (App.Div.1990). Since very early times, New Jersey has given strong recognition to an accused\u2019s right to an attorney. <em>See Rodriguez v. Rosenblatt, </em>[58 <em>N.J. </em>281, 285, 277 A.2d 216] (1971). The guarantee was included in our earliest organic law, <em>see N.J. Const, of 1776 </em>art. XVI, and appeared in our nascent statutes as well. <em>See [Slattery, supra, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 544, 571 A.2d 1314] (citing Act of March 6, 1795 <em>(Paterson, Laws </em>162 (1800))). The right to counsel recognizes the obvious but important truth that \u201cthe average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty____\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 <em>U.S. </em>458, 462-63, 58 <em>S.Ct. </em>1019, 1022, 82 <em>L.Ed. </em>1461, 1465-66 (1938). The assistance of counsel \u201cis essential to ensuring fairness and due process in criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>[Crisafi, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 509, 608 A.2d 317]. Other rights afforded to an accused would have little meaning without the benefit of counsel because often they cannot be secured and implemented without the guiding hand of an attorney. <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\"><em>[State v.

Sanchez, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>261, 274, 609 A.2d 400 (1992) (holding that after being indicted and before being arraigned, the State could not initiate a conversation with a defendant without defense counsel\u2019s consent). Our Supreme Court extended <em>Sanchez </em>to apply to juveniles once a complaint has been filed by the State. <em>State ex rel. P.M.P., </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>166, 169, 975 A.2d 441 (2009). In doing so, it noted that <em>Sanchez </em>reflects that \u201cour state constitution guaranteed the right to counsel before the adoption of the Sixth Amendment and that New Jersey has provided counsel for indigent defendants since 1795.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 975 A.2d 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>A criminal defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment must be knowing and intelligent. <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>168, 173, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>944, 948, 79 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>122, 130 (1984); <em>see also Crisafi, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 509, 608 A.2d 317. As our Supreme Court elaborated in <em>Crisafi, </em>and summarized in <em>State v. DuBois, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>454, 468-69, 916 A.2d 450 (2007), when determining whether to allow a defendant to represent himself, a trial judge should inform the defendant of several considerations. In particular, the judge ordinarily should address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">(1) the nature of the charges, statutory defenses, and possible range of punishment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">(2) the technical problems associated with self-representation and the risks if the defense is unsuccessful; (3) the necessity that defendant comply with the rules of criminal procedure and the rules of evidence; (4) the fact that the lack of knowledge of the law may impair defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself or herself; (5) the impact that the dual role of counsel and defendant may have; (6) the reality that it would be unwise not to accept the assistance of counsel; (7) the need for an open-ended discussion so that the defendant may express an understanding in his or her own words; (8) the fact that, if defendant proceeds pro se, he or she will be unable to assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim; and (9) the ramifications that self-representation will have on the right to remain silent and the privilege against self-incrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\"><em>[DuBois, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 468-69, 916 A.2d 450.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">The State does not argue that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. Rather, the State argues that there is no federal constitutional right to counsel on collateral review, pointing to the 1987 United States Supreme Court case of <em>Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>551, 555, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1990, 1993, 95 L.Ed.2d 539, 545 (1987). In <em>Finley, </em>the defendant raised again on PCR the same issues previously rejected by the state supreme court on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 553, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1992, 95 L.Ed.2d at 544. The defendant\u2019s appointed counsel sought successfully to withdraw, indicating that the petition was meritless. <em>Ibid. </em>New counsel argued that initial PCR counsel had the obligation to follow the procedures for appellate counsel set forth in <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>738, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). <em>Finley, supra, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>at 558, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1995, 95 L.Ed.2d at 547. <em>Anders </em>described counsel\u2019s obligation on a direct appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>His role as advocate requires that he support his client\u2019s appeal to the best of his ability. Of course, if counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw. That request must, however, be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal. A copy of counsel\u2019s brief should be furnished the indigent and time allowed him to raise any points that he chooses; the court^not counsel-then proceeds, after a full examination of all the proceedings, to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous. If it so finds it may grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal insofar as federal requirements are concerned, or proceed to a decision on the merits, if state law so requires. On the other hand, if it finds any of the legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous) it must, prior to decision, afford the indigent the assistance of counsel to argue the appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\"><em>[Anders, supra, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>at 744, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1400,18 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 498.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The <em>Finley </em>Court refrained from imposing the <em>Anders </em>requirements on counsel representing defendants \u201cwhen mounting collateral attacks upon their convictions[.]\u201d <em>Finley, supra, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>at 555, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1993, 95 L.Ed.2d at 545 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The United States Supreme Court has more recently explicitly recognized the existence of a limited exception to the general rule that a defendant does not have the federal constitutional right to counsel for collateral attacks. The right to counsel may exist for a PCR proceeding raising issues that a defendant is barred from raising on direct appeal. <em>Martinez v. Ryan, </em>566 U.S.-,-, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>1309, 1315, 182 L.Ed.2d 272, 282 (2012).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Although choosing not to decide the issue,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court explained the rationale for finding a constitutional right to counsel in \u201cinitial-review collateral proceedings\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>Coleman v. Thompson, supra, </em>left open, and the Court of Appeals in this case addressed, [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] a question of constitutional law: whether a prisoner has a right to effective counsel in collateral proceedings which provide the first occasion to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial. These proceedings can be called, for purposes of this opinion, \u201cinitial-review collateral proceedings.\u201d <em>Coleman </em>had suggested, though without holding, that the Constitution may require States to provide counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings because \u201cin [these] cases ... state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 755, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2546 [115 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>640]. As <em>Coleman </em>noted, this makes the initial-review collateral proceeding a prisoner\u2019s \u201cone and only appeal\u201d as to an ineffective-assistance claim, <em>id., </em>at 756, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2546, [115 L.Ed.2d 640] (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted), and this may justify an exception to the constitutional rule that there is no right to counsel in collateral proceedings. <em>See id., </em>at 755, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2546 [115 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>640]; <em>Douglas v. California </em>372 <em>U.S. </em>353, 357, 83 <em>S.Ct </em>814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963) (holding States must appoint counsel on a prisoner\u2019s first appeal).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\"><em>[Martinez, supra </em>566 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1315, 182 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 282 (first and second alterations in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The United States Supreme Court declined \u201cto resolve whether that exception exists as a [federal] constitutional matter.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Instead, the Court reversed the denial of habeas corpus on the basis of a procedural default, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">Where, under state law, claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at-, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1320, <em>182 L.Ed.2d </em>at 288.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Our Supreme Court has \u201cexpressed a general policy against entertaining ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal because such claims involve allegations and evidence that lie outside the trial record.\u201d <em>State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 460, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992). <em>See also State v. McDonald, 211 N.J. </em>4, 30, 47 A.3d 669 (2012) (holding that a PCR \u201cproceeding would be the appropriate forum to evaluate the strategy of defendant\u2019s trial counsel, defendant\u2019s reasons for pleading guilty before the trial court, and other issues requiring information that is not in the record before the Court.\u201d) <em>But see State v. Allah, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>269, 285, 787 A.2d 887 (2002) (noting that a \u201cdefendant should not be required to wait until post-conviction relief to raise the issue [when] the trial record discloses the facts essential to his ineffective assistance claim\u201d). Here, although defendant raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, where he was constitutionally entitled to counsel, we refused to consider the claim, indicating that the issue was \u201cmore properly addressed in a petition for post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>Quixal, supra </em>(slip op. at 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Whether a defendant has a constitutional right to counsel to assist in pursuing a claim should not be controlled by whether we deem the claim more appropriately raised on direct appeal or by way of PCR. The appropriate avenue for ineffective assistance claims depends on whether an adequate record exists in the trial proceedings to evaluate that claim. The sufficiency of the record should not dictate whether an individual does or does not have a constitutionally-protected right to counsel. Our Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed the importance of PCR proceedings. Writing for the Court, Judge Wefing stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">[PCR proceedings] play a critical role in our criminal justice system. A petition for posticonviction relief is New Jersey\u2019s analogue to the federal writ of habeas corpus. <em>State v. Afanador, </em>[151 <em>N.J. </em>41, 49, 697 A.2d 529] (1997). \u201cIt is a safeguard to ensure that a defendant was not unjustly convicted.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>State v. McQuaid, </em>[147 <em>N.J. </em>464, 482, 688 A.2d 584] (1997)). A petition for post-conviction relief \u201cis a defendant\u2019s last chance to raise constitutional error that may have affected the reliability of his or her criminal conviction.\u201d <em>[Rue, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 811 A.2d 425]; <em>see also State v. Loftin, </em>[191 <em>N.J. </em>172, 197, 922 A.2d 1210] (2007) (noting posticonviction relief petition is defendant\u2019s last opportunity to raise constitutional challenge to fairness and reliability of criminal verdict).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>We recently reiterated the significance of a petition for post-conviction relief and stressed that a hearing on such a petition \u201c \u2018is not a <em>pro forma </em>exercise, but a meaningful procedure\u2019 to root out mistakes that cause an unjust result either in a verdict or sentence.\u201d <em>State v.
