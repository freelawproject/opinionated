The affirmative voters took the position that this created a four-four deadlock, which, in their view, authorized the mayor to vote, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A-.16-8; the mayor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>voted in favor of plaintiff Shanique Davis Speight. Because an abstention in this context could not be counted as a \u201cno\u201d vote, we conclude, as did the trial judge, that there was no tie, the mayor was not authorized to vote and, consequently, the Council failed to fill the vacancy, leaving the matter to Newark\u2019s voters at the next election.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The facts are relatively simple and undisputed. On November 15, 2012, Newark Municipal Councilmember Donald M. Payne, Jr. resigned from the Council due to his election to the United States Congress. Pursuant to the Faulkner Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-1 to - 210, Newark maintains a mayor-council form of government, with nine council members and a mayor. On November 20, 2012, with the eight remaining members present, the Council attempted to appoint Congressman Payne\u2019s successor. <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:16-7 requires that a majority of remaining council members\u2014that is, at least five members\u2014approve of a replacement to fill the vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Councilmember Ronald Rice left the meeting, and Ms. Speight received four \u201cyes\u201d votes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 3 \u201cno\u201d votes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Council regarded Councilman Rice\u2019s departure as a \u201cno\u201d vote, which they believed created a four-four tie. Based on this perceived tie\u2014and only because of this perceived tie, <em>see N.J.S.A </em>40A:16-8 (declaring that a mayor may vote \u201cto fill a vacancy in the membership of a governing body only in the case of a tie vote\u201d)\u2014Mayor Cory Booker voted in favor of Ms. Speight.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Mayor Booker, City Clerk Robert Marasco, Ms. Speight and Councilmembers Ramos, Amador, Gonzalez and Quintana (hereafter \u201cplaintiffs\u201d) filed a verified complaint and obtained an order requiring Councilmembers Rice, Baraka, Crump and Sharif (hereafter \u201cdefendants\u201d) to show cause why the court should not enter a declaratory judgment confirming Ms. Speight\u2019s appointment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the Council or, in the alternative, why a mandatory injunction should not be issued compelling defendants to attend and vote at a special council meeting. In response, defendants sought temporary restraints and moved to invalidate the appointment. With the parties\u2019 consent and without waiver of their legal contentions, Judge Dennis F. Carey, III, entered an interim order compelling defendants to appear at a special meeting to vote again.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The special council meeting was held on December 5, 2012; all eight remaining couneilmembers attended. Ms. Speight received the same four \u201cyes\u201d votes. Couneilmembers Baraka and Crump again voted \u201cno,\u201d and Councilmen Rice and Sharif abstained. Mayor Booker voted to break this ostensible tie in favor of placing Ms. Speight on the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Judge Carey heard further argument on December 11, 2012, and, on December 17, 2012, rendered a thorough written decision. Judge Carey found that the Newark Council\u2019s rules of practice recognized that an abstention is neither a \u201cyes\u201d nor a \u201cno\u201d vote and that Newark\u2019s internal rules were not inconsistent with statutory or common law principles. Consequently, Judge Carey concluded there was no tie that would allow the mayor to cast a vote and that Ms. Speight did not receive the five votes required by law to fill the vacancy. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The Municipal Vacancy Law permits a governing body\u2019s \u201cremaining members,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:16-7, to fill a vacancy within thirty days of the occurrence of a vacancy, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:16-12. The remaining members are not required to act; if they are unable to agree or if they choose not to fill the vacancy, the seat remains vacant until filled by the voters. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:16-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">To fill a vacancy, at least five members were required to vote in favor of a nominee. Ms. Speight received only four affirmative votes. The only way that Ms. Speight could be validly seated to fill the vacancy left by Congressman Payne was through the recognition of a deadlock and, with such a tie, the affirmative vote of Mayor Booker. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40A:16-8 (declaring that \u201ca mayor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>shall be permitted to vote to fill a vacancy in the membership of a governing body only in the case of a tie\u201d). And the only conceivable way the Council vote could be viewed as constituting a tie is if Councilmembers Rice and Sharifs abstentions may be viewed as \u201cno\u201d votes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">To determine the meaning of the Councilmembers\u2019 abstentions, we are directed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-180(a), which authorizes a governing body to \u201cdetermine its own rules of procedure, not inconsistent with ordinance or statute,\u201d to consider the application of Newark\u2019s rules of procedure. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-36(f). Rule XVI of the Newark Council\u2019s rules declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">Upon any roil call there shall be no discussion or explanation given by any Council Member voting, and he shall vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d unless he shall first receive special permission from a majority of the Municipal Council to explain his vote. <em>A Council Member may abstain </em>from voting on any matter, <em>such abstention shall not be counted as a yes or no vote </em>but shall be recorded in the minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">[Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Application of the clear and unambiguous language of this rule precludes a finding that the Council was deadlocked when four members voted \u201cyes,\u201d two members voted \u201cno,\u201d and two members abstained.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">In response, plaintiffs argue that Rule XVI is, on its face, \u201carbitrary, capricious and unreasonable\u201d because it disregards common law principles and statutory authority and because, in their view, its application here permits the \u201cmanipulation] [of] the voting process and [the] defying] [of] the statutory scheme for breaking a tie vote.\u201d We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">There is nothing arbitrary or unreasonable about Rule XVI because it is consistent with <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:69A-180(a), which authorizes such rules of procedure so long as they are \u201cnot inconsistent with ordinance or statute.\u201d Plaintiffs have not referred to an ordinance or statute that would foreclose a council from adopting a rule that views an abstention as neither a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d vote. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Instead, they refer to our rather nuanced and confusing jurisprudence regarding the meaning of an abstention in various settings. Because no clear or definitive rule suggesting the treatment of an abstention can be ascertained from the cases, we reject the argument that Newark\u2019s Rule XVI is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with recognized law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Historically, our courts acknowledged a general rule for treating abstentions as affirmative votes when a majority vote of a governing body was required for enactment of a measure. <em>See Kozusko v. Garretson, </em>102 <em>N.J.L. </em>508, 509-10, 134 <em>A. </em>614 (Sup.Ct.1926) (recognizing that \u201cwhen in a parliamentary body a majority vote suffices for effective enactment, and some vote aye and the others remain silent, they are taken as voting in the affirmative\u201d); <em>Mount v. Parker, 32 N.J.L. </em>341, 342 (Sup.Ct.1867) (concluding that \u201cwhere no specified number of votes is required, but a majority of a board regularly convened are entitled to act, a person declining to vote is to be considered as assenting to the votes of those who do\u201d). But, as the court observed in <em>Kozusko, </em>when non-voters do not merely remain silent but instead \u201cexpress[] themselves\u201d as not \u201cwish[ing] to be counted as in favor,\u201d then the \u201ccommon sense of the matter seems to be that\u201d they \u201cshould be recorded in the negative.\u201d 102 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 510, 134 A. 614. <em>See also Aurentz v. Planning Bd., Twp. of Little Egg Harbor, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 139, 408 A.2d 140 (Law Div.1979); <em>Abels v. McKeen, </em>18 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>462, 465 (Ch.1867).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Exceptions to this general approach have been recognized. For example, when \u201cabstention is due to a disqualifying personal or financial interest,\u201d courts have held that the abstention is not considered \u201cacquiescence] in the majority\u201d and should not be considered an affirmative vote. <em>Aurentz, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>140, 408 A.2d 140; <em>see also Quinn v. Sea Isle City, </em>77 <em>N.J.L. </em>428, 429, 71 A. 1118 (Sup.Ct.1909); <em>Garner v. Mountainside Bd. of Adjust., </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>417, 426, 515 A.2d 280 (Law Div.1986). Additionally, it has been held that when a statute requires a \u201cspecific, fixed number of actual affirmative votes for a majority,\u201d abstentions should be regarded as negative votes. <em>Patterson v. Cooper, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 18, 682 A.2d 266 (Law Div.1994) (citing <em>Gamer, supra, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 425, 515 A.2d 280).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Our courts have, at times, also interpreted abstentions as negative votes when the record suggests that abstention was meant to intentionally frustrate the voting process. In <em>Kossyk v. Light, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>338, 339-40, 384 A.2d 1111 (App.Div.1978)\u2014upon which plaintiffs greatly rely\u2014we held that a quorum existed despite councilmembers\u2019 departure from the meeting for the purpose of preventing a quorum to fill a vacancy, finding that \u201corderly government should not be frustrated by whim and the device of council persons absenting themselves from a position to which they were elected and to the attendance on which they had a solemn duty.\u201d In <em>Smith v. Ghigliotty, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 233, 239-40, 530 A.2d 68 (Law Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 529 A.2d 1000 (App.Div.1987), certain councilmembers refused to attend a special meeting to fill a council vacancy; the trial judge relied on <em>Kossyk </em>and directed those members to attend a public meeting by declaring that public officials \u201cdisserve[ ] [the] public trust\u201d when they intentionally refrain from attending a meeting \u201cwith the express intent of denying the governing body and the public the right to meet and discuss a critical public issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">One trial judge, however, offered a common sense rejection of this approach in all instances, recognizing that the judicial role is not to analyze the rationale for the councilmember\u2019s position and that an abstention should not be viewed as either a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d vote. In <em>Mann v. Housing Authority of Paterson, </em>20 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 279, 89 <em>A.2d </em>725 (Law Div.1952), when considering whether the abstentions of three of six commissioners in a vote should be counted as affirmative votes, the court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>mere consent to the vote of the majority by one who abstains from voting is not an affirmative vote, as it is not an expression of the choice or preference of the voter. As six commissioners were present at the meeting, passage of the resolutions clearly required four affirmative votes. But three were recorded, so the resolutions failed of legal passage and are, therefore, wholly invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In the final analysis, very few clear patterns can be discerned from these various decisions. Indeed, the New Jersey Law Revision Commission recently recognized that the current state of the law is \u201ccomplicated\u201d and has sought to clarify, through currently pending legislation, that abstentions should be treated as neither \u201cyes\u201d nor \u201cno\u201d votes because, \u201c[cjurrently, under New Jersey common law, there are circumstances where abstention is interpreted as either a \u2018yes\u2019 or a \u2018no\u2019 vote,\u201d and in reality, \u201c[a] person who abstains does not intend to cast any vote, affirmative or negative.\u201d John M. Cannel, Executive Director, <em>Final Report Relating to Effect of Abstentions, </em>New Jersey Law Revision Commission (Apr. 2011).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">This brief analysis of our common law demonstrates there is very little clarity or consistency in the judicial treatment of abstentions by members of municipal governing bodies. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Newark\u2019s Rule XVI should not be applied because it is contrary to common law is unpersuasive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> More importantly, because Rule XVI does not conflict with any statutory authority\u2014neither the Faulkner Act nor the Municipal Vacancy Law addresses the legal significance of an abstention\u2014it does not violate <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-180(a). As a result, Judge Carey properly concluded that Rule XVI was dispositive and that the rule compelled a finding that the votes cast by Councilmembers Rice and Sharif were not either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d votes and, therefore, did not create a deadlock to be broken by Mayor Booker. We, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>therefore, agree with the conclusion reached by Judge Carey in his comprehensive and thoughtful opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We would be remiss, however, if we did not comment on plaintiffs\u2019 accusation that Councilmember Rice\u2019s earlier abstention, and his and Councilmember Sharif\u2019s later abstentions, were \u201cmanipulative\u201d or designed to \u201cturn[ ] the voting process upside down to carry out [a] political agenda.\u201d To the extent our decision in <em>Kossyk, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 340, 384 A.2d 1111, and the trial court decision in <em>Smith, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 235, 530 A.2d 68, which we affirmed, <em>Smith, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 11-12, 529 A.2d 1000, may be read to support plaintiffs\u2019 view, we reject them when viewed in this context. As we have emphasized, the questions before us are informed by the fact that the remaining couneilmembers were not required by law to fill the vacancy; they were only authorized to do so in their discretion. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A.-16-12 (declaring that \u201c... the governing body <em>may, </em>within 30 days of the occurrence of the vacancy, appoint a successor to fill the vacancy ... \u201d) (emphasis added). The failure of the remaining members to exercise their discretion to fill a vacancy does not arouse the spectre of an \u201cimpotent, stalemated government,\u201d <em>see Kossyk, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 340, 384 A.2d 1111, and action taken by a councilmember in this particular circumstance is not, as plaintiffs argue, per se \u201cwhim[sical]\u201d or purposefully destructive of the political process, <em>see Smith, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 235, 530 A.2d 68. Just as we must assume plaintiffs felt justified in voting \u201cyes,\u201d and other members felt justified in voting \u201cno,\u201d the abstentions of Couneilmembers Rice and Sharif must be similarly assumed to represent a principled approach to the matter at hand. The point plaintiffs seem to miss is that there were not only two choices placed before the Council\u2014for or against Ms. Speight\u2014 when the vacancy occurred; couneilmembers were also legitimately entitled to choose not to fill the vacancy and leave the question to be decided by the people of Newark at the next election as provided by statute. In the circumstances presented by Congressman Payne\u2019s resignation, couneilmembers could only express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>a desire to leave the seat vacant by either absenting themselves from the meeting or abstaining. On this record, we must assume that this was the principled basis for the abstentions; to the extent <em>Kossyk </em>and <em>Smith </em>would suggest that an abstention in this setting constitutes a breach of councilmembers\u2019 \u201csolemn duty,\u201d <em>Kossyk, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 340, 384 A.2d 1111, we respectfully disagree. If abstaining in this circumstance is manipulative or contrary to the people\u2019s best interests, then it is the Legislature\u2019s duty or the voters\u2019 prerogative\u2014not ours\u2014to provide a remedy.'</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\"> From Councilmembers An\u00edbal Ramos, Augusto Amador, Carlos Gonzalez and Luis Quintana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\"> From Councilmembers Ras Baraka, Mildred Crump and Darrin Sharif.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b581-12\"> It certainly has not been argued that the abstentions should have been counted as \"yes\u201d votes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\"> We could end this discussion by recognizing that <em>NJ.S.A. </em>40:69A-180(a) does not preclude a council's adoption of a rule of practice that is inconsistent with the common law, only those rules that are inconsistent with \"ordinance or statute.\" We proceed with an analysis of the case law, however, for the sake of completeness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\"> <em>http://www.lawrev.state.nj.us/dbstentions/abstentionFR042811.doc</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\"> As noted earlier, this argument is based on a faulty premise, because the common law is irrelevant in determining the legitimacy of a governing body\u2019s rule of procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
