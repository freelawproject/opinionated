The primary issues on this appeal are whether New Jersey violates LRRA by requiring risk retention groups to provide pedestrian personal injury protection (pedestrian-PIP) benefits in conformity with <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.3 or by precluding them from participating in the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association (PLIGA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:47A-9, which pays pedestrian-PIP benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>for commercial liability insurers who are members.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because LRRA does not exempt risk retention groups from the coverage requirements of a state motor vehicle no-fault insurance law, 15 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 3905(a), and precludes a state from requiring or permitting a risk retention group to participate in PLIGA, an insurance insolvency guaranty association, 15 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 3902(a)(2), we reject these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Caple Guthrie, who was insured under an automobile liability policy issued by plaintiff American International Insurance Company of Delaware (AIG), was struck and injured by a taxicab insured by defendant Ocean Risk Retention Group, Inc. (ORRG). AIG paid over $200,000 of Guthrie\u2019s medical expenses before realizing that the vehicle involved was a taxi and its insurer, not AIG, was obligated to pay Guthrie\u2019s pedestrian-PIP benefits. After discovering its error, demanding payment from ORRG and receiving no response, AIG filed this suit seeking reimbursement from ORRG, defendant 4M Interprises, Inc.\u2014the owner of the taxi insured by ORRG\u2014and, in the event ORRG was not responsible, defendant PLIGA. Neither AIG nor ORRG filed a cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The trial court determined that ORRG, not AIG, owed the pedestrian-PIP benefits, compelled ORRG and AIG to arbitrate ORRG\u2019s equitable share pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-11 and dismissed AIG\u2019s claim against PLIGA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ORRG appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">There is no dispute that Guthrie\u2019s policy with AIG did not provide pedestrian-PIP benefits. Nor is there any question that ORRG\u2019s policy with 4M covered Guthrie\u2019s pedestrian-PIP claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Pedestrian-PIP coverage in a standard policy of automobile liability insurance applies to an insured or a household member of the insured who sustains \u201cbodily injury ... as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. But a taxi \u201cused as a public or livery conveyance for passengers\u201d is excluded from the statutory definition of \u201cautomobile\u201d under a policy of automobile insurance. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a; <em>Jones v. Naser City Transp. Corp., </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 515, 909 A.2d 752 (App.Div.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In contrast, policies of \u201cliability insurance ... on a motor vehicle, exclusive of an automobile as defined in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a] ... shall provide personal injury protection coverage benefits in accordance with <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4], <em>to pedestrians who sustain bodily injury in the State caused by the named insured\u2019s motor </em>vehicle____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.3 (emphasis added). For the purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3, the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d includes taxis. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2j (assigning \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d the meaning given in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:1-1\u2014\u201call vehicles propelled otherwise than by muscular <em>power, excepting </em>such vehicles as run only upon rails or tracks and motorized bicycles\u201d\u2014but excluding automobiles as defined in <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-2a).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The mandatory pedestrian-PIP coverage in both auto and motor vehicle polices is no-fault insurance. It must be provided \u201cwithout regard to negligence, liability or fault of any kind.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4; <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3 (requiring pedestrian-PIP coverage \u201cin accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4\u201d); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Licensed Beverage Ins. Exch., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>12, 679 A.2d 620 (1996) (noting that the Legislature required pedestrian-PIP coverage in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3 \u201c \u2018to comport with the original intent of the no-fault law\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Statement to Assembly Bill No. 3981, </em>at 405 (Oct. 4, 1983), <em>reprinted in N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">ORRG does not deny that the policy it sold to 4M conforms with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3. It includes an endorsement asserting that ORRG \u201cwill pay Pedestrian Personal Injury Protection benefits pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3,\u201d and the text of the statute is set forth immediately following that promise to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">ORRG\u2019s contractual obligation for the benefits at issue raises a preliminary question\u2014whether ORRG\u2019s argument concerning the State\u2019s alleged violations of LRRA should be considered. For the reasons that follow, we address ORRG\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Generally, an insurer is bound by the terms of its policy even if the policy provides benefits the law does not require. <em>See, e.g., Capelli v. Twin City Fire Ins. Co., </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 555, 508 A.2d 269 (App.Div.1986) (holding insurer to its contract providing more generous coverage than required by law despite an amendment). But ORRG\u2019s challenge is based on LRRA, which exempts a risk retention group from any state law that would regulate its operation, \u201cdirectly or indirectly,\u201d except as authorized by LRRA. 15 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 3902(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Because insurance policies omitting mandatory coverage are amended to include it, <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Malec, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 514 A.2d 832 (1986), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3 indirectly regulates risk retention groups by requiring them to include the requisite pedestrian-PIP coverage or refrain from issuing liability insurance policies on motor vehicles. Thus, LRRA\u2019s prohibition is implicated, and it is appropriate to consider whether LRRA permits a state to require this coverage in ORRG\u2019s policy. Moreover, ORRG\u2019s contractual obligation has no bearing on its allegation of discriminatory exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>sion from the payment of benefits available to PLIGA members and not ORRG.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We turn to consider ORRG\u2019s primary claims: 1) that LRRA exempts risk retention groups from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3; and 2) that New Jersey violates LRRA by discriminating against risk retention groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Background information on the purpose and history of LRRA that informs our discussion of the issues is provided in <em>Aftab v. N.J. Property-Liability Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 898 A.2d 1041 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>357, 907 A.2d 1016 (2006). \u201c \u2018[A] risk retention group is simply a group of businesses or others who join together to set up their own insurance company only to issue insurance policies to <em>themselves----\u2019\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 50, 898 A.2d 1041 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 99-685 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5304, 5305-06). Congress initially authorized risk retention groups to provide product liability insurance, but in 1986 \u201cexpand[ed] the scope of commercial liability insurance coverage available through risk retention groups.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 898 A.2d 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Through LRRA and its predecessor\u2014the Product Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981\u2014Congress intended risk retention groups to \u201cprovide a vehicle by which [commercial entities] could obtain [commercial] liability insurance at lower rates.\u201d Id. at 48, 898 A.2d 1041. Congress intended to achieve that cost reduction \u201cby exempting risk retention groups from many state laws and regulations that prohibited or restricted risk retention groups.\u201d Ibid. While LRRA exempts risk retention groups from many state laws regulating insurance, it does not exempt the groups from all such laws. <em>See </em>15 <em>U.S.C.S. \u00a7 </em>3902.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">This case requires an interpretation of LRRA, which is a question of law subject to de novo review. <em>In re Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>86, 94, 935 A.2d 1184 (2007). The court\u2019s role is to construe LRRA to effectuate the intent of Congress, and the inquiry begins with LRRA\u2019s language, which is given its ordinary meaning and read \u201cwith related provisions so as to give sense to the legislation as a whole.\u201d <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005). Because LRRA is a federal law, \u201cthe interest of comity and the benefits of uniform application require us to consider and give due deference to decisions of federal and state courts interpreting the statute.\u201d <em>Fletcher v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>530, 534, 991 A.2d 859 (App.Div.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">An understanding of LRRA\u2019s structure is critical to an interpretation of its separate provisions. Some of LRRA\u2019s provisions\u2014the exemptions\u2014protect risk retention groups from state law. Other provisions of LRRA\u2014the exceptions\u2014restrict the protection afforded risk retention groups by the exemptions and permit state regulation. Stated differently, the exceptions authorize state regulation despite an exemption that would otherwise insulate a risk retention group from state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The exemptions from state law are stated in subsection (a) of \u00a7 3902:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">(a) Exemptions from State laws, rules, regulations, or orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\"><em>Except as provided in this section, </em>a risk retention group is exempt from any State law, rule, regulation, or order <em>to the extent that such law, rule, regulation, or order </em>would\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-13\">(1) <em>make unlawful, or regulate, </em>directly or indirectly, the <em>operation </em>of a risk retention group <em>except that ... any State may require such a group </em>to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amr\">.... [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>(2) <em>require or permit </em>a risk retention group <em>to participate in any insurance insolvency guaranty association </em>in which an insurer licensed in the State is required to belong;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">(3) ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">(4) <em>otherwise, discriminate against a risk retention group or any of its members, </em>except that nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the applicability of State laws generally applicable to persons or corporations. [15 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 3902(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Subsection (b) of \u00a7 3902 makes it clear that the foregoing exemptions apply to \u201cliability insurance coverage provided by a risk retention group.\u201d 15 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 3902(b)(1). Thus, absent an exception and read together, subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) would exempt a risk retention group from a state law such as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3 that mandates coverage in a policy of liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Section 3905, which clarifies the scope of permissible state authority under LRRA, precludes that reading. LRRA\u2019s exceptions permit state regulation despite an exemption, and \u00a7 3905 has that effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">(a) <em>No exemption from. State motor vehicle no-fault and motor vehicle financial responsibility laws. </em>Nothing in [LRRA] shall be construed to exempt a risk retention group or purchasing group authorized under [LRRA] <em>from the </em>policy form or <em>coverage requirements of any State motor vehicle no-fault </em>or motor vehicle financial responsibility <em>insurance law.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">[15 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 3905(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">ORRG\u2019s objection to <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.3 is defeated by \u00a7 3905(a). As previously noted, the mandate in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3 for pedestrian-PIP benefits is part of New Jersey\u2019s no-fault motor vehicle insurance law. <em>State Farm, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 12, 679 A.2d 620. Section 3905(a) plainly states that LRRA does not exempt risk retention groups from the coverage requirements of a state\u2019s no-fault motor vehicle insurance law, and it also precludes a construction of any other provision of LRRA to prohibit such state regulation. The plain meaning of \u00a7 3905(a), which accounts for the remainder of LRRA as well, ends the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Despite the clarity of \u00a7 3905(a), ORRG relies upon subsection (b) of \u00a7 3905. That provision states that the \u201cexemptions provided [in LRRA] shall apply only to\u201d a risk retention group\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u201cliability insurance\u201d and precludes a construction of any part of LRRA to permit a risk retention group to provide \u201cany other line of insurance.\u201d 15 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 3905(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">ORRG argues that the pedestrian-PIP coverage mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3 is \u201cFirst Party medical insurance provided, regardless of fault, that is not dependent upon an assessment as to the liability of the parties involved.\u201d As we understand this objection, ORRG argues that pedestrian-PIP coverage is not liability insurance ORRG may provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Without question, a state law compelling action prohibited by federal law is preempted. <em>Crosby v. Nat\u2019l Foreign Trade Council, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>363, 372, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2288, 2294, 147 L.Ed.2d 352, 361 (2000). But ORRG provides no authority or argument supporting its characterization of pedestrian-PIP coverage as a line of insurance other than liability insurance. True, the Legislature has recognized the relationship between PIP coverage and the cost of health insurance. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-l.lb. That nexus, however, does not make pedestrian-PIP benefits a \u201cline of insurance\u201d other than liability insurance. The pedestrian-PIP coverage mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3 is a component of a policy of liability insurance covering, among other things, liability for \u201cbodily injury\u201d as part of this state\u2019s no-fault motor vehicle insurance law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3; <em>State Farm, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 12, 679 A.2d 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we reject ORRG\u2019s claim that LRRA exempts it from complying with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">We also reject ORRG\u2019s claim that New Jersey discriminates against risk retention groups by barring their participation in PLIGA\u2019s program for payment of pedestrian-PIP benefits. Section 3902(a)(4) exempts risk retention groups from a state regulation to the extent it would \u201cotherwise, discriminate against a risk retention group or any of its members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Federal courts have interpreted LRRA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination and made it clear that the burden of showing discrimination in violation of LRRA is on the risk retention group. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has \u201cheld that insurers could prove that a state law discriminated in violation of \u00a7 3902(a)(4) by showing that a law differentiates between insurance providers \u2018without an acceptable justification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alliance of Nonprofits for Ins. v. Kipper, </em>712 F.3d 1316, 1322 (9th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Nat\u2019l Warranty Ins. Co. v. Greenfield, </em>214 F.3d 1073, 1081 (9th Cir.2000)). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has concluded that a claim of discrimination requires \u201ca showing that the contested act was done with the intent to discriminate against\u201d a risk retention group or \u201ca showing of \u2018disparate impact\u2019\u2014that is to say, a harmful effect of a generally applicable policy that is disproportionately visited upon a protected class,\u201d without regard to intent. <em>Preferred Physicians Mut. Risk Retention Grp. v. Pataki, </em>85 F.3d 913, 918 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">ORRG has not made the showing required under either standard. ORRG\u2019s complaint is that PLIGA pays pedestrian-PIP benefits due under policies of motor vehicle liability insurance issued by commercial carriers in conformity with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3 but does not pay those benefits on such policies issued by a risk retention group.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The basis for the different treatment is explained in the record, which includes a March 1, 2006 notice from the Director of the Division of Insurance in the Department of Banking and Insurance to \u201cAll Risk Retention Groups Writing Motor Vehicle Insurance in NJ.\u201d In that notice the Director explains that the different treatment of commercial insurers and risk retention groups is a function of PLIGA\u2019s authority to assess commercial insurers who are members of PLIGA to cover its obligations\u2014authority PLIGA does not have over risk retention groups whose membership in PLIGA is barred by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Applying LRRA, this court has held that \u201can insurer registered in New Jersey solely as a risk retention group is not covered by PLIGA.\u201d <em>Aftab, supra, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 44, 898 A.2d 1041. LRRA exempts risk retention groups from any state law that would \u201crequire <em>or </em>permit a risk retention group to participate in any insurance insolvency guaranty association in which an insurer licensed in the State is required to belong.\u201d 15 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 3902(a)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Although PLIGA has other responsibilities, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-2.1, PLIGA\u2019s primary role is minimization of \u201c \u2018loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carpenter Tech. Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>504, 515, 800 A.2d 54 (2002) (quoting Post-Assessment Prop. <em>&amp; </em>Liab. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n Model Act, <em>reprinted in NAIC Model Laws, Regulations and Guidelines, </em>at 540-1, \u00a7 2 (1995)). Consequently, in conformity with LRRA\u2019s prohibition, New Jersey makes a risk retention group ineligible to \u201cbecome a member of, contribute to, or derive any benefit from [PLIGA].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:47A-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">ORRG\u2019s claim, as we understand it, is that PLIGA discriminates by denying risk retention groups limited membership in PLIGA\u2014 membership that would permit them to enjoy PLIGA\u2019s benefits with respect to pedestrian-PIP benefits without participating in the insolvency fund. An entitlement to limited participation is not supported by any provision of LRRA and is undermined by the Act\u2019s legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Congress \u201c *inten[ded] that States be precluded from requiring or permitting risk retention groups to participate <em>either directly or indirectly </em>in an insurance insolvency guaranty association.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aftab, supra, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 50, 898 A.2d 1041 (emphasis added) (quoting H.R.Rep.

That goal would be implicated if risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>retention groups were permitted to issue policies with coverage not paid by the group\u2019s premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">As explained in <em>Aftab, </em>the ban against participation in an insolvency guaranty association is best viewed \u201cas part of the trade-off\u2019\u2014in exchange \u201cfor limited State regulation!,] risk retention groups were \u2018on their own\u2019 if they became insolvent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Insolvency funds are not available to risk retention groups, and states cannot require or allow them \u201cto contribute to guaranty associations.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The trade-off is \u201cpart of [LRRA\u2019s] overall scheme to keep costs down.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In order to show that New Jersey is discriminating against risk retention groups contrary to LRRA, ORRG would have to demonstrate how limited participation in those benefits and payment of the accompanying assessments could be accomplished without indirectly contributing to the solvency of other insurers and, thereby, running afoul of \u00a7 3902(a). ORRG has made no effort to demonstrate how this could be done, and none is apparent to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The assessments paid by PLIGA\u2019s members cover several of PLIGA\u2019s obligations. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-63(d), PLIGA must \u201ccalculate the probable amount which will be needed to carry out its responsibilities\u201d under several statutes, including <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6-86.1 (which covers specified uninsured claims, including pedestrian-PIP claims that would be payable pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.3 if a policy were in place), <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6-86.7 (which includes claims payable to a pedestrian injured by an automobile) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-69 (which covers specified unpaid judgments). PLIGA must assess the \u201cprobable amount needed to carry out\u201d those responsibilities \u201cagainst insurers for that year\u2019s contribution to the fund.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6\u201463(d); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-8(a)(3) (requiring PLIGA to \u201c[a]ssess member insurers in amounts necessary to pay\u201d designated obligations and authorized expenses, and providing for the assessments \u201cin the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer ... bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Because ORRG presents no argument as to how a risk retention group could participate in PLIGA\u2019s payment of pedestrian-PIP benefits on equal footing with PLIGA members without indirectly participating in and funding functions related to the insolvency guaranty association, it fails to show that New Jersey discriminates against these groups in any manner other than that required by \u00a7 3902(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In sum, the non-discriminatory explanation for PLIGA\u2019s assessment and responsibility for pedestrian-PIP benefits is grounded in LRRA, and, for that reason, it is \u201can acceptable justification.\u201d This justification precludes any inference of discriminatory intent in violation of LRRA. And, ORRG has not provided any evidence of disparate impact. In this circumstance, proof of disparate impact would require a showing that ORRG\u2019s complaint is about something that is not part of the trade-off LRRA requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">ORRG also attempts to bolster its claim of discrimination by relying upon an exception to LRRA\u2019s exemption from state laws. The argument does not require extended discussion. Section 3902(a)(1)(C) permits a state to allow a risk retention group \u201cto participate, on a nondiscriminatory basis, in any mechanism established or authorized under\u201d state law to equitably apportion \u201cliability insurance losses and expenses incurred on policies written through such mechanism.\u201d Setting aside the fact that ORRG\u2019s policy was mandated by statute, not written through a \u201cmechanism\u201d to equitably apportion losses, \u00a7 3902(a)(1)(C) neither compels a state to permit such participation nor suggests that a state discriminates by foreclosing a risk retention group\u2019s participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we reject ORRG\u2019s claim that New Jersey discriminates against risk retention groups in violation of the LRRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">ORRG also urges reversal on the ground that AIG\u2019s claim for reimbursement was filed beyond the time permitted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This statute applies to claims made by an insured or an insured\u2019s estate under policies of \u201cautomobile insurance\u201d issued pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-3.1, -3.3, -4 and -10. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1.

ORRG\u2019s argument\u2014based solely on AIG\u2019s status as its insured\u2019s subrogee\u2014 lacks sufficient merit to warrant any further discussion in a \u25a0written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). <em>See State Farm, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 9, 679 A.2d 620 (noting that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1 provides a primary right of reimbursement to an insurer not linked to any subrogation right); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1 (providing a limitations period, with which AIG complied,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> commencing on the date the claim is filed, not the date of the injury); <em>N.J.
