Plaintiffs brought this action for declaratory relief, seeking either the total elimination or a highly restrictive judicial interpretation of the MDAR form. They argue that the form requirement and the attendant denial of a fair hearing for failure to complete and submit the MDAR form violate federal and state laws, including the New Jersey Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 to -30.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Division did not violate any federal or state laws or regulations regarding its decision to require applicants to complete a standardized assignment form such as the MDAR. Inasmuch as the Division is presently undertaking rulemaking in accordance with the APA to promulgate the adoption of the MDAR form, either in its present form or as it may be revised in light of comments received about the proposed rule, we deem that issue moot without prejudice to plaintiffs\u2019 right to appeal the ultimate adoption of a rule. We further direct that the Division proceed expeditiously with fair hearings to address the unresolved Medicaid penalty issues as to E.S. and E.B., provided that plaintiffs or someone on their behalf provisionally complete the Division\u2019s currently existing MDAR form, subject to the outcome of the rulemaking process and potential appellate review of the dispositions in the fair hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The precipitating facts underlying these actions involve E.S., a ninety-four-year-old woman who resides at the Masonic Home of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>New Jersey (Masonic), and E.B., a ninety-five-year-old woman who resided at the Bayshore Health Care and Rehabilitation Center (Bayshore).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Masonic and Bayshore are collectively referred to as the \u201cFacilities.\u201d E.S. and E.B. shall be jointly referred to as \u201cplaintiffs.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In each instance, there is no dispute as to plaintiffs\u2019 respective eligibility for certain Medicaid assistance, as each plaintiff applied for and was awarded Medicaid benefits. However, upon receiving their respective determinations, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sent a letter to the Division on behalf of each respective Facility requesting fair hearings to challenge the penalty periods imposed, and in E.B.\u2019s case, also a denial of an Undue Hardship Waiver. In each case, the Division responded by sending counsel the MDAR form to complete if the resident wished to designate the Facility as the authorized representative, prior to the Division scheduling the requested fair hearings or otherwise addressing the merits of the appeals. The Facilities\u2019 counsel submitted its own signed but undated authorization forms in lieu of the MDAR form; however, the Division rejected these self-styled forms and no fair hearings were scheduled.

The federal Medicaid Act, Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1396 to 1396w-5, mandates a joint federal-state program to provide medical assistance to individuals \u201cwhose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1396-1. Once a state joins the program, it must comply with the Medicaid statute and federal regulations. <em>United Hosps. Med. Ctr. v.

The Division\u2019s adopted rules and regulations permit an applicant to submit an application through an authorized agent or representative. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-2.1 (an \u201capplicant\u201d is defined as an \u201caged, disabled or blind individual or his/her authorized agent who executes the formal written application\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\"><em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-2.5 outlines the Medicaid application procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ4\">(c) In Medicaid Only, an individual who wishes to apply may be confined at home or at an institution, or may be subject to a critical illness or injury which impedes action on his or her own behalf. Consequently, the CWA shall accept any one of the following, in order of priority as listed, as an authorized agent for the purpose of initiating an application:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">1. A relative by blood or marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">2. A staff member of a public or private welfare agency of which the person is a client, who has been designated by the agency to so act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">3.

To assist CWAs with implementation of these provisions, the Division issued Medicaid Communication No. 11-03, which included a standardized form titled \u201cMedicaid Designation of Authorized Representative Form.\u201d The Division explains in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">Because there may be any number of ways an applicant could assert his choice to have someone apply for benefits on his behalf, [the Division] created a form to promote consistency throughout the twenty-one county welfare agencies throughout the State. Additionally, use of the form helps to expedite the application process in that the county welfare agency need not divert time and effort away from determining an applicant\u2019s Medicaid eligibility to evaluate the appropriateness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>or legality of any other \u201cauthorization\u201d documents that might be presented to it. Additionally, the person named on the [MDAR] form becomes the contact point for all questions or issues regarding the application or hearing process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">The form also serves to protect applicants by assuring that the applicant or his or her guardian: has made the authorization freely and voluntarily; knows whom he is appointing as his representative; knows that that representative will have access to financial and medical information; knows that he can revoke the authorization at any time ...; and has been made aware of any actual or potential conflicts of interest and has waived those conflicts. The [MDAR] form also provides that the person appointed as the authorized representative can act as representative \u201cin all reviews of [the applicant\u2019s] eligibility.\u201d ([T]hat is, throughout any appeal process). To further assure the legitimacy of the authorization, each paragraph must be initialed by the applicant or the person authorized to act on his behalf. In addition, the signature of the Medicaid applicant or person with legal authority and the signature of the authorized representative must be witnessed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">[ (Citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Against this factual background, we now consider the first set of claims that allege the MDAR form requirement violates federal and state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Plaintiffs contend that the form requirement is invalid due to federal preemption of state law. Preemption arises where it would not be possible to comply with both federal and state laws at the same time, \u201cor when the state law \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objective[s] of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pac. Capital Bank, N.A v. Connecticut, </em>542 E.3d 341, 351 (2d Cir.2008) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Locke, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>89, 109, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>1135, <em>1148, 146 L.Ed.2d </em>69, 89 (2000)). Where compliance with both federal and state law is impossible, the .federal statutory or regulatory provision nullifies the state provision. <em>Farina v. Nokia, Inc., </em>625 E.3d 97, 115 (3d Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>365, 181 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>231 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>In this case, plaintiffs argue that the MDAR form, stating that all notices and correspondence will be sent <em>to the applicant\u2019s authorized, representative, </em>directly conflicts with the federal Medicaid regulation, 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 431.206 (1993), that requires state and county agencies to \u201cinform <em>every applicant or beneficiary </em>in writing ... of his right to a hearing[,] ... the method by which he may obtain a hearing\u201d and of his right to represent himself personally or to designate another party to so represent him. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In response, the Division contends that the form comports with relevant federal and state laws, which both permit the applicants to designate someone to represent them in the eligibility process. As the form does not place limits on whom the applicant may select as his authorized representative, the Division maintains that it has not created an obstacle to implementation of the federal Medicaid law.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Reviewing the record here, we can discern nothing in plaintiffs\u2019 argument that explains how the Division\u2019s MDAR form conflicts with federal law. Accordingly, we conclude that no conflicts exist in the use of this form that would trigger federal preemption. The State regulations provide alternative means for Medicaid applicants/recipients to communicate with CWAs or the Division. The State regulations provide that the applicant may authorize, and the CWA or the Division shall accept, another individual in the order of priority as set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-2.5(e). That provision is consistent with the federal regulations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Next, plaintiffs argue that the form requirement interferes with their right to a fair hearing, in contravention of federal and state laws. In essence, they claim that the completion of the form becomes an unauthorized prerequisite to processing their hearing requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">An applicant has the right to challenge an adverse determination of eligibility through a fair hearing, and federal regulations require that the state Medicaid agency inform every applicant, at the time he or she applies for Medicaid, of the right to a hearing. 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 431.206 (1993). The federal regulations also require the state agency to advise the applicant, in writing, of his or her rights and responsibilities in the application process. 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 435.905(a) (2012). Our State regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-10.3(b), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">An opportunity for a fair hearing shall be granted to all claimants requesting a hearing because their claims for medical assistance are denied or are not acted upon with reasonable promptness, or because they believe the Medicaid Agent ... has erroneously terminated, reduced or suspended their assistance____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">A request for hearing shall be defined as any clear expression (submitted in writing) by claimants (or <em>someone authorized to act on behalf of claimants) </em>to the effect that they desire the opportunity to present their case to higher authority!..]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Here, plaintiffs received notice of their eligibility for benefits in correspondence addressed to their attorney, as authorized agent, as permitted by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-2.5(c). The letter, State form number 400-093 (rev.10/06), contained a section titled \u201cFAIR HEARING NOTICE\u201d that informed the applicant of his or her right to request a fair hearing within twenty days. On the second page of that form, titled \u201cFAIR HEARING REQUEST,\u201d the center of the page contained the applicant\u2019s rights section, detailing, among other things, the right to present the applicant\u2019s \u201cown ease[,] or have <em>a relative, friend, or attorney </em>make the presentation.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney responded to the Division requesting a fair hearing <em>on behalf of the respective </em>Facility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Had counsel requested the fair hearings in their capacity as the plaintiffs\u2019 legal representative, we suspect that this matter would not have caused the CWA any concern. However, as it appeared that the Facilities were attempting to assume the rights and entitlements of plaintiffs, the Division, through the CWA, had the obligation to ensure that plaintiffs made proper authorizations designating the Facilities as their representatives. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-2.5(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The Facilities submitted their respective authorization forms in lieu of the MDAR form, in which plaintiffs purportedly demonstrated an intent to transfer, or assign, their Medicaid benefits to the Facilities. In citing to <em>Tirgan v. Mega Life &amp; Health Insurance, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 390, 700 A.2d 1239 (Law Div.1997), counsel for plaintiffs argues that his clients\u2019 undated executed forms evidence valid assignments under the law that: (1) express an intent to transfer their rights; (2) contain subject matter that is \u201cdescribed sufficiently to make it capable of being readily identified;\u201d and (3) provide clear and unequivocal notice to the obligor. First, counsel contends that plaintiffs\u2019 respective signed Authorization Statements demonstrate the intent to transfer, or assign, their Medicaid benefits. Second, the assignments are sufficiently described because the Facilities have the \u201cright to receive Medicaid benefits,\u201d which authorize them to receive the benefits as payment for services rendered and take actions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>qualify plaintiffs for Medicaid benefits. Third, the assignment was clear and unequivocal because the assignment \u201cirrevocably assigns\u201d rights to the Facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">As such, plaintiffs argue that the Facilities are \u201cafforded all of the rights that [plaintiffs] are or would be entitled to.\u201d In their reply briefs, plaintiffs add that they remain the Medicaid \u201capplicants\u201d and the Facilities are not attempting to substitute themselves as the \u201capplicants\u201d in these matters.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, plaintiffs contend that the Facilities have only been assigned the \u201cright to receive Medicaid benefits\u201d and \u201cright to take those actions that are required to secure\u201d those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The Division counters that \u201cthe use of the [MDAR] form is a reasonable and prudent step for [the Division] to ensure the applicant is being represented by the person of his or her choosing and to protect the integrity of the Medicaid program.\u201d Further, \u201c[i]f that form is not completed and submitted, [the Division] cannot act[,] as there is no basis to list [the Facilities] as [plaintiffs\u2019] representative^].\u201d The Division also argues that Medicaid eligibility is not fungible, and since plaintiffs\u2019 benefits are paid directly to the Facilities, there is no need for plaintiffs to assign their right to receive payments to the Facilities. Finally, the agency states: \u201cdespite asserting that [they are] acting on [plaintiffs\u2019] behalf as ... authorized representative^], [the Facilities] refuse[ ] to provide a signed [MDAR] form reflecting that relationship, asserting various constitutional, statutory and regulatory objections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In general, and subject to other governing law, \u201c[p]arties have a right to contract in any way they see fit.\u201d <em>Triffin v. Bank of Am., </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 89, 917 A.2d 257 (App.Div.2007) (citation omitted). However, \u201c[i]t is well-settled that the dictates of public policy may require invalidation of private contractual arrangements where those arrangements directly contravene ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>press legislative policy <em>or are inconsistent with the public interest or detrimental to the common good.\u201d Sacks Realty Co., Inc. v. Shore, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>258, 269, 721 A.2d 1011 (App.Div.1998) (emphasis added). The courts employ a balancing test that weighs the legislative policy and the public interest against the enforcement of the contractual provision in order to determine whether to void the contractual provision. <em>Saxon Constr. &amp; Mgmt. Corp. v. Masterclean of N.C., </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 378, 641 A.2d 1129 (Law Div.1992), <em>aff'd, </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 641 A.2d 1056 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>314, 645 A.2d 142 (1994); <em>see Triffin, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 87, 917 A.2d 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">As we have already made plain, under Medicaid\u2019s federal regulations, \u201c[t]he agency must require a written application from the applicant, <em>an authorized representative, </em>or, if the applicant is incompetent or incapacitated, <em>someone acting responsibly for the applicant.\u201d </em>42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 435.907 (2012) (emphasis added). In furtherance of this provision, <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-2.5(c) allows for the appointment of an \u201cauthorized agent for the purpose of initiating an application\u201d for an applicant who is critically ill or \u201cconfined at home or at an institution.\u201d As previously stated, no federal or state regulation defines how an \u201cauthorized representative\u201d is to be designated. In the absence of such legislation or regulatory direction, the Facilities where plaintiffs live, and perhaps countless other facilities and individuals, have created private contractual assignments that allow them to pursue Medicaid benefits on behalf of their residents. In response to receiving numerous variations of these agreements, the Division created the MDAR form.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">While we cannot fault plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for attempting to fashion their own remedy for the perceived lapse in the authorization process, we are of the view that the assignment contracts proffered by the Facilities present significant regulatory problems given their marked differences from the Division\u2019s MDAR form. These differences are explained as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">a) <em>Appointment of Representative</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADl\">The MDAR form provides that only one person can be appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>ed as the applicant\u2019s representative.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The form requires the representative\u2019s name, company affiliation, address, and phone number. The Facilities\u2019 form assigns plaintiffs\u2019 rights to a myriad of personnel, including the entire facility, \u201cemployees, agents and/or attorneys.\u201d No personal contact information is requested on the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">b) <em>Notification Made to Representative Only</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The MDAR form acknowledges applicant\u2019s authorization to send all agency correspondence to the Authorized Representative. The Facilities\u2019 documentation does not include this language, and as noted above, the form does not request any contact information for the representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">c) <em>Confidentiality Waiver and \u201cHold-Harmless\u201d Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The Facilities\u2019 documentation provides that the applicant \u201chereby waive[s] any and all claims of confidentiality relating to ... [his or her] records and/or information.\u201d The MDAR form does not specifically address a waiver of confidentiality. Rather, the form states that the applicant \u201chold[s] [the Division] and the [county agencies and service providers] harmless for any claim or action resulting from the use or disclosure of information by [the] Authorized Representative.\u201d Additionally, the applicant must acknowledge that \u201cinformation shared with [the] Authorized Representative may affect [his or her] liability to a third party.\u201d The Facilities\u2019 documentation does not include these clauses or other related language.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">d) <em>Conflict of Interest Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">The MDAR form states that the applicant has \u201cbeen fully informed in writing by the Authorized Representative of actual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>potential conflicts of interests that may exist between the above[-]named entity and [applicant], [The applicant] ... waive[s] any conflict of interest. If there is no conflict of interest, the Authorized Representative has also put that in writing.\u201d The Facilities\u2019 documentation does not include this same, or otherwise related, language.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">e) <em>Disclosure of Applicant\u2019s Personal Information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The MDAR form outlines that the applicant authorizes the Division to disclose his or her personal information to the representative, including \u201cSocial Security number, financial statements, medical information and the reasons for denial.\u201d The Facilities\u2019 form uses broader language, stating that the recipient authorizes the representative(s) to \u201csecure, from any third party, any and all financial and/or other records to secure ... benefits\u201d and \u201ccommunicate with any party regarding the personal financial and/or other information as needed to secure said benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">f) <em>Revocation of Authorization</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In the MDAR form, the applicant can revoke his or her authorization of a representative at any time by contacting the representative and the CWA in writing. In the Facilities\u2019 documentation, plaintiffs have \u201cirrevocably assign[ed]\u201d their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">g) <em>No Fee Charged for Application Processing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The MDAR form includes a provision that neither the State of New Jersey nor the CWAs can charge a fee for filing a Medicaid application. The Facilities\u2019 form does not include such language.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">h) <em>Witness Verification of Signatures</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">At the bottom of the MDAR form, it states: \u201cThis form has no effect unless witnessed and signed by the person granting authority and by the Authorized Representative or an agent of the company appointed to be the Authorized Representative.\u201d On the other hand, the Medicaid beneficiary must sign the Facilities\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>documentation, but the form does not require the representative\u2019s signature. Also, the beneficiary\u2019s signature does not require third-party verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">i) <em>Initialing of Each Paragraph on the MDAR form</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The MDAR form requires that the applicant initial each paragraph. The Facilities\u2019 documentation does not require these additional acknowledgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">In comparing the parties\u2019 forms, it is clear that on its face, the Facilities\u2019 authorization form does not provide the same information or assurances sought by the Division. At oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel conceded that their form may be no better than the Division\u2019s form.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The MDAR form appears to provide greater substantive and procedural protections for the Medicaid applicant in a manner consistent with federal and state mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">We are mindful that \u201c[t]he power of a court to declare a contractual provision void as against public policy must be exercised with caution and only in cases that are free from doubt. The illegality must be clear and certain.\u201d <em>Saxon, supra, </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 377, 641 A.2d 1129 (citation omitted). While we need not go so far as to declare the private form illegal, a brief review of the policy underpinnings of the Medicaid program is central to the comparison of these forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Medicaid provides free or low-cost health coverage to millions of children, families, pregnant women, the elderly, and people -with disabilities. Medicaid, Healthcare.gov, <em>available at </em>http://www. healthcare.gov/using-insurance/low-cost-care/medicaid (last visited May 1, 2013). This program has various eligibility criteria in order to ensure that applicants qualify for those services.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The ability to assign an applicant\u2019s right to pursue Medicaid benefits, without proper procedural protections, could create many problems as the Division asserts, including fraud and lack of accountability. We do not view the Division\u2019s concerns regarding the \u201cpotential for fraud or for use of an applicant\u2019s confidential financial (and other) information for nefarious or criminal purposes such as Medicaid benefit fraud or identity theft\u201d as mere litigious exaggeration or unfounded hyperbole. Rather, this is a matter of such importance that in 2010, the New Jersey Legislature passed the Medicaid Program Integrity and Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-53 to -64, establishing the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General to detect, prevent and investigate Medicaid fraud and abuse; recover improperly expended Medicaid funds; enforce Medicaid rules and regulations; audit cost reports and claims; and review quality of care given to Medicaid recipients. In furtherance thereof, Governor Chris Christie signed <em>L. </em>2010, c. 33, eff. June 29, 2010, which officially transferred these functions, powers and duties to the Office of the State Comptroller. The Office of the State Comptroller then created the Medicaid Fraud Division.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Here, plaintiffs\u2019 private contracts potentially jeopardize the applicants\u2019 rights in many ways, including, among other things, the irrevocability of the assignments and appointment of numerous, unnamed representatives. In the latter circumstance, for example, the Facility, hypothetically, could name a low level clerk or a custodian for that matter, giving that person access to the Medicaid recipient\u2019s private information. On the other hand, the MDAR form provides additional protections, such as witness verification of applicant and representative\u2019s signatures and revocation of the appointment \u201cat any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>In light of the Division\u2019s statutory responsibilities in administering the Medicaid program and its legitimate interests in protecting the vulnerable population of Medicaid recipients, we conclude that the Division\u2019s form requirement does not impede, but rather preserves, plaintiffs\u2019 rights to have a fair hearing by ensuring that an appropriately designated individual represents them in agency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The Division contends that federal enabling legislation allows it the authority to create this MDAR form and is \u201creasonably related to its obligation to monitor the provision of Medicaid services by establishing procedures by which it can assure the quality of services as well as the detection of fraud.\u201d <em>Gabor v. Hyland, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. 275, </em>278, 399 A.2d 993 (App.Div.1979). In <em>Gabor, </em>we upheld the Division\u2019s requirement that a standardized medical authorization form be completed before releasing recipient\u2019s confidential information. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 280, 399 A.2d 993. In upholding the Division\u2019s position, we concluded that the State\u2019s insistence on a standardized form as a condition of scheduling a fair hearing or processing an appeal \u201cis, on its face, in no way constitutionally offensive and is ... a requirement reasonably related to its obligation to monitor the provision of Medicaid services by establishing procedures by which it can assure the quality of services.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, as in <em>Gabor, </em>the Division\u2019s determination of the necessity of a standardized form in order to enforce its regulations designed to protect the Medicaid program is unquestionably reasonable. Moreover, because the party challenging the agency\u2019s action must demonstrate that the decision is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, <em>Arenas, supra, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 443-44, 897 A.2d 442, we determine that plaintiffs have not satisfied that burden as to the Division\u2019s decision to require completion of a general standardized form.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">We turn now to plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the MDAR form requirement violates the APA by implementing a widespread, uniform application of a procedure to all similarly situated individuals. The Division counters that the MDAR form need not be adopted as a rule in order to be valid because it is a \u201cregulatory guidance document,\u201d as authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-3a. They contend that the law defines a regulatory guidance document as \u201cany policy memorandum or similar document used by a State agency to provide technical or regulatory assistance or direction to the regulated community to facilitate compliance with State or federal law or a rule adopted pursuant to [the APA].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-3a(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The APA guides State agencies in the implementation, amendment, repeal, or adoption of rules. An agency, however, has administrative authority to conduct informal action without a trial-type hearing, which is not subject to the weighty rulemaking provisions of the APA. <em>See Deborah Heart &amp; Lung Ctr. v. Howard, </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. </em>491, 502-03, 962 A.2d 577 (App.Div.) (stating that an informal agency action was \u201cnot subject to the APA\u2019s requirements governing adoption of agency rules\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>129, 970 A.2d 1046 (2009). Such action includes \u201cinvestigating, publicizing, negotiating, settling, advising, planning, and supervising a regulated industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503, 962 A.2d 577 (quoting <em>Nw. Covenant Med. Ctr. v. Fishman, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>123, 136-37, 770 A.2d 233 (2001)). These types of actions \u201cconstitute[ ] the bulk of the activity of most administrative agencies.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>In re Request for Solid Waste Util. Customer Lists, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>508, 518, 524 A.2d 386 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">On the other hand, \u201can agency may not use its power to interpret its own regulations as a means of amending those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>regulations or adopting new regulations.\u201d <em>Venuti v. Cape May County Constr. Bd. of Appeals, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 554, 555 A.2d 1175 (App.Div.1989). \u201cThe manner in which an agency exercises broad discretion \u2018may be governed by the [APA].\u2019 \u201d <em>Besler &amp; Co., Inc. v. Bradley, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 173, 824 A.2d 289 (App.Div.2003) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>St. Barnabas Med. Ctr. v. New Jersey Hosp. Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>132, 143, 593 A.2d 806 (App.Div.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In order to avoid abuse of these broad administrative powers, our Supreme Court enumerated six factors that are weighed to determine whether agency action must be designated as an administrative rulemaking requiring implementation through the APA. <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 331-32, 478 A.2d 742 (1984). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">Such a conclusion would be warranted if it appears that the agency determination, in many or most of the following circumstances, (1) is intended to have wide coverage encompassing a large segment of the regulated or general public, rather than an individual or a narrow select group; (2) is intended to be applied generally and uniformly to all similarly situated persons; (3) is designed to operate only on future cases, that is, prospectively; (4) prescribes a legal standard or directive that is not otherwise expressly provided by or clearly and obviously inferable from the enabling statutory authorization; (5) reflects an administrative policy that (i) was not previously expressed in any official and explicit agency determination, adjudication or rule, or (ii) constitutes a material and significant change from a clear, past agency position on the identical subject matter; and (6) reflects a decision on administrative regulatory policy in the nature of the interpretation of law or general policy. These relevant factors can, either singly or in combination, determine in a given case whether the essential agency action must be rendered through rule-making or adjudication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">\n<em>{Ibid.1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Here, the Division states that Medicaid Communication No. 11-03 and the MDAR form were created and issued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">to provide direction on how to comply with federal and State Medicaid law[s] concerning applications, fair hearings and use of authorized representatives. They compile, synthesize and explain, in one place, the requirements that the application be in writing, that an applicant has the right to have an authorized representative assist him or her in the application and/or appeals process and that an applicant has the responsibility to provide the [CWA] and [the Division] with whatever information is needed to establish the applicant\u2019s eligibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>It is clear from the Division\u2019s argument that neither federal nor State regulations provide a methodology for designating the authorized representative, which has resulted in the agency\u2019s concern over inconsistencies among the CWAs, as well as the potential for fraud and misrepresentation. We agree with the Division that these concerns constitute a valid and laudable purpose for implementing the MDAR form. We recognize further that \u201cone of the acknowledged advantages of the administrative process \u2018has been its flexibility in enabling administrators to deal justly with unanticipated as well as anticipated situations in accordance with general legislative guides.\u2019\u201d <em>In re N.J.AC. 7:1B-1.1 et seq., </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 115-16, 67 A.3d 621, 2013 <em>WL </em>1150506 (App.Div.2013) (quoting <em>Ward v.

No other form or document shall be used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">(1) Use of the Division\u2019s Designation of Authorized Representative Form is not required if the authorized representative is the beneficiary\u2019s legal guardian, a relative by blood or .marriage, the attorney of the beneficiary hired by the beneficiary to represent the beneficiary, or a person with power of attorney for the beneficiary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>[45 <em>N.J.R. </em>716(a) (Apr. 1, 2013).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4(a)(3), comments from \u201call interested persons\u201d on the proposed rule were due by June 3, 2013. Regardless of our present assessment of plaintiffs\u2019 legal arguments, certain practical concerns may be best addressed in the context of the rulemaking process. At oral argument, for example, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel questioned how or by whom the MDAR form would be completed in situations when the Medicaid recipient is without any interested family members to act on his or her behalf, or is incapacitated, incompetent or, in E.B.\u2019s case, deceased. Granting that a guardian may be appointed by the Court, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:26-2, to act on the applicant or recipient\u2019s behalf, the Division may not have fully considered the practicalities raised by plaintiffs. We should think that such concerns and others would be appropriately addressed during the rulemaking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">We have surmised above that the creditable intent or purpose of the MDAR form requirement is to render more consistent the authorized representative designation process, while concomitantly protecting our State\u2019s most vulnerable citizens from potential fraud and misrepresentation. Toward that end, we consider it contrary to the best interests of plaintiffs, the Facilities and the Division to permit a void in this area of patient care while the agency promulgates the proposed rules. We are also cognizant that the present rulemaking process will not resolve plaintiffs\u2019 current payment issues. In balancing the interests of the parties and the public, we have, on occasion, permitted an agency to continue applying the regulation in question while rulemaking proceeds.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The \u201ctemporary validity doctrine,\u201d first espoused <em>in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>K.P. v. Albanese, supra, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 173-74, 497 A.2d 1276, allows an agency to continue using those current processes during a remand for agency rulemaking in compliance with the APA. Thereafter, we invoked the doctrine in <em>In re Commissioner\u2019s Failure to Adopt 861 CPT Codes, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 147, 817 A.2d 355 (App.Div.2003), where we determined not to void the rule for procedural irregularity.

Related thereto, the Division counsel informed that there are many more Medicaid recipients who comply with the form requirement than object. Nevertheless^ the objective is to develop a procedure to ensure consistent application by all twenty-one CWAs and to protect this segment of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Toward that end, and in accordance with our aforementioned conclusions, we hereby impose a curative temporary remand to the Division for the purpose of completing the adoption of the regulations, with possible modifications, in accordance with APA rule-making procedures. Pending such rule adoption, the present system now being implemented, namely Medicaid Communication No. 11-03, shall remain in full force and effect until the promulgation of the proposed rule or until December 31, 2013, whichever occurs first. If new rules are not promulgated by December 31, 2013, then Medicaid Communication No. 11-03 shall be deemed null and void as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">As to the merits of these appeals, on remand, we direct plaintiffs<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to complete the MDAR form, without prejudice to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>rights they have to seek farther review of this judgment or their rights under the APA, should they participate in that rulemaking process. After receipt of the completed MDAR form, the Division shall expeditiously process plaintiffs\u2019 requests for appeal and fair hearings, and address the outstanding issues raised in accordance with the Division\u2019s ordinary regulatory procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The remaining arguments raised in this appeal are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in this opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(1)(E).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-14\"> We consolidate A-6111-10 with the other two appeals solely for purposes of this opinion.
