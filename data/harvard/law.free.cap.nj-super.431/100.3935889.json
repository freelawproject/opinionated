Thereafter, twenty-eight environmental and labor organizations, led by the American Littoral Society, united to appeal the DEP\u2019s promulgation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Appellants argue that the waiver rules exceed DEP\u2019s legislated authority and, in any event, are facially invalid due to the lack of adequate standards to guide the agency\u2019s discretion and implementation. They also challenge DEP\u2019s guidance documents and many of the other postings on DEP\u2019s website created exclusively for the waiver rules after their adoption, as <em>defacto </em>rulemaking in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), <em>N.J.SA </em>52:14B-1 to -15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For reasons that follow, we uphold DEP\u2019s authority to promulgate the waiver rules and find they contain adequate standards.

Relying on this delegated legislative authority, DEP explained its reasons for proposing the waiver rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-16\">With decades of rulemaking experience and implementing its regulatory programs, it is clear to the Department that no administrative rule, however carefully crafted it may be, can possibly anticipate each and every factual circumstance that might fall within the purview of the waiver rules. While the Department attempts to craft its rules to address the factual scenarios that might be reasonably anticipated, unanticipated situations do arise that may warrant relief from strict compliance with an existing rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>[44 <em>N.J.R. </em>1002.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">As <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1B-1.1 further makes plain, DEP\u2019s purpose was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">to set forth the limited circumstances in which the Department may, in its discretion, waive the strict compliance with any of its rules in a manner consistent with the core missions of the Department to maintain, protect, and enhance New Jersey\u2019s natural resources and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and the environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">To that end, the rules establish several critical steps containing discrete requirements that a waiver applicant must meet before approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">First, the applicant, to be successful, must demonstrate that its request complies with one of four threshold requirements, or bases, to obtain a waiver. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.1(a) lists the four thresholds: (1) \u201c[Conflicting rules\u201d; (2) \u201cstrict compliance with the rule would be unduly burdensome\u201d; (3) \u201cnet environmental benefit\u201d; <em>or </em>(4) \u201cpublic emergency.\u201d These terms are defined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1B-1.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">\u201cConflicting rules\u201d means a situation in which two or more Department rules, or a Department rule and the rule of another State agency or a Federal agency, conflict so as to make compliance with both rules impossible or impracticable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">\u201cUnduly burdensome\u201d means a situation in which the strict compliance with a specific Department rule would result in either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">1. Actual, exceptional hardship for a particular project or activity, or property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">2. Excessive cost in relation to an alternative measure of compliance that achieves comparable or greater benefits to public health and safety or the environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-16\">\u201cNet environmental benefit\u201d means a situation in which the quantitative or qualitative benefit to a natural resource or other related environmental good for which the Department has responsibility would substantially outweigh any detriment to that natural resource or environmental good, which would result from a waiver. There must be an adequate geographic and resource nexus between the environmental offset and the natural resource or other environmental good that is protected by the rule being waived. The net environmental benefit may include mitigation, but it must be beyond what the waived rule would have required independent of the waiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-17\">\u201cPublic emergency\u201d means a situation in which a Federal or State official with the authority to do so declares a public emergency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">Second, the applicant must demonstrate that its waiver request does not fall within certain prohibitions expressed within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>waiver rules. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.1(b) identifies thirteen categories of DEP\u2019s rules and requirements that cannot be waived:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">1. A requirement of, or duty imposed by, a Federal or State statute or [flederal regulation, unless that statute or regulation provides for such a waiver;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">2. A rale providing for a [flederally delegated, authorized, or assumed program where the waiver would not be consistent with New Jersey\u2019s delegation, authorization, or assumption of authority pursuant to a Federal program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">3. A rule that implements a [fjederally enforceable program pursuant to a State Implementation Plan (SIP), as defined at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:27-18.1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">4. A rale that is part of a collaborative program involving multiple states or jurisdictions where the waiver would not be consistent with New Jersey\u2019s participation in the multi-state or multi-jurisdiction program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">5. A rule concerning the air emissions trading program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">6. A rale providing for a numeric or narrative standard protective of human health;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">7. A rule concerning the designation of rare, threatened, or endangered status of any species of flora or fauna, or habitat for such species;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\">8. A rale providing for a remediation funding source, claim or other reimbursement, grant, loan, or other financial assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-14\">9. A rule providing for a license, certification, or registration for a vehicle, boat, individual, or business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-15\">10. A rale providing for a license or approval for hunting, fishing, or trapping;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-16\">11. A rale providing for public participation or notice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-17\">12. A rale providing for a fee, over-sight cost, or other Department cost; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-18\">13. Any provision of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-19\">Moreover, no waiver can be granted that would conflict with any of DEP\u2019s \u201ccore missions ... to maintain, protect, and enhance New Jersey\u2019s natural resources and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and the environment.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1B\u20141.1; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.2(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-20\">Third, the applicant\u2019s request, to be successful, must satisfy various specific evaluation criteria. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.2, which delineates those criteria, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-21\">(a) The Department shall consider the extent to which the following criteria support a waiver of the strict compliance with a rale in accordance with this chapter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-22\">1. The public has had sufficient notice of the waiver in accordance with applicable rules;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-23\">2. The Department has been provided with information and data sufficient to support a waiver;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>3. There are circumstances that support the need for a waiver;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">4. The person seeking the waiver may have directly caused or contributed to the circumstances that resulted in the rule being unduly burdensome;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">5. There is a net environmental benefit, including the consideration, when appropriate, of the impact of the waiver on the remediation and redevelopment of a contaminated site, or on the expansion of an existing development;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">6. The waiver would be consistent with the Department\u2019s core missions to maintain, protect, and enhance New Jersey\u2019s natural resources and to protect public health, safety, and welfare, and the environment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">7. The waiver would result in a reasonable and effective response to a public emergeney.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">After it adopted the waiver rules, DEP posted a waiver rule \u201chomepage\u201d on its website.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This homepage includes links to subpages that provide additional and specific information concerning waiver rule prohibitions, waiver rule guidance, public notice requirements, frequently asked questions (FAQs), and DEP contact information.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">These subpages also link to information in a July 2012 \u201cGuidance Document For Requests Pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1B\u201d that provides specific instructions to waiver applicants, including what they should \u201cconsider,\u201d and what statements, reports, demonstrations, or other evidence they need to submit prior to DEP\u2019s review and evaluation. For example, this guidance document requires the waiver applicant to describe with specificity the circumstances that give rise to the exceptional hardship and/or excessive cost claims. It also declares that applicants seeking to qualify on the basis of net environmental benefit will be required to submit a detailed statement that compares the environmental benefit of the natural resource or related environmental good protected, which would be waived, to the environmental offset that would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>provided. And it states that a waiver based on conflicting rules will only be granted on the basis of impossibility (\u201ccannot physically or temporally comply with both rules\u201d) or impracticability (\u201cpossible to comply with both rules but extremely or unreasonably difficult to do so\u201d). Lastly, the document states which specific authority is required to declare the public emergency that can lead to waiver of a regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">To help applicants comply with notice requirements, DEP\u2019s website provides a link to a public notice rules summary chart, since waiver requests, pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.3, must contain proof that the applicant complied with any public notice requirements applicable to the underlying program rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The website\u2019s subpages also contain another guidance document, \u201cGuidance for Delegation, Authorization, and Assumption,\u201d listing which \u201cprogram rules ... in whole, or in part,\u201d are not available for regulatory waivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Additionally, DEP\u2019s subpage of FAQs lists twenty-nine general questions and answers, concerning specific administrative procedures for applicants. For example, one question is whether \u201can approved waiver [is] transferable to another party.\u201d Other questions concern how DEP will inform the public and applicants on waiver applications, and whether the public will have an opportunity to comment on waiver requests.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Another FAQs subpage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>involves program-specific questions and answers concerning an applicant\u2019s compliance with DEP\u2019s compliance and enforcement, environmental management, land use regulation, site remediation, and water resource management programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Appellants contend that DEP\u2019s \u201cblanket\u201d waiver rules are ultra vires because, although the Legislature has expressly authorized specific statutory exemptions in very limited \u201cprogram specific\u201d instances, there is no comprehensive legislative scheme allowing for a broad, single-set relaxation rule of universal application. DEP and amici counter that such authority is implied in various enabling laws the agency has been mandated to execute and is incidental to the extensive regulatory powers vested in the agency by those laws. In other words, DEP maintains that \u201c[w]here the Department has the authority to promulgate rules, it also has the authority to modify or waive those rules, provided that the modification or waiver does not violate a statutory requirement or purpose.\u201d 44 <em>N.J.R. </em>987.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In deciding this issue, we first look to some well-established standards for reviewing the validity of an agency\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Agency regulations are accorded a presumption of validity and reasonableness. <em>In re Petition of N.J.

Ass\u2019n of Nurse Anesthetists, Inc. v. N.J. State Bd. of Med. Exam\u2019rs, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>605, 610, 875 A.2d 247 (2005). \u201cOur function is to rule on whether the subject matter falls within the substantive authority delegated to the agency and whether the rule was enacted in accordance with applicable legal principles.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In this regard, the promulgation of administrative rules and regulations lies at the very heart of the administrative process, permitting \u201cexpert and flexible control in areas where the diversity of circumstances and situations to be encountered forbids the enactment of legislation anticipating every possible problem which may arise and providing for its solution.\u201d <em>Cammarata v. Essex Co. Park Comm., </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>404, 410, 140 A.2d 397 (1958). As such, \u201c[t]he basic purpose of establishing agencies to consider and promulgate rules is to delegate the primary authority of implementing policy in a specialized area to governmental bodies with the staff, resources and expertise to understand and solve those specialized problems.\u201d <em>Bergen Pines Cnty. Hosp., supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 474, 476 A.2d 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">One of the acknowledged advantages of the administrative process \u201chas been its flexibility in enabling administrators to deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>justly with unanticipated as well as anticipated situations in accordance with general legislative guides.\u201d <em>Ward v. Scott, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>117, 127, 93 A.2d 385 (1952). Administrative agencies are entitled to change their interpretation of a statute over time. <em>Glukowsky v.

It has elasticity that permits it to adapt to changing circumstances and conditions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Obviously, such flexibility is not without limits and does not allow an agency to be operated in a manner unfaithful to the governing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Consequently, \u201c[i]n reviewing agency action, the fundamental consideration is that a court may not substitute its judgment for the expertise of an agency \u2018so long as that action is statutorily authorized and not otherwise defective because arbitrary or unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v.

As previously noted, the Legislature has expressly authorized specific statutory waivers and/or exemptions in limited instances in various comprehensive legislative acts. For example, in the Flood Hazard Area Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:16A-55(b) states that \u201c[provision shall be made by the department for the waiver, according to definite criteria, of strict compliance with the rules and regulations, where necessary to alleviate hardship.\u201d <em>See also, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-4 (Solid Waste Management Act); <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:lE-48.4(b) (Comprehensive Regulated Medical Waste Management Act); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1K-11.4 (Industrial Site Recovery Act); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-18(a) (Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-5.3 and -6 (Coastal Area Facility Review Act (\u201cCAFRA\u201d)); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:20-33(b) (Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act); <em>N.J.S.A </em>26:2C-9.8(b) (Air Pollution Control Act); <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:10B-2(b) (Brownfield and Contaminated Site Remediation Act), <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:12A-5 (Safe Water Drinking Act). Consequently, DEP has adopted waiver provisions in regulations relating to these particular environmental policies. <em>See, e.g., N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-1.10 (takings waiver in Coastal Permit Program Rules); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:13-9.8 (hardship waiver in Flood Hazard Area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Control Act Rules); <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-17.1 (takings waiver in Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act Rules); <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-5.25(g) and (h) (hardship waivers in Water Quality Management Planning Rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Appellants point to these provisions as evidence that when the Legislature intends to delegate such waiver authority to DEP, it does so clearly, explicitly, and selectively. To be sure, \u201cwhen the Legislature includes limiting language in one part of a statute, but leaves it out of another section in which the limit could have been included, [our courts] infer that the omission was intentional.\u201d <em>Ryan v. Renny, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>37, 58, 999 A.2d 427 (2010). Indeed, we \u201cneed not strain to import that requirement where it is not.\u201d <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Prot. Act Rules, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 852 A.2d 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">By the same token, a reviewing court \u201cmay consider the entire enabling legislation in order to ascertain \u2018if there is in fact sufficient underlying authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Guild, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 561, 384 A.2d 795 (quoting <em>In re Weston, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>258, 263, 176 A.2d 479 (1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>369 <em>U.S. </em>864, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>1029, 8 L.Ed.2d 84 (1962)). \u201cThe ultimate question is whether the agency\u2019s interpretation is permissible under the broad language of the statute.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of N.J.AC. 7:26B, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 450, 608 A.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">So viewed, it becomes clear that in effectuating legislative policy, DEP has been entrusted with extensive rulemaking powers in both its originating statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:lD-9 (DEP \u201cshall formulate comprehensive policies for the conservation of the natural resources of the State, the promotion of environmental protection and the prevention of pollution of the environment of the State.\u201d), and in scores of comprehensive acts too numerous to enumerate. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-99.21f, -99.30, -99.35 (\u201cadopt rules and regulations necessary to implement [provisions of Solid Waste Management Act]\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-25(a) (adopt \u201cany rules and regulations necessary to implement [Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act]\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:lA-7.4(b) (adopt \u201crules and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>regulations necessary to implement [Water Supply Management Act]\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:11A-16 (adopt \u201cany rules and regulations necessary to implement [Water Quality Planning Act]\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:10A-4 (adopt \u201creasonable codes, rules and regulations\u201d to implement Water Pollution Control Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">DEP has implemented its rulemaking mandate by, at times, adopting wide-ranging regulatory frameworks applicable to multiple departmental programs under different statutes. 44 <em>N.J.R. </em>1015. For example, the Coastal Permit Program Rules, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7-l.l to -10.7, establish procedures by which DEP reviews permit applications and appeals from permit decisions under CAF-RA, the Wetlands Act of 1970, and the Waterfront Development Law. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>7:7-l.l(a). Indeed, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7-1.10 provides that DEP may, in its discretion, relax the procedures in those rules, and also that it may reconsider the application of substantive standards in the Coastal Zone Management Rules, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7E-1.1 to -8.22, which are used in reviewing permit applications under CAFRA, the Wetlands Act, and the Waterfront Development Law. Similarly, DEP\u2019s Stormwater Management Rules, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:8-l.l to -6.3, apply to programs under the Municipal Land Use Law, Water Quality Planning Act, the Water Pollution Control Act, the Flood Hazard Area Control Act, CAFRA, the Wetlands Act of 1970, the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, the Waterfront Development Law, and the Dam Safety Act. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-l.l(a)-(b). And DEP\u2019s regulations at <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:18 govern the certification of laboratories performing sample analyses for compliance with many statutes, and establish the criteria and procedures that certified environmental laboratories must follow in collecting, handling, preserving, and analyzing regulatory samples in connection with various agency programs under many statutory acts. These include, but are not limited to the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Water Pollution Control Act, the Solid Waste Management Act, the Air Pollution Control Act, and the Industrial Site Recovery Act. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>7:18-l.l(a)(b)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Thus, although specific enabling statutes direct DEP to promulgate rules for the regulatory program created therein, there can be no question, given the overall legislative scheme, that DEP is empowered to adopt regulations more \u201cuniversal\u201d in nature and of more general applicability to deal comprehensively, in a single set of rules, with the sheer scope of overlapping statutory programs the agency must administer as well as with the volume of interconnected activities the Commissioner must coordinate amongst the agency\u2019s various divisions. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>13:lB-3(i) (The Commissioner has the authority to \u201c[c]o-ordinate the activities of the department ... in a manner designed to eliminate overlapping and duplicating functions.\u201d). Indeed, appellants point to no authority that DEP cannot cut across intramural boundaries by adopting department-wide rules to deal with overlapping concerns or subjects.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To the contrary, we have earlier upheld DEP\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>authority to adopt a uniform set of rules that apply to different environmental programs and rules under various statutes. <em>In re Stormwater Mgmt.

Nevertheless, on a more limited, program-specific basis, and in the absence of an express legislative grant or prohibition, courts have recognized the inherent authority of state agencies to waive their regulatory requirements through regulations adopted pursuant to the APA and which establish appropriate standards for the exercise of the agency\u2019s waiver decision-making, while still honoring requirements imposed by statutes or by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">One of the first published cases to address agency suspension of a regulation was <em>Iuppo v.

The court found that the Commissioner and the State Board were \u201cbound by duly promulgated rules and regulations,\u201d so \u201c[t]he legal issue [was] simply whether the State Board improperly suspended its regulation without formal amendment, or whether it merely interpreted and applied the existing regulation in the light of prevailing circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549, 394 A.2d 96 (citations omitted). The court found that the State Board\u2019s, decision had the effect of reading an exception into the regulation, which could only be accomplished through formal rulemaking pursuant to the APA. <em>Id. </em>at 550-52, 394 A.2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In <em>SMB Associates v.

In dicta, the Court declared: \u201cThe DEP would have better served the public interest had it adopted a regulation pertaining to the waiver of substantive considerations____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although it did not need to consider \u201cwhether an administrative agency has the inherent power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>waive its substantive regulations,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>the Court -nevertheless declared: \u201c[A]n agency that seeks the power to waive its substantive regulations should adopt a regulation pertaining to any such waiver and setting forth appropriate standards to govern agency decision-making,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 308, 704 A.2d 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Thereafter, in <em>County of Hudson v.

We view that authority as otherwise <em>implicit </em>in the Legislature\u2019s delegation of broad rule-making power to the agency. It is beyond cavil that an agency\u2019s \u201cauthority encompasses all express <em>and implied powers </em>necessary to fulfill the legislative scheme that the agency has been entrusted to administer.\u201d <em>In re Virtua-West Jersey Hosp., supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 422-23, 945 A.2d 692 (emphasis added); <em>see also N.J. League of Municipalities v. Dep\u2019t of Comm. Affairs, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>211, 223, 729 A.2d 21 (1999). In addition, \u201cthe absence of an express statutory authorization in the enabling legislation will not preclude administrative agency action where, by reasonable implication, that action can be said to promote or advance the policies and findings that served as the driving force for the enactment of the legislation.\u201d <em>A.A. Mastrangelo, Inc., supra, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>at 683-84, 449 A.2d 516; <em>see also E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. &amp; Energy, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 346, 661 A.2d 1314 (App.Div. 1995). For instance, no one can seriously question DEP\u2019s implied authority to waive one environmental regulation when it is in direct and irreconcilable conflict with another regulation applicable to that particular scope or location of development; otherwise, the agency\u2019s action in applying the regulations would be arbitrary. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-22. Thus, we readily imply such \u201cincidental powers as are necessary to effectuate fully the legislative intent.\u201d <em>N.J. League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 223, 729 A.2d 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We similarly reject appellants\u2019 argument that the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of waiver authority in some environmental statutes signals an intentional exclusion in all others. In the first place, those statutory provisions that specifically address waivers generally either limit DEP\u2019s authority by mandating that it grant certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>waivers<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or permit waivers of <em>statutory </em>mandates.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Neither, however, suggests a legislative intent to preclude waivers of rules within DEP\u2019s discretion where, as here, these waivers do not conflict with any statutory requirement. And, particularly where the waiver exemption is from a <em>statutory, </em>rather than a regulatory requirement, the need for express legislative explication is apparent. In any event, no court has suggested that express regulatory authority in one statute demonstrates a lack of implied authority elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">For all these reasons, we conclude that DEP did not act ultra vires in promulgating its comprehensive set of general waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>rules, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1B-1 to -2.4. This promulgation constituted a valid exercise of DEP\u2019s implied authority incidental to the extensive and expressly broad powers vested in the agency by the Legislature. Simply stated, the power to promulgate a regulation implies the incidental authority to suspend or waive its application in certain limited, well-defined circumstances provided such exemption does not circumvent any legislative enactment or purpose, or federal law, is consistent with the agency\u2019s statutory core mission and objectives, is accomplished through a properly adopted regulation pursuant to the APA, and establishes appropriate and clear standards for the exercise of agency discretion\u2014all qualifications and prerequisites that we next address.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Alternatively, appellants argue that even if the waiver rules fall within the scope of DEP\u2019s legislative authority, they nevertheless lack adequate regulatory standards to guide the discharge of agency discretion thereunder. DEP counters that the rules identify situations where waivers may be appropriate, incorporate readily ascertainable standards routinely used by the agency to administer its existing regulatory programs, and explicitly prohibit waivers from thirteen categories of existing regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">It is well-settled that a rule that does not contain a clear or objectively ascertainable standard may not be upheld. <em>In re Review of Admin.

Promulgation, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 415 A.2d 1147. \u201c[RJegulations must be flexible enough to accommodate the day-to-day changes in the area regulated.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The waiver rules at issue here make clear that they will be applied only in limited circumstances where an applicant establishes that it meets one of the four bases for consideration of a waiver request and demonstrates the compelling circumstances needed to satisfy the rule\u2019s criteria: namely, public emergencies, conflicts between regulations, undue hardship or production of a net environmental benefit, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lB-2.1(a). Appellants take issue with three of these criteria, arguing that they are vague and ill-defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Appellants first contend that the waiver rules fail to provide a method for calculating a \u201cnet environmental benefit.\u201d Specifically, they argue that DEP has provided \u201cno formula\u201d to determine how it will measure that benefit or the harm that might occur as a result of a given waiver, or how to weigh those two measurements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\u201cThere are some concepts which, by their nature, defy precise definition.\u201d <em>In re Revocation of Access of Block No.1901, Lot No. 1, Borough of Paramus, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 332, 735 A.2d 594 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied sub nom. In re Access of Block #1901 (Parkway 17 Assocs.), </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>664, 745 A.2d 1213 (1999). We consider \u201cnet environmental benefit\u201d to be one of those concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Even so, the regulatory definition of \u201cnet environmental benefit,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1B-1.2, articulates some criteria and generally describes an evaluative process of weighing both the qualitative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>and quantitative components of environmental benefits and detriments in light of the particular circumstances, resources, and activities involved. \u201c[W]here a regulation does provide some standards or criteria, a substantial degree of discretion allows the agency the flexibility to deal with the varying circumstances.\u201d <em>In re Crown/Vista Energy Project Boiler Stack No. 1, Log 01-92-0857, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>74, 84, 652 A.2d 212 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>277, 658 A.2d 301 (1995). Moreover, because the Commissioner necessarily will have to \u201carticulate the standards and principles that govern [his] discretionary decisions in as much detail as possible,\u201d <em>Van Holten Grp. v. Elizabethtown Water Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>48, 67, 577 A.2d 829 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), applicants and other parties with discernible interests will be able to challenge his waiver decisions and weighing of environmental benefits and harms.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Appellants find similar fault with the \u201cconflicts\u201d and \u201cunduly burdensome\u201d criteria. As noted, the waiver rules authorize DEP to waive a regulation when there are \u201c[c]onflicting rules,\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lB-2.1(a)(l), which DEP defines as \u201ca situation in which two or more Department rules, or a Department rule and the rule of another State agency or a Federal agency, conflict so as to make compliance with both rules impossible or impracticable[,]\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:1B-1.2. And the rules also authorize DEP to waive a regulation when \u201c[t]he strict compliance with the rule would be unduly burdensome,\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lB-2.1(a)(2), which is defined as involving either \u201cexceptional hardship\u201d or \u201cexcessive cost in relation to an alternative measure of compliance that achieves comparable or greater benefits to public health and safety of the environment^]\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:1B-1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In our view, the definition of \u201cconflicting rules\u201d is neither vague nor, as appellants argue, an \u201cinvitation to arbitrary decision-making.\u201d Whether or not the conflict between rules is facial or based upon express language, the waiver applicant must demonstrate a conflict as applied to a specific person, project, or property. Likewise, although the definition of \u201cunduly burdensome\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>rather broad, it nevertheless contains some standards, and language any more rigid may impede DEP\u2019s discretion and flexibility to review waiver applications. Significantly, with respect to all three of the challenged criteria or bases, the waiver rules incorporate regulatory standards that are routinely used by DEP to administer its various environmental programs, have been part of existing regulations whose validity has been uncontested and uncontroversial, and are thus presumed to be understood by the regulated community.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Moreover, the four bases upon which regulatory waiver relief may be predicated are further qualified and defined by the waiver evaluation criteria contained in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.2., the most significant of which requires the waiver to be consistent with DEP\u2019s core missions to maintain, protect, and enhance the State\u2019s natural resources, and to protect public health, safety, and welfare, and the environment. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.2(a)(6).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And even further delimiting is the fact that the waiver rules contain over a dozen explicit statutory categories where the corresponding regulations cannot be waived, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lB-2.1(b), the most significant of which expressly prohibits the waiver of any substantive or procedural requirements expressed in a federal or a state statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1B\u20142.1(b)(1); consequently, they do not amend, enlarge, alter, limit or circumvent any direct legislative pronouncement.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Lastly, appellants argue that the waiver rules do not expressly require, as another criterion, the waiver to be <em>consistent </em>with all applicable statutory requirements and criticize DEP\u2019s deletion of a proposed provision expressing such a requirement before formal adoption of the rules. <em>See </em>43 <em>N.J.R. </em>478.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We do not view this omission as fatal to the validity of the waiver rules inasmuch as this consideration is otherwise implicit therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">As noted, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.1(b) lists those agency regulations that cannot be waived under the waiver rules. Thus, weighing the consistency of an activity that would be authorized by a waiver with the purposes and objectives of statutory requirements is rendered unnecessary by the prohibition in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7.7B-2.1(b)(l) against the issuance of a waiver under these rules of any requirement or duty imposed by federal statute or regulation or by State statute unless the statute or regulation specifically provides for a waiver. Furthermore, as noted, DEP must consider under <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lB-2.2(6), whether the waiver would be consistent with DEP\u2019s \u201ccore missions\u201d to maintain, protect, and enhance the State\u2019s natural resources and to protect public health, safety, and welfare, and the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In sum, we conclude that the waiver rules contain adequate regulatory standards that guide DEP in deciding waiver applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We agree with appellants, however, that DEP has engaged in <em>de facto </em>rulemaking in violation of the APA\u2019s notice and comment requirements by posting on its website, after promulgation of the waiver rules, so-called \u201cguidance\u201d documents and FAQs. These postings collectively detail DEP\u2019s plans to develop internal processes and procedures to ensure consistency in its waiver decision-making, to create a priority system for its consideration of waiver requests, to expand transparency in noticing the receipt of applications for waivers, and to develop standardized submission forms. By explaining the waiver rules and describing what DEP will require applicants to submit to satisfy the waiver rules and receive a waiver grant, these postings go beyond merely facilitating administrative implementation of the rules as claimed by DEP and actually, to some extent, announce new substantive requirements, necessitating compliance with the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The inquiry whether an agency\u2019s actions constitute improper rulemaking is informed by well-settled principles. In the first place, and as already noted, agency action is presumed valid and a challenger bears the burden of rebutting that presumption. <em>Gloucester Cnty. Welfare Bd. v. State Civil Serv.

State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>62, 68, 533 A.2d 387 (1987). In fact, these \u201cfactors are relevant whenever the authority of an agency to act without conforming to the formal rulemaking requirements is questioned.\u201d <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 97, 662 A.2d 367 (1995). And they \u201cneed not be given the same weight, and some factors will clearly be more relevant in a given situation than others.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">We recently invalidated a \u201cGuidance\u201d document promulgated by an administrative agency. In <em>In re Adoption of Regional Affordable Housing Development Program Guidelines, </em>418 <em>N.J.Super. </em>387, 391-95, 13 A.3d 900 (App.Div.2011), we concluded that the \u201cRegional Affordable Housing Development Program Guidelines\u201d issued by COAH set forth standards amounting to rules that should have been adopted in accordance with the APA\u2019s rulemaking procedures. And in <em>In re Highlands Master Plan, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 629-33, 25 A.3d 1172 we invalidated another \u201cGuidance\u201d document as <em>de facto </em>rulemaking in violation of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Here, DEP explained in its responses to commenters during the promulgation process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">There are two primary reasons the Department did not include detailed procedural requirements for waiver applications in the rules. First, most waiver applicants will also require other Department approvals and so must follow the application procedures to obtain those approvals under the applicable program rules. A waiver application in the context of applying for another approval would most likely need to contain information compare-able to that necessary for the application for the particular approval. Second, these rules will apply to a wide variety of situations. In each case, reviewing the four requisite bases at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.1(a) for consideration of a waiver and the waiver evaluation criteria in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>rules, the applicant will know what types of documentation will serve to demonstrate how waiver of a particular rule provision applicable to a particular activity in the applicant\u2019s case will meet the requirements for a waiver under the rules. If the Department does not receive sufficient information and data to support a waiver under these waiver rules, or if it does not receive such information in a timely manner, the waiver request will be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">[44 <em>N.J.R. </em>1017.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Nevertheless, DEP declared that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">will also be posting on its website information regarding the implementation of the waiver rules and other information regarding waiver decisions pursuant to these rules____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">The Department is developing an internal review process to ensure consistency in the Department\u2019s future review and disposition of waiver applications pursuant to these rules. The Department believes that this process, coupled with the substantive standards, decision-making criteria; and limitations in the rules and the posting of notice of waiver decisions and information pursuant to these rules, will result in coherent, principled, and consistent consideration and disposition of waiver applications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">[44 <em>N.J.R. </em>994-95.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">For example, in DEP\u2019s \u201cGuidance Document For Requests Pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1B,\u201d DEP lists specific procedures and instructions that waiver applicants should follow to prove and satisfy each of the four bases for waivers under <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lB-2.1(a). One such listing reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">\n<em>Unduly Burdensome</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">The Unduly Burdensome definition contains two separate and distinct provisions that an applicant can request a waiver under. An applicant may provide information for one, or both, provisions as part of a waiver request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">For all Unduly Burdensome requests, if the underlying program rules for which a waiver is being sought contains a waiver, variance, or exemption provision, the applicant requesting a waiver on the Unduly Burdensome basis should explain the reasons for not availing itself of such existing provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">\n<em>1. Actual, exceptional hardship for a particular project, or activity, or property</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au8\">\u2022 A statement detailing how the circumstances give rise to an exceptional hardship and how a waiver request will alleviate this hardship. For example, the specific circumstances an applicant may identify include, but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">\u2022 Exceptional topographic, physical, or chemical conditions or features uniquely affecting a specific piece of property, or structures thereon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-16\">\u2022 An extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely affecting a specific piece of property, or structures existing thereon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-17\">\u2022 Technical impracticability of treatment technologies for the particular project, activity, or property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u2022 Temporal or other non-physical characteristics unique to the particular project, activity, or property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u2022 Other unique circumstances associated with the particular project, activity, or property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\n<em>2. Excessive cost in relation to an alternative measure of compliance that achieves comparable or greater benefits to public health and safety or the environment</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">\u2022 A statement of specific facts supporting an alternative measure:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">\u2022 An explanation of the benefit to public health and safety or the environment of strict compliance of the rules sought to be waived; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">\u2022 A description of the alternative measure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">\u2022 An explanation of the benefit to public health and safety or the environment of the alternative measure of compliance; and[ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">\u2022 A discussion comparing how the alternative measure of compliance provides comparable or greater benefit to public health and safety, or the environment than strict compliance with the rule sought to be waived</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">\u2022 A statement of specific facts detailing costs of compliance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-14\">\u2022 Detail the expected cost of strict compliance with the rule sought to be waived; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">\u2022 Detail the expected cost of the alternative measure of compliance with the rule sought to be waived, including any costs or benefits to potentially affected individuals or community; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-16\">\u2022 A discussion comparing the costs of strict compliance and the alternative measure of compliance</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">The other listings in that guidance document are similar in scope and detail of instructions. Also, the document explains the various evaluation criteria and identifies other reports and documents an applicant should consider supplying to DEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-18\">In our view, all six of the <em>Metromedia </em>factors apply to the guidance documents and to much of DEP\u2019s website here. The information posted is intended to have wide coverage, applying not only to all persons seeking a waiver of DEP\u2019s regulations, but to the entire regulated community and the public in general. Moreover, it is drafted so as to be applied generally and uniformly for all future waiver applications. Factors four and five of <em>Metromedia </em>especially are key, because this information prescribes procedures, agency policies, and directives concerning application submissions and evaluations that are not otherwise expressly provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>by or obviously inferable from the waiver rules themselves or from any statute or other regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In fact, despite DEP\u2019s attempts to validate each of its online documents, nowhere in the waiver rules does the agency explain what specific materials should be submitted with a waiver application, what materials it will consider for application completion or waiver approval, or how it will conduct its review. Furthermore, since the waiver rules have universal and comprehensive application to many of DEP\u2019s independent regulatory schemes, we are simply unpersuaded by DEP\u2019s claims that it is only requiring what applicants seeking to waive regulation in those schemes already need to submit. That is, the existing standards and procedures in each statutory scheme. Administrative agency action and an agency\u2019s discretionary choice of the procedural mode of action are valid only when there is compliance with the APA. <em>Nw. Covenant Med. Ctr. v. Fishman, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>123, 137, 770 A.2d 233 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Simply put, as DEP\u2019s own explanation makes clear, these postings do more than implement the waiver rule; they establish rules of the game. By elaborating upon and clarifying the very standards by which applicants will be held and the outcomes of their applications determined, these newly posted measures will have a substantial impact on the regulated community as well as the public in general. As such, they form integral, substantive components of the waiver rules, subject to rulemaking in accordance with the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In this regard, DEP\u2019s plans to develop so-called \u201cinternal\u201d processes to ensure consistency of decision-making, prioritization of applications, transparency of review and standardization of forms provide the missing links in the waiver rules\u2019 four predicate bases for relief and their accompanying \u201cevaluation criteria.\u201d These processes carry the very real potential to determine when an application will be considered and when a waiver will be granted or denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">For instance, a process that ensures consistency of result is not exclusively \u201cinternal\u201d but necessarily sets the external criteria by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>which the agency decides when a conflict of rules becomes \u201cimpracticable,\u201d or a cost, unduly \u201cexcessive,\u201d or the limits of its definition of \u201cnet environmental benefit\u201d have been reached. These standards, in turn, establish \u201cthe essential quality of fairly predictable decisions,\u201d <em>Boiler Beverages, Inc., supra, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 152, 183 A.2d 64, and therefore must be the product of rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">This same reasoning equally applies to DEP\u2019s development of standardized submission forms. Although they may not directly impact the substantive rights of the regulated community or the public at large, these forms nevertheless will fill in the interstitial gaps in the waiver rules that nowhere detail the type, nature, scope, or amount of evidence required to decide a waiver application. These missing links, we conclude, must be developed by DEP through notice and comment rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Finally, like appellants, we remain unconvinced by DEP\u2019s attempt to rehabilitate its web postings created after promulgating the rules by asserting additional explanations in its brief. An appellate brief is no place for an agency to try and rehabilitate its actions. <em>In re Petition of Elizabethtown Water Co. for an Increase in Rates, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>440, 460, 527 A.2d 354 (1987) (agency orders not judged on \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d documents \u201cpurporting to explain\u201d actions taken) (citing <em>Sec. &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 <em>U.S. </em>80, 87, 63 <em>S.Ct. </em>454, 459, 87 <em>L.Ed. </em>626, 633 (1943)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">We emphasize, however, that DEP\u2019s lack of an adequately promulgated internal review process does not fatally flaw the entire waiver regulatory scheme. On this score, we reiterate our view that there are sufficient substantive standards in the waiver rules for applicants to submit, and the decision-maker to evaluate, waiver applications. The rules set forth a statement of purpose emphasizing that waivers shall be consistent with DEP\u2019s core missions, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1B-I.l(a), establish that only four limited situations, or bases, will be considered to grant a waiver, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lB-2.1(a), and provide detailed criteria that must be applied by the final decision-maker in his or her review and evaluation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>waiver applications, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.2(a). The rules also impose limitations curbing the discretion to grant any waiver application, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.1(b) and 2.4. Thus, even without the guidance documents and FAQs listed on DEP\u2019s website, the waiver rules provide adequate standards and safeguards to inform the public and guide the agency as to how decisions will be made under the new rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Accordingly, we uphold DEP\u2019s authority to promulgate waiver rules and affirm the waiver rules, as written and adopted. We invalidate the documents on DEP\u2019s website, to the extent they go beyond the terms of the regulations themselves, as <em>de facto </em>rulemaking without APA compliance.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\"> Over 528 persons submitted written and/or oral comments, with the majority opposing the proposal. 44 <em>N.J.R. </em>982-86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\"> Appellant Michael Perlmutter filed a separate appeal and the two appeals were administratively listed as back-to-back for calendaring purposes (hereinafter, \"appellants\u201d refers to all appellants in both appeals, unless named individually).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\"> The Commissioner denied appellants\u2019 motion for a stay and interim relief as did this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b136-10\">E02 was thereafter published in the <em>New Jersey Register </em>on February 16, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b140-11\"> Also, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.2 lists various criteria that DEP must consider and evaluate before granting a waiver request; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.3 lists notice requirements for waiver applicants and for DEP; and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.4 lists what must be included in DEP\u2019s decision approving or denying the request, and the effects and limitations of an approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b140-12\"> <em>See </em>DEP's Waiver Rule, http://www.state.nj.us/dep/waiverrule/ (last visited Feb. 20, 2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\"> With regard to the transparency with which waiver applications will be evaluated, the Commissioner has assured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">As stated at <em>NJ.A.C. </em>7:lB-2.3(b) and (c) of the Waiver Rule, the Department will publish notice of its determination to consider all waiver requests and its ultimate decision on each waiver request in the following ways: on the DEP's Waiver webpage ... and, where appropriate, in the DEP Bulletin (which is an on-line publication) for waiver requests/decisions relating to a rule for which the Department publishes notice of permit decisions in the DEP Bulletin.

Because the policies and objectives of each statute within DEP's authority vary, it makes little sense to analyze the agency's core missions here in the abstract.
