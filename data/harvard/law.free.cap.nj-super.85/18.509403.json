B.. </em>4:55-7(c), had a priority over a federal tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">The mortgage foreclosed was executed by the taxpayer to-respondent Camptown Savings <em>&amp; </em>Loan Association (hereafter Camptown) and recorded in 1954. On May 29, 1962 the District Director of Internal Revenue filed in the Union County Eegister\u2019s Office a federal tax lien against the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The mortgage fell into default in December 1962. Camp-town instituted foreclosure on March 25, 1963, asking the court to allow a counsel fee pursuant to <em>R. R. </em>4:55-7 (c). The United States was made a party defendant because of the tax lien. The final judgment of foreclosure entered by the Chancery Division on August 7, 1963 awarded Camptown a counsel fee of $167.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">A mortgagee is given certain protection against federal tax liens by 26 <em>U. S. C. </em>\u00a7 6323. The construction of that section and the priority of federal versus state liens are governed by federal and not state law. <em>United States v. Gilbert Associ</em>ates., 345 <em>U. S. </em>361, 73 <em>S. Ct. </em>701, 97 <em>L. Ed. </em>1071 (1953). Under the facts above stated, the federal tax lien had priority. <em>United States v. Pioneer American Ins. Co., </em>374 <em>U. S. </em>84, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1651, 10 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>770 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Camptown argues that <em>Pioneer </em>is distinguishable because in New Jersey the amount of the fee is fixed by a rule which has the force of a statute; the amount provided for by that rule is fixed and definite, and not merely a \u201creasonable\u201d fee, as was provided for in the mortgage in <em>Pioneer; </em>and, because the fee is fixed by rule, it is an \u201cadministration expense.\u201d Finally, Camptown argues that since the sale of the foreclosed property produced an amount over and above the amount due it, exclusive of the attorney\u2019s fee (but not enough to pay the federal lien in full), the surplus constitutes a \u201cfund in court\u201d within the meaning of <em>R. R. </em>4:55-7(b) and therefore the fee is entitled to priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We find no merit in any of these arguments. It is admitted that the attorney did not create, benefit or protect the so-called fund, and he \u201cadministered\u201d nothing. That the fee is provided for by rule or statute is immaterial. <em>Cf. United States v. Buffalo Savings Bank, </em>371 <em>U. S. </em>228, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>314, 9 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>283 (1963). That <em>R. R. </em>4:55-7 (c) sets forth the precise percentage which is to be allowed is also immaterial in the case at bar, for, when the federal tax lien was filed, the mortgage was not even in default. The amount of counsel fee could not become certain until after the mortgage fell into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>default, was foreclosed and the amount due the mortgagee (and the fee) was adjudged by the court. Here that did not happen until long after the federal tax lien was filed. Assuming that an attorney\u2019s fee may, under proper circumstances, be entitled to priority, the lien here was not \u201cchoate\u201d as is required to give a lien priority. <em>United States v. New Britain, </em>347 <em>U. S. </em>81, 74 <em>S. Ct. </em>367, 98 <em>L. Ed. </em>530 (1953); <em>Pioneer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Eeversed. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
