A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AQn\">This matter involves consolidated appeals from a decision of the Civil Service Commission and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>judgment o\u00ed the Superior Court. However, plaintiff concedes that the basic relief sought in both proceedings is identical and that this court\u2019s decision on the appeal and cross-appeal from the Superior Court judgment will for all practical purposes be dispositive of the entire matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Our review of the record satisfies us that there was substantial credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiff had not shown discrimination on the part of the township officials in not appointing plaintiff to the position of sergeant in the police department. It is argued that the opinion filed by the trial court actually found such discrimination to exist. However, the sense of the opinion is that while there were some instances of plaintiff\u2019s being dealt with severely because of his race, they did not add up to discrimination as such, and had not \u201cprevented plaintiff\u2019s promotion to the office of sergeant of police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"> The trial court determined that the September 1962 ordinance amendment fixing the number of sergeants at six was not adopted in bad faith and was applicable to plaintiff\u2019s suit. Therefore it concluded that \u201cno vacancy exists in the office of sergeant at this time.\u201d We agree with these findings and conclusions generally for the reasons stated by the trial court. Moreover, we conclude that plaintiff has not shown that a vacancy actually existed under the previous amended ordinance. Even had a vacancy been shown, it would have been discretionary with the township (considering the public good) as to whether or not such vacancy should be filled. <em>Marranca v. Harbo, </em>41 <em>N. J. </em>569, 575\u2014576 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The trial court also ruled that under <em>R. S. </em>11:22-33 the list containing plaintiff\u2019s name remained in existence \u201cduring the period that this action has been pending and, additionally, for a period of time equal to the period during which the action was pending.\u201d It also ordered that a second list could not be requested or promulgated until the first list had expired or been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Since the trial court\u2019s ruling, the Supreme Court decided <em>Marranca v. Harbo, supra, </em>and has given <em>R. S. </em>11:22-33 an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>interpretation contrary to that placed upon it by the trial court. In conformity with <em>Marranea </em>we hold that the list containing plaintiff\u2019s name expired July 22, 1962, the latest authorized date of extension. The trial court\u2019s ruling prohibiting the promulgation or requesting of a new list until the expiration or exhaustion of the old list therefore becomes moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The judgment of the Superior Court is modified as herein indicated and, as modified, is affirmed. Fo costs to any party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
