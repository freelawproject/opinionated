Braslaw, following a jury trial, was found guilty of raping an intoxicated person (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(3)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, he contends the trial court should have given further jury instructions on a defendant\u2019s belief in the victim\u2019s capacity to consent and should have instructed on attempted rape. He also claims his counsel was ineffective in failing to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct. In the published portion of this decision, we conclude there was no instructional error. In the unpublished portion, we reject the claim of ineffective assistance. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">Defendant and Jane Doe<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were classmates at a vocational school in St. Helena. Doe lived in a school dormitory. Defendant lived off campus in a house notorious for wild parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">In January 2012, Doe and her former roommate, M.H., attended a party at defendant\u2019s house. Doe became \u201creally drunk.\u201d One moment she was hanging out with friends; the next thing she recalled was being unclothed in a shower.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-11\">M.H. testified Doe, while playing a drinking game, \u201chit a wall,\u201d sat down, and stopped talking. M.H.\u2019s boyfriend took Doe upstairs so she could sleep. Doe then vomited, and M.H., the boyfriend, and defendant assisted with cleanup. M.H. and her boyfriend got Doe undressed and into the shower. Doe, according to M.H. was \u201ccompletely gone\u201d- \u2014 just dead weight, not really aware of anything. Defendant was also drunk, but his level of intoxication was not comparable to Doe\u2019s, as defendant was coherent and functional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>While in the shower, Doe saw M.H. and the boyfriend leave the bathroom, and saw defendant had entered. Defendant, also unclothed, came into the shower and asked if it was \u201cgonna be awkward.\u201d Doe recalled saying \u201cno\u201d and being confused about what defendant intended to do, but thought he might help her bathe. She remembered nothing else in detail about what happened in the shower. Afterwards, M.H. dressed Doe in a sweater, nothing more, and placed her in a spare trundle bed in the boyfriend\u2019s bedroom. Doe had no recollection of being dressed in the sweater or placed in the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">M.H. and her boyfriend then retired to his bed. Although the lights in the bedroom were out, M.H. saw defendant enter the bedroom and \u201ccollapse\u201d or \u201cflop\u201d (not crawl) onto Doe\u2019s bed. M.H. asked her boyfriend to get a condom. Overhearing, defendant asked, in what M.H. perceived as a joking tone, if he could have one too. The boyfriend got out of bed, asked if Doe and defendant were okay, and returned to bed with a condom. M.H. and her boyfriend began having sex when, \u201c[a] short amount of time\u201d later, M.H. heard Doe scream \u201cno, no, no.\u201d M.H. got up and saw defendant \u201cjump\u201d back, heard him say something like \u201cokay, okay, I\u2019ll stop,\u201d and saw him run out of the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">Doe had no recollection of anything going on in the bedroom until \u201clooking up\u201d and seeing defendant \u201con top of me.\u201d He was \u201cmoving back and forth,\u201d and she felt his penis inside her vagina. She recalls \u201ccrying and just like \u2014 he left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Doe did not, immediately following the encounter with defendant, discuss being penetrated \u2014 for example, penetration did not come up when she subsequently spoke to M.H., or when she phoned her then fianc\u00e9e, who is now her domestic partner. But the next day, when Doe visited a sexual assault nurse examiner for a sexual assault response team (SART) exam, she told the nurse she had been penetrated. The nurse found evidence of abrasions in Doe\u2019s posterior fourchette that were consistent with a \u201cmounting injury,\u201d but also consistent with Doe having certain types of intercourse with her fianc\u00e9e. The nurse also noted Doe was experiencing pain from urination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">In September 2012, the district attorney filed an information charging defendant with rape of an intoxicated person (\u00a7261, subd. (a)(3)) and attempted rape of an unconscious person (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(4)). On the district attorney\u2019s motion, the trial court dismissed the attempted rape charge, and the remaining charge went to the jury. Defendant was convicted, and the trial court sentenced him to three years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">Defendant raises three contentions on appeal: (1) the trial court should have instructed the jury a defendant is not guilty of rape of an intoxicated person if he reasonably believed the person had the capacity to consent; (2) the trial court should have instructed the jury on attempted rape of an intoxicated person; (3) and defendant\u2019s counsel should have objected to the prosecutor\u2019s assertion in closing argument that defendant was no longer presumed innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">A. <em>Reasonable Belief in Capacity to Consent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">The trial court instructed the jury with a version of CALCRIM No. 1002, which sets forth the elements of rape of an intoxicated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">In reading the instruction, the trial court told the jury such rape has the following elements: (1) defendant had sexual intercourse with a person; (2) defendant and the person were not married; (3) the effects of intoxicants prevented the person from resisting; and (4) \u201cdefendant knew or reasonably should have known that the effect of an intoxicating substance prevented [his alleged victim] from resisting.\u201d (See \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(3) [\u201cRape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person not the spouse of the perpetrator [\u00b6]... [][] (3) [w]here [the] person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this condition was known, or reasonably should have been known by the accused.\u201d].) The court further instructed that an intoxicating substance prevents resistance when it prevents the giving of legal consent \u2014 that is, \u201cconsent given freely and voluntarily by someone who knows the nature of the act involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court omitted a bracketed, optional portion of CALCRIM No. 1002, which reads: The defendant is not guilty of this crime if he actually and reasonably believed that the [alleged victim] was capable of consenting to sexual intercourse, even if that belief was wrong. The People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not actually and reasonably believe that the [alleged victim] was capable of consenting. If the People have not met this burden, you must find the defendant not guilty. (CALCRIM No. 1002.) The trial court found the evidence insufficient to support instructing the jury on defendant\u2019s reasonable belief in the capacity to consent theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">We generally review a trial court\u2019s denial of a requested instruction as a matter of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Larsen </em>(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 810, 824 [140 Cal.Rptr.3d 762].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>The trial court did not err in refusing to give the optional language of the instruction. The key evidence defendant marshals in support of his reasonable belief in the capacity to consent theory does not show a reasonable belief in Doe\u2019s <em>capacity </em>to consent. Defendant recounts how Doe, who was already so drunk she had vomited and had \u201chit a wall,\u201d had been put into the bathroom shower by her friends to cleanup. After the friends left, defendant, naked himself, entered the shower and asked if it was \u201cgonna be awkward,\u201d and Doe responded \u201cno.\u201d Defendant contends this exchange was sufficient for him to reasonably believe Doe was giving consent to intercourse sometime later that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">Even apart from the fact such a construction of the shower exchange is manifestly unreasonable, whether defendant believed Doe was consenting to intercourse sometime later in the evening is irrelevant if he did not also reasonably believe she was <em>capable of giving consent </em>to intercourse despite her intoxication. It is a reasonable belief in the victim\u2019s capacity to consent, not the consent, that provides a defense to rape of an intoxicated person. (See \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(3); CALCRIM No. 1002; <em>People v. Giardino </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 454, 460 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 315] [\u201cif the victim is so unsound of mind that he or she is incapable of giving legal consent, the fact that he or she may have given actual consent does not prevent a conviction of rape\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 471 [\u201cthe actual consent of the victim is not a defense to a charge of rape by intoxication, <em>a belief in the existence of such actual consent is </em>irrelevant\u201d (italics added)]; cf. <em>People v. Dancy </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 21, 36 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 898] [as to rape of an unconscious person who cannot resist, consent (or even belief in advance consent) is irrelevant if defendant knows the victim is unconscious].) Defendant points to no evidence regarding a belief in Doe\u2019s <em>capacity </em>to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">Even if there was an evidentiary basis for giving the additional language regarding actual and reasonable belief in the capacity to consent, the trial court\u2019s decision to omit it was not prejudicial error in light of the adequacy of the instructions it did give. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1512, 1529 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 110] <em>(Ramirez).) </em>In <em>Ramirez, </em>as here, the defendant faced a charge of rape of an intoxicated person. The jury was similarly instructed on the elements of the crime, including the fourth element, which requires proof the defendant <em>\u201cknew, or reasonably should have known, that [the alleged </em>victim] <em>was unable to resist due to her </em>intoxication.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant requested, but was denied, a general \u201cmistake of fact\u201d instruction based on the theory the defendant mistakenly believed his victim was sufficiently sober to resist.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Ramirez, </em>at p. 1527.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>The appellate court concluded there was no prejudicial error in failing to give the \u201cmistake of fact\u201d instruction. <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.4th at p. 1529.) The jury, in convicting the defendant, necessarily found true the fourth element of the crime. This finding \u2014 that the defendant reasonably should have known the victim could not resist (i.e., give consent) \u2014 meant the jury could not also have found, as a matter of logic, that the defendant had a reasonable belief the victim was capable of giving consent. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Put another way, \u201c[a] belief that the victim was able to resist could not be reasonable if the perpetrator \u2018reasonably should have known\u2019 that the victim was unable to resist.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the fourth element of the crime of rape of an intoxicated person necessarily addressed the defense of a reasonable mistake of fact as to whether the victim was too intoxicated to consent, and the trial court did not err in declining to give the more general-purpose mistake-of-fact instruction. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>People v. Giardino, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 472 [equating what are essentially the bracketed portion of CALCRIM No. 1002 and the fourth element referenced in that instruction]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Carrillo </em>(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1038 [78 Cal.Rptr.3d 138] [78 Cal.Rtpr.3d 138] [no prejudicial error if the jury necessarily resolved, under other instructions actually given, the issue that would have been raised by an omitted instruction].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">Although defendant here requested the optional \u201cactual and reasonable belief\u2019 language in CALCRIM No. 1002, and not the general mistake-of-fact instruction, this makes no material difference and requires no different result than in <em>Ramirez. </em>Both requested instructions would have served the same purpose of essentially rephrasing the requirement of element four in CALCRIM No. 1002, ensuring no defendant is convicted unless he knew or reasonably should have known the victim was incapable of giving consent due to intoxication.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Had defendant wanted to argue to the jury, in connection with the fourth element, that he had a reasonable belief the victim could consent, he was free to do so. Moreover, the jury in this case, by finding the fourth element true, necessarily found any belief by defendant that the victim had capacity to consent was unreasonable. We therefore conclude <em>Ramirez </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>governs this case and reject defendant\u2019s claim the trial court prejudicially erred by not giving the full CALCRIM No. 1002 instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">B. <em>Attempted Rape</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Defendant never requested, and the trial court never gave, a jury instruction on attempted rape of an intoxicated person. Nonetheless, he now asserts the trial court was obligated to instruct on attempted rape sua sponte, contending the crime is a lesser included offense of rape of an intoxicated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">Section 1159 provides: \u201cThe jury . . . may find the defendant guilty of any offense, the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which he is charged, or of an attempt to commit the offense.\u201d (\u00a7 1159.) While the \u201cdisjunctive language\u201d of the statute might suggest <em>both </em>lesser included offenses and attempts should be treated equally when it comes to the obligation to instruct sua sponte <em>(People v. Bailey </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 740, 752 [143 Cal.Rptr.3d 647, 279 P.3d 1120] <em>(Bailey); </em>see <em>People v. Hamlin </em>(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1412, 1454 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 402] [citing \u00a7 1159 as creating an obligation to instruct on attempt]), this is not so. Our Supreme Court has made the \u201cqualification that under section 1159, 1 \u201c[a] defendant may be convicted of an uncharged crime if, but only if, the uncharged crime is necessarily included in the charged crime.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at p. 752.) A trial court therefore has no sua sponte duty to instruct on attempt unless it is also a lesser included offense. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 753 [no duty to instruct on attempted escape because it had more specific intent requirement than crime of escape].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">\u201c \u2018[A] lesser offense is necessarily included in a greater offense if either the statutory elements of the greater offense, or the facts actually alleged in the accusatory pleading, include all the elements of the lesser offense, such that the greater cannot be committed without also committing the lesser.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Licas </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 362, 366 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 31, 159 P.3d 507] <em>(Licas).) </em>Where the accusatory pleading, as in this case, tracks the statutory language rather than reciting factual details of the offense, \u201conly the statutory elements test is relevant in determining if an uncharged crime is a lesser included offense of that charged.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moussabeck </em>(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 975, 981 [68 Cal.Rptr.3d 877].) We determine de nova whether one crime is a lesser included offense of another. <em>(Licas, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\"><em>Bailey, </em>applying the elements test, concluded attempted escape is not a lesser included offense of escape, and therefore a trial court has no sua sponte obligation to instruct on attempt when only a completed escape is charged. <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at pp. 749, 753.) Escape, reasoned <em>Bailey, </em>is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>general intent crime, while attempted escape requires proof of an additional element, namely specific intent to escape. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 749; see \u00a7 21a [attempt \u201cconsists of two elements: a specific intent to commit the crime, and a direct but ineffectual act done toward its commission\u201d].) The jury in <em>Bailey </em>rendered a verdict only on a charge of escape. So it never considered whether the defendant, when he sawed through prison barriers, acted with the specific intent to escape prison altogether or, as the defendant claimed, acted with the intent to enter another area of the prison to assault an inmate. (54 Cal.4th at pp. 745, 751, 754.) Only the former intent, not the latter, would support a conviction of attempted escape. Thus, the jury could reasonably have concluded the requisite specific intent for attempt was lacking. This left the court powerless to \u201creduce\u201d the defendant\u2019s otherwise erroneous conviction of escape, to one of attempted escape. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 754.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\"><em>Bailey </em>thus highlights a nonintuitive aspect of the relationship between attempts and completed crimes: while it might seem an attempt would naturally be a lesser included offense, this is not necessarily so. Attempts are only lesser included offenses if the sole distinction between the attempt and the completed offense is completion of the act constituting the crime. <em>(People v. Ngo </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 126, 156 [170 Cal.Rptr.3d 90] <em>(Ngo).) </em>If the attempt requires a heightened mental state, as is the case with attempts of many general intent crimes, the attempt requires proof of an additional element and is therefore not a lesser included offense. <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at p. 753 [\u201cwhere the attempted offense includes a particularized intent that goes beyond what is required by the completed offense,\u201d it is not a lesser included offense]; <em>People v. Strunk </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 265, 271 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 868] [\u201can attempt is a specific intent crime and does not fit within the definition of a necessarily included offense of a general intent crime\u201d]; <em>Ngo, </em>at p. 156 [\u201cwhen the completed offense is a general intent crime, an attempt to commit that offense does not meet the definition of a lesser included offense under the elements test because the attempted offense includes a specific intent element not included in the complete offense\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Under the <em>Bailey </em>framework and elements test, attempted rape of an intoxicated person is not a lesser included offense of rape of an intoxicated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">Rape of an intoxicated person (\u00a7261, subd. (a)(3)) is a general intent crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Linwood </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 59,70 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 73] <em>(Linwood).) </em>This is so even though there is an additional knowledge requirement \u2014 that \u201cthe accused either must have known or reasonably should have known of the victim\u2019s particular condition that precluded consent.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 71; see \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(3).) In other words, the general intent and knowledge requirements are separate elements, and the latter does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>transform rape of an intoxicated person into a specific intent crime. <em>(Linwood, </em>at p. 70.) Thus, rape of an intoxicated person requires both (1) intent to engage in sexual intercourse and (2) either actual knowledge of the intoxicated victim\u2019s incapacity or negligent belief the victim had the capacity to consent. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 70-71; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Dancy, supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th at p. 37 [under \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(4), defendant must have intent to have intercourse, plus constructive knowledge victim is unconscious of nature of act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Attempted rape, in accord with section 21a governing attempts, \u201chas two elements: (1) the-specific intent to commit the crime of rape and (2) a direct, although ineffectual, act toward its commission.\u201d <em>(People v. Clark </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 948 [131 Cal.Rptr.3d 225, 261 P.3d 243].) The mere intent to have sexual contact is not a sufficiently culpable mental state for attempted rape. As to attempted forcible rape, \u201c[i]ntent to commit [that crime] requires (1) the intent to commit the act of sexual intercourse; (2) against the will of the victim [citation]; (3) by any of the means described in section 261, subdivision (a)(2),\u201d namely \u201c \u2018violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 620, 633 [122 Cal.Rptr.3d 117, 248 P.3d 651] <em>(Lee); </em>see \u00a7261, subd. (a)(2); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 509 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119] [\u201c \u2018The essential element of [assault with intent to commit rape] is the intent to commit the act against the will of the complainant. The offense is complete if at any moment during the assault the accused intends to use whatever force may be required.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People v. Dillon </em>(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1378 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 449] <em>(Dillon) </em>[the crime of assault with intent to rape \u201crequires not only the specific intent to commit the underlying sexual act, but a specific intent to commit that act without the consent of the victim\u201d]; <em>Hall v. Cullen </em>(N.D.Cal., July 29, 2010, No. C 09-5299 PJH) 2010 WL 2991663, pp. *1, *16-* 18 [granting habeas corpus relief following <em>Dillon, </em>because jury instructions had not clearly stated the defendant, to commit assault with intent to commit, sexual penetration, must have had the specific intent not only to touch the victim, but to do so without consent].) Extrapolating to the crime of attempted rape of an intoxicated person, a defendant, to be guilty, must not only intend to have intercourse, but to have intercourse with a person incapacitated by intoxication. (See \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">The significance of the different mental states required for attempted rape of an intoxicated person and actual rape is illustrated by the way in which a defendant\u2019s beliefs can affect guilt. As a specific intent crime, attempted rape of an intoxicated person hinges on a defendant\u2019s actual intent and, thus, is subject to a good faith, <em>unreasonable </em>mistake-of-fact defense. <em>(People v.

(See <em>Linwood, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at p. 71 [a defendant is guilty of rape of an intoxicated person despite a good faith belief in ability to consent so long as he <em>should have known </em>the victim lacked capacity]; see generally Use Note to CALJIC No. 4.35 [\u201cIn specific intent or mental state crimes, delete the bracketed phrase \u2018and reasonable.\u2019 Mistakes of fact, however, must be reasonable to negate general criminal intent.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">More follows from the categorization of rape and attempted rape as general and specific intent crimes. Intoxication can negate the required mental state of a specific intent crime, such as attempted rape of an intoxicated person. (\u00a7 29.4 (formerly \u00a7 22)); <em>People </em>v. <em>Atkins </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 76, 81-82 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 738, 18 P.3d 660] (Atkins); <em>People v.

Intoxication cannot, however, negate general intent, the mental state required for actual rape of an intoxicated person. (\u00a7 29.4, subds. (a)-(b) (former \u00a7 22) [\u201cEvidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>voluntary intoxication shall not be admitted to negate the capacity to form any mental states . . .\u201d such as \u201cpurpose, intent, [or] knowledge\u201d except such evidence \u201cis admissible ... on the issue of whether or not the defendant actually formed a required specific intent.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanley </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 700, 706 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 881] [voluntary intoxication cannot be used to support a defense to rape based upon a reasonable mistake of fact].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">In short, for a jury to find defendant guilty of attempted rape of an intoxicated person, the prosecution must prove an intent above, beyond, and apart from the mental state required for the completed crime. The facts of this case underscore the point. Throughout, defendant claimed he believed Doe consented to having intercourse and he had no intent of having sex against her will. If a jury had credited this assertion and found defendant did not have the requisite specific intent, it would have had to acquit him of attempted rape, regardless of the objective unreasonableness of his belief. That would not, however, preclude a conviction of actual rape. As to the completed crime, defendant\u2019s subjective belief was beside the point \u2014 if, as the jury found, he should have known the victim was incapable of freely giving consent. (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(3); see <em>People v. Williams </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 354, 361 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 841 P.2d 961] [mistaken belief in consent must be objectively reasonable to negate mental state required for completed rape].) In other words, because of the significantly different intent requirements, a not guilty verdict on attempted rape of an intoxicated person is not inherently irreconcilable with a guilty verdict on actual rape of an intoxicated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Defendant points to two older Supreme Court cases which suggest attempted rape might, at least in some circumstances, be a lesser included offense of rape. In <em>Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at page 88, the court addressed the relationship between the crimes of arson and its lesser included offense, reckless burning. The defendant argued arson, as the more \u201cserious crime . . . should have a more culpable mental state.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In explaining why this was not necessarily so, the court, in dicta, gave this counterexample: \u201cattempted rape, a specific intent crime, is a lesser included offense of rape, a general intent crime.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In support of this statement, the court cited <em>People v. Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385] <em>(Kelly). </em>In <em>Kelly, </em>the defendant was convicted of forcible rape under section 261, but the evidence suggested he may not have penetrated the victim until after death. <em>(Kelly, </em>at pp. 511, 524.) As there can be no rape of a corpse, the trial court\u2019s instruction to the contrary was error. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 524, 527-528.) The court then stated: \u201cThe error would not, however, have affected a conviction of the lesser included offense of attempted rape. When a greater offense must be reversed, but a lesser included offense could be affirmed, we give the prosecutor the option of retrying the greater offense, or accepting a reduction to the lesser offense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 528.) The court assumed the prosecution, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>light of the ultimate affirmance of a death sentence on another charge, would simply accept the reduction. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">Neither the dicta in <em>Atkins </em>nor the expedient charge reduction in <em>Kelly </em>persuades us the analytical framework set out in <em>Bailey </em>is not controlling. Both <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Kelly </em>significantly predate <em>Bailey, </em>and neither applies the elements test set forth in that case. In fact, neither <em>Atkins </em>nor <em>Kelly </em>engaged in any analysis to establish that attempted rape is a lesser included offense of forcible rape. Furthermore, the Supreme Court, in other, more recent cases, has recognized that rape and attempted rape require different kinds of intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rundle </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 76, 138, fn. 29 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 454, 180 P.3d 224] [\u201c[W]e emphasize that defendant was charged with attempted forcible rape, which, unlike the crime of forcible rape, is a specific intent crime. [Citation.] Accordingly, in the following discussion, our references to the specific intent to commit rape are made in the context of discussing the sufficiency of the evidence of the charges in the present case, and do not implicate the basic distinction between the intent elements of attempted rape (specific intent) and rape (general intent).\u201d (italics omitted)], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Doolin, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 421, fn. 22; <em>People v. Jones </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1229, 1257 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 468, 64 P.3d 762] [noting various crimes the defendant could be convicted of depending on whether or not he harbored a specific rather than a general intent to rape]; see <em>Lee, supra, </em>51 Cal.4th at p. 633 [noting intent for attempted forcible rape requires more than intent to have intercourse].) Finally, <em>Bailey </em>itself marginalizes <em>Kelly, </em>noting it does not stand for the proposition that any attempt is a lesser included offense and explaining \u201c \u2018[t]he law of \u201cattempt\u201d is complex and fraught with intricacies and doctrinal divergences.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at p. 753.) Thus, even if <em>Kelly </em>\u201capplied the general principle that attempt is a lesser included offense of any completed crime\u201d that principle is <em>not </em>applicable \u201cwhere the attempted offense includes a particularized intent that goes beyond what is required by the completed offense.\u201d <em>(Bailey, </em>at p. 753.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">We therefore conclude <em>Bailey </em>is controlling and compels the conclusion attempted rape of an intoxicated person is not a lesser included offense of rape of an intoxicated person. The trial court was therefore not obligated to instruct, sua sponte, on attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">C. <em>Closing </em>Argument*</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>III.

CALCRIM No. 1000 thus, in its recitation of the elements, does not address mistake of fact. Accordingly, a specialized mistake-of-fact instruction, a <em>Mayberry </em>instruction (see <em>People v. Mayberry </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 143, 153-158 [125 Cal.Rptr. 745, 542 P.2d 1337]), is warranted when sufficient evidence suggests the defendant had an actual and reasonable belief in consent <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 337, 344 [103 Cal.Rptr.3d 101]).
