INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">In 2006, Mia Eriksson was a 17-year-old equestrian \u201ceventing competitor\u201d and the daughter of plaintiffs and appellants, Karan and Stan Eriksson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant and respondent, Kristi Nunnink, was Mia\u2019s riding coach. In November 2006, Mia\u2019s horse struck a hurdle during the cross-country portion of an event at Galway Downs in Temecula. With the Erikssons looking on, Mia fell off her horse and the horse fell on Mia, causing her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">The Erikssons sued Nunnink for wrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). The Erikssons alleged that Nunnink substantially increased the risk Mia reasonably assumed by, among other actions, allowing Mia to ride a horse that \u201cwas unfit to ride because of prior falls and lack of practice\u201d and concealing this condition from the Erikssons.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">In an earlier appeal, we reversed an order granting summary judgment for Nunnink. (See <em>Eriksson v. Nunnink </em>(2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 826 [120 Cal.Rptr.3d 90] <em>(Eriksson </em>I).) The case was thereafter tried to the court. After the presentation of the Erikssons\u2019 case-in-chief, the court granted Nunnink\u2019s motion for entry of judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 631.8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court relied, in part, on a release of liability entered into between Nunnink and Mia about six months prior to Mia\u2019s death. The Erikssons appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>The Erikssons contend that the release of liability is ambiguous and does not apply to their claims and that, based on the evidence presented and the applicable law, the court erred in granting Nunnink\u2019s motion for entry of judgment. In the published portion of our opinion, we hold the release is enforceable and can be asserted by Nunnink as a defense to the Erikssons\u2019 wrongful death and NIED claims and Nunnink can therefore be liable only if Mia\u2019s death was caused by Nunnink\u2019s gross negligence. In the unpublished portion, we conclude that the Erikssons failed to establish that Nunnink was grossly negligent. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">II. SUMMARY OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Eventing is an equestrian sport in which horse and rider compete in three events over three days. The dressage event takes place on the first day,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> cross-country on the second day, and show jumping on the third. The competitive eventing season runs from late January through November.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Different eventing organizations use different nomenclature for a competition\u2019s level of difficulty. International, or FBI (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale), competitions are classified as one-star, two-star, three-star, or four-star. National competitions under the auspices of the United States Equestrian Federation (USEE) include \u201cnovice,\u201d \u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cpreliminary,\u201d \u201cintermediate,\u201d and \u201cadvanced\u201d levels. A two-star cross-country event is longer and, according to Nunnink and Karan, more challenging than a USEE intermediate competition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Galway Downs competition where Mia died was a two-star competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">In a two-star event, the cross-country jumping course is approximately 4,800 meters long and involves jumps over numerous fences and other obstacles. In contrast to the fences used in the show jumping event, the fences on the cross-country course do not give way or fall down when struck by a horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Nunnink is a professional rider and eventing coach who has coached about 80 riders over 25 years. Nunnink said that her job as a coach is to \u201ccoach riders to ride their horses better.\u201d She explained that her students would not necessarily advance to a higher level merely by competing in a certain number of events. In fact, she would discourage her students from advancing before mastering their current level.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The Erikssons hired Nunnink to be Mia\u2019s eventing coach in 2001. In 2005 and 2006, Nunnink had two or three coaching sessions with Mia each week. The sessions took place at the Erikssons\u2019 Tahoe Meadows horse ranch in the Truckee area.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In May 2006, Mia and Nunnink entered into a release of liability agreement in which Mia agreed to release Nunnink from all liability except for damages caused by Nunnink\u2019s \u201cdirect, willful and wanton negligence.\u201d (This release is discussed in more detail below.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In planning for the eventing season, Nunnink and Mia would identify particular events they wanted to enter. The final decision would be made jointly by Nunnink, Karan, and Mia.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If Mia had difficulty at a given level of competition, Nunnink would make the decision to have Mia \u201cstep back\u201d to a lower level to be safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Mia aspired to be an Olympic rider. In early 2006, she told Nunnink of her goal to raise her level of competition by moving up through one-star and intermediate competitions to a two-star event. Nunnink thought Mia could make that progression.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In 2006, Mia competed in eight 3-day events prior to the Galway Downs event. The only horse Mia rode that year was Koryography, or Kory. Nunnink described Kory as talented and an \u201cupper-level horse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Mia\u2019s last four competitions prior to Galway Downs were (1) Rebecca Farms in July, (2) Woodside in August, (3) Twin Rivers in September, and (4) Ram Tap in October. All four competitions were rated intermediate. Prior to these events, Mia had never competed at that level. The Galway Downs competition would be Mia\u2019s and Kory\u2019s first two-star event.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">According to Nunnink, Mia had \u201crough\u201d rides at the Rebecca Farms and Woodside competitions in that Kory struck his knees on various jumps. At Twin Rivers in September, Kory \u201chook[ed] the stifle\u201d during the cross-country event. Nunnink explained that hooking a stifle occurs when the horse hits the uppermost portion of the rear legs against a fence during a jump. The incident caused swelling in the area of the injury. The Twin Rivers veterinarian indicated that Kory had a bruise and said they should put ice on it. The veterinarian said that if Kory \u201ctrotted sound\u201d in the morning he could show jump. Kory received no further medical attention at that time. The next day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Kory performed in the show-jumping event and, according to Nunnink, was \u201cfine.\u201d He did not receive any medication for the Twin Rivers injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">After Twin Rivers, Nunnink told Karan she wanted Mia to compete at Ram Tap, which was not on the original schedule. Karan agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">B. <em>Ram Tap</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The Ram Tap competition took place on October 20 through 22, 2006. During the cross-country event on the second day, Kory tripped and fell near the 18th jump. A Ram Tap event veterinarian, Dr. Liz Bracken, examined Kory. Dr. Bracken indicated that Kory had swelling and a hematoma on his chest and had suffered a concussion. She said they needed to watch him carefully. Kory was given Bute, an anti-inflammatory, and other medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">According to Karan, the evening after Kory\u2019s Ram Tap fall, she told Nunnink, \u201cWe\u2019re done,\u201d meaning that Mia\u2019s eventing season was finished. Nunnink did not argue, but told Karan she wanted Kory to jump a few fences the next morning so that Kory does not \u201cend on a fall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Dr. Bracken saw Kory again the next day. Nunnink was present during the examination. After the examination, Dr. Bracken indicated that Kory could do a few jumps that afternoon. Karan told Nunnink they could do these jumps, but they were then \u201cdone for the season.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Nunnink testified that Kory then performed about 30 jumps, including a jump over the fence where Kory fell, and had no problem with any of them. Karan, however, testified that Kory performed about six \u201centry-level\u201d jumps, and looked \u201crough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">After Kory returned to Tahoe Meadows, Karan cut back on Kory\u2019s \u201chigh-powered feed\u201d and replaced his competition horseshoes with \u201cregular\u201d shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">On October 25 or 26, Mia informed Nunnink that she and her parents had a family meeting and agreed that Mia could compete at Galway Downs. Karan, however, testified that she agreed to allow Mia and Kory to go to Galway Downs to compete in the dressage event only.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">Nunnink called a veterinarian to ask about the hematoma on Kory\u2019s chest, but Kory was not seen by a veterinarian. He was given medication through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Friday, October 27. Nunnink did not see any swelling or discharge from Kory\u2019s head injury. To Nunnink, Kory \u201cseemed perfectly healthy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Kory and Mia had an eventing lesson on October 29 and, in Nunnink\u2019s opinion, Kory jumped very well.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">On October 29, Nunnink trailered Kory to her facility in Auburn, where Kory stayed for the next two nights. During that time, Kory was not being administered any medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">On October 30, Mia and Kory performed jumps to prepare for Galway Downs. Nunnink thought the lesson went well. She testified that Karan observed the jumping session; Karan said she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">C. <em>Galway Downs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Galway Downs was, like other eventing competitions, a three-day event with dressage on Friday, cross-country jumping on Saturday, and show jumping on Sunday. The competition was scheduled for November 3 through 5, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Mia met the eligibility requirements to compete at Galway Downs based upon her results in prior competitions. Her entry form for the event, submitted after the Woodside event in August, included Karan\u2019s written consent. According to a Galway Downs official, Karan could have withdrawn her consent to Mia\u2019s participation in the event in person, over the telephone, or in an e-mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">On October 31, 2006, Mia and a friend trailered their horses to Galway Downs. It was Nunnink\u2019s understanding that Mia intended to compete. Nunnink arrived on November 2 and gave Mia a dressage lesson that afternoon. Stan drove to Galway Downs on November 2. Karan, believing that Mia would only compete in dressage, had decided not to travel to Galway Downs.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">Prior to the start of the Galway Downs event, the horses undergo an in-barn inspection, where they are checked by a veterinarian, and participate in a \u201ctrot out.\u201d Dr. Karen Nyrop was the veterinarian who conducted the Galway Downs in-bam inspection. She testified at trial that she noticed a bruise on Kory\u2019s chest and was aware that he had hit a fence at Ram Tap. The bruise was not inflamed and Kory showed no pain when Dr. Nyrop pressed on the bruise. She found nothing that required further treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">At the trot out, the horses are led by hand before a ground jury of two judges and a veterinarian. This is done to ensure that the horse is sound and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>not showing any signs of lameness. By rule, a horse may not compete if it is judged \u201cunfit, whether on account of lameness, lack of condition, or for any other reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Dr. Nyrop was also on the committee judging the Galway Downs trot out on November 2. She explained that being fit to compete does not require an absolutely perfect horse; the horse can be fit to compete so long as it \u201cis not significantly limping.\u201d She testified that she did not observe any significant lameness during Kory\u2019s trot out.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Wayne Quarles, the president of the ground jury, also observed the trot out. He testified that Kory passed the trot out without any dissention among the observers. Prior to testifying at trial, he viewed a videotape of Kory\u2019s Galway Downs trot out; he saw no signs of lameness in Kory and heard no sound of unevenness in his gait.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">On November 3, Mia and Kory performed in the dressage competition. In addition to judging the performance, dressage judges are expected to look for signs of lameness and unfitness. Quarles was one of the judges for Mia\u2019s dressage event. He saw nothing to suggest that Kory was lame or otherwise unfit to compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Nunnink and Stan watched Mia\u2019s dressage performance. Out of 45 dressage competitors, Mia placed 41st. Nunnink thought Mia performed well and told Mia she did a very good job riding Kory through a difficult task. It appeared to Stan that Mia was \u201cstruggling\u201d and \u201chaving problems,\u201d and he believed she made \u201cmany, many faults and many mistakes.\u201d He could not assess whether Kory was having problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">After the dressage event, Karan spoke with Mia by telephone. Mia indicated that they were going to participate in the cross-country event the next day, and that Nunnink said it was okay. Karan told Mia, \u201cYou guys are out of your mind,\u201d and told Mia to have Nunnink call her.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Nunnink called Karan that afternoon. She told Karan that Kory \u201cdid very well in his dressage\u201d and assured her that \u201c[ijt\u2019s fine.\u201d Karan told Nunnink, \u201c[ajbsolutely not,\u201d and that she was \u201con [her] way down there.\u201d That evening, Karan traveled by airplane from Sacramento to Galway Downs to, in her words, prevent Mia from competing.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">The next morning, Karan met with Mia and told her, \u201cYou\u2019re not running.\u201d Mia told Karan to talk to Nunnink and to not \u201c \u2018make a scene.\u2019 \u201d Karan then met with Nunnink. Nunnink believed Kory was physically sound and that both Kory and Mia were capable of performing. She told Karan that Kory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>had been jumping all week, that Mia was confident, and Kory was \u201cgood to go.\u201d Although Karan repeatedly told Nunnink \u201cno,\u201d Nunnink persuaded her to let Mia compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Karan testified that Nunnink\u2019s statement that Mia had done very well in dressage was determinative in Karan\u2019s final decision to allow Mia and Kory to perform. Nunnink testified she could not remember speaking to Karan about Mia\u2019s performance in dressage.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Karan and Stan watched Mia\u2019s cross-country run. Under the rules applicable at Galway Downs, a rider is penalized each time a horse refuses to make a required jump. A refusal includes not only the failure to make the jump, but also circling around to make a second approach before taking the jump. Once a rider has four refusals, the rider is eliminated from the competition. During her cross-country run, Kory had such refusals at fences 4, 5, 10A, 17A, and 17B. Upon the fourth refusal, Mia was, by rule, eliminated from competition and required to leave the course. However, she continued. Kory hit the fence at jump No. 19, causing a rotational fall \u2014 a fall in which the rear end of the horse comes up over its front end, causing the horse to land on its back. Kory fell on Mia, causing injuries that resulted in her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">D. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Grant of Nunnink\u2019s Section 631.8 Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Following the presentation of the Erikssons\u2019 case-in-chief, Nunnink moved for the entry of judgment pursuant to section 631.8. The trial court granted the motion. It thereafter filed a written statement of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The trial court found that the \u201crelease of liability\u201d was \u201cbinding upon, and enforceable against,\u201d the Erikssons. Under the release, Nunnink could only be liable if damages were caused by her \u201cdirect, willful and wanton negligence.\u201d The court found that Nunnink\u2019s negligence, if any, did not rise to that \u201clevel of recklessness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Regarding the Erikssons\u2019 wrongful death claims, the court specifically explained that these claims \u201care derivative of Mia\u2019s rights vis-a-vis Nunnink. Mia having expressly released her rights to assert any such claims against Nunnink, the [Erikssons\u2019] claims for wrongful death are barred by the terms of the release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">The court analyzed the NEED claims differently. These claims, the court explained, \u201care not derivative of the rights of Mia.\u201d However, because \u201cKoran signed the release as \u2018Rider\u2019s Parent,\u2019 \u201d \u201cthe release extends, not only to Mia, but also to Karan . . . .\u201d Because \u201cNunnink was not reckless,\u201d Karan\u2019s NIED claim failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>As for Stan\u2019s NIED claim, the court stated that the release agreement did not foreclose Stan\u2019s claim because he did not sign the release. Nevertheless, the court denied Stan\u2019s NEED claim because, based on the court\u2019s \u201cevaluation of the weight of the evidence, there [was] nothing that Ms. Nunnink did or omitted to do that materially increased the risk of harm to Mia . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">We disagree to some extent with the court\u2019s determinations, and conclude that although Karan\u2019s signature on the release as Mia\u2019s \u201cparent\u201d did not make her a party to the release and Mia cannot, by signing the release, waive a cause of action on behalf of her heirs, the release can nonetheless be asserted as a defense to her parents\u2019 wrongful death and bystander NEED claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">A. <em>The Release of Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">1. <em>Standard of Review and the Terms of the Release</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">While often referred to as a defense, a release of future liability is more appropriately characterized as an express assumption of the risk that negates the defendant\u2019s duty of care, an element of the plaintiff\u2019s case. \u201c[C]oses involving express assumption of risk are concerned with instances in which, as the result of an express agreement, the defendant owes no duty to protect the plaintiff from an injury-causing risk. Thus in this respect express assumption of risk properly can be viewed as analogous to primary assumption of risk. ... \u2018In its most basic sense, assumption of risk means that the plaintiff, in advance, has given his <em>express </em>consent to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him, and to take his chances of injury from a known risk arising from what the defendant is to do or leave undone .... <em>The result is that the defendant is relieved of legal duty to the plaintiff; and being under no duty, he cannot be charged with </em>negligence.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Knight v. Jewett </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 296, 308-309, fn. 4 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 834 P.2d 696]; see <em>Allabach v. Santa Clara County Fair Assn. </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1007, 1013 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 330]; <em>Cohen v. Five Brooks Stable </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1476, 1483 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 471].)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">\u201c \u2018The existence of a duty is a question of law for the court.\u2019 [Citation.] So is the interpretation of a written instrument where the interpretation does not turn on the credibility of extrinsic evidence. [Citation.] It therefore follows that we must independently determine whether the release in this case negated the duty element of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Allabach v. Santa Clara County Fair Assn., supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at p. 1011; see <em>Cohen v. Five Brooks Stable, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1483 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>[interpretation of a written release is a legal question which, in the absence of paroi evidence, is reviewed independently].)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">We begin by setting forth the relevant terms of the release:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\u201cThis RELEASE OF LIABILITY is made and entered into ... by and between KRISTI NUNNINK, hereinafter designated \u2018Trainer\u2019; and the below signed, hereinafter designated, \u2018Rider\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\u201cIn return for the use today, and on all future dates, of the property, facilities and services provided by Trainer, the Rider, their heirs, assigns and legal representatives, her[e]by expressly agree to the following: [\u00b6]... [][]</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\u201c3. Rider agrees to hold Trainer . . . completely harmless and not liable and release [Trainer] from all liability whatsoever, and AGREES NOT TO SUE them on account of or in connection with any claims, causes of action, injuries, damages, costs or expenses arising out of Rider\u2019s use of Trainer\u2019s services or facilities or presence upon any property used, including without limitation, those based on death, bodily injury, . . . except if the damages are caused by the direct, willful and wanton negligence of the Trainer. [\u00b6]... [][]</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">\u201c5. Rider agrees to indemnify Trainer against, and hold her harmless from, any and all claims, causes of action, damages, judgments, costs or expenses including attorney\u2019s fees, which in any way arise from Rider\u2019s use of Trainer[\u2019]s services or presence upon Trainer\u2019s facilities or property used by or with Trainer. [\u00b6]... [][]</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">\u201c9. When the Trainer, Rider and (if minor) Rider\u2019s parent sign this Release, it will then be irrevocable and binding on all parties, subject to the above terms and conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">The document is signed by Nunnink as \u201cTrainer,\u201d by Mia as \u201cRider,\u201d and by Karan as \u201cRider\u2019s Parent.\u201d Stan did not sign the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">2. <em>The Meaning of Karan\u2019s Signature as \u201cRider\u2019s Parent\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">Initially, we observe that Mia was 17 years old at the time she signed the release and at the time of her death. Although minors may enter into contracts (Earn. Code, \u00a7 6700), Family Code section 6710 provides that such contracts \u201cmay be disaffirmed by the minor before majority or within a reasonable time afterwards or, in case of the minor\u2019s death within that period, by the minor\u2019s heirs or personal representative.\u201d (Earn. Code, \u00a7 6710; see <em>Celli </em>v. <em>Sports Car Club of America, Inc. </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 511, 517 [105 Cal.Rptr. 904].) The purpose of this statute \u201cis to protect the minor from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>own improvidence.\u201d <em>(Hohe v. San Diego Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1559, 1564 [274 Cal.Rptr. 647].) However, courts have held that the right to disaffirm a minor\u2019s contract does not extend to a release of liability signed by a parent on behalf of the minor. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1564-1565; <em>Aaris v. Las Virgenes Unified School Dist. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1120 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 801].)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The release of liability was expressly \u201centered into\u201d by and between Nunnink (as \u201cTrainer\u201d) and Mia (as \u201cRider\u201d). It is also signed by Karan over the words, \u201cRider\u2019s Parent.\u201d According to paragraph 9 of the release, \u201c[w]hen the Trainer, Rider and (if minor) Rider\u2019s parent sign this Release, it will then be irrevocable and binding on all parties, subject to the above terms and conditions.\u201d By signing as Mia\u2019s parent, Karan approved of the terms of the release and understood that her signature made the release \u201cirrevocable and binding.\u201d Under these circumstances, the release could not be disaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Although Karan\u2019s signature prevented the agreement from being disaffirmed, it does not make her a party to the release. The parties are clearly identified in the first sentence: \u201cThis RELEASE OF LIABILITY is made and entered into ... by and between KRISTI NUNNINK, hereinafter designated \u2018Trainer\u2019; and the below signed, hereinafter designated \u2018Rider\u2019.\u201d The only designated \u201cRider\u201d is Mia. No other party is identified. Nor do the terms of the agreement obligate Karan in any way. Throughout the document, \u201cRider\u201d \u2014 and only \u201cRider\u201d \u2014 makes numerous promises, such as to assume risks, indemnify and hold Nunnink harmless, and release Nunnink from all liability. No promises, agreements, representations, or warranties are made by \u201cRider\u2019s Parent.\u201d Karan\u2019s only involvement in the agreement is to affirm, as the parent of a minor, that the release will \u201cbe irrevocable and binding on all parties\u201d \u2014 i.e., Nunnink and Mia. Karan is not, therefore, a party to the agreement or contractually bound to any of Mia\u2019s promises. (Cf. <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. </em>(2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 674, 680-681 [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 273] [Fourth Dist., Div.

As we explain below, the agreement can be asserted as a defense to the Erikssons\u2019 wrongful death and NIED claims. We must still, therefore, construe its terms and evaluate the Erikssons\u2019 argument that the release is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>3. <em>Interpretation of the Release</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">\u201c \u2018A written release may exculpate a tortfeasor from future negligence or misconduct.

[Citation.] Exculpatory agreements in the recreational sports context do not implicate the public interest and therefore are not void as against public policy. [Citations.] [(J[] The determination of whether a release contains ambiguities is a matter of contractual construction. [Citation.] \u201cAn ambiguity exists when a party can identify an alternative, semantically reasonable, candidate of meaning of a writing. [Citations.] An ambiguity can be patent, arising from the face of the writing, or latent, based on extrinsic evidence.\u201d [Citation.] ... If an ambiguity as to the scope of the release exists, it should normally be construed against the drafter.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cohen v. Five Brooks Stable, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1485.) \u201c \u2018If a release of all liability is given, the release applies to any negligence of the defendant. \u201c \u2018It is only necessary that the act of negligence, which results in injury to the releaser, be reasonably related to the object or purpose for which the release is given.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cAn act of negligence is reasonably related to the object or purpose for which the release was given if it is included within the express scope of the release.\u201d <em>(Benedek v. PLC Santa Monica </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1351, 1357-1358 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 197].)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Initially, we note that the document is titled, in bold print and capital letters, \u201cRELEASE OF LIABILITY.\u201d The unmistakable focus of the document is, generally, to protect Nunnink from liability arising from Mia\u2019s use of Nunnink\u2019s services and facilities. The terms of the release are not \u201cburied in a lengthy document, hidden among other verbiage, or so encumbered with other provisions as to be difficult to find.\u201d (See <em>Leon v. Family Fitness Center (#107), Inc. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1227, 1232 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 923].)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Paragraph 3 of the release is straightforward. Trimmed of extraneous verbiage, it provides: \u201cRider agrees to hold Trainer . . . completely harmless and not liable and release [her] from all liability whatsoever, and AGREES NOT TO SUE [her] on account of or in connection with any claims, causes of action, injuries, damages, costs or expenses arising out of Rider\u2019s use of Trainer\u2019s services . . ., including without limitation, those based on death [or] bodily injury, . . . except if the damages are caused by the direct, willful and wanton negligence of the Trainer.\u201d By providing for a release of \u201call liability whatsoever,\u201d the release plainly encompasses liability for <em>future </em>negligence as well as any previously committed torts. (See <em>Benedek v. PLC Santa Monica, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at p. 1357 [\u201cIf a release of all liability is given, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>release applies to any negligence of the defendant.\u201d].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In essence, Mia agreed that Nunnink would not be liable for any damages that arose from Nunnink\u2019s services except for damages caused by Nunnink\u2019s \u201cdirect, willful and wanton negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Paragraph 5 of the release agreement is substantially similar to paragraph 3, except in two respects. First, although Mia agrees to \u201cindemnify\u201d and \u201chold [Nunnink] harmless\u201d from claims, etc., it does not refer to a <em>release </em>of liability. This appears to be a matter of form, not substance. If Mia holds Nunnink harmless from claims or damages arising from Nunnink\u2019s services, she has effectively relieved Nunnink of responsibility for damages arising from her services. Second, paragraph 5 includes no exception to Mia\u2019s agreement to hold Nunnink harmless, such as the exception for \u201cdirect, willful and wanton negligence\u201d found in paragraph 3. Nevertheless, under <em>Santa Barbara, </em>the purported unlimited agreement would be unenforceable to the extent it could protect Nunnink from liability for her gross negligence. (See <em>Santa Barbara, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 751 [release of liability, \u201cto the extent it purports to release liability for future gross negligence, violates public policy and is unenforceable\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The Erikssons argue that the release is ambiguous, and therefore inapplicable to their claims, because it refers to Nunnink as a <em>trainer </em>rather than as a <em>coach. </em>\u201cTrainer,\u201d they explain, \u201cusually means the trainer of the horse\u201d; therefore, they assert, the agreement was limited to liability arising from Nunnink\u2019s training of horses at Tahoe Meadows. If Nunnink wanted the release to apply to competitions where she functioned as a coach, they argue, \u201cshe should have drafted it that way.\u201d We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The meaning of the word \u201cTrainer\u201d is established in the opening sentence of the document in which the agreement is named, dated, and expressly entered into \u201cby and between KRISTI NUNNINK, hereinafter designated \u2018Trainer\u2019 . . . .\u201d By defining \u201cTrainer\u201d to mean Nunnink for purposes of the agreement, the term\u2019s only legal significance is to act as a placeholder or substitute for Nunnink\u2019s name throughout the document. Thus, for example, where the agreement states that \u201cRider agrees to hold Trainer . . . harmless . . . ,\u201d it means that Rider (i.e., Mia) agrees to hold Nunnink harmless. The term cannot reasonably be read as modifying or limiting the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Moreover, the interpretation proffered by the Erikssons is inconsistent with the document as a whole. Nunnink provided coaching services to Mia that included training the horse Mia rides. The release is written to protect Nunnink from liability in the broadest terms. She is released, for example, \u201cfrom all liability whatsoever\u201d and for claims arising out of Mia\u2019s \u201cuse of Trainer\u2019s services or facilities or presence upon any property used . . . .\u201d The Erikssons\u2019 argument that the release protects Nunnink from all liability whatsoever as to her training services but provides no protection from liability arising from her coaching services is not, in light of the whole contract, reasonably plausible. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1641 [\u201cThe whole of a contract is to be taken together, so as to give effect to every part, if reasonably practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Further, at the time the release was signed, the relationship between the parties had been ongoing for at least two years, with Nunnink involved in all aspects of Mia\u2019s training and eventing activities. She was involved in selecting the competitions Mia entered and she attended all of Mia\u2019s events. The release clearly contemplates releasing Nunnink from liability for all of Mia\u2019s horse-related activities involving Nunnink\u2019s services. As such, the release is enforceable as between Nunnink and Mia.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">4. <em>Effect of the Release on Karan and Stan\u2019s Cause of Action for Wrongful Death</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In the release, Mia expressly agreed to release Nunnink from liability for claims, causes of action, and damages, including \u201cthose based on death.\u201d The trial court concluded that the Erikssons\u2019 \u201cclaims for damages for the wrongful death of Mia are derivative of Mia\u2019s rights vis-a-vis Nunnink. Mia having expressly released her rights to assert any such claims against Nunnink, the [Erikssons\u2019] claims for wrongful death are barred by the terms of the release.\u201d Although we do not agree that the wrongful death claims are derivative and can be waived by Mia signing the release, Nunnink can assert Mia\u2019s release and express assumption of risk as a defense to the Erikssons\u2019 claims and thereby limit the scope of her potential liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Our state Supreme Court has explained that wrongful death claims \u201care not derivative claims but are independent actions accruing to a decedent\u2019s heirs . . . .\u201d <em>(Ruiz </em>v. <em>Podolsky </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 838, 841 [114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 263, 237 P.3d 584].) \u201cUnlike some jurisdictions wherein wrong-M death actions are derivative, [California\u2019s wrongful death statute] \u2018creates a <em>new cause of action </em>in favor of the heirs as beneficiaries, based upon their own independent pecuniary injury suffered by loss of a relative, and distinct from any the deceased might have maintained had he survived. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Horwich </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 272, 283 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 222, 980 P.2d 927]; see <em>Daniels v. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc., supra, </em>212 Cal.App.4th at p. 680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Because a wrongful death claim is not derivative of the decedent\u2019s claims, an agreement by the decedent to release or waive liability for her death does not necessarily bar a subsequent wrongful death cause of action by her heirs. (6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Torts, \u00a7 1402, p. 825.) As explained in <em>Madison </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 589 [250 Cal.Rptr. 299], in which the decedent signed an agreement purporting to release, discharge, and waive any cause of action for wrongful death, \u201cit is clear that [decedent] had no power or right to waive that cause of action on behalf of his heirs. [Citation.] This is a right which belongs not to [decedent] but to his heirs. \u2018The longstanding rule is that a wrongful death action is a separate and distinct right belonging to the heirs, and it does not arise until the death of the decedent. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 596.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Although Mia could not release or waive her parents\u2019 subsequent wrongful death claims, it is well settled that a release of future liability or express assumption of the risk by the decedent may be asserted as a defense to such claims. (See, e.g., <em>Horwich v. Superior Court, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 285; <em>Paralift, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 23 Cal.App.4th 748, 755 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 177]; <em>Saenz </em>v. <em>Whitewater Voyages, Inc. </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 758, 763-764 [276 Cal.Rptr. 672].) As the <em>Madison </em>court explained: \u201c[A] distinction must be made between the legal <em>ineffectiveness of </em>a decedent\u2019s preinjury release of his heirs\u2019[] subsequent wrongful death action and the legal <em>effectiveness </em>of an express release of negligence by a decedent which provides a defendant with \u2018a complete defense.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Madison </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 597; see <em>Ruiz v. Podolsky, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at pp. 851-852 [\u201calthough an individual involved in a dangerous activity cannot by signing a release extinguish his heirs\u2019 wrongful death claim, the heirs will be bound by the decedent\u2019s agreement to waive a defendant\u2019s negligence and assume all risk\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The operation of this rule is illustrated in <em>Coates v. Newhall Land &amp; Farming, Inc. </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1 [236 Cal.Rptr. 181]. In that case, Charles Coates was a dirt bike rider who signed a release agreement before using the defendant\u2019s motorcycle riding park. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 3-4.) The release included an \u201cadvance waiver of liability\u201d and an \u201cexpress assumption of [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>risk.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 7.) While riding his dirt bike in the park, Coates was fatally injured. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 4.) His heirs sued the owners of the park for wrongful death. The owners were granted summary judgment based upon the release, and the Court of Appeal affirmed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 5, 10.) The court explained: \u201cBehavior which is authorized is not wrongful and, logically, cannot be the basis of a wrongful death action. \u2018In its most basic sense, assumption of risk means that the plaintiff, in advance, has given his <em>express </em>consent to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him, and to take his chances of injury from a known risk arising from what the defendant is to do or leave undone. . . . The result is that the defendant is relieved of legal duty to the plaintiff; and being under no duty, he cannot be charged with negligence.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 8, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The <em>Coates </em>court\u2019s explanation indicates that while the wrongful death cause of action is not derived from the decedent\u2019s rights, the pertinent duty of care is the duty of care the defendant owed to the decedent, which can be limited or negated by the decedent in a preaccident release. This rationale is also apparent in <em>Horwich </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 272, which states that a \u201crelease executed by the decedent in circumstances involving primary assumption of the risk may also be asserted as a defense. [Citations.] In that situation, the decedent agrees in advance of the activity to relieve the defendant of any duty of care. [Citations.] <em>The defendant can owe no greater duty to the heirs than to the decedent4, </em>thus the premise of any wrongful death action would fail at the outset.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 285, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">As such, the terms of the release effectively extinguished Nunnink\u2019s duty of ordinary care to Mia; in that Nunnink\u2019s duty toward the Erikssons could be no greater, Nunnink can rely upon the release as a defense to the Erikssons\u2019 negligence cause of action for wrongful death.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">5. <em>Effect of the Release on the Erikssons\u2019 Negligence Action for Emotional Distress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The trial court analyzed Karan\u2019s NIED claim differently from Stan\u2019s. Regarding Karan\u2019s claim, the court found that Karan was bound by the release because she signed it as Mia\u2019s parent, making her a party to the release. Karan, the court explained, thus \u201creleased her claims against Nunnink except to the extent that Nunnink was reckless.\u201d The court analyzed Stan\u2019s NIED claim, on the other hand, based on the fact that Stan did not sign the release; Stan\u2019s claim was evaluated under common law tort principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Although we affirm the court\u2019s judgment, we get there by a different route. As we explained above, Karan was not a party to the release. As such, she did not release her claims against Nunnink any more than did Stan. Nevertheless, as we discuss below, with respect to the Erikssons\u2019 bystander NIED claims, Nunnink owed no greater duty of care toward the Erikssons than the duty she owed to Mia. Because Mia, by signing the release, negated Nunnink\u2019s duty of ordinary care toward her, Nunnink did not owe a duty of ordinary care to protect the Erikssons from the risk of the emotional distress they suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Just as the wrongful death action is a separate and distinct right belonging to the decedent\u2019s heirs, the right to damages for NIED is a separate and distinct right belonging to the NIED plaintiffs. Our courts have distinguished \u201cbystander\u201d NIED claims from \u201cdirect victim\u201d claims. (See, e.g., <em>Burgess v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1071 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 831 P.2d 1197].) As stated in <em>Huggins v. Longs Drug Stores California, Inc. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 124, 129-130 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 587, 862 P.2d 148]: \u201c \u2018The distinction between the \u201cbystander\u201d and the \u201cdirect victim\u201d cases is found in the source of the duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Bystander\u2019 claims are typically based on breach of a duty owed to the public in general [citation], whereas a right to recover ... as a \u2018direct victim\u2019 arises from the breach of a duty that is assumed by the defendant or imposed on the defendant as a matter of law, or that arises out of the defendant\u2019s preexisting relationship with the plaintiff [citations].\u201d The Erikssons\u2019 NIED claims are bystander claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Although the Erikssons\u2019 right to recover is based on a duty separate and distinct from that owed to Mia, the California Supreme Court, in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 728 [69 Cal.Rptr. 72, 441 P.2d 912] <em>(Dillon), </em>recognized that a defendant should be able to assert the same defenses to bystander liability as she would be able to assert against direct victim liability. The court stated: \u201c[Defendant has interposed the defense that the contributory negligence of the . . . [decedent] child contributed to the accident. If any such defense is sustained and defendant found not liable for the death of the child because of the contributory negligence of the . . . child, we do not believe that the mother or sister should recover for the emotional trauma which they allegedly suffered. In the absence of the primary liability of the tortfeasor for the death of the child, we see no ground for an independent and secondary liability for claims for injuries by third parties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 733.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>This has been followed in <em>Balthazor v. Little League Baseball, Inc. </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 47 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 337] (Balthazar). There, the minor filed an action for injuries sustained when he was struck by a wild pitch during a baseball game. His mother asserted a cause of action for emotional distress. The court, in affirming summary judgment, found that the league did not increase the risk of injury to the minor plaintiff and, therefore owed no duty to him. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 48-53.) In addressing the mother\u2019s NIED claim, the court noted: \u201cBecause we hold primary assumption of risk bars [the minor\u2019s] negligence action, his mother\u2019s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is similarly barred. <em>(Dillon[, supra,] </em>68 Cal.2d [at p.] 733 . . . [\u2018In the absence of the primary liability of the tortfeasor[,] ... we see no ground for an independent and secondary liability for claims for injuries by third parties.\u2019].)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 53, fn 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The <em>Balthazor </em>court\u2019s one-sentence analysis of the mother\u2019s claim, though brief, is telling. The reason why the mother\u2019s claim for emotional distress was barred is not because she, by attending her son\u2019s baseball game, assumed the risk of injury that could result from seeing her son hit by a ball; rather, her claim was barred because <em>her son assumed the risk </em>of being hit by playing the game. In short, the league could not be liable for the emotional distress of the mother if it was not liable to the baseball playing child.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Just as the ballplayer\u2019s mother in <em>Balthazor </em>could not recover for her emotional distress because the child assumed the risk of the incident that caused the mother\u2019s distress, it would seem to follow that the Erikssons cannot recover for their emotional distress if Mia expressly assumed the risk of the incident that caused their distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The <em>Balthazor </em>case, however, did not involve a written release agreement; it was based upon the primary assumption of risk doctrine developed by <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 296, and its progeny. This is not a basis for distinguishing <em>Balthazor. </em>As <em>Knight </em>itself stated, a contract in which a party makes an \u201c \u2018express assumption of risk\u2019 \u201d is analogous to the judicially created primary assumption of risk doctrine. <em>(Knight v. Jewett, supra, </em>at pp. 308-309, fn. 4; see <em>Santa Barbara, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 779, fn. 57; <em>Allabach v. Santa Clara County Fair Assn., supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at p. 1013.) In both situations, the defendant is relieved of a duty of care to protect the plaintiff from particular risks. <em>(Knight v. Jewett, supra, </em>at pp. 308-309 &amp; fn. 4.) It follows that just as the primary assumption of risk doctrine was applied in <em>Balthazor </em>to the mother\u2019s bystander liability claim, Mia\u2019s express assumption of risk applies to the Erikssons\u2019 claims here.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">A rule that a defendant can assert the direct victim\u2019s release in a bystander NIED case is consistent with the law\u2019s treatment of releases in wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>death cases. As discussed above, in wrongful death cases, a release by the decedent can negate the defendant\u2019s duty of ordinary care to the decedent. Because the defendant can owe no greater duty to the heirs than to the decedent <em>(Horwich v. Superior Court, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 285), the release can be asserted against the wrongful death plaintiffs to prove the absence of a duty of ordinary care (see, e.g., <em>Coates v. Newhall Land &amp; Farming, Inc., supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d at p. 8; <em>Madison v. Superior Court, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 597). The same rationale should apply in bystander NIED cases. Accordingly, just as Nunnink may interpose the defense of express assumption of the risk to the Erikssons\u2019 wrongful death suit, she may interpose the same defense to their bystander action for NIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Allowing a defendant to assert the direct victim\u2019s release as a defense to an NIED claim is also supported by sound policy reasons. We begin by observing that the \u201c <em>\u2018negligent </em>causing of emotional distress is not an independent tort but the tort of <em>negligence </em>. . . .\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The traditional elements of duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Marlene F. v. Affiliated Psychiatric Medical Clinic, Inc. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 583, 588 [257 Cal.Rptr. 98, 770 P.2d 278].) The basic inquiry is \u201c \u2018whether the plaintiff\u2019s interests are entitled to legal protection against the defendant\u2019s conduct. . . . \u201c[D]uty\u201d is ... an expression <em>of the sum total of those considerations of policy </em>which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 734, italics added.) \u201c \u2018[I]n considering the existence of \u201cduty\u201d in a given case several factors require consideration including \u201cthe foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved. [\u201d]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Christensen v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 885-886 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 79, 820 P.2d 181].)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">As pointed out in <em>Christensen, Dillon </em>\u201creflects] a public policy exception <em>which limits </em>the right of a bystander who did not suffer physical injury and was not threatened with such injury to recover damages for the emotional distress the bystander suffered as a result of witnessing negligent conduct which caused physical injury to a third person. If any and all bystanders who witnessed the injury-causing event were permitted to recover for ensuing emotional distress, the defendant\u2019s liability could be out of all proportion to the degree of fault. [Citations.] Public policy therefore justified a limitation on the statutory right to recover damages for the emotional distress injury.\u201d <em>(Christensen </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 885, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>The limitation imposed by <em>Dillon </em>dealt solely with the consideration of foreseeability. \u201cIn order to limit the otherwise potentially infinite liability which would follow every negligent act, the law of torts holds defendant amenable only for injuries to others which to defendant at the time were reasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 739; see <em>Molien v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 916, 922 [167 Cal.Rptr. 831, 616 P.2d 813].)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Just as the <em>Dillon </em>court limited a defendant\u2019s duty to the plaintiffs who are reasonably foreseeable, the court also recognized that the presence of <em>other \u201c \u2018overriding policy considerations' </em>\u201d may run counter to the imposition of a duty on a defendant for specific conduct. <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 739, italics added.) Here, we believe such considerations are present. Substantial policy reasons support our conclusion that when a participant in a sport has expressly assumed the risk of injury from a defendant\u2019s conduct, the defendant owes no duty of care to bystanders with respect to such risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">First, we recognize that Karan and Stan, as Mia\u2019s parents, are foreseeable plaintiffs and, based on their contemporaneous observations, sustained injury. Additionally there is a close connection between Nunnink\u2019s alleged negligent conduct and the injury. As <em>Dillon </em>indicates, \u201cwe . . . cannot doubt that a mother who sees her child killed will suffer . . . injury from shock.\u201d <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at pp. 735-736.) From there, however, the policy considerations move decidedly in the direction of not imposing on Nunnink a duty to the Erikssons greater than the duty she owed to Mia.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Whether Nunnink is characterized as a trainer, coach, or instructor, her services dealt with the schooling of a horse and the teaching of a rider. As the evidence demonstrates, Mia wished to improve and advance in the sport of eventing. Presumably, Nunnink had the knowledge and skills to facilitate Mia\u2019s and Kory\u2019s improvement in the sport. Nunnink, aware of the dangers involved in the sport, desired some protection from liability for risks inherent in the sport \u2014 hence the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">In the absence of the release, Nunnink, or a person similarly situated as an instructor, would be less inclined to offer her services to Mia or others similarly situated. Thus, to encourage individuals to teach sports, some of which pose a high risk of injury, it is necessary to allow for enforceable releases of liability; otherwise, persons in Nunnink\u2019s position might not provide the necessary instruction for safe participation in the sport. To then allow the instructor, who has secured an enforceable release from the participant, to be secondarily liable to a nonparticipant for the conduct covered by the release would, in essence, negate the effectiveness of the release and discourage the teaching of the sport. This adversely affects the community as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Additionally, for a coach or other involved entity to fully protect themselves from liability they, in essence, would be required to obtain releases from all close relatives who may watch the participant engage in the sport. This would be unworkable. Many sports involve team participation with numerous participants on a team. It is foreseeable that parents and siblings will attend team games. If the coach or sponsoring entity has received signed releases from the members of the team, it seems nonsensical to require each family member to sign a release similar to that signed by the participant in order to be protected from liability. The burden of acquiring such releases would be great.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Lastly, the reasonable contractual expectation of a coach or trainer who obtains an enforceable release of liability from the participant is that she is released from liability for negligent conduct. To allow an end run by those who may assert secondary liability destroys that reasonable contractual expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that where a participant in a sport has expressly assumed the risk of injury from a defendant\u2019s conduct, the defendant no longer owes a duty of care to bystanders with respect to the risk expressly assumed by the participant. The defendant can therefore assert the participant\u2019s express assumption of the risk against the bystanders\u2019 NIED claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">B. <em>Standards of Review of Ruling on Nunnink\u2019s Motion for Judgment and Burdens of Proof Regarding the Release and Gross Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Under section 631.8, in a bench trial, a party may move for judgment after the other party has completed his or her presentation of evidence. (\u00a7 631.8, subd. (a).) In considering such a motion, the court \u201cshall weigh the evidence and may render a judgment in favor of the moving party . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c \u2018In weighing the evidence, the court may exercise the prerogatives of a fact trier <em>by refusing to believe witnesses and by drawing conclusions at odds with expert opinion </em>....\u2019\u201d <em>(County of Ventura v. Marcus </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 612, 615 [189 Cal.Rptr. 8].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">On appeal \u201c[w]e resolve all evidentiary conflicts in favor of the prevailing parties, and indulge all reasonable inferences possible to uphold the trial court\u2019s findings. [Citation.] . . . This court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court when the trial court could reasonably deduce two or more inferences from the facts.\u201d <em>(Jordan v. City of Santa Barbara </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1245, 1254-1255 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 340]; see, e.g, <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Shemtov </em>(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 599, 608 [148 Cal.Rptr.3d 570]; <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Parker </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 542, 549-550 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 250].)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Here, the trial court found \u201cthat Ms. Nunninlc\u2019s negligence . . . did not rise to the level of recklessness.\u201d Although distinctions can be made between gross negligence (as defined in <em>Santa Barbara, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 754), willful and wanton conduct (as indicated in the release), and recklessness (the trial court\u2019s phrase), for purposes of this case we understand them to be roughly synonymous and will evaluate the court\u2019s determination as a finding that Nunnink\u2019s conduct did not reach any of these standards. For ease of reference, we will refer solely to gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In addressing the trial court\u2019s conclusion, we must first determine the applicable standard of review. In doing so, we must initially resolve who had the burden of proof relative to the issue of gross negligence. We conclude that once Nunnink established the applicability of the release, it was the Erikssons\u2019 burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that Nunnink was grossly negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Normally it is said that \u201c[t]he standard of review of a judgment and its underlying findings entered pursuant to section 631.8 is the same as a judgment granted after a trial in which evidence was produced by both sides. . . . [T]he power of the reviewing court begins and ends with the determination as to whether, on the whole record, there is substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, that will support the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>(San Diego Metropolitan Transit Development Bd. v. Handlery Hotel, Inc. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 517, 528 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 473].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">This standard, however, can be \u201cmisleading\u201d in cases when the judgment for one party is based on the other party\u2019s failure to satisfy a burden of proof. (See <em>Shaw v. County of Santa Cruz </em>(2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 229, 279 [88 Cal.Rptr.3d 186].) When, for example, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the elements of his claim and the court finds he has failed to satisfy that burden, judgment will be for the defendant \u2014 even if there is no evidence supporting the defense. There being <em>no </em>evidence for the defense, there could be no <em>substantial </em>evidence in the record to support the judgment. Yet, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>plaintiff, who failed to prove his case, would clearly not be entitled to reversal of the defense judgment. Plainly, the substantial evidence standard, as it is usually stated, is an inadequate appellate tool in that situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Thus, \u201c[w]hen the trier of fact has expressly or implicitly concluded that the party with the burden of proof failed to carry that burden and that party appeals ... the question for a reviewing court becomes whether the evidence compels a finding in favor of the appellant as a matter of law. [Citations.] Specifically, the question becomes whether the appellant\u2019s evidence was (1) \u2018uncontradicted and unimpeached\u2019 and (2) \u2018of such a character and weight as to leave no room for a judicial determination that it was insufficient to support a finding.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Shaw v. County of Santa Cruz, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.4th at p. 279; see <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Oh </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 1094, 1099 [195 Cal.Rptr. 720] [\u201cBy asserting that there was no substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict for respondent, appellant is in fact claiming that he proved negligence as a matter of law, and such is not established unless the only reasonable hypothesis is that negligence existed.\u201d]; <em>Ermoian v. Desert Hospital </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 475, 506 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 754] [Fourth Dist., Div. Two] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Here, the Erikssons alleged their claims of wrongful death and NIED were based on Nunnink\u2019s \u201cnegligence and fault.\u201d Viewing the complaint in isolation, it would seem to be beyond dispute that the Erikssons had the burden of proving such negligence and fault. (See <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 675, 685 [126 Cal.Rptr.3d 706]; see also <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 861 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493] [\u201c \u2018party desiring relief\u2019 \u201d bears burden of proof]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 521 [\u201cThe party claiming that a person did not exercise a requisite degree of care has the burden of proof on that issue.\u201d].) Nunnink, however, interposed a defense of assumption of the risk and relied on the release.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As a defense, Nunnink had the burden, as the <em>Santa Barbara </em>court stated, of \u201cestablishing the validity of [the] release as applied to the case at hand.\u201d <em>(Santa Barbara, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 780, fn. 58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">For the reasons discussed, Nunnink has established the validity of the release in the sense that it was binding and enforceable against Mia, except insofar as it would protect Nunnink from future liability arising from her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>gross negligence. If, as here, the validity of the release is established and yet Nunnink can still be liable if she acted with gross negligence, this question arises: Is it Nunnink\u2019s burden, as part of proving her defense, to prove she did not act with gross negligence (thus bringing her conduct within the scope of the release), or is it the Erikssons\u2019 burden to establish that Nunnink was grossly negligent (thus taking her conduct outside the scope of the release) in order to prove the elements of their case? The answer, we conclude, is that once Nunnink proves the validity of the release and its applicability to this case, the Erikssons have the burden of establishing that Nunnink was grossly negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">This conclusion follows from the rule that \u201c[t]he party claiming that a person did not exercise a requisite degree of care has the burden of proof on that issue.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 521.) Although there may be a dispute as to what the requisite degree of care is, this rule mandates that whatever the degree of care is, the party arguing that the defendant did not exercise that degree of care has the burden of proof on that issue.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Because it was the Erikssons\u2019 burden of proving that Nunnink acted with gross negligence and the trial court found she was not grossly negligent (or \u201creckless\u201d), we review the record to determine whether the evidence establishes, as a matter of law, that Nunnink breached this standard of care by allowing (or persuading Karan to allow) Mia to compete in the Galway Downs cross-country event with Kory.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">C. <em>The Evidence Does Not Establish That Nunnink Was, as a Matter of Law, Grossly Negligent or Engaged in \u201cWillful and Wanton Negligence\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>IV.
