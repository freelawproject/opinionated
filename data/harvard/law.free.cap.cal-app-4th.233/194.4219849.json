J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUD\">\u2014 In this original proceeding, petitioners Adam Nick and Sherry Nick (collectively, Nick) challenge respondent Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control\u2019s (Department) decision granting real party in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>interest 7-Eleven, Inc. (7-Eleven), a license to sell beer and wine at its store located in the City of Lake Forest (City). The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23000 et seq.; hereinafter Act)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibits the Department from issuing a license that would result in or add to an undue concentration of licenses unless the local governing body of the area where the applicant premises is located determines that issuing the license would serve \u201cpublic convenience or necessity.\u201d (\u00a7 23958.4, subd. (b)(2); see <em>id,., </em>\u00a7 23958.) The City determined issuing the license would serve public convenience or necessity and the Department relied on that determination in granting 7-Eleven\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In the published portion of this opinion, we address Nick\u2019s contention the Department improperly \u201cceded\u201d its exclusive constitutional authority by treating the City\u2019s public convenience or necessity determination as binding and conclusive, rather than independently making its own determination. As explained below, this contention fails because it misconstrues the duties of the Department and the City under the Act, and also mischaracterizes the Department\u2019s investigation and decision in granting 7-Eleven\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The unpublished portion of the opinion addresses Nick\u2019s contentions the City\u2019s public convenience or necessity determination is void because the City failed to make the determination within the time period specified by section 23958.4, subdivision (b)(2), and the record lacks substantial evidence to support a public convenience or necessity determination by either the City or the Department. These contentions are not persuasive because they fail to recognize the proper event triggering the statutory time period and the broad deference given to the City in making a public convenience or necessity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Finally, we address in the unpublished portion of the opinion Nick\u2019s contention we must overturn the Department\u2019s decision because respondent Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board (Appeals Board) found 7-Eleven misrepresented a material fact by failing to disclose a franchisee held a \u201chidden ownership\u201d interest in the store at issue. As we explain, the Appeals Board made no such finding, but rather affirmed the Department\u2019s decision and then remanded for the Department to investigate the hidden ownership issue because Nick failed to raise it as a basis for denying 7-Eleven\u2019s application during the administrative hearing before the Department. Moreover, misrepresenting a material fact in obtaining a license is a ground for revoking or suspending a license that may be addressed after the license issues. Accordingly, we affirm the Department\u2019s and the Appeals Board\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">7-Eleven operates a convenience store in the City that sells a variety of grocery, food, and other convenience items, including 7-Eleven\u2019s exclusive brand of certain items. Seeking to expand its offerings, 7-Eleven applied to the Department for an \u201coff-sale\u201d beer and wine license, which is a license to sell beer and wine for consumption off the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In its initial investigation, the Department determined that granting 7-Eleven\u2019s request would result in an undue concentration of licenses because three other stores in the same census tract already held off-sale beer and wine licenses, including a gas station and convenience store Nick owned and operated across the street from 7-Eleven\u2019s store. The Department therefore required 7-Eleven to obtain a determination from the City that issuing the license would serve public convenience or necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Acting on 7-Eleven\u2019s request, the City\u2019s director of development services investigated the matter and concluded that issuing the license would serve public convenience or necessity. Nick appealed that determination to the City\u2019s planning commission and then to the city council. The city council conducted a public hearing on Nick\u2019s appeal and independently determined that issuing the license to 7-Eleven would serve public convenience or necessity. The City forwarded its determination to the Department. Nick sought to overturn the City\u2019s decision by seeking a writ of administrative mandamus, but the superior court denied Nick\u2019s writ petition and we affirmed that decision in <em>Nick v. City of Lake Forest </em>(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 871 [181 Cal.Rptr.3d 530],</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Nick also filed a protest with the Department, raising several reasons why it should deny 7-Eleven\u2019s application, including claims that issuing the license would result in an undue concentration of off-sale licenses in the area and 7-Eleven offered nothing unique in the sale of alcoholic beverages not already available in the community. After receiving the City\u2019s public convenience or necessity determination, the Department\u2019s investigator completed her investigation regarding 7-Eleven, its application, the surrounding community, and Nick\u2019s protest. The investigator prepared a report analyzing Nick\u2019s protest and recommending the Department deny the protest and grant 7-Eleven\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In November 2012, the Department conducted an evidentiary hearing on Nick\u2019s protest at which the Department, 7-Eleven, and Nick each called witnesses and presented evidence. The administrative law judge issued a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>proposed decision denying Nick\u2019s protest and granting 7-Eleven\u2019s application. The proposed decision explained issuing the license to 7-Eleven would raise the total of off-sale liquor licenses to four, but this would result in a minimal degree of overconcentration because the statutory formula establishing the threshold for undue concentration authorized three licenses for the census tract. The proposed decision also noted, after considering a wide variety of factors and making numerous findings, the City determined issuing the license would serve the public convenience or necessity despite an overconcentration of licenses in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Effective February 2013, the Department adopted the administrative law judge\u2019s proposed decision as its own and Nick appealed the decision to the Appeals Board. The Appeals Board affirmed the Department\u2019s decision to deny Nick\u2019s protest and grant 7-Eleven\u2019s application, but it also remanded for the Department to conduct further proceedings on an issue Nick failed to raise before the Department \u2014 whether 7-Eleven materially misrepresented a franchisee\u2019s possible ownership interest in the store that would justify suspending or revoking 7-Eleven\u2019s license under section 24200.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Nick timely filed a petition for a writ of review challenging the Department\u2019s and Appeals Board\u2019s decisions. We granted the petition, ordered the Department to certify the administrative record of its proceedings, and now consider Nick\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">A. <em>Relevant Legal Background on Licenses to Sell Alcoholic Beverages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The California Constitution grants the Department \u201cexclusive power\u201d to license the sale of alcoholic beverages \u201cin accordance with the laws enacted by the Legislature.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22.) The Department may, \u201cin its discretion, . . . deny, suspend or revoke any specific alcoholic beverage license if it shall determine for good cause that the granting or continuance of such license would be contrary to public welfare or morals, or that a person seeking or holding a license has violated any law prohibiting conduct involving moral turpitude.\u201d (Ibid.; see <em>Rondon v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. </em>(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1274, 1281 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 295].)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The Legislature enacted the Act to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages and establish procedures and standards for granting, denying, suspending, and revoking licenses to sell alcoholic beverages. Upon receipt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>an application for a liquor license, the Act requires the Department to \u201cmake a thorough investigation to determine whether the applicant and the premises for which a license is applied qualify for a license and whether the provisions of [the Act] have been complied with, and [also to] . . . investigate all matters connected therewith which may affect the public welfare and morals.\u201d (\u00a7 23958.) The Department must deny an application \u201cif either the applicant or the premises for which a license is applied do not qualify for a license under [the Act].\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">As pertinent here, the Act also requires the Department to deny an application if its investigation reveals \u201cissuance would result in or add to an undue concentration of licenses, <em>except as provided in Section 23958.4.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 23958, italics added.) Section 23958.4 provides an undue concentration of off-sale retail licenses occurs when \u201cthe ratio of off-sale retail licenses to population in the census tract or census division in which the applicant premises are located exceeds the ratio of off-sale retail licenses to population in the county in which the applicant premises are located.\u201d (\u00a7 23958.4, subd. (a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">When the issuance of a license would result in or add to an undue concentration, section 23958.4 provides the Department nonetheless \u201cmay issue a license ... [][]...['][]... if the local governing body of the area in which the applicant premises are located, or its designated subordinate officer or body, determines within 90 days of notification of a completed application that public convenience or necessity would be served by the issuance.\u201d (\u00a7 23958.4, subd. (b)(2).) If the local governing body or its designee \u201cdoes not make a determination within the 90-day period, then the [Department may issue a license if the applicant shows the [Department that public convenience or necessity would be served by the issuance.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Regardless whether the local governing body or the Department makes the public convenience or necessity determination, the exclusive power to issue a liquor license remains with the Department. (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; see \u00a7\u00a7 23958, 23958.4, subd. (b)(2).) The Department\u2019s decision to grant or deny an application for a license to sell alcoholic beverage \u201cis broad and inclusive and is not subject to judicial control when exercised within its legal limits.\u201d <em>(Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1066, 1073 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 278] (Deleuze).)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Any party aggrieved by the Department\u2019s decision to issue or deny a license may appeal that decision to the Appeals Board. (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; \u00a7\u00a7 23081, 23084.) The Appeals Board\u2019s scope of review is narrow; it \u201cshall not receive evidence in addition to that considered by the [Department\u201d and its review \u201cshall be limited to the questions whether the [D]epartment has</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>proceeded without or in excess of its jurisdiction, whether the [Djepartment has proceeded in the manner required by law, whether the decision is supported by the findings, and whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; \u00a7 23084; see <em>Deleuze, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at p. 1071.) The Appeals Board may remand a matter for reconsideration if it determines the Department failed to consider relevant evidence either because the evidence could not have been produced at the Department\u2019s hearing despite the exercise of reasonable diligence or the Department erroneously refused to consider the evidence. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Any party aggrieved by the Appeals Board\u2019s final decision may file a petition for writ of review with \u201cthe Supreme Court or . .. the court of appeal for the appellate district in which the proceeding arose.\u201d (\u00a7 23090; see <em>Deleuze, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at p. 1071.) The appellate court reviews the Department\u2019s decision, not the Appeals Board\u2019s decision, and exercises the same limited review as the Appeals Board. (\u00a7 23090.2; <em>Kirby v. Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 433, 436 [102 Cal.Rptr. 857, 498 P.2d 1105] <em>(Kirby); Deleuze, </em>at p. 1072.) Furthermore, section 23090.2 provides, \u201cNothing in this article shall permit the court to hold a trial de nova, to take evidence, or to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence.\u201d (\u00a7 23090.2.) Thus, the scope of judicial review \u201cis quite limited.\u201d <em>(Sepatis </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 93, 102 [167 Cal.Rptr. 729] <em>(Sepatis).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u201cNeither this court nor the [Appeals] Board may ' \u201cdisregard or overturn a finding of fact of the Department... for the reason that it is considered that a contrary finding would have been equally or more reasonable.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.] \u2018[I]f it be conceded that reasonable minds might differ as to whether granting [a license] would or would not be contrary to public welfare, such concession merely shows that the determination of the question falls within the broad area of discretion which the Department was empowered to exercise.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kirby, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 436; see \u00a7 23090.3 [\u201cThe findings and conclusions of the [Department on questions of fact are conclusive and final and are not subject to review.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u201cOf course, the discretion exercised by the Department under section 22 of article XX of our Constitution 1 \u201cis not absolute but must be exercised in accordance with the law, and the provision that it may revoke [or deny] a license \u2018for good cause\u2019 necessarily implies that its decisions should be based on sufficient evidence and that it should not act arbitrarily in determining what is contrary to public welfare or morals.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.] Nevertheless, it is the Department, and not the [Appeals] Board or the courts, which must determine whether \u2018good cause\u2019 exists for denying a license upon the ground that its issuance would be contrary to public welfare or morals. [Citations.]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>(Kirby, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 436-437.) \u201cAs long as there is substantial evidence to support the Department\u2019s determination, as long as the decision is a reasonable one under the evidence, the decision must be upheld as a valid exercise of the Department\u2019s discretion conferred by the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Department of Alcoholic Bev. Control v. Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 315, 318 [186 Cal.Rptr. 189] (Kolender); see <em>Department of Alcoholic Bev. Control v. Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 814, 817 [184 Cal.Rptr. 367]; <em>Sepatis, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.3d at pp. 102-103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">B. <em>The Department Did Not Cede Its Authority to the City</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Nick contends the Department improperly \u201cceded\u201d its authority to the City by treating the City\u2019s public convenience or necessity determination as \u201cconclusive and binding.\u201d According to Nick, the City\u2019s determination was merely advisory and the Department was required to independently investigate 7-Eleven\u2019s application to make its own public convenience or necessity determination. Nick, however, misconstrues the governing statutes and mischaracterizes the Department\u2019s investigation and determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">As explained above, section 23958 prohibits the Department from issuing a license that would result in or add to an undue concentration of licenses unless \u201cthe local governing body of the area in which the applicant premises are located . . . determines within 90 days of notification of a completed application that public convenience or necessity would be served by the issuance.\u201d (\u00a7 23958.4, subd. (b)(2).) If the local governing body makes this determination, the Department \u201cmay\u201d issue the license despite an undue concentration. (\u00a7\u00a7 23958, 23958.4, subd. (b)(2).) Nothing in the plain language of either section 23958 or section 23958.4 requires the Department to independently determine whether issuing the license would serve public convenience or necessity if the local governing body already made that determination.  <em>(Jenkins v. Teegarden </em>(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1138 [179 Cal.Rptr.3d 304] [\u201c \u2018 \u201cIf the plain, commonsense meaning of a statute\u2019s words is unambiguous, the plain meaning controls.\u201d \u2019 \u201d].)  Section 23958.4, subdivision (b)(2) requires the Department to make its own public convenience or necessity determination only if the local governing body fails to do so within the 90-day period specified in the statute. (\u00a7 23958.4, subd. (b)(2) [\u201cIf the local governing body, or its designated subordinate officer or body, does not make a determination within the 90-day period, then the [Department may issue a license if the applicant shows the [Department that public convenience or necessity would be served by the issuance.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The previous version of section 23958 allowed the Department to deny an application that would result in or add to an undue concentration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>licenses unless the applicant made a showing <em>to the Department </em>that issuing the license would serve public convenience or necessity. <em>(Kolender, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.3d at pp. 318-319, fn. 2.) In 1994, the Legislature amended section 23958 and enacted section 23958.4 to delete the requirement that the Department malee the public convenience or necessity determination, and instead shifted that responsibility to the local governing body. (Stats. 1994, ch. 630, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, p. 3050.) By changing the Act, we must presume, the Legislature intended to eliminate the Department\u2019s obligation to make the public convenience or necessity determination in favor of the local governing body. (See <em>City of Irvine v. Southern California Assn. of Governments </em>(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 506, 522 [96 Cal.Rptr.3d 78] [\u201c \u2018Under the rules governing statutory construction, when the Legislature enacts an amendment, we presume that this \u201c \u2018indicates that it thereby intended to change the original act by creating a new right or withdrawing an existing one.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.] \u201c \u2018Therefore, any material change in the language of the original act is presumed to indicate a change in legal rights.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d]; <em>Suman v. BMW of North </em>America, <em>Inc. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1, 10-11 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 133] [\u201c \u2018It is a well recognized principle of statutory construction that when the Legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and has excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Nick cites nothing in the language of section 23958.4 nor any case authority to support his contention the Department must independently make its own public convenience or necessity determination. Instead, Nick points to the constitutional provision granting the Department the exclusive power to license the sale of alcoholic beverages. According to Nick, the Department\u2019s \u201cblind adherence\u201d to the City\u2019s public convenience or necessity determination results in an unconstitutional divestiture of its exclusive authority. Nick\u2019s argument fails because it misconstrues both the governing constitutional provision and statutes, and also ignores the other factors the Department considers in deciding whether to issue a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Article XX, section 22 of the California Constitution grants the Department the exclusive power to license the sale of alcoholic beverages \u201cin accordance with laws enacted by the Legislature.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; see <em>Stroh v. Midway Restaurant Systems, Inc. </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 1040, 1048 [226 Cal.Rptr. 153] [\u201cThe Department has the power to issue and revoke licenses according to the specifications set out in the statutes . . . .\u201d].) Consistent with this constitutional provision, the Legislature established the limitation on licenses based on undue concentration, created the exception to that limitation based on public convenience or necessity, and required the local governing body to make the public convenience or necessity determination rather than the Department. (\u00a7\u00a7 23958, 23958.4.) By relying on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>local governing body\u2019s public convenience or necessity determination, the Department does not divest itself of its constitutional authority, but rather follows the statutory instructions on how to exercise that authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Moreover, in making a public convenience or necessity determination a local governing body does not license the sale of alcoholic beverages; it merely makes a determination to aid the Department in exercising its constitutional authority. The Department still retains the discretion and final decision on whether to issue the license. Indeed, the Department still must determine whether the applicant and the premises for which a license is sought satisfy the Act\u2019s other requirements, and whether issuing the license would be contrary to public welfare or morals. (See Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; \u00a7 23958.) A local governing body\u2019s public convenience or necessity determination is only one of many factors bearing on the Department\u2019s final decision; by no means is it determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Nick\u2019s contention also fails because the Department did not \u201cblind[ly] adhere[]\u201d to the City\u2019s determination and treat it as \u201cbinding and conclusive.\u201d As section 23958 requires, the Department made a thorough investigation of 7-Eleven, its store, the surrounding community, and all matters that may affect the public welfare and morals. The Department\u2019s investigator spoke with law enforcement officials about the application, visited 7-Eleven\u2019s store on numerous occasions, worked with the City to obtain the necessary information, and spoke with Nick regarding his objections. When the investigation revealed the area where 7-Eleven\u2019s store is located already had the maximum number of off-sale licenses based on the statutory definition of undue concentration, the Department required 7-Eleven to obtain a public convenience or necessity determination from the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">After receiving the City\u2019s public convenience or necessity determination, the Department reviewed the factors the City considered in reaching its determination, and the specific findings the City made to support it. Based on its own investigation, the Department concluded the City\u2019s determination was reasonable and that issuing the license would benefit the neighborhood by providing a convenient location to purchase convenience items, including 7-Eleven\u2019s exclusive brand, while also purchasing alcoholic beverages. The Department\u2019s investigator also noted the neighborhood would benefit because the store was located in a shopping center that both residents and workers in the area regularly use to obtain common convenience products and services. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Finally, the Department\u2019s investigator noted issuing the license would result in only a minimal degree of overconcentration because it would be the fourth off-sale license in a census tract that allows three off-sale licenses without a public convenience or necessity determination. The Department therefore did not cede any of its authority to license the sale of alcoholic beverages to the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">C.-E.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The Department\u2019s and Appeals Board\u2019s decisions are affirmed. The Department, the Appeals Board, and 7-Eleven shall recover their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Fybel, J., and Ikola, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 15, 2015, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.

Again, Nick is mistaken. The City is not taking any action that conflicts with state law; it is making a determination that state law requires it to make.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 194.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
