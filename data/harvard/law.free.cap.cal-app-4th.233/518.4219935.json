(B&amp;B), was the framing subcontractor in a series of construction contracts related to various residential real estate development projects in Temecula, Riverside County, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">ASIC is a nonadmitted insurance company that issued two policies of commercial general liability insurance to B&amp;B: policy No. XGI 02-2922-001, covering the time period January 18, 2002, to January 18, 2003, and policy No. XGI 03-2922-002, covering the time period January 18, 2003, to January 18, 2004. Although both policies are alleged in the original and first three amended complaints in this action, the parties agree that only the first policy, No. XGI 2-2922-001 (Policy), is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">B. <em>The Construction Defect Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">In October 2007, 117 homeowners in the Broolchaven, Castle Pines and Cypress Point projects (projects) filed an amended complaint in Riverside County Superior Court against McMillin and others, alleging construction defect claims related to the homeowners\u2019 residences in the projects <em>(Baker </em>litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">In December 2007, McMillin (and a number of its related entities named as defendants in the <em>Baker </em>litigation) tendered the defense of the <em>Baker </em>litigation to ASIC under the terms of both of the policies, contending it was an additional insured under the policies. Approximately six months later, ASIC denied the tender.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">C. <em>The Present Insurance Coverage Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">1. <em>The Complaint and Amended Complaints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">In February 2009, eight McMillin-related entities (but not McMillin) filed the underlying complaint against ASIC and 11 other insurance companies. The plaintiffs alleged that each of the defendants was an insurer to one or more of the subcontractors on the projects, that each of the plaintiffs was an additional insured under each of the respective policies, that each of the defendant insurers owed each of the plaintiffs a duty to defend the <em>Baker </em>litigation, and that by denying the tender of the defense of the <em>Baker </em>litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>each of the defendants breached a contract of insurance and its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">In a first amended complaint filed in July 2010, McMillin and nine related entities named the same defendants as in the original complaint and alleged essentially the same facts and causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Two months later, in a second amended complaint (SAC), McMillin and two related entities (SAC plaintiffs) named the same defendants as in the first two complaints and alleged essentially the same facts and causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In November 2011 McMillin, as the sole plaintiff, filed a third amended complaint (TAC) against ASIC, as the sole defendant, alleging essentially the same facts and causes of action as in the prior three complaints.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This was <em>after </em>the denial of ASIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the settlements with all defendants except ASIC, and the filing of the parties\u2019 pretrial motions in limine, but <em>before </em>the rulings on the in limine motions \u2014 all discussed <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>2. <em>ASIC\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In January 2011, ASIC filed a motion for summary judgment directed to the then operative SAC. ASIC argued that all three causes of action\u2014 declaratory relief, breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \u2014 failed as a matter of law on the following independent grounds: (1) none of the SAC plaintiffs qualified as an \u201cadditional insured\u201d under the terms of the Policy; (2) the Policy only covered B&amp;B\u2019s \u201congoing operations,\u201d which ASIC contended had ceased prior to the occurrences alleged in the <em>Baker </em>litigation; (3) the Policy only covered liability arising out of B&amp;B\u2019s negligence; (4) the Policy\u2019s exclusion j.(5) precluded coverage; and (5) the Policy\u2019s exclusion j.(6) precluded coverage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We will discuss the substance of the specific arguments, as necessary, in the Discussion, <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The SAC plaintiffs opposed the motion, ASIC replied to the opposition, and the court issued a tentative ruling and entertained lengthy oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">By minute order filed July 29, 2011, the court denied ASIC\u2019s motion, ruling in relevant part: (1) ASIC met its initial burden of establishing that there is not an \u201cadditional insured endorsement\u201d on the Policy expressly identifying any of the SAC plaintiffs; (2) the SAC plaintiffs then did not meet their burden of raising a triable issue of material fact as to the absence of an effective \u201cadditional insured endorsement\u201d identifying any of the SAC plaintiffs; but (3) the applicable \u201c \u2018blanket\u2019 additional insured endorsement\u201d contained in the Policy provided benefits in circumstances that ASIC did not disprove as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">3. <em>The Settlements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">During the time period May 2010 through October 2011, the SAC plaintiffs settled their claims in the coverage action with all the defendants except ASIC (Settlement). Of the total $690,154 in Settlement proceeds, the Settlement documentation affirmatively allocated $274,154 to defense expenses from the <em>Baker </em>litigation, and $416,000 was unallocated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>4. <em>The Motions in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">In October 2011, in anticipation of trial, the parties filed motions in limine. One dealt with ASIC\u2019s alleged duty to defend, and two dealt with the effect of the Settlement proceeds on the SAC plaintiffs\u2019 alleged damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">With regard to the duty to defend, the SAC plaintiffs filed a motion to exclude testimony and argument disputing that ASIC had a duty to defend the <em>Baker </em>litigation. With regard to the Settlement proceeds, the SAC plaintiffs filed a motion to exclude evidence or argument about the Settlement (or any of its details), and ASIC filed a motion to preclude McMillin from arguing either (a) that the Settlement proceeds <em>are not </em>offsets to McMillin\u2019s alleged damages for breach of the duty to defend (breach of contract claim) or (b) that the Settlement proceeds <em>are </em>allocated to McMillin\u2019s alleged damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (tort claim). By the time the motions were fully briefed and decided, the operative complaint was the TAC filed by McMillin. Since McMillin was the only plaintiff at the time the court ruled on the motions, we will refer only to McMillin unless context requires otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">a. <em>Duty to Defend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Relying on <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barbara B. </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1076, 1078 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792] <em>(Horace Mann), </em>and <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 301 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153] <em>(Montrose), </em>McMillin argued that the denial of ASIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment established as a matter of law that ASIC had a duty to defend them in the <em>Baker </em>litigation. Opposing the motion, ASIC disputed the legal effect of the denial of its summary judgment motion, contending that because the court did not deny the motion by expressly finding a disputed factual issue, the effect of the ruling did not establish the duty to defend as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In denying summary judgment, the court (Judge Nevitt) had ruled that, with regard to four allegedly undisputed issues, \u201cASIC has not met its initial burden of proof.\u201d During the in limine proceedings, ASIC argued that the court (Judge Alksne) could not consider the denial of the summary judgment, relying in part on Judge Nevitt\u2019s following comments at the conclusion of the hearing in which he denied ASIC\u2019s motion: \u201cHowever, I remind counsel that this ruling is of no evidentiary value later. I don\u2019t know what other evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>may be presented to the Court when these issues are next presented. Whether foundations may have been laid for things, not laid here, and so forth. And so should this issue come before the Court again under different circumstances and with potentially different evidence, you should not necessarily count on the same result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Considering both Judge Nevitt\u2019s comment and the written order, Judge Alksne explained at the in limine hearing that ASIC\u2019s failure to meet its initial burden in its summary judgment motion was a decision that there <em>was </em>a disputed issue of material fact as to coverage, and that such a disputed issue established the duty to defend. The court\u2019s minute order granted the motion to exclude testimony and argument disputing that ASIC had a duty to defend the <em>Baker </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">b. Offset<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Both motions sought pretrial rulings as to whether the court would allow evidence of the Settlement and, more specifically, whether the parties could present evidence or argument as to the application of the Settlement proceeds as an offset to the alleged damages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> McMillin\u2019s alleged damages were limited to contract damages for breach of ASIC\u2019s duty to defend (consisting of McMillin\u2019s unreimbursed defense expenses from the <em>Baker </em>litigation <em>{Baker </em>fees))<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and tort damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (consisting of McMillin\u2019s attorney fees and costs incurred to compel payment from ASIC of insurance benefits under the Policy <em>{Brandt </em>fees)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">In its motion in limine, McMillin principally argued in the alternative: (1) all evidence of the Settlement was inadmissible under the collateral source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>role,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or (2) where the Settlement agreements with the settling insurers did not expressly allocate their Settlement payments either to unreimbursed defense expenses in the <em>Baker </em>litigation (after Settlement, $416,000)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or to consideration for the settlement of the coverage action, ASIC should not be allowed unilaterally to allocate those proceeds to <em>Baker </em>fees. ASIC responded: (1) the collateral source rule was inapplicable, since it affects only tort, not contract, claims, and McMillin\u2019s principal claim here was breach of contract, and (2) application of <em>Emerald Bay Community Assn. </em>v. <em>Golden Eagle Ins. Corp. </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1078 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 43] <em>(Emerald </em>Bay) required the court to offset all Settlement proceeds (whether allocated or unallocated) from McMillin\u2019s alleged damages in order to preclude McMillin from recovering more in contract damages than it actually suffered.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">In its motion in limine, ASIC affirmatively sought the relief it argued in opposition to McMillin\u2019s motion. Again relying on <em>Emerald Bay </em>(see fn. 13, <em>ante), </em>ASIC attempted to establish that McMillin suffered no contract damages. Given that McMillin had, in fact, incurred unreimbursed defense expenses during the <em>Baker </em>litigation (i.e., <em>Baker </em>fees), the only way for ASIC to prove its point was to have the trial court apply the equitable doctrine of offset, such that each dollar of Settlement proceeds offset each dollar of <em>Baker </em>fees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> More specifically, ASIC argued that because McMillin had recovered more in Settlement proceeds than its <em>Baker </em>fees, McMillin could no longer prove an essential element of its cause of action for breach of contract \u2014 namely, damages. From there ASIC reasoned that, without the ability to recover for breach of contract, as a matter of law McMillin could not prove an essential element of its cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \u2014 namely, breach of the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>In opposition to ASIC\u2019s motion, McMillin argued that, of the total Settlement proceeds ($690,154), only $274,154 had been allocated specifically to settle the contract claim, leaving $416,000 in unallocated Settlement proceeds; that McMillin still had unreimbursed defense expenses from the <em>Baker </em>litigation of $309,957; and that ASIC could not arbitrarily and unilaterally allocate the $416,000 to <em>Baker </em>fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">At a hearing on August 1, 2012, Judge Alksne orally ruled that the court would allow evidence of the Settlement at trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Following many rounds of briefing and oral argument hearings, Judge Alksne took under submission the in limine motions regarding the Settlement. In a minute order filed in October 2012, the court granted ASIC\u2019s motion in limine without further explanation, thereby ruling that McMillin would be precluded from presenting evidence or argument that the Settlement proceeds either <em>are not </em>offsets to the <em>Baker </em>fees (McMillin\u2019s contract damages) or <em>are </em>allocated to the <em>Brandt </em>fee (McMillin\u2019s tort damages).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In so doing, Judge Alksne necessarily allocated at least $309,957 of the previously unallocated Settlement proceeds ($416,000) to McMillin\u2019s breach of contract cause of action against the settling insurers, completely offsetting McMillin\u2019s contract damages (i.e., <em>Baker </em>fees) by Settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">5. <em>The Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The parties agreed that the effect of the rulings in the in limine motions\u2014 namely, that although ASIC had breached its duty to defend, the Settlement proceeds ($690,154) would be applied as an offset to McMillin\u2019s <em>Baker </em>fees ($309,957) \u2014 was that McMillin could not prove any contract damages, and without contract damages, McMillin could not maintain a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The parties further agreed that, based on the effect of the rulings, judgment could be entered in favor of ASIC \u2014 with all parties reserving their rights to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The court entered judgment, and ASIC gave notice of its entry on March 5, 2013. McMillin timely appealed, and ASIC timely cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">As we explain <em>post, </em>the trial court erred in granting McMillin\u2019s motion in limine to preclude evidence or argument that disputed ASIC\u2019s duty to defend; the trial court erred in granting ASIC\u2019s motion in limine to preclude McMillin from presenting evidence or argument either that the Settlement proceeds are not an offset to McMillin\u2019s <em>Baker </em>fees or that the Settlement proceeds are allocated to <em>Brandt </em>fees; and we are unable to affirm that portion of the judgment in favor of ASIC on McMillin\u2019s cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">A. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Granting the Motions in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">1. <em>Introduction and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Motions in limine are designed to facilitate management of a case by deciding difficult evidentiary issues in advance of trial. <em>(Amtower v. Photon Dynamics, Inc. </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1582, 1593 [71 Cal.Rptr.3d 361] <em>(Amtowerf, </em>see Super. Ct. San Diego County, Local Rules, rule 2.1.18 [\u201cMotions in limine must be limited in scope in accordance with <em>Clemens v. American Warranty Corp. </em>(1978) 193 Cal.App.3d 444, 451 [238 Cal.Rptr. 339] . . .\u201d : e.g., evidentiary issues where attempts to \u201cunring the bell\u201d would be unduly prejudicial or futile.].) Although trial courts may exercise their inherent powers to permit other uses of motions in limine <em>{Amtower, </em>at p. 1595; <em>Coshow </em>v. <em>City of Escondido </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 687, 701-702 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 19] [proper exercise of \u201cinherent powers\u201d by construing motions in limine as a motion for judgment on the pleadings]), when used in such fashion they become substitutes for dispositive statutory motions <em>{Amtower, </em>at p. 1594).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Like many evidentiary rulings, orders on motions in limine are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(Piedra </em>v. <em>Dugan </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1493 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 36].) However, as we explain <em>post, </em>that standard does not apply where (as here) the grant of the motion becomes a substitute for a summary adjudication or nonsuit motion, which requires a ruling as a matter of law in the first instance and de nova review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">By granting McMillin\u2019s motion as to the duty to defend, the court essentially granted a summary adjudication motion in favor of McMillin on one of the elements of its cause of action for breach of contract, ruling as a matter of law that ASIC had a duty to defend. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (f)(1) [\u201cparty may move for summary adjudication as to . . . one or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>more issues of duty\u201d].) For this reason, we will review de nova the order granting McMillin\u2019s in limine motion. <em>(Lomes </em>v. <em>Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 127, 131 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 471] [\u201cthe appellate court independently reviews an order granting summary adjudication of the duty to defend . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Similarly, by granting ASIC\u2019s motion as to offset, the court essentially granted \u201ca motion for nonsuit after [McMillin\u2019s] opening statement\u201d in favor of ASIC on McMillin\u2019s causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \u2014 all resulting from ASIC\u2019s alleged breach of the duty to defend.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>(Amtower, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1594, 1595; see <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Centex Real Estate Corp. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 27 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 518] (.Edwards) [where the grant of defendant\u2019s motion in limine precludes plaintiff from presenting <em>all </em>evidence on an issue at trial, the effect is \u201cthe functional equivalent of an order sustaining a demurrer to the evidence, or nonsuit\u201d].) Accordingly, like the trial court in ruling on a motion for nonsuit, \u201con this appeal we must view the evidence most favorably to [McMillin], resolving all presumptions, inferences and doubts in [its] favor, and uphold the judgment for [ASIC] only if it was required as a matter of law\u201d <em>{Edwards, </em>at p. 28), recognizing that \u201cthe grant of such a motion is not favored . . .\u201d <em>(Amtower, </em>at p. 1595). Since this determination raises only an issue of law, we review the order de nova. <em>(M&amp;F Fishing, Inc. v. Sea-Pac Ins. Managers, Inc. </em>(2012) 202 Cal. App,4th 1509, 1532 [136 Cal.Rptr.3d 788].)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">2. <em>Duty to Defend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">An insurer owes a duty to defend any lawsuit \u201cwhich <em>potentially </em>seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>(Gray v. Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263, 275 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168].) Since the duty arises whenever the claim against the insured seeks damages on any theory that, if proved, would be covered by the policy, the insurer is relieved of its duty only when \u201c \u2018the third party complaint <em>can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>(Montrose, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 300.) Thus, where the insurer moves for summary judgment based on the lack of a duty to defend, the insurer must present undisputed facts that establish <em>\u201cthe absence of any such potential\u201d </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>coverage.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>(Montrose, </em>at p. 300.) In so doing, if coverage depends on an unresolved dispute over <em>a factual </em>question, the very existence of that dispute would not only result in a denial of the motion, but also establish a possibility of coverage and thus a duty to defend. <em>(Horace Mann, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 1085.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">In its cross-appeal, ASIC\u2019s principal argument is that Judge Alksne erred when she ruled that, based on Judge Nevitt\u2019s denial of ASIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ASIC was precluded from presenting evidence or argument disputing that ASIC owed the SAC plaintiffs a duty to defend the <em>Baker </em>litigation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although Judge Alksne\u2019s minute order merely granted, without explanation, McMillin\u2019s motion in limine, Judge Nevitt\u2019s minute order denying ASIC\u2019s summary judgment motion explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201c \u2018Undisputed issue\u2019 7 concerns ASIC\u2019s contention that there is <em>not </em>an \u2018additional insured endorsement on the policies which <em>specifically identifies </em>any of the [SAC pjlaintiffs\u2019 [citation]. [The SAC pjlaintiffs appear to agree with ASIC .... Therefore, ASIC has met its initial burden of proof, and [the SAC] plaintiffs have not raised a triable issue of material fact as to the absence of an effective additional insured endorsement specifically naming [the SAC] plaintiffs (or any of them) as an additional insured. However, this is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u201cASIC acknowledges that there is a \u2018 \u201cblanket\u201d additional insured endorsement\u2019 (AIE).... The AIE includes an Amendment limiting coverage. ASIC\u2019s \u2018undisputed issues\u2019 1, 2, 5 and 6 are based on provisions of this Amendment. ASIC contends that the underlying action [citation] does not involve, or potentially involve, <em>\u2018[o]ngoing operations </em>performed by the Named Insured [B&amp;B Framing] on or after the effective date [of] this endorsement,\u2019 \u2018[liability arising out of or relating to the Named Insured\u2019s <em>sole </em>negligence,\u2019 or \u2018 \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d under Coverage A not <em>otherwise excluded </em>in the policy to which the Endorsement applies.\u2019 (AIE\u2019s Amendment, emphasis added.) <em>ASIC\u2019s arguments are not persuasive as to any of these four \u2018undisputed issues,\u2019 i.e., ASIC has not met its initial burden of proof.\u201d </em>(Last italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>We focus on the last statement that \u201cASIC has not met its initial burden of proof.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><em>Horace Mann </em>instructs: Where \u201cfactual issues exist precluding summary judgment in the insurer\u2019s favor . . . , the duty to defend is then <em>established, </em>absent additional evidence bearing on the issue.\u201d <em>(Horace Mann, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 1085.) Given this language, ASIC contends that, because Judge Nevitt denied ASIC\u2019s motion on the basis ASIC \u201chas not met its initial <em>burden\u201d </em>\u2014 not because factual issues existed \u2014 the duty to defend was not established as a matter of law. McMillin\u2019s response is that under the \u201cdoctrine of implied findings,\u201d Judge Nevitt\u2019s denial of ASIC\u2019s motion <em>necessarily </em>found that the SAC plaintiffs were additional insureds under the \u201cblanket additional insured endorsement.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We agree with ASIC. The reason for the above quoted language in <em>Horace Mann </em>is that, \u201c[i]f coverage depends on an unresolved dispute over <em>&amp; factual </em>question, the very existence of that dispute would establish a possibility of coverage and thus a duty to defend.\u201d <em>(Mirpad, LLC v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1068 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 136] <em>(Mirpad).) </em>Here, however, Judge Nevitt\u2019s summary judgment ruling did not find <em>&amp; factual </em>dispute that necessarily established a possibility of coverage. Rather, the ruling established <em>only </em>that ASIC did not meet its initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact. As further support for this position, we note that Judge Nevitt did not \u201cspecify one or more material facts raised by the motion\u201d \u2014 a requirement when the court denies the motion \u201con the ground that there is a triable issue as to one or more material facts . . . .\u201d (Code Civ.

In granting McMillin\u2019s motion in limine as to the duty to defend, she explained to ASIC\u2019s counsel: \u201c[Judge Nevitt\u2019s] written order says . . . that you [(ASIC)] didn\u2019t meet your burden of proof. And the case law says [if] you don\u2019t meet your burden of proof, [then] you\u201d have \u201ca duty to defend.\u201d However, as we clarified <em>ante, </em>in order for the denial of an insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment to establish a duty to defend, the denial must be based on \u201can unresolved dispute over a <em>factual </em>question,\u201d because only that type of dispute \u201cestablish[es] a possibility of coverage and thus a duty to defend.\u201d <em>(Mirpad, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 1068; see <em>Horace Mann, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1085.) Denying a summary judgment motion because the moving party failed to meet its initial burden of production is not the same as denying the motion based on an unresolved factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Accordingly, the trial court erred in ruling <em>prior to trial </em>that ASIC was precluded from presenting evidence or argument that disputed whether ASIC had a duty to defend the SAC plaintiffs in the <em>Baker </em>litigation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In making such a ruling in limine, the trial court essentially granted summary adjudication as to the breach of ASIC\u2019s alleged duty to defend without requiring the statutory procedural protections associated with summary judgment proceedings, thereby not requiring McMillin to prove its case and not allowing ASIC to defend McMillin\u2019s proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">3. <em>Offset</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">McMillin contends the court erred in ruling that McMillin was precluded from arguing or presenting evidence either that the Settlement proceeds are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>not offsets to the contract damages or that the Settlement proceeds are allocated to settling the tort (as opposed to contract) cause of action. We agree, but not for the same reasons suggested by McMillin. As we will explain <em>post, </em>because of procedural context of the requested relief (in limine proceedings) and the standard of review (de nova), on this record ASIC was not entitled to an offset based on equitable principles at this stage of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">a. <em>Offset as an Affirmative Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Based on inconsistencies in the record and appellate briefing, we requested and received Government Code section 68081 supplemental briefing on the issue whether ASIC was asserting offset as an affirmative defense. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 431.70.) We received responses from both McMillin and ASIC, and they are in agreement: ASIC\u2019s claim of offset at issue in this appeal is not being asserted or defended as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">While that answer satisfies our inquiry, we note the parties\u2019 lack of clarity in their appellate briefing regarding the basis of ASIC\u2019s requested application of offset and the related burden of proof, especially in light of the parties\u2019 express arguments in the trial court regarding the affirmative defense of offset and the parties\u2019 citations to and reliance on authorities in their appellate briefing applicable to the affirmative defense of offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">b. <em>Offset as Equitable Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">From the parties\u2019 presentations throughout this case, we perceive a basic misunderstanding as to the effect of the type of equitable offset ASIC is asserting. Both ASIC and McMillin treat the entire Settlement proceeds ($690,154) as potential offsets <em>to damages. </em>The Settlement proceeds do not affect McMillin\u2019s <em>damages. </em>Rather, in the event of an award of damages at trial, Settlement proceeds that are found to be offsets by the trial court<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> affect only McMillin\u2019s right to <em>recover </em>the full amount of damages awarded at trial. (See <em>Goodman v. Lozano </em>(2010) 47 Cal.4th 1327, 1338 [104 Cal.Rptr.3d 219, 223 P.3d 77] [in the context of determining the prevailing party for purposes of awarding costs, settlement offsets affect whether a party has a \u201c \u2018net monetary recovery\u2019 \u201d].) If we assume (solely for the purpose of this illustration) that ASIC breached its duty to defend, \u201cthe proper measure of damages is the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred by [McMillin] in defense of the <em>[Baker </em>litigation].\u201d <em>(Marie Y. v. General Star Indemnity Co. </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 928, 961 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 135] <em>(Marie Y.); </em>see <em>Hogan </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>Midland National Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 553, 564 [91 Cal.Rptr. 153, 476 P.2d 825] [same, even where no duty to indemnify].) In the context of this record, that means <em>all </em>attorney fees and costs McMillin incurred <em>other than those that were paid by insurer(s) that accepted the tender of, and participated in, the defense of the </em>Baker <em>litigation. </em>The significance of this distinction \u2014 namely, that an offset affects the right to <em>recover damages, </em>not the <em>amount of damages suffered </em>\u2014 is that McMillin should be allowed to present at trial evidence of the contract damages it suffered; and if the trier of fact awards contract damages and finds support for the other elements of McMillin\u2019s claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, then McMillin may also recover tort damages, subject to proof (and the potential posttrial request for offset to reduce McMillin\u2019s recovery). The fact that the 11 other insurer defendants settled with McMillin should not, and does not, affect whether ASIC breached the duty to defend or the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. At best, the Settlement proceeds from the other 11 insurers may reduce (by way of offset) the amount ASIC ultimately owes McMillin for contract or tort damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In our Government Code section 68081 letter, we indicated an intent to treat Judge Alksne\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine as a ruling on a motion for nonsuit, inquiring if the result would be different depending on whether ASIC had asserted its right to offset as an affirmative defense or as an equitable claim. McMillin responded that the result would be the same, repeating its request for a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Rather than responding to the question presented, ASIC argued that its motion in limine was not really a motion in limine; \u201cit is better understood as a shifting of the order of proof.\u201d According to ASIC, \u201cthe parties stipulated that the court was to make certain damage determinations before presenting the remainder of the case.\u201d ASIC described its understanding of the stipulated procedure as follows: \u201cThe setoff issue was thus <em>decided by the trier of fact </em>(stipulated to be the trial judge who usually addresses third party payments post trial) following the presentation of the evidence \u2014 the only difference being that Judge Alksne made the same factual and legal determinations at the start of trial that she would have made after trial.\u201d From this description of the procedure, ASIC argued that because the parties presented evidence in support of their respective positions, some of which Judge Alksne credited and applied as an offset to damages, McMillin is not entitled to the presumptions, inferences and doubts that benefit an appellant in an appeal from the grant of a nonsuit after opening statement, as we suggested in our Government Code section 68081 letter.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Finally, ASIC repeated its principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>(already briefed) contention that, because <em>Emerald Bay </em>is factually and legally indistinguishable from the present case, the trial court correctly ruled as it did, and we have no choice but to affirm based on the standards of review suggested by ASIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We disagree with ASIC\u2019s representation of the scope of the proceedings before Judge Alksne (and, accordingly, the standard of review to be applied) and with ASIC\u2019s insistence that <em>Emerald Bay </em>and similar cases are controlling. As we will explain <em>post, Emerald Bay </em>and ASIC\u2019s related authorities are factually distinguishable and thus inapplicable. In <em>Emerald Bay, </em>the insured did not suffer any damages because the participating insurers paid the insured\u2019s entire costs of defense <em>as they were incurred, </em>whereas here McMillin <em>actually </em>suffered contract damages of at least $309,957, even if the eventual application of an equitable offset precludes McMillin from recovering some or all of these damages. We will then explain that because the record on appeal does not support ASIC\u2019s representation that the parties stipulated to have Judge Alksne decide either the amount of damages in lieu of trial or the amount of any offset, there is no support for ASIC\u2019s suggestion of a standard of review other than de nova with all presumptions, inferences and doubts in favor of McMillin.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">(i) <em>Emerald Bay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Throughout the briefing at all stages in both the trial and appellate courts, ASIC has relied on the opinion in <em>Emerald Bay, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th 1078, as authority <em>requiring </em>the court to rule as a matter of law that McMillin did not suffer any contract damages. We disagree; <em>Emerald Bay </em>is not controlling, except to the extent it supports the claim that McMillin suffered damages here, whereas the insured in <em>Emerald Bay </em>did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>In <em>Emerald Bay, </em>an insured sued Golden Eagle Insurance Corporation for breach of the duties to defend and to indemnify under a policy of commercial general liability insurance. <em>(Emerald Bay, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1082-1083.) Although Golden Eagle had refused to defend or indemnify the insured in the underlying action at a certain point in time, Federal Insurance Company, another of the insured\u2019s insurers, provided a complete defense (and indemnification) at all times. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1083-1084.) The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Golden Eagle \u2014 and the Court of Appeal affirmed \u2014 on the ground that, <em>since Federal had provided a complete defense at all times, </em>the insured \u201c \u2018suffered no cognizable damages\u2019 \u201d in its claims both for breach of contract and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1087-1096.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">ASIC\u2019s reliance on <em>Emerald Bay </em>is misplaced, because the predicate in <em>Emerald Bay </em>\u2014 namely, that at all times the insured had been provided a complete defense by a participating insurer <em>(Emerald Bay, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at p. 1084) \u2014 is not present here. ASIC\u2019s other authorities are also unpersuasive because of ASIC\u2019s failure to appreciate that, in each, the insured was <em>never </em>without a complete defense provided by someone other than the defendant. <em>(Bramalea California, Inc. v. Reliable Interiors, Inc. </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 468, 471-473 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 302] [in an action against subcontractors to recover costs of defense from an underlying construction defect action, all of the contractor\u2019s attorney fees in the third party action were paid by the contractor\u2019s insurer]; <em>Tradewinds Escrow, Inc. v.

Maryland Casualty Co. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1187 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 136] [plaintiff insured did not suffer damages when defendant insurer withdrew from providing a defense, because insured \u201cwas fully protected from having to pay <em>any </em>costs of its own defense by other insurers\u201d]; <em>Ceresino v.

ASIC fails to distinguish the situation where the insured is provided a complete defense (the plaintiffs in <em>Emerald Bay </em>and related authorities) from the situation where the insured is without a complete defense but later, following litigation, recovers payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>from others that arguably compensate the insured for having to provide its own defense (McMillin here).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">On appeal, ASIC acknowledges that only a portion of McMillin\u2019s defense expenses in the <em>Baker </em>litigation were covered by other insurers, thereby essentially conceding that McMillin did, in fact, suffer damages in the amount of the unpaid portion defense expenses in the <em>Baker </em>litigation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>(Marie Y., </em>supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p. 961 [\u201cthe proper measure of damages [for breach of the duty to defend] is the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred by the insured in defense of the claim\u201d].) In its most recent letter brief, in reliance on <em>Emerald Bay </em>and related authorities, ASIC emphasizes that \u201cthe measure of damages for breach of the duty to defend are the costs and attorney fees that were paid by McMillin <em>and remain </em>\u2018unreimbursed.\u2019 \u201d ASIC presents no authority (and we are aware of none) that supports the italicized portion of ASIC\u2019s statement requiring an insured\u2019s damages to <em>\u201cremain </em>\u2018unreimbursed\u2019 \u201d at the time of trial in order to establish damages as an element of the cause of action. The timing and source of \u201creimbursement\u201d may affect the insured\u2019s ability to <em>recover damages awarded, </em>but not whether the insured <em>suffered the damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\"><em>Emerald Bay </em>is neither controlling nor persuasive, except to the extent it confirms that, in contrast with the insured in <em>Emerald Bay, </em>the insured here (McMillin) does have evidence of damages \u2014 namely, McMillin\u2019s attorney fees and costs incurred in defending the <em>Baker </em>litigation that were not paid by the insurers that participated in McMillin\u2019s defense of that action. Thus, according to <em>Emerald Bay </em>and ASIC\u2019s related authorities, the existence of the Settlement proceeds is irrelevant to the determination of whether McMillin suffered damages as a result of the alleged breach of the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">(ii) <em>Purported Stipulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">After merits briefing of 152 pages and amicus curiae briefing of 32 pages, <em>for the very first time in its letter brief, </em>ASIC advises that \u201cthe parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>stipulated that [Judge Alksne] was to make certain damage determinations before presenting the remainder of the case\u201d and \u201cMcMillin agreed to have [Judge Alksne], not the jury, decide whether [McMillin] still had damages- at the start of trial.\u201d In support of this new revelation, ASIC refers us to the following statements, which it attributes to McMillin during the in limine proceedings:</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u201c \u2018Plaintiff McMILLIN joins with Defendant ASIC in requesting that the court address the issue of offset before the remainder of the case. Plaintiff concurs with Defendant ASIC that the issue of damage offsets is one for the trial judge, not the jury to decide.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u201c \u2018McMILLIN joins ... in requesting that the court address the issue of offset before the remainder of the case.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The first statement is contained in one of McMillin\u2019s briefs on the issue of offsets. ASIC did not provide a record reference for the second statement, and thus we may disregard it. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.204(a)(1)(C); <em>Liberty National Enterprises, L.P. v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., supra, </em>194 Cal.App.4th at p. 846.) In any event, neither statement alone nor both statements together establish an agreement by McMillin and ASIC to have Judge Alksne decide the issue of <em>damages </em>based on declarations and oral argument. At most, McMillin asked the court to decide the potential effect of the Settlement proceeds on McMillin\u2019s alleged damages in order to limit or exclude evidence of the Settlement,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>not </em>to preclude McMillin from going to trial on the causes of action in the TAC. Finally \u2014 and tellingly \u2014 ASIC does not tell us where in the record <em>it </em>agreed to the procedure that it now contends was intended by the parties and accepted by the court; and our familiarity with the record does not disclose such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">(iii) <em>Trial Court\u2019s Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">As explained at part III.A.l., <em>ante, </em>we consider ASIC\u2019s motion in limine as if it had been a motion for nonsuit after opening statement. As such, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling de nova, viewing the evidence and offers of proof most favorably to McMillin, and resolving all presumptions, inferences and doubts in its favor; and we will uphold the order granting ASIC\u2019s motion only if it is required as a matter of law. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 28; <em>Amtower, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1594\u20141595.) Under this standard, Judge Alksne\u2019s order granting ASIC\u2019s motion in limine \u2014 and, therefore, the related judgment \u2014 must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The parties do not dispute that pursuant to express language in certain of the Settlement agreements, $274,154 was allocated to McMillin\u2019s defense expenses in the <em>Baker </em>litigation. McMillin presented this evidence to the trial court, explaining: \u201c[I]f it was McMillin and the settling carriers\u2019 intent to allocate a portion of the [settlement] funds to settlement of defense costs, then the allocation would have been set forth explicitly in the settlement agreements].\u201d This statement and a reasonable inference from it establish that because the remaining Settlement proceeds ($416,000) were unallocated, the settling parties did not intend that those funds be allocated to <em>Baker </em>fees \u2014 i.e., those Settlement funds instead should be allocated to settling insurers\u2019 resolution of the cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, <em>not </em>to the cause of action for breach of the contract duty to defend. Doing so leaves McMillin with its claim for <em>Baker </em>fees \u2014 sufficient evidence to defeat a motion for nonsuit after opening statement, the standard we are to apply.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Thus, under the standards for ruling on motions for nonsuit \u2014 which are the same for purposes of our standard of review on appeal <em>{Edwards, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 28) \u2014 Judge Alksne erred in rejecting McMillin\u2019s presentation (that unallocated Settlement proceeds be allocated to resolving the tort claim) and accepting ASIC\u2019s presentation (that unallocated Settlement proceeds be allocated first to resolving the contract claim), leaving McMillin without evidence of damages. In making such a ruling in limine, the trial court essentially granted a nonsuit as to the issue of McMillin\u2019s alleged damages without requiring the statutory procedural protections associated with nonsuit proceedings, thereby precluding McMillin from trying its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">(iv) <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In ruling that McMillin was precluded from arguing that the unallocated Settlement proceeds either are not an offset to contract damages or are allocated to the tort damages, the trial court erred in essentially granting a nonsuit in ASIC\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">ASIC\u2019s arguments regarding offsets based on the Settlement proceeds do not defeat McMillin\u2019s right to go to trial on the TAC. The fact that McMillin may have obtained the Settlement from 11 other insurers years after the tender of defense to ASIC \u2014 regardless how the Settlement proceeds are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>allocated \u2014 affects only McMillin\u2019s potential <em>right to recover damages </em>from ASIC, not whether McMillin <em>suffered damages </em>as a result of ASIC\u2019s alleged breaches.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">4. <em>The Orders Granting the Motions in Limine Are Reversed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The minute order filed July 26, 2012, precluding ASIC from disputing its alleged duty to defend is reversed; and on remand, the court should enter an order denying the SAC plaintiffs\u2019 motion in limine. The minute order filed October 22, 2012, precluding McMillin from arguing that the unallocated Settlement proceeds either are not an offset to contract damages or are allocated to the tort damages, is reversed; and on remand the court should enter an order denying ASIC\u2019s motion in limine.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">As evidenced in this appeal, using an in limine motion as a substitute for a potentially dispositive statutory motion produces substantial risk of prejudicial error. \u201cThe disadvantages of such shortcuts are obvious. They circumvent procedural protections provided by the statutory motions or by trial on the merits; they risk blindsiding the nonmoving party; and, in some cases, they could infringe a litigant\u2019s right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>(Amtower, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at p. 1594.) Accordingly, \u201c[t]he better practice in nearly every case is to afford the litigant the protections provided by trial or by the statutory processes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1588.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>B. <em>ASIC Is Not Entitled to Judgment on McMillin\u2019s Cause of Action for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">As part of its cross-appeal, ASIC asks us to affirm that portion of the judgment in its favor on McMillin\u2019s third cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">However, since only a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d can prosecute an appeal (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 902), we question whether ASIC has standing to raise this request in its cross-appeal. A party is legally \u201caggrieved\u201d for appeal purposes only if its \u201crights or interests are injuriously affected by the judgment.\u201d <em>(County of Alameda v.

(ASIC also relies on this doctrine in support of its position on a different issue in its cross-appeal, and likewise, ASIC does not provide authority for application of this doctrine.) The doctrine of implied findings provides that, if the parties in a <em>civil court trial </em>waive a statement of decision, then on appeal the appellate court will presume that the trial court made all factual findings necessary to support the judgment for which substantial evidence exists in the record; i.e., the necessary findings of ultimate facts will be implied, and the only issue on appeal is whether the implied findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Michael U. </em>v. <em>Jamie B. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 787, 792-793 [218 Cal.Rptr. 39, 705 P.2d 362].)

Co. </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 425, 438 [212 Cal.Rptr. 466, 696 P.2d 1308].) Since McMillin\u2019s contract claim is based on an alleged breach of the duty to defend the <em>Baker </em>litigation, proof of actual coverage is not required; rather, McMillin\u2019s burden is to present only a prima facie case of entitlement to a defense by showing that the claims in the <em>Baker </em>litigation <em>potentially </em>fall within the insuring provisions of the Policy. (Montrose, <em>supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 300, 304; Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 2014) | 7:571.6, p. 7B-26.) The burden then shifts to ASIC to show <em>conclusively </em>that the claims alleged in the <em>Baker </em>litigation were not covered under the Policy. <em>(Montrose, </em>at pp. 300, 304; Croskey et al., <em>supra, </em>1 7:571.7, p. 7B-26.)

In its letter brief, ASIC contends that, because the proceedings were essentially a stipulated trial (not a motion in limine), McMillin\u2019s appeal presents issues to be reviewed under the \u201cmore lenient\u201d standards of \u201csubstantial evidence and abuse of discretion.\u201d In so doing, however, ASIC fails to advise <em>what </em>standard applies to <em>what </em>ruling(s) or to provide any <em>authority </em>for its position. In the same sentence, ASIC describes the procedure as \u201ca pre-trial determination of mixed legal and factual issues\u201d \u2014 which, if true, would suggest a de nova standard of review.

Here, during the in limine proceedings, there were no disputes as to McMillin\u2019s alleged contract damages, the total amount of Settlement proceeds, or the amount of Settlement proceeds allocated expressly to contract damages by the settling insurers; rather, the parties\u2019 disagreements centered on who had the burden of proof and whether, as a matter of law, McMillin suffered damages.

We disagree. In the context of an equitable subrogation dispute between two insurers, <em>J.
