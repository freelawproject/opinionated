H. Dewey, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqx\">as to the first ground of exception, contended, that by the Rev. Sts. c. 59, \u00a7 1, real estate could only be conveyed by deed ; and that the paper in question had none of the requisites of a deed (see 4 Kent (4th ed.), 460 and following pages) except the words of conveyance, \u201c release \u201d and \u201c quitclaim,\u201d which were not used in connection with any other technical words, and which might be applied to the plaintiffs interest in the personal estate of George Hunting. <em>Ingell </em>v. <em>Nooney, 2 </em>Pick. 362. As to the second ground of exception, he referred to <em>Brimmer </em>v. <em>Long Wharf, </em>5 Pick. 131; <em>Dorr ell </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>17 Pick. 263 ; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Pinkham, </em>18.

It was intended, we think, to discharge the administrator from his liability to the plaintiff for his share of the personal estate of the deceased, and it was intended to be a full discharge; and if it had been intended to convey the plaintiff\u2019s share in the real estate, an estate in fee, and not a life estate only, would have been conveyed. Such is the reasonable presumption, and there is nothing in the language of the deed to rebut it.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As to the second exception, the defendant contended, that as he was, at the time of the alleged trespass, in possession of the close described, claiming title as a tenant in common with the plaintiff, this action could not be maintained, although the plaintiff had the sole and exclusive legal title to the estate. But the court ruled, that if the legal title to the estate was in the plaintiff, and he was in possession thereof, he could maintain the action, although the defendant was also in possession thereof claiming title thereto, as a tenant in common with the plaintiff. This ruling was unquestionably correct. For if the title was in the plaintiff, and he had possession, the defendant\u2019s claim and possession were unlawful, and can be no justification of the alleged trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
