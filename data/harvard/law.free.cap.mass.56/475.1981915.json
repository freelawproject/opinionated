The writ was dated October 9th, 1844. The trial was before <em>Ward, </em>J., in the court of common pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\">It appeared, on the trial, that the plaintiff had a bill against the defendants, which was read by the moderator at the annual meeting 'of the defendants, oil the 6th of March, 1843, and it was voted thereupon to leave it with the selectmen. The charges for work on this bill amounted to $18-60.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">In January, 1844, the plaintiff presented a second bill to the selectmen for payment. This bill included all the charges contained in the first, with additional charges for work, and the charge for rent, and is the same with the account annexed to the writ, except that it contained no charge for interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-7\">It appeared, that it was the usage in Rehoboth, when a bill was presented for payment, for the <em>selectmen to </em>pass upon it; if they approved the bill, they drew an order on the treasurer for the amount to be paid, and left it with the town treasurer; and the creditor then called on the treasurer for payment. In the case of the plaintiff\u2019s bill, the selectmen, on the 13th of April, 1844, having disallowed the charge for rent, drew an order on the treasurer for the payment of the other charges therein, amounting to $24-67, and left the same with the treasurer, who met the plaintiff soon after in the street, and informed him that $24-67 of his bill was ready for him. To this the plaintiff made no reply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-8\">On the 4th of December, 1844, after the commencement of this action, the defendants tendered the plaintiff the sum of $26-64, for the charges of blacksmith\u2019s work, and the further sum of $5-57, for his costs to that time, and these sums were brought into court on a plea or specification of tender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-9\">It was agreed, that the charges for blacksmith\u2019s work were proved, and that the charge for rent could not be recovered. The only question was, whether the defendants had tendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>enough, and this depended upon the amount of interest which the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\">The defendants requested the court to instruct the jury, that there was no evidence of such a demand as would entitle the plaintiff to interest; that the notice given by the treasurer to the plaintiff, that he was ready to pay him $24 67, was a tender for the purpose of stopping interest; that the presentment of the second bill was an absolute waiver in law of all claim to interest on the first; and that if the amount tendered for the debt, with that tendered for the costs, making together the sum of $32-21, was in the gross more than sufficient to cover the whole amount of the plaintiff\u2019s bill and costs, the defendants were entitled to a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-6\">The court instructed the jury, that there was evidence for them to consider, tending to prove a demand by the plaintiff, on or before the 9th of March, 1843; that the notice of the treasurer, that he was ready to pay the plaintiff $24-67 of his demand, was not such a tender as would necessarily stop the interest, if any had begun to accrue; that the presentment of the second bill was not, of itself, an absolute legal bar to the claim for interest, but was strong evidence of a waiver, which the jury should consider; and that the sums tendered respectively for debt and for costs must.be considered separately, having been separated in the tender and in the pleadings, and could not be put together into one gross sum, for the purpose of defeating the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants thereupon filed exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-8\"><em>N. Morton, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-9\">1. In order to entitle the plaintiff to the interest which he claims, he should have proved a demand and refusal, or that the amount due was liquidated. <em>Walden </em>v. <em>Sherburne, </em>15 Johns. <em>409; </em>1 Am.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7L\">The only question raised in this case is, whether the defendants were bound to pay more interest than they tendered and brought into court. It appears to us, that the case falls clearly within that class, in which interest cannot be recovered upon an open and running account, for work and labor, goods sold, and the like, unless there is some contract to pay interest, or some usage, as in the case of the custom of merchants, from which a contract may be inferred, or where the defendant is a wrong-doer in acquiring or detaining money. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Nevers, </em>15 Pick. 500. The only recent case, which countenances the contrary doctrine, is the case of <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>22 Pick. 291, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>that, we think, was founded on a special promise to pay a specific sum, capable of being made certain, on a particular day.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">But, in the present case, there was no demand and refusal. In 1843, the plaintiff presented liis account for services, and the town did not refuse payment, but referred it to the selectmen. The plaintiff did not apply to the selectmen, until a year after, and then presented his demand with additional items. The selectmen allowed all the charges on that bill, which the plaintiff now proves himself entitled to, and gave him notice of such allowance. But, further, in both cases, he presented another large demand, which he sued for, and has failed to establish. Perhaps the trial in this case was the new trial, which was ordered by this court in the action between the same parties, reported in 12 Met. 26. If this is the same case, the principal item in controversy, the demand for rent of the meeting-house, was sharply \u2018contested, and large costs were incurred ; and as to the real matter of controversy, the plaintiff was the failing party. If, in any case, a demand would lay the foundation for a claim of interest, it must be a separate and distinct demand for a debt or sum of money, which is afterwards admitted or proved to be due. <em>Oriental Bank </em>v. <em>Tremont Ins. Co. </em>4 Met. 1; <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Charlestown Branch Railroad Co. </em>11 Met. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">But, further, we are of opinion, that the notice given by the treasurer to the plaintiff, that $24-67, being the whole amount of his bill then demanded, except the contested claim on which the defendants prevailed, though not a technical tender, was such an offer as to prevent the accruing of interest by way of damages. <em>Suffolk Bank </em>v. <em>Worcester Bank, </em>5 Pick. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">On both grounds, the court are of opinion, that the direction, given by the judge at the trial, was incorrect, and therefore that the verdict must be set aside, and a new trial had in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
