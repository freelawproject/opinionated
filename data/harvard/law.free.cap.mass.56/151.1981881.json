At the trial, which was before Merrick, J., in the court of common pleas, the defendant contended, among other things, that the note was without consideration, inasmuch as it was given by the defendant for a debt of his son, Joshua Corbin, jr., who, at the time of the contracting of the debt, was of full age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-9\">The court instructed the jury, that if the note in suit was given for the debt of the defendant\u2019s son, it was without consideration, unless it was given with the knowledge, or at the request of the son, or unless, when it was given, the plaintiff did, in fact, discharge the debt due to him from the son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-10\">The jury, under these instructions, returned a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff thereupon alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-11\"><em>B.

The presumption was, that the jury were instructed as to every point, which the evidence tended to prove.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-6\">Wilde, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">It appears to the court, that the instructions to the jury in this case were too restrictive. The action is assumpsit on \u00e1 promissory note, given by the defendant, for a debt due to the plaintiff from the defendant\u2019s son, he being of full age. The jury were instructed, that if the note was given for the debt of the defendant\u2019s son, it was without consideration, unless it was given with the knowledge, or at the request, of the son, or unless, when the note was given, the plaintiff did in fact discharge the debt due to him from the son. These instructions excluded from the consideration of the jury any evidence of a discharge of the debt afterwards, or of a promise to discharge it, or of a promise to delay to prosecute, or an actual delay; either of which, if proved, would be a sufficient consideration. Indeed, the slightest consideration would be sufficient. It is said, that it does not appear that any such evidence was given, there being no report of the evidence ; and in this respect the report is defective. But, from the instructions, we think it may be inferred, that they were intended to limit and restrict the evidence in the case as stated. It is not asserted by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that there was not, in fact, any evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s forbearance to sue the son, or of his receiving the note in discharge or payment of the debt. Under these circumstances, we think a new trial ought to be granted, although the case is brought up in a very defective form.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
