Examination by two other doctors, Dr. Serkin and Dr. Libertson, resulted in a report dated July 9, 1968, in which defendant was found to be suffering from <em>\u201c </em>an obvious mental deficiency \u201d and their conclusion was that \u2018 \u2018 because of his mental deficiency the defendant does not understand the charge against him and cannot assist and cooperate in his defense \u201d. Defendant was then committed to Matteawan State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">In April, 1969 Matteawan informed the court that it was <em>\u201c felt </em>\u201d that defendant was fit to proceed and he was returned to Wayne County for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Defendant was re-examined by Dr. Bergman who reported that his condition was unchanged and unchangeable. On court-ordered re-examination Drs. Serkin and Libertson reported that since their 1968 examination defendant had acquired certain rote knowledge but was still unfit for trial <em>\u201c </em>because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>his mental deficiency Defendant was thereupon committed for the second time in October, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Repeating the pattern the Matteawan authorities advised the court in May of 1970 that \u00a3\u00a3 it was felt \u201d that defendant was fit for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Defendant\u2019s third commitment began, predictably, with the report of his own psychiatrist, Dr. Bergman, that he was still incapable of standing trial. A court-ordered examination was then conducted by Dr. Serkin and by a psychiatrist new to the case, Dr. Giminez. On July 21,1970 they reported that defendant \u20181 was mentally retarded, classifying as a borderline mental defective \u201d. For purposes of a more complete evaluation these two doctors had defendant examined by the psychologist at the Wayne County Mental Health Clinic, who concluded that, &lt;\u00a3 it is very possible that, through concrete examples, fairly complex material could be taught him \u201d. The two doctors then concluded, \u00a3 \u00a3 It would seem, therefore, that since this man has been shuttled back and forth between Wayne County and Beacon, (although strictly speaking he should not stand trial * * *), the best way to handle the present problem is to let him partake in his defense, with the proviso that his appearance in court be explained to him in the simplest, concrete manner. We trust the above will help settle this complex case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">At a hearing six days later on July 27 Dr. Serkin modified his testimony somewhat. He concluded that defendant\u2019s mental condition had \u00a3\u00a3 changed to a degree \u201d. Defendant still could understand the indictment \u00a3\u00a3 only in the most general way. * * * If his attorney put everything in a simple, basic way, he could understand * * * Whether he would have a full understanding is another story * * * much would be over his head.\u201d When pressed with the ultimate question as to whether defendant could stand trial Dr. Sirkin was equivocal. He said, \u00a3\u00a3 I think I would have to say no because of his limited intellect. Of course that is a qualified no because there are some things he could help in.\u201d Dr. Giminez in effect confirmed the opinions of his professional colleague. The court reserved decision. On August 12 without further testimony, the court found defendant capable of standing trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">During following court appearances defendant\u2019s conduct led to agreement that the competency hearing should be reopened. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>This time, on October 16, 1970, the examining doctors, again Drs. SerMn and Bergman, concluded that defendant was no longer capable of standing trial. Querried as to the change from the opinion expressed in July, Dr. Serlrin responded, <em>\u201c </em>I think I can properly say that we stretched a point and felt that in order to keep^him from being sent back and forth to Beacon for the rest of Ms days, it would be wise in a careful or guarded manner to have him participate in his defense, that he could if everything was put simply to him, that he could understand it and maybe therefore participate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The court found defendant incapacitated and recommitted him to Beacon State Facility where he remained until June of 1971 when for the third time the court was informed that <em>\u201c </em>it was felt \u2019 \u2019 by the authorities there that defendant could proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On defendant\u2019s return to Wayne County defense counsel moved to have his mental condition re-evaluated, and Drs. Serkin and Libertson were appointed again. With reservations they nevertheless concluded that <em>\u201c </em>it is possible that this man could stand trial, if he were to cooperate with Ms defense counsel, and if procedures were kept simple. However, one cannot be sure how he would react to the pressures of a trial. If his counsel finds that he can talk reasonably with Mr. Jordan, then it might be worth going on with his defense. If his counsel finds that he cannot assist in his defense properly (from the attorney\u2019s standpoint), Mr. Jordan should be reconfined to a mental institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\"><em>A </em>final competency hearing was held on August 6, 1971. Dr. SerMn then testified, <em>\u201c </em>This time he did in spite of his anger, he did relate well enough to give us the idea that he knew what was going on and if he did cooperate with his attorney might be able to satisfactorily partake in his defense.\u201d He admitted that defendant might not co-operate with his attorney but in his opinion defendant could make a choice. Dr. Serkin admitted that he was still concerned over the fact that defendant was being transferred back and forth. \u201c I think this has been in my thinMng. I think that I have probably leaned as far as I could and still stay within the limits of truth and honesty and so on. I think I have leaned further because I have known that he has been as you say \u2018 yo-yoed \u2019 back and forth.\u201d Dr. Libert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>son agreed that defendant was capable of standing trial, but admitted that he might not co-operate with his attorney. He testified that he found a marked improvement since the examinations he had made in 1968 and 1969. A determination of defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial was made on August 10, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Defendant\u2019s trial began on September 22, 1971 and ended on September 28,1971 with the verdict of guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We interpret this record as disclosing continuing and essentially undeviating testimony of defendant\u2019s serious mental incapacity. Dr. Serkin\u2019s testimony in August, 1971 in support of the proposition that defendant was then competent to stand trial was admittedly based on his desire to terminate defendant\u2019s being \u201c yo-yoed \u201d between court and confinement \u2014 clearly an unacceptable formulation of capability to stand trial. Both Drs. Serkin and Libertson recognized the possibility of defendant\u2019s non-co-operation with his counsel in which event it would be necessary to <em>\u201c </em>modify the Courtroom techniques then to accommodate this explosive characteristic \u201d. In one view Dr. Libertson\u2019s final testimony could be said to provide a basis for the conclusion reached by the court. In our view, however, on the whole record in this case, the proof falls short as a matter of law, of meeting the requirement that defendant be able to comprehend his predicament and be capable of participating rationally in his own defense (CPL 730.10; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Laudati, </em>35 N Y 2d 696).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">On oral argument we were informed that defendant was at that time committed to Matteawan State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The order of the Appellate Division should accordingly be reversed, defendant\u2019s conviction vacated and the case remitted to County Court, Wayne County, for further proceedings on the indictment at such time as defendant in consequence of a <em>de novo </em>hearing is determined to be capable of standing trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b615-8\">Gabrielli, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlK\">(dissenting). The defendant stands convicted for the April 27, 1968 shotgun killing of George Lee, Jr. At trial he asserted his freedom from guilt by reason of his insanity at the time of the commission of the murder. Upon his appeals to the Appellate Division and this court he has again advanced that ground for a rev\u00e9rsal of his conviction as well as a second ground, to wit, that he was incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>A majority of this court now holds that he <em>\u201c </em>was incompetent to stand trial as a matter of law It is this conclusion with which we find fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Little is to be served in rereviewing the pretrial procedural processes of this case. Suffice it to say, and it remains undisputed, that at the final of the several pretrial hearings, held on August 6, 1971, the two court-appointed psychiatric experts testified as to their examinations, rendered their opinions, and concluded that the defendant was capable of standing trial; and, thereafter the court found as a fact that the defendant was fit and competent to proceed to trial. This holding has been affirmed by an unanimous Appellate Division. In light of all this evidence adduced upon the hearing we find it impossible to reach the conclusion of the majority that, as a matter of law, he could not proceed to trial.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No one has urged, as indeed it may not be, that upon a hearing to determine competency to stand trial, .the People are required to prove such status beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">While the defendant has claimed, as indicated, a lack of criminal responsibility because of his insanity at the time of the murder, he makes no frontal attack or serious claim on this point in this court; and we may conjecture with some conviction, that he is unable to assail the jury finding that the People proved his sanity at the time of the murder beyond a reasonable doubt, it appearing that there was, as asserted by the People and undenied by the defendant, <em>\u201c </em>Substantial expert testimony was presented on both sides of this issue</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Chief Judge Bbeitel and Judges Jasen, Wachtleb and Rabin concur with Judge Jones; Judge Gabbielli dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judge Stevens concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Order reversed, judgment vacated and case remitted to Wayne County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\"> In a proceeding to vacate a judgment of conviction upon similar grounds alleging mental illness at the time of trial, wherein there was psychiatric evaluation prior to trial, this court affirmed a denial of a further hearing when it was undisputed that he was committed to Dannemora State Hospital five weeks after he was sentenced and remained there for 13 years <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caldo, </em>24 N Y 2d 847).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
