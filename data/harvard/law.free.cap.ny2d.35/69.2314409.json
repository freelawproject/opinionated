Defendant\u2019s confession, oral and written, was properly received in evidence, both upon trial and the <em>Huntley </em>hearing. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>396 F. 2d 492; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>United States, </em>375 F. 2d 363, 389 U.

The opinion testimony of Dr. Richard Jaenike, an expert witness, was properly received by the court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Keough, </em>276 N. Y. 141; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>12 N. Y. 358; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mathias, </em>20 A D 2d 696.) III. The opinion testimony of Dr. Richard Jaenike, an expert witness, was properly received, notwithstanding that his opinion was confirmed by extrajudicial statements. <em>(People </em>v. <em>DiPiazza, </em>24 N Y 2d 342; <em>Matter of Lee </em>v. <em>County Ct. of Erie County, </em>27 N Y 2d 432.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b105-6\">Rabin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkK\">Defendant Gary Lee Stone was convicted by a jury of the murder of his wife. His sole defense was insanity. His principal contention upon appeal is that the expert opinion of Dr; Richard Jaenike, a court-appointed psychiatrist, as to defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the commission of the crime, was improperly admitted into evidence. The defendant claims that the doctor\u2019s opinion was based in part upon interviews with individuals other than defendant, some of whom did not testify at trial. It is argued that the rule in <em>People </em>v. <em>Keough </em>(276 N. Y. 141) requires reversal of the conviction because the doctor\u2019s opinion was not based solely upon his personal observation and examination of the defendant and facts in evidence. We have concluded that the trial court properly admitted Dr. Jaenike\u2019s expert testimony and that the conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">At trial, three psychiatrists testified: Dr. Pollack for the defendant and Drs. Jaenike and Lynch for the People. Of these, both Pollack and Jaenike interviewed individuals who knew the defendant but who did not testify at trial. Dr. Jaenike, a psychiatrist with over 40 years of experience, testified that between November 4, 1970 and May 25, 1971, he interviewed the defendant six times, but that the defendant refused to talk about his wife\u2019s death or the circumstances surrounding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>After Ms last interview with the defendant on May 25, the doctor spoke to 12 other people including defendant\u2019s friends, 2 police officers who were present when defendant signed a confession three days after the crime, 2 doctors and others acquainted with the defendant. Four of these 12 did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Some detail is required in describing the challenged testimony. On direct examination by the prosecution, Dr. Jaenike was asked a hypothetical question which posited certain facts regarding commission of the crime. The doctor was asked his opinion of defendant\u2019s capacity at the time of the crime to appreciate the nature and consequences or the wrongfulness of the hypothesized conduct, based not only upon his interviews with the defendant but upon his conversations with others as well. Defense counsel objected on the ground that the doctor\u2019s conversations with persons who had not testified in the case could not be included in his evaluation of the defendant\u2019s sanity. The trial court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The prosecution then posed the hypothetical again, this time asking for the doctor\u2019s opinion based upon matters in evidence and upon Ms observations of and interviews with the defendant. \"Defense counsel objected on the ground that it was too difficult for the witness to isolate his opinion to the sources specified. The court overruled the objection stating that counsel could make this inquiry on cross-examination. Dr. Jaenike then responded that in his opinion defendant <em>\u201c </em>possessed the substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Thereafter, during lengthy cross-examination, defense counsel questioned the extent of the doctor\u2019s reliance upon the 12 additional interviews. The doctor stated: \u201c I wanted the information from the outside to perhaps help me to finally formulate my final opimon.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>There was some uncertainty in my mind.\u201d Under further cross-examination, the doctor stated: \u201c I needed this information.\u201d Defense counsel then moved to strike the doctor\u2019s opinion. After the court ordered the jury to leave the courtroom, defense counsel stated he was moving to strike because Dr. Jaenike \u201c had access or did use the information * * * which would be within the hearsay rule \u201d, The court then allowed the District Attorney to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>an examination during which the doctor stated: <em>\u201c </em>I needed more information which is usually necessary in all the people that I see or examine that I need <em>confirming or non-confirming </em>information, data to <em>substantiate </em>what I think * * * <em>It didn\u2019t change my opinion </em>but I needed more information because I alone cannot in most cases make just an independent study and isolate the individual from the rest of the people who know him.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The court, <em>sua sponte, </em>then asked the doctor whether he would be able to give an opinion of defendant\u2019s mental condition with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, <em>\u201c </em>without talking to the people that you have named, without any interviews with those people * * * [but] [biased solely on your interviews with the defendant and hospital record, the portion that is in evidence.\u201d Dr. Jaenike responded: \u201c Yes, I could give an opinion but I wouldn\u2019t have been as certain as I was after my interviews with the other data.\u201d The court then denied defendant\u2019s motion to strike, stating: <em>\u201c </em>It will go to the <em>weight </em>that that jury wants to give it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel excepted to the ruling and the court ordered the jury returned to the courtroom. Then, in the presence of the jury, defense counsel continued his cross-examination and asked Dr. Jaenike whether he <em>\u201c </em>as an intelligent, competent psychiatrist felt [it]was necessary \u201d to seek the additional background data \u201c before [he] could render a medical opinion with reasonable medical certainty as to Mr. Stone\u2019s condition as of August 30th or 31st, 1970 [the date of the killing] \u201d. The doctor responded: <em>\u201c No, </em>I don\u2019t think I could have done it, no, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Defendant argues that Dr. Jaenike\u2019s opinion was based, in substantial part, upon the extrajudicial statements of the people he spoke to after his interviews with the defendant. We find little, if any, support in the record for this assertion. The doctor repeatedly stated during his testimony that the additional interviews were conducted to \u201c crystalize \u201d, \u201c substantiate \u201d, \u201c finalize \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>confirm \u201d the view he had of defendant\u2019s state of mind as a consequence of his six interviews with the defendant. We note that the Trial Judge was very careful to satisfy himself that an independent, legally competent basis existed for the opinion in the doctor\u2019s interviews with the defendant and in the medical records in evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Once reasonably assured of a legally competent basis for <em>Dr. </em>Jaenike\u2019s testimony, the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the opinion in evidence, subject to challenges to its weight on cross-examination. In addition, the court in its charge to the jury regarding expert testimony, instructed among other things, that the jury could accept such testimony \u201c if you find that [it] is based on underlying facts which have been established and the expert knew what he was talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The defendant argues, however, that the doctor\u2019s statement on cross-examination \u2014 that as an intelligent, competent psychiatrist he did not think he could have rendered a medical opinion as to defendant\u2019s mental condition with a reasonable degree of medical certainty without conducting the additional interviews \u2014 renders his opinion inadmissible. Defendant relies upon the <em>\u201c </em>rule \u201d of <em>People </em>v. <em>Keough </em>(276 <em>N. </em>Y. 141, 146, supra) \u201c limiting opinions of experts aside from hypothetical questions, [i.e., facts' already in evidence] to those based <em>solely </em>on observation and an examination of the defendant \u201d. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Since the jury ultimately decides the sanity or insanity of the defendant, the purpose of the <em>Keough </em>rule is to aid the jury in its search for the true determination by assuring that the facts upon which an expert opinion is based are before it. The assumption is that the jury is then better able to evaluate the relative worth of the opinion <em>(People </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>302 N. Y. 163, 172) and to determine whether the opinion is <em>\u201c </em>concocted to produce a desired result \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Keough, supra, </em>at p. 146). At the same time the rule is designed to allow cross-examination into the basis of the opinion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cerami, </em>33 N Y 2d 243, 249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">In cases like the present, however, the limitations of the rule are apparent, for its rigid application discourages the professionally responsible psychiatrist from exploring sources of background information relevant and necessary to a sound medical opinion as to the defendant\u2019s sanity. The effect is to render the more thorough and thoughtful opinion inadmissible because not based <em>exclusively </em>upon observations of the defendant and facts in evidence. (See, generally, Rheingold, The Basis of Medical Testimony, 15 Vanderbilt L. Rev. 473, 526 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>et seq.; </em>Diamond &amp; Louisell, The Psychiatrist as an Expert Witness, 63 Michigan L. Rev. 1335, 1350-1354.) Where, as here, the court has reasonably assured itself of a legally competent basis for the psychiatrist\u2019s opinion, a mechanical application of the <em>Keough </em>rule is to be avoided. \u201c Making available to our triers of fact the information available from the arts and sciences remains one of the continuing challenges of the law.\u201d (5 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, N. Y. Civ. Prac., par. 4515.03.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The Legislature has recognized the importance of adequate access by the jury to the psychiatrist\u2019s skill and knowledge. The strictness of the <em>Keough </em>rule has been modified by CPLR 4515<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>DiPiazza, </em>24 <em>N </em>Y 2d 342, 351), and CPL 60.55<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (formerly Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 398-b) (cf. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>County Ct. of Erie County, </em>27 N Y 2d 432, 441). The latter statute, which deals specifically with psychiatric testimony in cases like the present, represents an effort by the Legislature to strike a balance between the potentially conflicting factors we have mentioned \u2014 the medical soundness and legal admissibility of a psychiatrist\u2019s expert opinion. CPL 60.55 represents a legislative recognition of the importance of adequate psychiatric opinion <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>County Ct. of Erie County, </em>27 N Y 2d 432, 441, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>The modification of <em>Keough, </em>particularly by virtue of CPL 60.55, allows the psychiatrist\u2019s expert opinion to be admitted where the opinion is substantially, though not exclusively, based upon observation and examination of the defendant and facts in evidence. The purpose for which the psychiatrist, is called as an expert witness in cases like the present is to render his opinion. In evaluating the worth of that opinion, the jury should be informed of his sources and how he evaluated those sources in arriving at his conclusion. On cross-examination, the validity of his reasoning process may be probed and any \u201c shaky factual basis \u201d of the opinion exposed. (Cf. 5 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, N. Y. Civ. Prac., par. 4515.03.) The jury may then take the opinion for what they think it is worth. (See, generally, Dieden &amp; Gasparich, Psychiatric Evidence and Full Disclosure in the Criminal Trial, 52 California L. Rev. 543.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Having explored the factual basis for the expert psychiatric opinion, and found it legally competent, the court in this case correctly determined that the existence of further support for the opinion in medically sound but legally hearsay evidence would not affect its admissibility, but only its weight. (Cf. 3 Wigmore, Evidence [Chadbourn rev.], \u00a7 688; McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 15.) Dr. Jaenike testified in response to the court\u2019s questioning that he was able to express his opinion based upon legally competent evidence with \u201c reasonable certainty That he independently pursued other sources to achieve a greater degree of professional certainty did not defeat admission of his testimony. This is particularly so where, as here, the doctor\u2019s reliance, if any, upon the extrajudicial statements was slight, and where the third-party sources served only to confirm the opinion reached as a result of the psychiatrist\u2019s interviews with the accused. The.doctor was thoroughly cross-examined; the sources he appealed to and the process by which he reached Ms opinion were effectively exposed. We also note that there was more than sufficient evidence in this record from which a jury could conclude that the defendant was sane, able to premeditate the crime and intend to kill his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We have considered the defendant\u2019s other contention on appeal and find it without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of conviction should he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler and Stevens concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-5\">. CPLR 4515 provides: <em>\u201c </em>Unless the court orders otherwise, questions calling for the opinion of an expert witness need not be hypothetical in form, and the witness may state his opinion and reasons without first specifying the data upon which it is based. Upon cross-examination, he may be required to specify the data and other criteria supporting the opinion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\">. CPL 60.55 provides: \u201cRules of evidence; psychiatric testimony in certain cases. When, in connection with a defense of mental disease or defect, a psychiatrist <em>who has examined the defendant </em>testifies at a trial concerning the defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the conduct charged to constitute a crime, b\u00e9 must be permitted to make a statement as to the nature of the examination, the diagnosis of the mental condition of the defendant and his opinion as to the extent, if any, to which the capacity of the defendant to know or appreciate the nature and consequence of such conduct, or its wrongfulness, was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect at that time. <em>The psychiatrist must be permitted to make any explanation reasonably serving to clarify his diagnosis and opinion, and may be cross-examined as to any matter bearing on his competency or credibility or the validity of his diagnosis or opinion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
