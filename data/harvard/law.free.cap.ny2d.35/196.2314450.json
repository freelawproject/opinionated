A review of the suppression hearing testimony discloses that at about midnight on November 15, 1971 Officer Haskins of the Livingston County Sheriff\u2019s Department surprised a burglar, who then eluded him. By radio the officer promptly reported the incident and a description of the burglar to his headquarters and to other Sheriff\u2019s patrols in the area. Shortly thereafter and five miles away Officer Ni Castro of the same department, acting upon Haskins\u2019 radio advice, stopped a speeding automobile operated by defendant Fustanio, in which one Hadden was a sole passenger. It was raining very hard.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Officer Ni Castro arrested Fustanio for speeding. He observed that Hadden was breathing hard, was nervous and very wet, and that he fitted the description of the burglar which Officer Haskins had given. Officer Ni Castro radioed to his fellow officer, Patrick Gillan, to come to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Upon Gillan\u2019s arrival Ni Castro advised him that Hadden\u2019s appearance gave grounds to suspect that he was the man who eluded Officer Haskins. Officer Gillan asked Fustanio if he could <em>\u201c </em>check the trunk \u201d of his automobile. Fustanio replied that the officer \u201c could look \u201d, and Fustanio opened the trunk for him. Gillan made a \u201c quick visual search \u201d of the trunk and saw there a silver colored bar about three feet long with a hook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>on the end of it. Because of the weather and their desire to have Officer Haskins see Fustanio and Hadden, the officers decided to go to the scene of the burglary at once. Hadden was put into Grillan\u2019s patrol car, and the officers had Fustanio drive his vehicle back to the burglary scene, escorted by the two patrol cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">At the pretrial suppression hearing it was found, and is undisputed, that on arrival at the burglary scene Officer Haskins identified Hadden as the burglar, and Hadden was immediately arrested therefor. Fustanio\u2019s automobile was promptly seized, the bar was removed from the trunk and Fustanio was arrested on the charge of possession of a burglar\u2019s instrument. His automobile was then towed to the Sheriff\u2019s parking lot, arriving there at about 4:00 a.m. while it was still raining, and it was kept there in custody of the Sheriff. Later that morning at about 8:45 o\u2019clock another deputy searched the trunk of this vehicle and found a police radio and other items therein. Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress them was denied after a hearing, upon the ground that the consent which defendant gave at midnight to Officer Grillan to <em>\u201c </em>look \u201d into the trunk was a general consent for the Sheriff\u2019s Department to search the trunk at any time concerning this incident, and those items were admitted into evidence against defendant upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">A question of law is presented as to whether Fustanio\u2019s consent that Officer Grillan 1 \u2018 could look \u2019 \u2019 into the trunk extended to all the officers of the Sheriff\u2019s Department and continued into the next morning and authorized the search of the trunk made at that time. The court is divided on the resolution of that question. We find it unnecessary to determine that question, however, for a majority Of the court are in agreement that there was ample basis for search of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Officer Grillan had seen the bar in the trunk of Fustanio\u2019s automobile when Fustanio opened it for him. When, at the scene of the burglary, Officer Haskins positively identified Fustanio\u2019s passenger, Hadden, as the burglar there existed probable cause not only for the arrest of Hadden but for seizure of the automobile and the arrest of Fustanio for possession of a burglar\u2019s instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">It is well established that once the police have lawfully taken possession of an arrested person\u2019s property, especially where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>there is knowledge or probable cause that it contains contraband or evidence of the crime, they have the right to examine it \u2014 to search it \u2014 within a reasonable time and at a reasonably convenient place for such contraband or other evidence of the crime for which the arrest was made <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perel, </em>34 N Y 2d 462, 466-468; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brosnan, </em>32 N Y 2d 254, 260-261; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>16 N Y 2d 186, 189). This is so, even if the search may not be justified as an incident of the arrest <em>(Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U. S. 42, 47-48). In light of the circumstances existing at the time of the arrest, that is, the hour, the rain and the place, it was reasonable for the police to defer their further search of defendant\u2019s automobile until later that morning at the Sheriff\u2019s parking lot, where the vehicle had remained in police custody. The denial of the suppression motion was, therefore, proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should he affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b234-6\">Wachtler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ6\">(dissenting). The conclusion of the majority that the evidence seized from the trunk of defendant\u2019s automobile was properly admitted at trial is based on the premise that since there existed probable cause to arrest there was probable cause to seize the defendant\u2019s vehicle and, furthermore, probable cause to search the trunk. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The evidence seized from the trunk of the impounded car while the car was in the Sheriff\u2019s parking lot should have been suppressed. The search here was not justified as incident to an arrest, nor as an inventory search. Moreover, since the vehicle had been impounded and towed to the Sheriff\u2019s parking lot at a time when the defendant was in custody, there was no danger that the evidence could he destroyed or spirited away.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">There was probable cause for the arrest and sufficient probable cause to obtain a search warrant. However, absent exigent circumstances,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I cannot agree that this justified a warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Babin and Stevens concur with Judge Wither<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> ; Judge Wachtler dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-11\"> See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brosnan </em>(32 N Y 2d 254, 263, Wachtler, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-12\"> Designated pursuant to section 2 of article VI of the State Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
