The record establishes that a police officer stopped the vehicle driven by petitioner based on her failure to yield the right-of-way, to maintain her lane and to stop at a red light. Although the officer warned petitioner of the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical test, she nevertheless refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, the determination is supported by substantial evidence. \u201c \u2018Hearsay evidence is admissible in administrative hearings\u2019 . . . , \u2018and if sufficiently relevant and probative may constitute substantial evidence\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Mastrodonato v New York State Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>27 AD3d 1121, 1122 [2006]; <em>see Matter of Gray v Adduci, </em>73 NY2d 741, 742 [1988]). Here, the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing established that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that petitioner had been driving while impaired or intoxicated, that the officer made a lawful arrest of petitioner and \u201cthat petitioner refused to submit to the chemical test after being warned of the consequences of such refusal\u201d <em>(Gray, </em>73 NY2d at 742; <em>see </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 [2] [c]). \u201c[T]he Administrative Law Judge [(ALJ)] was entitled to discredit petitioner\u2019s testimony to the contrary\u201d <em>(Mastrodonato, </em>27 AD3d at 1122), and the record as a whole does not support petitioner\u2019s further contention \u201cthat the [ALJ] was prejudiced or biased or had predetermined the case\u201d <em>(Matter of Donlick v Hults, </em>13 AD2d 879, 880 [1961]; <em>see Matter of Wai Lun Fung v Daus, </em>45 AD3d 392 [2007]).
