That the statute under which this proceeding is sought to be maintained is unconstitutional, and this court has no jurisdiction of the subject-matter of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-7\">\u201c 2d.

Chappell, </em>plaintiff in error, in person.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkcS\">The State of Maryland by an act of the General Assembly of Maryland, Acts of 1874, chapter 395, has expressly given its consent to the condemnation of land .for light-house purposes, by the United States. Section 10 provides: \u201c Jurisdiction is hereby ceded to the United States over such lands as shall be condemned, as aforesaid, for their use for public purposes, <em>as soon as the same shall be condemned, </em>under the sanction of the General Assembly of this State, hereinbefore given to said condemnation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-6\">It must be acknowledged that all the powers of the United States originate in the several States; that the States delegated certain rights and reserved certain rights, and that by the Tenth Amendment, those not delegated are reserved. One of these rights reserved was the right to prevent the United States from exercising exclusive jurisdiction in any places, except in the District of Columbia, and in such places as the State might consent to being acquired by purchase. If the State does not see fit to consent, it cannot be compelled to do so; if it sees fit to consent that jurisdiction shall be transferred \u201cas soon as. the same shall-be condemned,\u201d that is not a consent to such jurisdiction before said condemnation, and the State cannot be compelled to consent, except on its own terms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-7\">The mode of procedure prescribed by the law of the State and the act of Congress itself has not- been followed; a special jury of inquest has been convened, a statutory jury of inquiry. In the case of <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>United States, </em>91 U. S. 367, this court laid down the rule, that a condemnation proceeding is an action at common law. Being an action at common law, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>plaintiff in error is- entitled to a trial by a common law jury, and he has not been afforded that trial. A special jury of inquest of damages is a body of men in the nature of commissioners, misnamed a jury. They cannot exercise any of the powers of a common law jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-5\">The result of this distinction between a special body of assessors of damages, by whatever name they may be called, a jury, commissioners or assessors, and a jury at common law is this, that on appeal from the action of said commissioners or special jury, the party is entitled to a trial <em>de novo </em>by a common law jury before the appellate tribunal. <em>Steuart </em>v. <em>Baltimore, </em>7 Maryland, 500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-6\">The result of this reasoning is that the plaintiff in error is entitled to such a trial before the appellate tribunal, under the decision of <em>Steuart </em>v. <em>Baltimore, supra, </em>by jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-7\">According to the rule laid down in <em>Tide Water Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Arch, </em>9 Gill <em>&amp; </em>Johns. 511, the appellate tribunal tries the case <em>de novo, </em>the laws of the States being the rule of decision in the courts of the United States, except where repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, this plaintiff in error is entitled to a trial by jury in this court, of the questions of fact raised in the record, according to the course of the common law under the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-8\">This is the result of conferring jurisdiction upon the courts of the United States in this proceeding, which is held in <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>United States, </em>91 U. S. 367, by this court, to be an action at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-9\">These cases fully establish the principle that where a law secures a trial by jury upon an appeal, it is no violation of a constitutional provision for guarding that right, although such law may provide for a primary trial without the intervention of a jury. This is upon the ground that the party, if he thinks proper, can have his case decided by a jury before it is finally settled. <em>Steuart </em>v. <em>Baltimore, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-10\">The modes in which this-power is. exercised vary according to circumstances. Sometimes it is i\u00f1itiated by summoning a jury upon warrant, in the nature of an inquest <em>ad quod dam</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>nwn; </em>at others, boards of assessors are appointed to appraise dues and benefits; with the right of appeal to a court of record, <em>and </em>of review by a jury. <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Graves, 19 </em>Maryland, 351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQP\">In <em>Cruger </em>v. <em>Hudson River </em>Railroad, 12 N. Y. 190, it was held that the word \u201cjury\u201d had been used in a number of statutes to describe a body of men who are in fact commissioners or assessors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-5\">The plaintiff in error being entitled to a'trial by a common law jury,, under Article VII of the Constitution of the United States, has not been afforded that right, because he -was not brought into the lower court according to the course of the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-6\">The case of <em>Tidewater Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Archer, ubi sup., </em>demonstrates that- a statutory jury of- view is not a common law jury, and also lays down the rule that the party is entitled to have a trial before the appellate tribunal by a common law jury, and to try the case <em>de novo:</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-7\"><em>Mr. Assistant Attorney General Dickinson </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ahg\"> An act to authorize condemnation of land for sites of public buildings and for other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">Sec. 1.

The motion was not made at the first term, as required by Rule <em>14 of </em>this court, and no satisfactory cause is shown for the delay. ,2d. The copy of docket entries, submitted with the motion, while it shows that a petition for a writ of error was filed on that day, does not show that a writ of error was then allowed or sued out; and the plaintiff in error afterwards obtained the allowance of a writ of error from the Circuit Court to the District Court, which he abandoned, and; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>instead thereof, applied for and obtained the present writ of error from this court. 3d. The order overruling the demurrer to the petition, and directing a jury to be empanelled, was not a final judgment upon which a writ of error would lie. <em>Luxton </em>v. <em>North River Bridge Co., </em>147 U. S. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The writ of error now before us was sued out from this court to the District Court of the United States for the District of Maryland, under the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517,' \u00a7 5, which provides that \u201c appeals or writs of error may be taken from the District Courts or from the existing Circuit Courts direct to the Supreme Court in the following [among other] cases: \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u25a0First. \u201c In any case in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue; in such cases, the' question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified to the Supreme Court from the court below for decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Fifth. \u201c In any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States\u201d \u201cis drawn in question.\u201d 26 Stat. 827, 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">In order to bring a case within the first class, not only must it appear of record that a question of jurisdiction was involved in the decision below, but that question, and that alone, must be certified to this court. - If both a question of jurisdiction and other questions were before the court below, and a writ of error is allowed in the usual and general form to review its judgment, without certifying, or specifying the question of jurisdiction, this court cannot take jurisdiction under this clause of\u2019 the statute. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Hecht, </em>151 U. S. 324; <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Hagerman, </em>151 U. S. 329; <em>Colvin </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>157 U. S. 368 ; <em>Davis &amp; Rankin Co. </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>157 U. S. 673; <em>The Bayonne, </em>159 U. S. 687; <em>Van Wagenen </em>v. <em>Sewall, ante, </em>369.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">If, indeed, the writ of error is allowed upon the petition of the original plaintiff, asking for a review of a judgment dismissing the action for want of jurisdiction, and. the only question tried and decided in the court below was a question of jurisdiction, that question is sufficiently certified to this, court. <em>Lehigh Co., petitioner, </em>156 U. S. 322; <em>Interior Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Gibney, ante, </em>217. And if an appeal from a decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>of the Circuit Court appointing a receiver is allowed by that court \u201c solely upon the question of jurisdiction,\u201d and on a petition praying an appeal from the decree as \u201c taking and exercising jurisdiction,\u201d the question of jurisdiction is sufficiently certified. <em>Shields </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>157 U. S. 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">But in the case, just cited, of <em>Shields </em>v. Coleman, the essential requisite of the appellate jurisdiction of this court in this class of cases was defined as follows: \u201cIt is not necessary that the word <em>\u2018 </em>certify \u2019 be formally used. It is sufficient if there is a plain declaration that the single matter which is by the record sent up to this court for decision is a question of' jurisdiction, and the precise question clearly, fully and separately stated. No mere suggestion that the jurisdiction of the court was in issue will answer. This court will not of itself search, nor follow counsel in their search of the record, to ascertain whether the judgment of the trial court did or did not turn on some question of jurisdiction. But the record must affirmatively sh-ow that the trial court sends up for consideration a single definite question of jurisdiction.\u201d 157 U. S. 176,177.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The record in the present case falls far short of satisfying any such test. The defendant, among many other defences, and in various forms, objected to the jurisdiction of the District Court, because the act of Congress under which the proceedings were instituted was unconstitutional, because the proceedings were not according to the laws of the United States, and because they should have been had in a court of the State of Maryland; and the court, overruling or disregarding all the objections, whether to its jurisdiction over the case, or to the merits or the form of the proceedings, entered final judgment for the petitioners. There is no formal certificate of any question of jurisdiction; the allowance of the writ of error is general, and not expressly limited to such a question; .and the petition for the writ, after mentioning all the proceedings in detail, asks for a review of all the \u201c rulings, judgments and orders \u201d of the court \u201c upon the question of jurisdiction raised in said exc\u00e9ptions, pleas and demurrers, and the other papers on file in this cause,\u201d without defining or indicating any spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>cific question of jurisdiction. Here, certainly, is no such clear, full and separate statement of a definite question of jurisdiction, as will supply the want of a formal certificate under the first clause of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">But no question of jurisdiction having been separately certified or specified, and the writ of error having been allowed without restriction or qualification, this court, under the other clause of the statute, above cited, has appellate jurisdiction of this case as one in which the constitutionality of a law of the United States was drawn in question; and, having acquired jurisdiction under this clause, has the power to dispose, not merely of the constitutional question, but of the entire case, including all questions, whether of jurisdiction or of merits. <em>Nishimura Ekiu </em>v. <em>United States, </em>142 U. S. 651; <em>Horner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>143 U. S. 570, 577; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jahn, </em>155 U. S. 109, 112, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In support of the position that the act of Congress was unconstitutional, reliance was placed on art. 1, sect. 8, cl. 17, of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that Congress shall have exclusive power of legislation <em>\u201c </em>over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,- dock-yards, and other needful buildings; \u201d and on the statute of Maryland, by which a method is provided for the condemnation, for the use and benefit of the United States, of lands wanted for the erection of light-houses or other public buddings, and jurisdiction is ceded to the United States over such lands \u201c as soon as the same shall be condemned\u201d under this statute. Maryland Stat. 1874, c. 395, \u00a7\u00a7 1-13; 2 Public General Laws of 1888, art. 96, \u00a7\u00a7 5-17. It was argued that the act of Congress was unconstitutional, because it undertook to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the courts of the United States before purchase or condemnation of the lands in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">But in the case at bar the question is not of jurisdiction for. purposes of legislation, but of acquiring title by judicial proceedings. It is now well settled that whenever, in the execution of the powers granted to the United States by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Constitution, lands in any State are needed by the United States, for a fort, magazine, dock-yard, ligbt-bouse, customhouse, court-house, post office, or any other public purpose, and cannot be acquired by agreement with the owners, the Congress of the United States, exercising the right of eminent domain, and making just compensation to the owners, may authorize such lands to be taken, either by -proceedings in the courts of the State with its consent, or by proceedings in the courts of the United States, with or without any consent or concurrent act of the State, as Congress may' direct or permit. <em>Harris </em>v. Elliott, 10 Pet. 25; <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>United States, </em>91 U. S. 367; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>109 U. S. 513; <em>Fort Leavenworth Railroad </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>114 U. S. 525, 531, 532; <em>Cherokee Nation </em>v. <em>Kansas Railway, </em>135 U. S. 641, 656; <em>Monongahela Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>148 U.

Co., </em>106 Mass. 356; <em>United States, petitioners, </em>96 N. Y. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Nor is it necessary that Congress should itself select the particular land to be taken. In <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>United States, </em>above cited, it was decided that an act of Congress, authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to acquire by purchase at private sale, or by condemnation, a site in the city of Cincinnati, \u201cfor the accommodation of the United States courts, custom-, house, United States depository, post office, internal revenue and pension offices,\u201d was constitutional; and authorized the proceedings for condemnation to be had in the name of the United States in the Circuit Court of the United States under its general jurisdiction of actions at law in which the United States, or any officer thereof suing under the authority of an act of Congress, were plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">By the.Revised Statutes of the United States, the Lighthouse Board, under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, is entrusted with the discharge of all administrative' duties relating to the construction, illumination, inspection and superintendence of light-houses, light-vessels, beacons, buoys, sea-marks, and their appendages; and is authorized to purchase for the purpose, within appropriations made by Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>gress, land which does not belong to the United States. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 4658, 4660. And the act of August 1, 1888, c. 728, under which this proceeding was instituted, authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, whenever in his opinion it is necessary or advantageous to the United States, to acquire land for the purpose of a light-house by condemnation under judicial process in a court of the United States in the district in which the land is situated. 25 Stat. 357. This act is a constitutional exercise of the power of Congress, according to the decisions of this court, above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The statute of Maryland, above cited, provides that whenever the United States are desirous of procuring the title to, any land within the State, \u201cfor the purpose of erecting thereon any light-house, beacon-light, range-light, light-keeper\u2019s dwelling, forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, buoys, public piers, or necessary public buildings, or improvements connected therewith,\u201d and, cannot obtain the same by purchase; the United States, by.any agent authorized under the hand and seal of any member of the President\u2019s Cabinet, may,- by petition to the circuit court for the county where the land lies, have the land condemned for the use and benefit of the United States. That statute further provides that the petition shall state the bounds and quantity of the land, the purpose for which the United States desire to obtain title, and the names of the owners, and shall be verified by an affidavit of the agent of the United States; that, after notice to the owner, the court shall hear and determine upon the petition and any objections filed to the proposed condemnation, and, if it shall declare that the condemnation ought to be had, shall issue a warrant to the sheriff to summon .twenty jurors, \u201c and from them each party or his agent, or, if either be not present in person or by his agent, the sheriff for said party, may strike four jurors, and the remaining jurors shall act as the jury of inquest of damages ; \u201d that the sheriff, before the jury proceed to act, shall \u201c administer to each of them an oath that he will justly and impartially value the damages which the owner will sustain \u25a0by the use or permanent occupation of \u201cthe land required by the United States; \u201d that \u201c the jury shall- Summon such wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>nesses as the parties may require,\u201d and examine them on oath in relation to the value of the land, and reduce the testimony to writing, and ascertain and determine the compensation which ought to be made by the United States to the party owning or being interested in the land to be condemned; and that the jury shall reduce their inquisition to writing, and sign and seal it, and it shall then be returned by the sheriff, together with the testimony, to the clerk of the circuit court for the county; that the inquisition shall be confirmed by the court, if no sufficient cause be shown by the fourth day of the ensuing term, and, when confirmed, shall be recorded; that, if the inquisition be set aside, the court may direct another inquisition in the manner before prescribed ; that the inquisition shall describe the land condemned, and state the' valuation thereof; and that such valuation, when paid or tendered to the owner, shall entitle the United States to the land, for the use and purposes set forth in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The only position, other than the denial of the constitutionality of the act of Congress, argued by the plaintiff in error in this court, was that by the statutes and decisions of.. Maryland the jury which returned the inquisition was but a body of assessors of damages, in the nature of a special jury of inquest, or board of commissioners, and that he was entitled to have the whole case tried anew by an ordinary jury. In support of this position were cited the following cases, decided under different statutes of Maryland: <em>Tide Water Canal Co. </em>v. Archer, 9 Grill <em>&amp; </em>Johns. 479; <em>Steuart </em>v. Baltimore, 7 Maryland, 500; <em>State </em>v. Graves, 19 Maryland, 351. But, however that may be under the statutes of the State, it is not so under the act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The direction, in the act of Congress, that the practice, pleadings, forms and inodes of proceeding, in cases arising under it, \u201c.shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, forms and proceedings existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the State,\u201d must, as was said by this court in an analogous case, following the decisions under the corresponding provision of section 914 of the Be-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>vised Statutes, \u201cgive way, whenever to adopt the state practice would be inconsistent with the terms, defeat the purpose, or impair the effect, of any legislation of Congress.\u201d <em>Luxton </em>v. <em>North River Bridge Co., </em>147 U. S. 337, 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">This proceeding for the condemnation of an interest in landj for the use and benefit of the United States for lighthouse purposes, was instituted in-the District Court of the United States by the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the Attorney General of the United States, as authorized by the act of Congress. Having been commenced in the name of the Secretary of the Treasury, it was rightly ordered to be amended so as to make the United- States the formal, as they were the real petitioners. <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>United States, </em>91 U. S. 367; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jahn, </em>155 U. S. 109, 111; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hopewell, </em>5 U. S. App. 137. The proceeding was conducted in substantial accordance with the provisions of the statute of Maryland upon the same subject, except so far as controlled by the act of Congress under which it was instituted, or by other laws of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The provision of.the Maryland statute, that a petition in the county court shall be verified by affidavit of the agent of the United States, is inapplicable to a petition presented to a court of the United States by the officer designated in the act of Congress. And the provision requiring a sheriff\u2019s jury to reduce to writing, and to return to the clerk of the court, the testimony taken before them, has no application to a trial had and evidence taken before the court itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The proceeding, instituted and concluded in a court of the United States, was, in substance and effect, an action at law. <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>United States, </em>91 U. S. 367, 376; <em>Upshur County </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>135 U. S. 467, 476. The general rule, as expressed in the \u00a1Revised Statutes of the United States, is that the 'trial of issues of fact in actions at law, both in the District Court and in the Circuit Court, \u201c shall be by jury,\u201d by which is evidently-meant a trial by an ordinary jury at the bar of the court. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 566, 648. Congress has not itself- provided any peculiar mode of, trial in proceedings for the condemnation of lands for public uses. The direction in' the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of 1888, c. 728, \u00a7 2, that such proceedings shall conform, \u201c as near as may be,\u201d to those \u201cin the courts of record of the State,\u201d is not to be construed as creating an exception to the general rule of trial by an ordinary jury in a court of record, and as requiring, by way either of preliminary, or of substitute, a trial by a different jury, not in a court of record, nor' in the presence of any judge. Such a construction would unnecessarily and unwisely encumber the administration of justice in the courts of the United States. <em>Indianapolis &amp; St. Louis Railroad </em>v. <em>Horst, </em>98 U. S. 291, 301; <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Denton, </em>146 U. S. 202, 209; <em>Mexican Central Railway </em>v. <em>Pinkney, </em>149 U. S. 194, 206, 207. This plaintiff in error had the benefit of a trial by an ordinary jury at the bar of the District Court on the question of the damages sustained by him; and he was not entitled to a second trial by jury, except at the discretion of that court, or upon a reversal of its judgment for error in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">To prevent, any possible misconception, it is fit to observe that this case concerns only the taking by the United States, on making compensation to the owner, of an interest in- fast land above high water mark; and does not touch the question, argued but not decided in two recent cases, of the right of the United States to take, without compensation, for the purpose of a light-house, land under tide waters. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>149 U. S. 593; <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Waterworth, </em>155. U. S. 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
