After stopping the car and trying to close the hood without success, the three positioned the vehicle partially on the center median pavement and themselves stood in the roadway some distance from the car, flagging oncoming traffic to warn of the disabled vehicle. After this had continued for about 15 minutes, a passing motorist volunteered to go to telephone for a towtruck. Plaintiff and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>passengers continued to flag traffic from positions behind the disabled automobile for another five minutes, varying their locations, until, when plaintiff was walking in the road six or seven feet from his car, he was struck by a vehicle traveling on the Parkway and operated by one Conwell, defendant\u2019s insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The present declaratory judgment action seeks a determination that plaintiff is entitled to benefits under the no-fault provisions of Conwell\u2019s liability policy, following defendant\u2019s rejection of plaintiff\u2019s claim filed with it. The rejection was predicated on defendant\u2019s determination that \"[t]he claimant is not considered a pedestrian but a passenger of a disabled vehicle. He should be covered under the No Fault coverage of the disabled vehicle. Therefore benefits are denied under our insured No Fault coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Trial Term granted judgment declaring that defendant insurer is not obligated to plaintiff as a person entitled to benefits under the no-fault provisions of the Insurance Law. The Appellate Division unanimously reversed, and we now affirm that disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The question is whether plaintiff was a \"person other than an occupant of another motor vehicle\u201d within the contemplation of section 672 (subd 1, par [a]) of the Insurance Law. That paragraph defines the claimants who are entitled to payment of first-party benefits under the Comprehensive Automobile Insurance Reparations Act \u2014 the so-called no-fault program. If, as plaintiff claims, he is such a person then he is entitled to receive first-party benefits at the hands of Aetna, the insurer of the Conwell automobile; if, as the insurer asserts, plaintiff was an \"occupant\u201d of his own disabled car, then he is excluded from coverage under the Aetna policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">When plaintiff was struck by the Conwell vehicle he was not an \"occupant\u201d of his own car within the ordinary and customary meaning of the term, and the insurer does not contend otherwise. Its claim is predicated on the very much expanded meaning of the word \"occupying\u201d as used in section 617 of the Insurance Law under the Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation Law, and it asserts that the word \"occupant\u201d under no-fault should be accorded a similar expanded meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">When the MVAIC program was enacted in 1958 by section 617 the benefits of coverage in the case of hit-and-run accidents were extended to qualified persons \"occupying\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>motor vehicle at the time of the accident. Not content with the literal and customary meaning of the word, the Legislature explicitly provided that it was intended in that statute to embrace situations which would not normally be thought to be included in the term, i.e., in addition to including presence \"in or upon\u201d the motor vehicle \u2014 the normal denotation of the word \u2014 \"occupying\u201d was to extend as well to situations involving \"entering into or alighting from\u201d. Thus, the Legislature gave the word a specially constructed definition for the purposes of section 617 coverage. Taking guidance from this legislative signal the courts have held that a person who is \"vehicle oriented\u201d falls within the scope of the term for purposes of section 617<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 now a very far cry from the lexicographer\u2019s definition of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">From a policy standpoint this has accorded with the legislative declaration of purpose to secure to innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents recompense for the injury and financial loss inflicted upon them (Insurance Law, \u00a7 600, subd [2]). Inasmuch as \"occupying\u201d is a term defining included coverage, the more expansive a meaning accorded the term, the broader the sweep of coverage. Accordingly both Legislature and the courts have been disposed to stretch rather than to narrow the embrace of the critical word.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">When article 18 inaugurating no-fault insurance was added to the Insurance Law in 1973, in defining entitlement to first-party benefits the Legislature again had occasion to resort to use of the stem \"occupy\u201d in employing the term \"occupant\u201d. Notwithstanding the specially constructed definition ascribed in section 617 and charged with awareness of the judicial interpretation given the concept by the courts over the intervening years, the Legislature chose to use the unembellished word \"occupant\u201d. It neither expressly incorporated the MVAIC meaning of the term by cross reference, as it might have, nor did it include the statutory signal that it was, for no-fault purposes, to have the specially constructed definition including \"entering in or alighting from\u201d. We can only conclude that the Legislature made a conscious choice to give the word \"occupant\u201d a different meaning for no-fault purposes than its associated term \"occupying\u201d had for MVAIC pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>poses, in effect to leave the word to its customary lexicographical and thus more restricted meaning.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">This, too, serves to accomplish the presumed intention of the Legislature in seeking an equitable distribution of compensation among accident victims to assure maximum appropriate coverage of the new no-fault insurance program. In this instance, in contrast to that under MVAIC, the word \"occupant\u201d functions as a term of exclusion. Thus, to accord a restricted meaning will work an expansion of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">For the foregoing reasons we conclude that the word \"occupant\u201d appearing in section 672 (subd 1, par [a]) of the Insurance Law should be ascribed its normal, dictionary meaning and that plaintiff is therefore entitled to benefits under the policy issued by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\">.
