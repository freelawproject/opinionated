Except for his own statement that he was unable to do any work until September 15, 1934, the only evidence in the record of continued disability is to the effect that same terminated May 31st. If the evidence remaining in your files or your further investigation discloses, that claimant was actually prevented by such accident from pursuing his usual and customary labors, until September 15, 1934, he would be entitled under the terms of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to One Hundred Fifty-Three and 75/100 ($153.75) Dollars, and you would therefore be fully justified under the terms of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in making settlement with him in the sum of One Hundred Thirty-One and 25/100 ($131.25) Dollars, that being\u2019 the amount which he and his attorney have, according to your statement, agreed to accept in full settlement for injuries and loss of time resulting from such accident. Without such evidence and proof, and in the absence of a showing as to partial disability, the right to an award for temporary total disability would terminatel May 31st, and, would cover a period of six and one-half (6%) weeks, for such temporary total disability, in the sum of Forty-Eight and 75/100 ($48.75) Dollars.</p> <p id=\"b792-3\" pgmap=\"792\">Any settlement made should be from funds allocated to the Illinois Emergency Relief Commission available for such purposes, and if settlement is made it should be conditioned upon the dismissal of the case of Dan Dunbar vs. State, C. of C., No. 2516.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
