L. c. 201D (proxy statute), authorizes a proxy agent to commit a principal to a mental health facility. The question arises because the proxy statute does not address the issue directly, and commitment to such a facility, unless voluntary, produces a loss of freedom as well as the stigma of mental illness. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, 377 </em>Mass. 272, 280-281 (1979); <em>Superintendent of Worcester State Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hagberg, </em>374 Mass. 271, 276 (1978). We conclude that, absent an express limitation by the principal in the health care proxy itself, the proxy statute does not prevent an agent from making that treatment decision, provided the principal does not object. If the principal objects, or if she revokes her proxy after it has been activated, the proxy statute provides that the agent has no further authority to make treatment decisions \u2014 including the commitment or retention of the principal at a mental health facility \u2014 without a court determination that the principal is incapacitated. See G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 6, sixth par., \u00a7 7, second par.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In this case the hospital sought to commit the objecting principal under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, the involuntary commitment statute, whereupon a judge in the Probate and Family Court made a determination that commitment was in the best interests of the principal and that there was a likelihood of serious harm if she was not committed. G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(d). </em>There is therefore no basis on which to conclude that the involuntary commitment of the principal in this case was improper. We need not and do not decide whether, had a judicial determination been sought and obtained that the principal was incapacitated (G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 6), commitment by the agent over the principal\u2019s objection would have contravened the requirements of G. L. c. 201D, G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 (involuntary commitment), or any other provision of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>In 1998, Helen Bolduc, then seventy-four years old, executed a prototypical health care proxy, in which she authorized her daughter, as her agent, to make health care decisions on her behalf in the event she was unable to consent to them. Bolduc\u2019s health care proxy provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cMy Health Care Agent is granted full power and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>authority to consent to any and all medical treatment which I may need in the event that I am unable to consent to such treatment on my own including without limitation authority to consent for medical care, hospitalization, nursing home admission, or whatever else may in my Health Care Agent\u2019s sole judgment be in my best interest.... I further state to all the world that there are no limitations imposed upon my Health Care Agent\u2019s authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">By its express terms, the proxy placed no limitations on the authority of Bolduc\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In June, 2000, the proxy was activated while Bolduc was a resident of the Forestview Nursing Home in Warren. Her attending psychiatrist determined that she was suffering from auditory hallucinations and paranoid and psychotic thought, and that she lacked the capacity to make or communicate health care decisions, the proxy\u2019s triggering event. She was admitted to McLean Hospital (hospital) under the emergency hospitalization procedures specified in G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(a).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Her attending psychiatrist entered in Bolduc\u2019s record his determination that she was incapable of making or communicating health care decisions, thereby activating the proxy. See G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 6. On July 2, Bolduc\u2019s daughter, acting as her health care proxy agent, converted Bolduc\u2019s status at the hospital to \u201cconditional voluntary\u201d by executing on Bolduc\u2019s behalf an application for \u201cconditional voluntary\u201d admission, which was accepted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under \u201cconditional voluntary\u201d status there were no temporal limits on Bolduc\u2019s confinement. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *Had her agent not converted Bolduc\u2019s status, the hospital would have been required to file a petition to retain Bolduc on an involuntary basis within ten (now four) days of Bolduc\u2019s emergency admission. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(d), </em>inserted by St. 1986, c. 599, \u00a7 38.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">On August 7, Bolduc executed a written revocation of her proxy, and indicated her intention to leave the hospital.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record does not reveal the circumstances that triggered Bolduc\u2019s action. Two days later the hospital filed in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department a petition for involuntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>commitment under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, seeking to retain Bolduc at the hospital involuntarily.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>'<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Bolduc filed a motion to dismiss the hospital\u2019s petition on the ground that it was not timely filed. She claimed that her agent lacked the authority under the proxy to convert Bolduc\u2019s status at the hospital to \u201cconditional voluntary,\u201d and that the hospital\u2019s petition for involuntary commitment was therefore beyond the ten-day period within which to file a petition. G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(d). </em>See note 6, <em>supra. </em>The motion judge disagreed and, after a hearing, found that Bolduc was mentally ill and that failure to retain her at the hospital would create a likelihood of serious harm.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He denied Bolduc\u2019s motion to dismiss, and entered a six-month order of commitment. Bolduc filed an expedited appeal to the Appellate Division of the District Court Department. See Dist./Mun. Cts. Appellate Division Appeal Rule 8A (West 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Prior to oral argument before the Appellate Division, Bolduc was discharged from the hospital. The Appellate Division held that Bolduc\u2019s challenge to the order of commitment and the issues raised by her were moot, but addressed the merits of the claims as concerning matters of public importance \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Acting Supt. of Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>431 Mass. 101, 103 (2000), quoting <em>Guardianship of Doe, </em>391 Mass. 614, 618 (1984). The Appellate Division agreed with the motion judge and dismissed Bolduc\u2019s appeal. Bolduc appealed, and we granted her application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>direct appellate review. We affirm the order of the motion judge denying Bolduc\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">2. <em>Commitment to a mental health facility where the principal does not object to treatment. </em>In response to advances in medical technology that have made it possible to maintain and prolong life in circumstances previously not possible, every State has enacted legislation permitting individuals to give advance directives for health care decisions should they become incapable of communicating their own wishes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> First adopted in 1990, St. 1990, c. 332, \u00a7 1, the Massachusetts proxy statute, entitled, \u201cAn Act providing for the execution of health care proxies by individuals,\u201d reflects one of several approaches to the subject. Written in broad terms, it allows an appointed agent to make \u201cany and all health care decisions\u201d if granted such authority by a principal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 5. Advance directive statutes can apply to physical or mental conditions, or (as in Massachusetts) to both. G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5. One aspect of mental health treatment \u2014 whether an advance directive should convey the authority to commit a principal to a mental health facility \u2014 has been the subject of some debate among commentators,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is the subject of a uniform law promulgated by the National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and has been regulated in different ways in different States. The Massachusetts proxy statute does not address the subject. In contrast, twenty-five other States have enacted statutes that do. Ten States allow advance directives for mental health treatment, but prohibit any commitment \u2014 voluntary or involuntary \u2014 by the agent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Three States allowing such directives prohibit only involuntary commitment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Eight States allow Commitment only if expressly authorized by the principal in her proxy, in some cases for limited periods only.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Four other States permit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>principal to authorize an agent to admit the principal to a mental health facility provided that the authority is conferred in a document separate from a general durable power of attorney concerning, for example, property or financial assets.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The statutes in the last two categories (notes 17 and 18, <em>supra) </em>are silent as to involuntary commitment and, to our knowledge, no court has sanctioned indefinite involuntary commitment to a mental health facility even where there is express statutory authorization for voluntary commitment. See note 14, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Because the Massachusetts proxy statute does not address the issue, we must determine whether authority to commit is implicit in our statutory scheme.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Bolduc did not object to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>initial commitment to the hospital, and we consider first the agent\u2019s authority to act unopposed by her principal. General Laws c. 201D, \u00a7 2, provides that \u201c[ejvery competent adult shall have the right to appoint a health care agent by executing a health care proxy.\u201d Section 5 of the statute provides that an agent \u201cshall have the authority to make any and all health care decisions on the principal\u2019s behalf that the principal could make, including decisions about life-sustaining treatment, subject, however, to any express limitations in the health care proxy.\u201d \u201cHealth care,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201cany treatment, service or procedure to diagnose or treat the physical <em>or mental condition </em>of a patient\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 1. Bolduc argues that commitment to a mental health facility is beyond the scope of \u201ctreatment\u201d as defined in the statute, and that the Legislature could not have intended to permit such commitment without a judicial finding in every case that failure to commit would create a likelihood of serious harm. We disagree with both propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">There is no indication in the proxy statute that the Legislature intended the scope of \u201ctreatment\u201d to be limited. General Laws c. 201D, \u00a7 5, is sweeping in its scope \u2014 \u201cany and all health care decisions.\u201d \u201cHealth care\u201d is broadly defined, and does not limit an agent\u2019s authority regarding any particular areas of treatment. By referring specifically to the \u201cmental condition\u201d of a principal, the Legislature plainly contemplated an agent\u2019s authorizing some mental health treatments, again without limitation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Other provisions of the statute suggest that commitment to a mental health facility is indeed within the contemplated authority of a health care agent. The conflict of interest provision of the statute is one such indication. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Section 3 of the proxy statute prohibits the appointment of health care agents who may have a conflict of interest with a principal, defined as \u201coperator[s], administrator[s] or employ-eels]\u201d of a \u201cfacility\u201d at which the principal is a patient, resident, or applicant for admission when she executes the proxy.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 3. \u201cFacility\u201d includes \u201cany private, county or municipal facility . . . which offers . . . residential or day care services and is represented as providing treatment of persons who are mentally ill.\u201d G. L. c. 19, \u00a7 19.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, the proxy statute explicitly restricts operators, administrators, or employees of a facility that provides \u201ctreatment of persons who are mentally ill\u201d from acting as proxy agents.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Legislature must surely have intended treatment at mental health facilities to come within the definition of health care \u201ctreatment,\u201d or the conflict of interest provisions as applied to persons who are mentally ill would be redundant. See <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977) (statutory language principal source of insight into legislative purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Denying a health care proxy agent the authority to commit her principal to a mental health facility would also frustrate the evident purpose of the proxy statute: to support and enhance patient autonomy, while ensuring the principal\u2019s control over her health care decisions. Every person has a \u201cright\u201d under the proxy statute to appoint a health care agent, who is granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>authority to make health care decisions on her behalf as if she had made the decisions herself. G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 2. The agent\u2019s decisions are to be made from the principal\u2019s perspective: they must be in accordance with an \u201cassessment\u201d of her \u201cwishes,\u201d or, if her wishes are unknown, an \u201cassessment\u201d of her \u201cbest interests.\u201d G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 5. Any decisions not expressly prohibited by the principal have the \u201csame priority over decisions by any other person\u201d as if the principal had made them. <em>Id. </em>The proxy statute thus ensures that a patient\u2019s right of autonomy and self-determination with regard to medical care is respected, even after she loses the capacity to make and communicate her wishes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Restricting the range of choices available to a person who enters into a proxy arrangement would hinder the control over medical decision-making the statute seeks to foster. See G. L. c. 20ID, \u00a7 4 (iii) (health care proxy shall \u201cdescribe the limitation, if any, that the principal intends to impose upon the agent\u2019s authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Contrary to Bolduc\u2019s claim, permitting an agent to commit her principal to a mental health facility where the principal does not object is also consistent with our case law concerning the rights of incompetent patients with regard to health care decision-making.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Respect for patient autonomy does not end when a patient becomes incapable of making her own decisions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>See <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 746 (1977) (\u201cTo protect the incompetent person within its power, the State must recognize the dignity and worth of such a person and afford to that person the same panoply of rights and choices it recognizes in competent persons\u201d). We give effect to those rights by using a substituted judgment standard to approximate best what the incompetent person would have wanted were she able to communicate her wishes. See, e.g., <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489, 501-502, 512 (1983) (substitute judgment determination must be made before administration of antipsy-chotic drugs to incompetent patient); <em>Superintendent of Belcher-town State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 752-753 (right of incompetent person to refuse treatment for Hfe-threatening illness requires substituted judgment). By executing a health care proxy, a principal determines in advance that a person of her choice (rather than a judge) will make such medical decisions on her behalf. Reading into the proxy statute a restriction on her agent to act in one set of circumstances \u2014 commitment to or retention at a mental health facility where the principal does not object \u2014 would contravene the principles of individual autonomy embodied in this statute and expressed in our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Bolduc argues that inferring an agent\u2019s authority to order treatment in a mental facility when the principal does not object would nevertheless effectively deprive the principal of her right not to be restrained in such a facility without due process of law. Two provisions of the proxy statute mitigate this legitimate concern. The Legislature has provided that, even after a medical determination of incapacity has been made, a principal\u2019s wishes, will <em>always </em>prevail over those of her agent, unless a judicial determination of her incapacity is obtained. Thus, G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 6, specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u201cNotwithstanding a determination pursuant to this section that the principal lacks capacity to make health care decisions, where a principal objects to a health care decision made by an agent pursuant to a health care proxy <em>the principal\u2019s decisions shall prevail unless the principal is determined to lack capacity to make health care decisions by court order\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The statute also recognizes a principal\u2019s right to revoke the proxy, both before and after it is activated, and the principal is \u201cpresumed to have the capacity to revoke a health care proxy unless determined otherwise pursuant to a court order.\u201d G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 7. Revocation is simple and can be accomplished by \u201cnotifying the agent or a health care provider orally or in writing or by any other act evidencing a specific intent to revoke.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The principal need not know that revocation of the proxy would prevent commitment to a mental health facility; objection by the principal to <em>any </em>treatment decision of the agent \u2014 including commitment to or retention at a mental health facility \u2014 requires nothing more than signifying her objection. It is as simple as saying \u201cno.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Bolduc\u2019s proxy placed no limitation on her agent\u2019s authority; it specifically authorized her agent to hospitalize her. There is no reason to infer that at the time she executed the proxy, Bolduc did not wish to convey to her agent the power to commit her to a mental health facility, should the agent deem it in her best interests. There is no indication in the record that Bolduc protested her admission to the hospital, nor any indication that she objected to her hospitalization during the first thirty-five days of her treatment. We would fail to respect Bold-uc\u2019s own \u201cright,\u201d G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 2, to make treatment decisions through a proxy of her choice were we to read into the statute a restriction on her agent\u2019s authority to commit her to a mental health facility. The motion judge properly determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>that a health care proxy agent does have the authority to commit a principal to a mental health facility, provided the principal does not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">3. <em>Commitment to a mental health facility where the principal objects to treatment. </em>The respect for individual autonomy and self-determination that is reflected in the proxy statute and that has shaped our jurispmdence requires that we honor the desires of an individual expressed in her health care proxy. The right to refuse medical treatment is founded on those same values, and the Legislature has made clear that a principal retains her right of self-determination concerning medical treatment she chooses not to receive. Thus, even after a proxy has been activated, the principal may disagree with her agent, in which event \u201cthe principal\u2019s decisions shall prevail.\u201d G. L. c. 20ID, \u00a7 6. The principal may also revoke her proxy at any time. G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 7. In both cases the agent has no further authority to make treatment decisions, including the commitment or retention of the principal at a mental health facility, without judicial intervention. See G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7. Where there is disagreement between the principal and her agent, on application to affirm the agent\u2019s authority over the principal, the statute directs a judge to determine whether the principal \u201clacks capacity to make health care decisions.\u201d G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 6. Where there is revocation, the principal is \u201cpresumed\u201d to have the capacity to revoke her proxy \u201cunless determined otherwise pursuant to court order.\u201d G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In this case, when the hospital received Bolduc\u2019s written notice that she had revoked her proxy and that she wanted to leave the hospital, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>the hospital correctly determined, in its words, that it had \u201cno further legal authority to retain her at [its] facility.\u201d It thereupon immediately filed a petition for involuntary civil commitment, G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, and sought judicial permission to retain Bolduc against her will. In so doing the hospital\u2019s treating physician represented to the court that he had determined that failure to hospitalize Bolduc would create a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness, and provided the court with reasons for his diagnosis. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 7. A judge in the District Court thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>found that Bolduc was mentally ill and that her discharge from the hospital would create a likelihood of serious harm, as required by G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 8. See notes 9 and 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In the circumstances of this case, therefore, Bolduc\u2019s argument that she was denied due process of law in connection with her retention at the hospital fails: she received adequate process to protect her rights to refuse medical treatment. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, 377 </em>Mass. 272, 280-281 (1979); <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 746, 752-753 (1977). Because the hospital proceeded under the involuntary commitment statute, there was no need for a judicial determination of Bolduc\u2019s \u201cincapacity\u201d.under G. L. c. 201D, \u00a7\u00a7 6 or 7. We therefore need not and do not decide whether commitment over Bolduc\u2019s objection would have contravened G. L. c. 201D, G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 (involuntary commitment), or any other provision of law had the hospital not proceeded as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The judge\u2019s order denying the motion to dismiss is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">General Laws c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(a), </em>provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny physician who is licensed pursuant to [G.
