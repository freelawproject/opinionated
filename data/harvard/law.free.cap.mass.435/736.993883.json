The school committee contends, on various grounds, that the judge erred in upholding the arbitrator\u2019s award. We transferred the case here on our own motion. We need not discuss all of the school committee\u2019s arguments. We conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s award should have been vacated because he exceeded his authority in finding the association\u2019s grievance arbitrable where the agreement clearly and unambiguously excludes the nurses from its coverage. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of a judgment vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The background of the case is as follows. The school committee and the association are parties to a collective bargaining agreement effective July 1, 1997, through June 30, 2000 (agreement). The agreement covers the \u201cwages, hours, standards of productivity and performance and other conditions of employment,\u201d primarily for teachers. Pursuant to the \u201crecognition\u201d clause of the agreement, the association is \u201cthe exclusive bargaining agent and representative of those members of the professional staff of the Hanover Public Schools including teachers and partnership teachers, comprising Unit A, so-called. Unit A includes all professional employees excluding the Superintendent, the Assistant Superintendent, members of Unit B, so-called, substitute teachers, aides, nurses and all others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The agreement contains a clause concerning grievance procedures. The clause defines a \u201cgrievance\u201d as \u201ca written claim by the [school committee], [association, or an individual involving an allegation that the contract has been violated or involving a question concerning the interpretation of the contract.\u201d In the event that the association files a grievance, and is not satisfied with the school committee\u2019s response, arbitration may be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Prior to executing the agreement, the school committee recognized the association as the bargaining representative for the school nurses, but refused to include the nurses in \u201cUnit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>A.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The association attempted, through collective bargaining, to add the nurses to Unit A. That effort failed. Eventually, the parties submitted their dispute concerning the terms and conditions of the nurses\u2019 employment to interest arbitration,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and submitted the question concerning the nurses\u2019 inclusion in Unit A to the Labor Relations Commission (commission). The interest arbitration resulted in an agreement concerning the nurses\u2019 terms and conditions of employment for the period of July 1, 1995, through June 30, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The commission, on March 23, 1998, concluded that the nurses\u2019 unit should be accreted into Unit A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the commission\u2019s decision, the association asserted that the terms and conditions of the agreement applicable to Unit A members should also be applied to the nurses. Conversely, while acknowledging the nurses\u2019 membership in Unit A, the school committee maintained that the terms and conditions of the nurses\u2019 employment were subject to negotiation. Consequently, on April 28, 1998, the association filed a grievance. The school committee unsuccessfully sought to obtain an advisory opinion from the commission as to whether the terms and conditions of the agreement applied to the nurses accreted into Unit A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The association filed a demand for arbitration. The arbitrator</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>rejecting the school committee\u2019s contrary claim concluded that the association\u2019s grievance was arbitrable. The arbitrator went on to conclude that the school committee had acted improperly \u201cby not agreeing to make the entirety of said [ajgreement applicable to the nurses,\u201d and he ordered the school committee to apply all of the terms of the agreement to the nurses \u201ceffective April 28, 1998.\u201d The arbitrator based his decision on the fact that the commission had accreted the nurses, stating, \u201cthe recognition clause in the [a]greement can no longer be read to exclude nurses. To the contrary, it must be read to include them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The school committee, pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 11, commenced an action in the Superior Court to modify or vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award maintaining, as it does here, that the award was unlawful. The association moved for a judgment on the pleadings to confirm the award. A judge in the Superior Court allowed the association\u2019s motion, confirming the award. The judge concluded that the arbitrator had acted within the scope of his authority by finding that the grievance was arbitrable. He explained: the agreement provides for arbitration \u201cwhen there is an allegation that the contract has been violated or there is a question concerning the interpretation of the contract. As such, the [association\u2019s] claim that the provisions of the [ajgreement should have been applied to the newly accreted nurses is an allegation of contract violation and a matter of contract interpretation. In light of the prior decision of the [commission] to include the school nurses in Unit A, the arbitrator could no longer read the [ajgreement as excluding those nurses. Instead, the arbitrator properly exercised his authority and interpreted the recognition clause of the [ajgreement to include nurses as members of the professional staff in Unit A.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>The judge also rejected the school committee\u2019s various arguments that the arbitrator\u2019s award should be vacated. The school committee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">1. \u201cA matter submitted to arbitration is subject to a very narrow scope of review.\u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. J. <em>Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990). \u201cCourts inquire into an arbitration award only to determine if the arbitrator has exceeded the scope of his authority, or decided the matter based on \u2018fraud, arbitrary conduct, or procedural irregularity in the hearings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Marino </em>v. <em>Tagaris, </em>395 Mass. 397, 400 (1985). See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3). \u201cAn arbitrator exceeds his authority by granting relief beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement ... by awarding relief beyond that to which the parties bound themselves ... or by awarding relief prohibited by law\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., supra. </em>\u201cArbitration, it is clear, may not \u2018award relief of a nature which offends public policy or which directs or requires a result contrary to express statutory provision\u2019 ... or otherwise transcends the limits of the contract of which the agreement to arbitrate is but a part.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 28 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">2. The judge erred in concluding that the arbitrator had not exceeded his authority in finding the grievance arbitrable. The association, pointing to the definition of \u201cgrievance\u201d in the agreement, maintains that, because its grievance alleged that the school committee violated the agreement, its grievance was arbitrable. This narrow approach overlooks the fact that arbitration constitutes a matter of contract and the settled principle that an arbitrator\u2019s award must draw its essence from the contract, here, the agreement in its entirety, not just the provision defining the term \u201cgrievance.\u201d See <em>Local No. 1710, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>430 Mass. 417, 420-421 (1999), quoting <em>AT&amp;T Techs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Communications Workers, </em>475 U.S. 643, 648 (1986); <em>School Comm. of Needham </em>v. <em>Needham Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>398 Mass. 709, 713 (1986). The school committee\u2019s argument was not that the association\u2019s alleged grievance failed to constitute an arbitrable \u201cgrievance\u201d so defined, but that the agreement otherwise prohibited the arbitration of the dispute because its provisions plainly excluded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>nurses from coverage. As a result, the arbitrator was required to look beyond the association\u2019s bare assertion that the school committee had violated the agreement or the association\u2019s contention that its grievance concerned the interpretation of the agreement. To permit otherwise would result in the arbitration of <em>any </em>grievance merely alleging that the terms of the agreement had been violated or that the dispute concerned the interpretation of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The arbitrator failed to apply the unambiguous language of the agreement\u2019s recognition clause that negated his authority to inquire into or interpret further into the status of the nurses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. </em>v. <em>Local 27, United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union, </em>864 F.2d 940, 944 (1st Cir. 1988) (\u201cIf the language of an agreement is clear and unequivocal, an arbitrator cannot give it a meaning other than that expressed by the agreement\u201d); <em>Grobet File Co. of Am. </em>v. <em>RTC Sys., Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 134-135 (1988) (\u201cthe arbitrator may not ignore the plain words of the contract\u201d); F. Elkouri &amp; E. Elkouri, How Arbitration Works 470 (5th ed. 1997) (\u201cThere is no need for interpretation unless the agreement is ambiguous\u201d). The recognition clause states that \u201cUnit A.includes all professional employees <em>excluding </em>the Superintendent, the Assistant Superintendent, members of Unit B, so-called, substitute teachers, aides, <em>nurses </em>and all others\u201d (emphases supplied). There is nothing ambiguous in that language; it means exactly what it states, namely, that Unit A excludes the nurses and the agreement does not cover them. Because the limiting language speaks with clarity, and leaves no room for doubt as to interpretation, no presumption of arbitrability arose. See <em>Local No. 1710, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Chicopee, supra </em>at 421. The arbitrator exceeded his authority by transcending the confines of the agreement to resolve the purported issue of arbitrability. The commission\u2019s decision accreting the nurses into Unit A did not alter, and had no bearing on, the arbitrator\u2019s authority, which was at all times limited by, and derived from, the plain language of the agreement. See <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number><em>Pub. Safety, </em>430 Mass. 601, 603 (2000) (arbitrator \u201climited to considering matters encompassed by the collective bargaining agreement\u201d). See also <em>School Comm. of Needham </em>v. <em>Needham Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 713. To allow the arbitrator to ignore the recognition clause\u2019s unambiguous restriction would also render virtually meaningless another unambiguous provision in the agreement that states that an arbitrator \u201cshall have no power to modify, amend, add to, subtract from, or alter this [agreement.\u201d The aptness of the result is also supported by the consideration that the provisions of the agreement were never intended to include the nurses, and their inclusion might create the incongruous result of making wage, hours, and benefit terms meant exclusively for teachers and other Unit A employees applicable to the nurses.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">3.
