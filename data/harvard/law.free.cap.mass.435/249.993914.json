L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, appearing in the last sentence of the first paragraph that provides: \u201cIf the justice or clerk or assistant clerk of the district court, the bail commissioner or master in chancery determines that a cash bail is required, the prisoner shall be allowed to provide an <em>equivalent amount </em>in a surety company bond\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Based on the history of the bail statute, the reform context from which it developed, and the purpose it is intended to serve, we conclude that a judge may properly set such alternative bail amounts as a condition of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>On December 26, 2000, James Ray was arraigned in the Fall River Division of the District Court Department on complaints charging him with armed assault in a dwelling, armed robbery, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and intimidation of a witness. Bail was set at $1 million surety bond or $100,000 cash. Subsequently, a grand jury in Bristol County indicted Ray for the same offenses. At Ray\u2019s first appearance in the Superior Court, the Commonwealth requested the Superior Court judge to set the same bail terms as had been set in the District Court. The judge denied the request, concluding that G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, did not empower him to set different surety bond and cash bail amounts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bail was set at \u201c$100,000 flat.\u201d As such, Ray could have satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>fled the bail condition either by paying $100,000 in cash directly into the court (which would have been refundable to him at the conclusion of the case), or by securing a surety company bond in the face amount of $100,000 by paying a bail bondsman a nonrefundable fee of up to ten per cent (the maximum premium allowed) of the bail amount, that is, up to $10,000.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Commonwealth filed a petition in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, for relief from the judge\u2019s bail order. A single justice granted the relief, and, declaring the.statutory provision in question to be \u201cambiguous,\u201d concluded that the words \u201cequivalent amount\u201d could mean that the amount of the surety bond and cash bail must be equal \u201cor they could mean an \u2018equivalent amount\u2019 of bond that would be obtained by the sum of cash designated as bail, namely $100,000 would purchase a bond of one million.\u201d The single justice accepted this latter interpretation, which he noted the Superior Court had been following for some time, and vacated the bail order, remanding it to the Superior Court for further hearing on the basis of that interpretation. He also reserved and reported the matter to the full court for a \u201cdefinitive decision on the issue,\u201d which \u201cis of systemic importance and one which arises on a daily basis in the Trial Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">2. <em>The meaning of \u201cequivalent.\u201d </em>The specific provision of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, which mandates that a defendant be \u201callowed to provide an equivalent amount in a surety company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>bond,\u201d if a cash bail is required, was added to the statute by amendment in 1981. St. 1981, c. 802, \u00a7 2. The term \u201cequivalent\u201d is not defined in the statute and its interpretation in this context is a matter of first impression. The words of a statute are the main source for the ascertainment of legislative purpose, and when the text of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it must be construed in accordance with its plain meaning. See <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 490, 494 (1993); <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984), and cases cited. The word \u201cequivalent,\u201d as used here, does not plainly and unambiguously mean equal in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The word equivalent has two primary meanings: equal in value and equal in effect.* ****<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Depending on which of these meanings we ascribe to the Legislature\u2019s use of the word, we are led toward a different interpretation of the provision, each of which is rational. Because the text of the statute is ambiguous,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is appropriate to look \u201cat the purpose and legislative history of the statute.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Med. Sec., </em>412 Mass. 340, 346 (1992). When imperfection of language fails clearly to express legislative purpose or intent \u201c[statutes are to be interpreted ... in connection with their development, their progression through the legislative body, the history of the times, prior legislation, contemporary customs and conditions and the system of positive law of which they are part . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 401 (1931). Through this prism we interpret the statute \u201cin connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 872 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">3. <em>History of bail reform in Massachusetts. </em>The legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>history of the specific provision inserted by St. 1981, c. 802, is sparse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the history of bail reform in Massachusetts, which led to a complete rewriting of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 58, in the 1970\u2019s, is not. Because we must consider the words contained in this provision in the context of the system of law of which they are a part, it is necessary to examine that earlier history.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Prior to 1967, the usual means by which a defendant would obtain pretrial release was by posting bail through the purchase of a surety company bond from a professional bail bondsman for a nonrecoverable premium equal to between five and ten per cent of the bond\u2019s face amount. The practice was much the same throughout the country.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By the 1960\u2019s, it was a system that was increasingly viewed as disreputable and unacceptable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court noted in a review of the Illinois bail system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cPrior to 1964 the professional bail bondsman system with all its abuses was in full and odorous bloom in Illinois. Under that system the bail bondsman customarily collected the maximum fee (10% of the amount of the bond) permitted by statute . . . and retained that entire amount even though the accused fully satisfied the conditions of the bond. . . . Payment of this substantial \u2018premium\u2019 was required of the good risk as well as of the bad. The results were that a heavy and irretrievable burden fell upon the accused, to the excellent profit of the bondsman, and that professional bondsmen, and not the courts, exercised significant control over the actual workings of the bail system.\u201d (Footnote omitted. Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\"><em>Schilb </em>v. <em>Kuebel, </em>404 U.S. 357, 359-360 (1971). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Beginning with the passage of St. 1966, c. 681,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Massachusetts became a national leader in the bail reform movement, and was the first State to adopt legislation changing the presumption to one of release on personal recognizance rather than release on bail for offenses within the jurisdiction of the District Courts. Spangenberg, Bail Reform in Massachusetts: 1965-1967, 52 Mass. L.Q. 135, 146 (1967). This change in presumption was expanded with the passage of St. 1971, c. 473, \u00a7 1 (the Bail Reform Act), to include all crimes except those punishable by death. That act completely rewrote G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, and provided that a prisoner \u201cshall\u201d be admitted \u201cto bail on his personal recognizance without surety unless ... [it is determined] that such a release will not reasonably assure the appearance of the prisoner before the court.\u201d G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 473, \u00a7 1. See <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 490, 495 (1993), and cases cited (\u201cOur Legislature intended \u00a7 58 to protect the rights of the defendant by establishing a presumption that he or she will be admitted to bail on personal recognizance without surety and by delineating carefully the circumstances under which bail may be denied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">While the presumption of personal recognizance reduced the number of defendants required to post bail, it did not eliminate bail altogether. See S.R. Bing &amp; S.S. Rosenfeld, The Quality of Justice in the Lower Criminal Courts of Metropolitan Boston (1970). In a further effort to root out the corruption that existed in the Massachusetts bail bondsman system* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and reform what remained, this court, on November 16, 1971, ordered a pilot bail project to be carried out in selected District Courts. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>project, named the \u201cpercentage deposit bail pilot project,\u201d permitted a defendant who was not eligible to be released on his personal recognizance to be released by depositing with the court an amount of money equal to five per cent of the face value of the surety bond he would otherwise have needed to secure. The deposit was to be returned to the accused on his performance of all the conditions of his recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The project found the default rate for defendants released under these terms was lower than the default rate for defendants released under the professional surety bond system in the courts studied, presumably because the deposit was refundable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See Final Report of the Percentage Bail Project to the Chief Justice of the Superior Court and the Chief Justice of the District Courts 68.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The success of the project led to the widespread adoption of the practice in the District Courts. It also led to its incorporation into the administrative regulations of the District Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Administrative Regulation No. 4-77, entitled, \u201cStandards of Judicial Practice, Pretrial Release,\u201d was promulgated by the Chief Justice of the District Courts on August 31, 1977.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It included standard 1:07, entitled, \u201cRecognizance with Percentage Deposit in Lieu of Surety,\u201d which provided: \u201c[I]n lieu of surety, a cash deposit of approximately ten percent of the amount of the recognizance, to be returned to him upon the condition that he appear in court as required, has been found to be an effective technique to insure the voluntary presence of the defendant and is encouraged.\u201d The commentary to this standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>notes: \u201cIn order to promote the use of cash deposits in lieu of surety, courts have accepted a percentage of the recognizance amount \u2014 usually 10%. Since this practice is now in use, since it works to the defendant\u2019s advantage, since the Supreme Judicial Court has reviewed cases in which this procedure was followed, without objecting to it and, perhaps most importantly, since this procedure furthers the objectives of pretrial release, it is recommended . . . where personal recognizance without surety is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Similarly, according to a July 14, 1998, letter from the State bail administrator to the House chairman on the joint committee on the judiciary, the Superior Court committee on bail (bail committee) began recommending and encouraging judges in that court to enter bail orders that included both a surety bond amount and a cash amount equal to the maximum ten per cent fee that could be charged to secure such a bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In the context of this history, we are confident that the Legislature, in amending \u00a7 58 in 1981, did not intend to encourage a renewed preference for surety bonds over the percentage cash bail system that had emerged in the 1970\u2019s as a successful and widely accepted model of bail reform. Then as now the \u201cconsensus is that cash bail systems, despite [any] flaws, are a better alternative to the bondsman regime.\u201d Harmsworth, Bail and Detention: An Assessment and Critique of the Federal and Massachusetts Systems, 22 New Eng. J. on Crim. &amp; Civ. Confinement 228-229 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Our view finds further support in the long-standing interpretation given to the language of the 1981 amendment by the bail committee. Shortly after the 1981 amendment to \u00a7 58 took effect, the bail committee interpreted the \u201cequivalent amount\u201d language to mean that, if bail was set by a judge at a single figure, e.g., $1,000, the statute required the defendant to post either the entire amount as cash bail or pay a bondsman to secure a surety bond in the same amount. If, however, a judge issued an order setting one amount for cash bail and another for a surety bond, then the statute\u2019s language did not apply to the bail order because the judge had specified what amount in each arrangement represented the acceptable risk to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">While we may not fully agree with the bail committee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>reasoning regarding the proper application of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, its twenty-year unchallenged history supporting the setting of alternative bail amounts, combined with the continuing practice by many of the Commonwealth\u2019s courts of setting ten per cent cash bail as an alternative to surety bonds, suggests that, if the Legislature had intended to abolish this practice, the language it enacted in 1981 plainly failed to do so.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While the Legislature has amended G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, on numerous occasions since 1981, it has never changed this language and has rejected several attempts to further amend this portion of the statute to provide specifically that \u201cthe amount of bail set whether in cash or surety shall be the same.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See, e.g., 1999 Senate Doc. No. 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>4. <em>Conclusion. </em>In light of the statute\u2019s history and purpose, we conclude that the words \u201cequivalent amount\u201d contained in the last sentence of the first paragraph of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, mean an amount equal in effect. In the bail context, we conclude that a surety bond set at an amount ten times the amount of a cash bail is equal in effect to that cash bail. The reasons are several: the amount of the surety bond is equal to the minimum value of bond that could be obtained with the sum set as cash bail; the financial burden on the defendant is virtually the same; and the effect of ensuring the defendant\u2019s appearance in court throughout the proceedings is as great. The practice of setting the amount of the surety bond at ten times the amount of cash bail or, otherwise stated, of providing for a ten per cent cash equivalent to the surety bond, is therefore permitted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs of the Attorney General, International Fidelity Corporation, and Richard Verrochi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\">For the purposes of this opinion, we assume, without deciding, that this provision applies to bail set by judges of the Superior Court as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\">In making his decision, the Superior Court judge relied in part on a recent memorandum and order of a single justice of this court as authority for this interpretation of G.

While the single justice acknowledged that it was \u201ccommon practice to set cash bail in an amount equal to the amount of the premium for a surety bond,\u201d he nevertheless concluded that such orders were improper under the statute: \u201cThe amount of cash bail and the amount of the surety must be equal.\u201d Because the single justice could not determine whether the judge admitting the defendant to bail had intended bail to be $150,000 cash or surety bond, or $15,000 cash or surety bond, he remanded the matter for rehearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\">General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 61B, provides in part: \u201cAll professional bondsmen shall be governed by rules which shall be established from time to time by the superior court.\u201d Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules Governing Professional Bondsmen provides: \u201cNo bondsman shall charge or receive for his services in acting as surety excessive or exorbitant fees.

This argument confuses the intention of the private proponents of legislation with the intentions of the legislative body that enacted the statutory change, to the extent we may ascertain them. They are not necessarily the same. If it was the intention of the Legislature to require that cash bail and surety bond bail be set in the exact same dollar amount, it could have said so simply and unambiguously. More importantly, Ray\u2019s argument ignores the magnitude of the challenges facing the bail bond industry in 1981. The industry was under wholesale attack, and there was a powerful national movement to bar commercial sureties from posting bail altogether. This movement culminated in 1985 with a call by the American Bar Association for the abolition of professional bondsmen, 2 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, standard 10-1.3(c) (2d ed. rev. 1985), and led to the adoption by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws of a uniform rule of criminal procedure that excluded the posting of bonds by compensated sureties. Unif. R. Crim. P. 341(g)(2), 10 U.L.A. 42 (Spec. Pamph. 1992). See 2 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, <em>supra </em>at standard 10-5.3(d). In Massachusetts, some judges had begun setting cash-only bail in the 1970s, a practice noted and discouraged in the District Courts\u2019 1977 Standards of Judicial Practice, Pretrial Release, as being of \u201cquestionable legality.\u201d See Administrative Regulation No. 4-77, standard 1:08. In this context, any statutory support for the continued viability of any form of surety bond in Massachusetts (even if not as attractive to defendants as a cash alternative) would have been a legislative accomplishment for the industry. General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 58, as amended in 1981, accomplishes this objective even as we have interpreted its meaning today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, even in cases in which a judge sets bail in the form of a bond and a ten per cent cash alternative, a surety bond might be a more feasible or attractive option for some defendants.

A bond equal in value to cash bail is the same as a bond equal in effect to cash bail, and in either case, that means that the face amount of the bond is the same as the cash bail set by a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In my view, the construction given the statute by the court does not arise from any ambiguity in the word \u201cequivalent\u201d but from the unstated indirect object of the verb \u201cprovide.\u201d Under the statute, bail, whether it be in the form of cash or a surety bond, is provided to only one entity. That entity must be the Commonwealth. The result reached by the court requires two different indirect objects of the verb \u201cprovide\u201d: the Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>monwealth, if the defendant provides cash bail; and the bail bondsman, if the defendant provides the \u201cequivalent amount\u201d (\u201c \u2018equivalent amount\u2019 of bond that would be obtained by [providing the bail bondsman] the sum of cash designated as bail, namely $100,000 would purchase a bond of one million,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 251).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The result reached by the court runs counter to basic rules of statutory construction. Three aspects of that result bear mention. The first is the meaningless choice presented to a defendant, who can either pay the cash bail to the clerk of court and recover that amount at the end of the case, or pay an equivalent amount to a bail bondsman as the premium for a surety bond, plus fees, and recover nothing after disposition of the case. Second, if the bail bond system were as pernicious as the court has described, and the studies provided by the amici suggest that it is not, then the Legislature could have eliminated bondsmen altogether rather than devise such a convoluted, indirect method of putting bail bondsmen out of business. Third, the bail statute expresses a preference for personal recognizance, grounded in the presumption of innocence, and it thus calls for bail to be set in a reasonable amount. See <em>Mendonza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>423 Mass. 771, 774 (1996). As the bail statute is now construed, the surety bond is not a viable alternative for a defendant who cannot afford cash bail to obtain his freedom pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The court relies on the \u201ctwenty-year unchallenged history supporting the setting of alternative bail amounts\u201d for support. <em>Ante </em>at 257. In truth, judges set bail in a variety of ways, a point noted by the court. Judges set bail according to the formula approved by the court; judges set bail according to the formula subscribed by this dissent; and judges use other formulae for setting bail (e.g., $10,000 cash; $25,000 surety). There is nothing inherently wrong with any of these methods. The Legislature could amend the statute to reflect, and validate, these practices, thereby giving judges the flexibility needed to address circumstances when setting bail to ensure the presence of a defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Because I see no ambiguity in the words of the statute, I believe that those words should be given their common meaning such that the amount of the surety bond a defendant may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>post, its face value, represents an amount equivalent to the cash bail set by the judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
