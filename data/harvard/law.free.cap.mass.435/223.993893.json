The school district of Beverly (district) appealed from the order of a Superior Court judge affirming an arbitration award reinstating James Geller, a sixth grade teacher, who had been discharged for physically and verbally abusing his students on multiple occasions. The district asserts that the award reinstating Geller was beyond the arbitrator\u2019s authority, contrary to the best interests of the students, and violative of a public policy prohibiting teachers from using physical force against students.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">The Superior Court judge concluded that the arbitrator acted within the scope of his authority in ordering reinstatement. The Appeals Court reversed and vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award, holding that Geller\u2019s reinstatement offended \u201ca clear and well defined public policy against the use of physical force, however <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>slight, by a teacher against students.\u201d <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 297 (2000). This court granted Geller\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">This is the first occasion in which we have considered the dismissal of a teacher under the provisions of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44, the Education Reform Act of 1993.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I believe that the arbitrator exceeded the authority granted him by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, when he substituted his own judgment as to proper discipline for that of the district, after finding in substance that the district had sustained its burden of proving that Geller had engaged in \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher,\u201d one of the statutorily enumerated bases on which teachers with professional teacher status can be dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>1. <em>Factual background. </em>Geller was employed as a teacher in the district for over twenty years and had attained professional teacher status (formerly known as tenure), as defined in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41. He was dismissed in October, 1996, by the principal of the school in which he taught, with the approval of the superintendent of schools, for conduct unbecoming a teacher after it was determined that Geller had used physical force against students on three separate occasions. Geller appealed from his discharge to an arbitrator pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fourth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing the arbitrator found that Geller had engaged in the conduct alleged by the district and that \u201c[pjushing [students] against a wall and yelling in their faces is totally inappropriate.\u201d* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He further found that Geller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>conduct was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201ccannot be condoned.\u201d With respect to the penalty of dismissal, the arbitrator noted that, \u201conce having determined that misconduct occurred, the School Department has substantial discretion in determining the level of discipline to be imposed.\u201d He concluded, however, that the appropriateness of the discipline had to be measured against more than twenty years of service, no prior disciplinary problems, and good prior evaluations. Without elaboration, he found that, \u201c[i]t is in the best interest of the students that a teacher of Mr. Geller\u2019s accomplishments and experienced [sz'c] be retained.\u201d He then ruled that the district had \u201cjust cause to impose severe discipline, short of discharge,\u201d directed that \u201cthe decision in this case constitutes a final warning to [Geller],\u201d and ordered that Geller be reinstated at the start of the 1997-1998 school year without back pay. In his award the arbitrator found that \u201cthe dismissal of James Geller [was] not for just cause within the meaning of Chapter 71, Section 42,\u201d and in effect reduced Geller\u2019s dismissal to an unpaid suspension of approximately one school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. A </em>teacher with professional teacher status, such as Geller, can be dismissed only for \u201cinefficiency, incompetency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination or failure ... to satisfy teacher performance standards ... or <em>other </em>just cause\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, third par. If a teacher with this status is discharged, he or she may seek review of the dismissal by filing a petition for arbitration. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fourth par. At an arbitration hearing, the school district has the burden of proving the grounds for dismissal, in this case, conduct unbecoming a teacher. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par. In determining whether the school district has satisfied its burden, the arbitrator must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>consider the best interests of the pupils in the district and the need to elevate standards of performance. <em>Id. </em>The arbitrator is required to issue a \u201cdetailed statement of the reasons for [his] decision.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, sixth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The arbitrator\u2019s decision is subject to judicial review as provided in G. L. c. 150C (concerning collective bargaining agreements to arbitrate). G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, sixth par. Our role in reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s award pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, is limited. <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. Safety, </em>430 Mass. 601, 603 (2000), quoting <em>Concerned Minority Educators of Worcester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, </em>392 Mass. 184, 187 (1984). Unlike our review of factual findings and legal rulings made by a trial judge, we are bound by an arbitrator\u2019s findings and legal conclusions. \u201cThe courts are not authorized to reconsider the merits of an award even though the parties may allege that the award rests on errors of fact or on misinterpretation of the contract.\u201d <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 36 (1987) <em>(Misco). </em>See <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990); <em>School Comm. of Waltham </em>v. <em>Waltham Educators Ass\u2019n, </em>398 Mass. 703, 705 (1986) (arbitrator\u2019s decision may not be vacated on error of fact or error of law). \u201cEven a grossly erroneous [arbitration] decision is binding in the absence of fraud\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Trustees of the Boston &amp; Me. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>363 Mass. 386, 390 (1973). This narrow scope of judicial review reflects a strong public policy favoring arbitration. <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., supra </em>at 1007. However, if, on review, the court finds that an arbitrator has exceeded his authority in fashioning an award, the court is required to vacate it. G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a) </em>(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 407, 410-411 (1984) (whether arbitrator exceeded scope of his authority is question always open to judicial review).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">3. <em>Arbitrator\u2019s scope of authority. </em>The power and authority of an arbitrator is ordinarily derived entirely from a collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>bargaining contract, and he violates his obligation to the parties if he substitutes \u201c \u2018his own brand of industrial justice\u2019 for what has been agreed to by the parties in that contract.\u201d <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. </em>v. <em>Local 27, United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union, </em>864 F.2d 940, 944 (1st Cir. 1988), quoting <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960). An arbitrator cannot \u201ctranscend[] the limits of the contract of which the agreement to arbitrate is but a part.\u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., supra, </em>quoting <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 28 (1980). Stated differently, an arbitrator\u2019s \u201caward is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement\u201d that he is confined to interpret and apply. <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., supra </em>at 597. <em>School Comm. of Waltham </em>v. <em>Waltham Educators Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 706-707. In performing his responsibilities, the arbitrator exceeds his authority if he ignores the plain language of the contract. <em>Misco, supra </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In this case the source of the authority to arbitrate the dismissal of a teacher is a statute, not a collective bargaining contract. This important difference informs this court\u2019s determination of how the arbitrator\u2019s powers are to be ascertained and interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In the collective bargaining context, the arbitrator is ordinarily empowered to interpret the underlying contract and the extent of his powers thereunder. Such authority comes from the parties having agreed to it in the contract itself and is consistent with the notion that arbitrators have special expertise in the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements. See <em>School Comm. of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 115 (1977) (interpreting collective bargaining agreement ordinarily task for arbitrator and not court); <em>School Comm, of Hanover </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>369 Mass. 685, 685 (1976) (\u201cWe do not review the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the agreement, since that subject is committed to the arbitrator by the agreement\u201d). See also <em>Misco, supra </em>at 37-38 (\u201cit is the arbitrator\u2019s view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract that [the parties] have agreed to accept\u201d). But as the United States Supreme Court noted long ago, \u201cthe specialized competence of arbitrators pertains primarily to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>law of the shop, not the law of the land.\u201d <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 57 (1974), citing <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 581-583 (1960). \u201cWhere the determinations to be made are primarily issues of public law, the arbitrator possesses no special expertise . . . .\u201d <em>School Comm. of Hanover </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 156 (1975), <em>S.C., </em>369 Mass. 683 (1976) (no justification for allowing arbitrator to determine school committee\u2019s statutory rights). See <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union, </em>406 Mass. 36, 40 (1989), citing <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 407, 411 (1984) (\u201ccourt, upon review, need not defer to arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of relevant statutes\u201d). Hence, the responsibility for interpreting the meaning of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, and the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority thereunder remains with the court. It cannot be ceded to the arbitrator by agreement of the parties,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and has not been ceded to the arbitrator in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">4. <em>Analysis. </em>The principal dismissed Geller for conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>unbecoming a teacher based on three incidents of abuse (and a prior warning) that he contended supported that ground for dismissal. Conduct unbecoming a teacher is specifically identified in the statute as a ground on which dismissal is proper. The arbitrator found that Geller had engaged in the conduct with which he was charged. The fact that the arbitrator characterized the conduct as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and not \u201cunbecoming,\u201d and that he did not use the phrase \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher\u201d in his finding, but referred to it as conduct that \u201ccannot be condoned,\u201d is not determinative. He found facts and described those facts in a manner that clearly establishes Geller\u2019s conduct to be \u201cconduct unbecoming a teacher,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Having found that Geller engaged in serious misconduct that the statute specifically identifies as proper grounds for dismissal, the arbitrator proceeded to apply an additional \u201cjust cause\u201d analysis \u2014 weighing Geller\u2019s repeated misconduct against a more than twenty-year career of good performance \u2014 in an effort to gauge whether the punishment should be modified. In doing so he ignored the plain words and import of the statute. In essence, he substituted his own judgment of what the penalty should be for that of the district, and thereby acted beyond his authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In concluding that the arbitrator acted beyond the authority</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>vested in him by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, I interpret the statute in accord with the interpretation many courts have given to collective bargaining agreements that identify specific grounds warranting dismissal. In reviewing arbitration awards arising out of such agreements, courts have consistently held that, when an agreement specifically enumerates grounds for dismissal, the arbitrator does not have the authority to judge whether discharge is an excessive penalty for the violation committed. Fogel, Court Review of Discharge Arbitration Awards, 37 Arb. J. 22, 25-28 (No. 2, 1982). This is the case even when the agreement also provides for dismissal on just cause.* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Our statute is analogous to such an agreement. It enumerates six specific grounds on which dismissal may be based, in addition to \u201cother just cause.\u201d In this context, the six specific grounds set forth in the statute constitute adequate grounds for dismissal independent of \u201cother just cause.\u201d* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Stated conversely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the six specifically enumerated grounds constitute \u201cjust cause\u201d for dismissal by clear statutory mandate. From either perspective, a proper interpretation of the statute precludes the arbitrator from conducting a further \u201cjust cause\u201d analysis (e.g., weighing the teacher\u2019s prior record against the misconduct for the purpose of justifying a different sanction) once he has found that one of the enumerated grounds for dismissal has been proved. See cases cited in note 8, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">While parties to a private collective bargaining agreement may choose to give an arbitrator a great deal of discretion and authority to determine what sanctions to impose for misconduct, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, does not, at least not as to dismissals based on the conduct specifically enumerated in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, third par. If the Legislature had intended to cede this authority to an arbitrator, it could readily have done so.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The principal, with the approval of the superintendent of schools, retains the sole statutory authority to determine whether to discharge, demote, or discipline teachers for the misconduct which the Legislature has specifically identified.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the absence of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>authority, the arbitrator exceeds his powers when he does so.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Because the arbitrator erroneously applied a further just cause analysis to misconduct that was both enumerated in the statute as a proper basis for discharge and proved by the district, and because he substituted his judgment for that of the district by imposing \u201csevere discipline, short of discharge,\u201d the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">5. <em>Best interests of the students. </em>General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par., requires that the arbitrator \u201cconsider the best interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance standards\u201d in determining whether the district has proved grounds for dismissal. This simply stated requirement is a direct reminder that the purpose of the Education Reform Act of 1993, from its billions of dollars in additional financial aid to local school systems, to its establishment of teacher performance standards, is to improve the education provided to the students in the classrooms of our public schools. It is also a reminder that the teacher dismissal statute is not only about the relationship between employer and employee, it is about the education of students. Their stake in the dismissal of inadequate teachers must now be specifically taken into account<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, accordingly, their best interests and the elevation of performance standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>are considerations that might properly influence the ultimate conclusion of the arbitrator in a particular case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In this case, after weighing Geller\u2019s misconduct against his more than twenty years of teaching service to ascertain whether dismissal was too severe a penalty (and apparently concluding that it was), the arbitrator simply recites in his decision that it is also \u201cin the best interest of the students that a teacher of Mr. Geller\u2019s accomplishments and experienced [szc] be retained.\u201d It is unclear how or whether this cursory conclusion regarding an important statutory consideration contributed to the arbitrator\u2019s ultimate determination that \u201c[t]he dismissal of James Geller was not for just cause within the meaning of Chapter 71, Section 42.\u201d Whether the statement was intended merely as confirmation that this required consideration had been made and was consistent with the outcome of the arbitrator\u2019s \u201cjust cause analysis,\u201d or whether it was an important factor in tipping the scales against dismissal, I cannot ascertain from the decision. I need not address this issue because, as set forth above, it is my conclusion that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by applying a further just cause analysis to the proven misconduct in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">For these reasons I concur in the decision to vacate the Superior Court judgment and would vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award as well.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The Education Reform Act of 1993, St. 1993, c. 71, made substantial changes to the governance structure and financing of the public school system in the Commonwealth. These changes were enacted to ensure: \u201c(1) that each public school classroom provided the conditions for all pupils to engage fully in learning as an inherently meaningful and enjoyable activity without threats to their sense of security or self-esteem, (2) a consistent commitment of resources sufficient to provide a high quality public education to every child, (3) a deliberate process for establishing and achieving specific educational performance goals for every child, and (4) an effective mechanism for monitoring progress toward those goals and for holding educators accountable for their achievement.\u201d G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 27. G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1A, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">To further these goals, statutory changes were made to the statute governing teacher demotions and dismissals, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. These changes included (1) transferring from school committees to school principals and superintendents the responsibility for dismissing teachers; (2) expanding the statutorily enumerated grounds for dismissal to include failure to satisfy teacher performance standards, and changing the catchall ground from other \u201cgood\u201d cause to other \u201cjust\u201d cause; (3) depoliticizing and streamlining the dismissal process by requiring that contested dismissals proceed directly to arbitration, where timelines for decisions and detailed statements of supporting reasons are mandated; (4) providing for limited rather than de novo review of dismissal decisions (as confirmed or not by arbitration) in the Superior Court; and (5) requiring arbitrators specifically to take into account the best interests of students and the need for the elevation of performance standards in determining whether a school district has met its burden of proving grounds for dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">I reach this conclusion based on our interpretation of the authority granted to the arbitrator by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, an issue raised by the parties, and a task necessary to deciding the meaning and application of the statute to the facts of this case. However, although I agree with the district that the arbitrator exceeded his powers, I do so for reasons different from those adopted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Appeals Court and argued by the district either here or in the courts below, but advanced and argued in the amicus briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The facts found by the arbitrator, as gleaned from the Appeals Court opinion, <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 291-292 (2000), are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">1. In November, 1995, Geller yelled at his students in the classroom, making them feel uncomfortable. A letter from a parent to the district resulted in a meeting, in the course of which Geller admitted to sometimes having an \u201coutburst\u201d and that he was working on \u201ccalming down.\u201d The assistant principal, who was present at the meeting, cautioned Geller that the issue was serious and that, if such conduct was taking place in the classroom, it should not be.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">2. Subsequently, in the course of one week in May, 1996, Geller was involved in three separate incidents in which he used physical force against three of his sixth grade students. The arbitrator found the witnesses\u2019 versions of the following events to be credible:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">a. On May 22, 1996, one student, whom we shall call J.S., got up in class to retrieve a pencil that had fallen on the floor. Geller, after yelling at the student, took him by the elbow and \u201cdirected\u201d him, very, very fast, out of the classroom and into the hallway. Once in the hall, Geller pushed or threw J.S. against a locker and then pushed J.S.\u2019s head, forcing him against the wall next to the lockers. Geller grabbed J.S. by the shirt (around the collar) and threw him against the locker. A school nurse testified that two days later she observed a bruise on J.S.\u2019s elbow, consistent with his being held in a forceful way.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">b. On May 23, 1996, another sixth grade student, whom we shall call J.F., was standing near a chair in the classroom when Geller ordered all students to be seated. J.F. did not sit immediately, and Geller approached him from the rear, poking J.F. in the back three times in rapid succession. When J.F. turned, Geller shoved him with both hands; the force was sufficient to knock J.F. off balance and he fell on top of a desk. Geller then grabbed J.F. by the hand and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>pulled Mm over to the teacher\u2019s desk. J.F. told his mother, who reported the incident to the principal. J.F. felt afraid of Geller as a result of the mcident and did not return to Geller\u2019s class for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">c. The third incident occurred on or about May 27, 1996. Another student, whom we shall call C.R., admitted humming, with a view to distracting Geller. Geller grabbed C.R. by the shoulders and pushed Mm hard against the door. Geller then opened the door, pushing C.R. into the hallway and up against a locker, wMle screammg and yelling at him. C.R. reported the incident to his mother, who notified the authorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\">General Laws c. <em>150C, </em>\u00a7 <em>11 (a), </em>provides in pertinent part that \u201cthe superior court shall vacate an award if. . . (3)the arbitrators exceeded their powers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The arbitrator describes the issue submitted to him for decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201cWas the dismissal of James Geller for just cause within the meaning of Chapter 71, Section 42?

There is no reason why the words \u201cor other just cause\u201d should be interpreted differently. It is reasonable, however, to conclude from the substitution of the word \u201cjust\u201d for \u201cgood\u201d that the Legislature intended to limit the broad range of conduct that had previously been considered as warranting dismissal in this catchall category, to serious misconduct.

As forcefully stated in a case decided prior to the Education Reform Act of 1993, \u201c[mjanifestly one of the most important duties involved in the management of a school system is the choosing and keeping of proper and competent teachers. The success of a school system depends largely on the character and ability of the teachers. Unless a school committee has authority to employ and discharge teachers it would be difficult to perform properly its duty of managing a school system.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Somerville, </em>307 Mass. 354, 362 (1940). While the Education Reform Act shifted personnel authority from the school committee to superintendents and principals, it did not alter the long-standing deference to managerial prerogative with respect to the assessment of teacher qualifications or the statutory power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>discharge teachers. See, e.g., <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council/Roxbury Community College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n/Mass. Community College Council, </em>423 Mass. 23, 31 n.8 (1996). Decisions concerning managerial rights in the public sector are qualitatively different from those in the private sector, not only because of the presence of statutes regulating and limiting the public employer, but also because of the necessity of safeguarding public control over and accountability for such decisions. Nothing in the Education Reform Act delegates to arbitrators the critically important public responsibility for deciding when and whether to dismiss teachers whose conduct constitutes one of the causes for discharge enumerated in \u00a7 42. The discretion to dismiss or impose some other remedy remains with the responsible public officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\">That the arbitrator believed he had the authority to fashion his own remedies as if he were the principal is most apparent in that portion of his decision where he reinstates Geller without back pay but directs that this is to be \u201ca final warning\u201d to Geller. The statute does not give the arbitrator any authority to discipline, discharge, or issue \u201cfinal warnings\u201d to teachers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\">That interest may not always be of significant consequence in a dismissal action. Theft or other gross misconduct outside of the classroom would justify dismissal based on other important principles, regardless of the teaching abilities of the teacher in question. But when a teacher is dismissed for conduct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the classroom, student interests are directly implicated and may well override typical employer-employee considerations. For example, it would not appear to be in the best interests of the students of a school district for a teacher to be retained who is no longer capable of effectively teaching or creating a positive learning environment \u2014 regardless of how many years of unblemished service he or she may have accumulated in the past, and no matter how such a period of prior service might be valued in a different employment context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">In such a case, we would expect the reasons for that conclusion to be set forth in detail in the \u201cdetailed statement of the reasons\u201d required by G.

With this concern in mind, this court fashioned a three-pronged test to limit significantly the scope of the public policy exception. See <em>BSI, supra </em>at 604-605. First, the public policy in question \u201cmust be well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained \u2018by reference to the laws and legal precedents and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>not from general considerations of supposed public interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>BSI, supra </em>at 604-605, quoting <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 387, </em>252 Conn, 467, 479 (2000) (Peters, J., concurring) (fact that egregious misconduct occurred while on job distinguishes it from cases of employee misconduct where courts upheld arbitral awards reducing sanctions against employees). Part of a teacher\u2019s responsibilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>include the maintenance of a safe environment that is conducive to their students\u2019 growth. Given that reality, common sense suggests that it is wholly inappropriate to place school children in daily contact with a teacher who has repeatedly inflicted physical abuse on his students. See <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 2663, supra </em>at 806; <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, supra </em>at 297 (reinstating teacher might jeopardize \u201cthe physical safety of members of the public\u201d).

Where the court must balance two competing policies, i.e., one favoring arbitration and one protecting our children, I do not hesitate to conclude that the latter outweighs the former.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Because of my view that the arbitrator exceeded his statutory authority in this case by reaching a conclusion that offended public policy, I do not find it necessary to reach the broader question of the arbitrator\u2019s authority to modify the sanction of dismissal discussed in Justice Cordy\u2019s concurring opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b259-6\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atj\">(dissenting, with whom Greaney and Spina, JJ., join).

Just as an arbitration award cannot \u201ctranscend the limits of the contract of which the agreement to arbitrate is but a part,\u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., supra, </em>quoting <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 28 (1980), an arbitration award cannot ignore the limits imposed by statute. Here, the relevant statute, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, provides that a teacher with professional teacher status \u201cshall not be dismissed except for inefficiency, incompetency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination or failure on the part of the teacher to satisfy teacher performance standards developed pursuant to [G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38] or other just cause.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, third par. \u201c[T]he school district shall have the burden of proof.\u201d G.

L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">I believe that the Legislature not only permits, but indeed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>expects, the arbitrator to review the discipline imposed by the school district even if the district has established grounds that might support a dismissal decision. If the Legislature intended an arbitrator to uphold a school district\u2019s decision to discharge a teacher whenever the teacher\u2019s conduct could potentially support such a decision, the Legislature could have simply provided that the school district has the burden of proving grounds for dismissal and that the arbitrator is to determine whether the school district has satisfied its burden of proof. That, however, is not what the statute provides. Instead, the Legislature required that \u201c[i]n determining whether the district has proven grounds for dismissal consistent with this section, the arbitrator shall consider the best interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance standards.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fifth par. By adopting this requirement, the Legislature, in my view, intended that the arbitrator review the dismissal decision in light of the circumstances surrounding the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Whether grounds for dismissal consistent with the statute exist is a question of fact. Considerations of the students\u2019 best interests and the need for elevating performance standards are primarily relevant in reviewing whether the decision to discharge a teacher was appropriate as measured against the conduct that occurred. It may be that, although a teacher engaged in misconduct in a particular instance, given the teacher\u2019s exemplary teaching record and no prior history of misconduct, it is in the best interests of the students that the teacher be retained. Accordingly, in order to give effect to the requirement that the arbitrator consider the students\u2019 best interests and the need for elevation of performance, standards, the statute must be interpreted as authorizing the arbitrator to determine both whether the grounds alleged by the school district have occurred and, if so, whether such grounds warrant dismissal. To conclude otherwise would render the express requirement that the arbitrator consider the students\u2019 best interests and the need for elevating performance standards marginal, if not meaningless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWe are bound to \u2018construe [a] statute to avoid any part of the legislation being meaningless or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>duplicative.\u2019 \u201d <em>American Honda Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Bernardi\u2019s, Inc., </em>432 Mass. 425, 435 (2000), quoting <em>Richard Lundgren, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 415 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Justice Cordy states in his opinion that \u201cwhen an agreement specifically enumerates grounds for dismissal, the arbitrator does not have the authority to judge whether discharge is an excessive penalty for the violation committed.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 232 (Cordy, J., concurring). The opinion concludes that the statute at issue in this case enumerates six grounds on which a teacher may be dismissed and therefore that, once the arbitrator determined that Geller had engaged in misconduct (i.e., inappropriately yelling at and touching students), the arbitrator was required to uphold the school district\u2019s dismissal decision. See <em>id. </em>at 233-234 (Cordy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The statute does indeed list grounds for dismissal, but it also contains specific language directing the arbitrator to review the penalty imposed even where misconduct is found. By connecting consideration of the students\u2019 best interests and elevation of performance standards to the determination whether the school district has proved grounds for dismissal, the statute authorizes an arbitrator to measure the conduct at issue against the discipline imposed and consider whether that discipline is consistent with the students\u2019 best interests and the need for elevating performance standards. As Justice Cordy\u2019s opinion acknowledges, an arbitrator does not exceed his or her authority by reviewing the dismissal decision, despite the fact that the grounds for dismissal are enumerated, where the statute, as here, contains express language empowering the arbitrator to do so. The interpretation of the statute in Justice Cordy\u2019s opinion overlooks this express language and narrowly focuses on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>fact that the statute lists - grounds for dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such an interpretation is contrary to the clear legislative intent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Further, the statute provides that if the arbitrator finds that \u201cdismissal was improper under the standards set forth in [G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42], the arbitrator may award back pay, benefits, reinstatement, and any other appropriate non-financial relief or any combination thereof.\u201d If an arbitrator were to find that dismissal was improper under the construction of the statute in Justice Cordy\u2019s opinion, then the arbitrator must have determined that the school district failed to prove any grounds that could support a dismissal decision (because, according to that opinion, the arbitrator can review only the grounds alleged by the district and not the discipline imposed at this point). The only remedy in such a situation would be full reinstatement with back pay. If the school district failed to prove the grounds that served as the basis for its dismissal decision, the arbitrator could not penalize the teacher in any way. But, because the statute permits an arbitrator to award reinstatement without back pay (thereby ordering an unpaid suspension), the statute must allow for situations where the arbitrator finds that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>are grounds that could support discharge under the statute but that dismissal is too severe a penalty when measured against the best interests of the students and the need for elevating performance standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Finally, my view of the statute as empowering the arbitrator to review the discipline imposed even where the teacher engaged in conduct that could constitute grounds for dismissal is substantiated by the legislative history. In an earlier draft of legislation to amend G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, Governor William Weld proposed that an arbitrator could overturn dismissal decisions only in five specific situations and that the arbitrator could not \u201csubstitute his standards or judgments for those of the [school] principal.\u201d 1992 House Doc. No. 5750, at 107. This proposal was not enacted. Rather, the legislation that passed delegated much more expansive powers to arbitrators. It requires the school district to prove that it had just cause for dismissal, while instructing the arbitrator to consider the students\u2019 best interests and the need for elevating performance standards, and permits the arbitrator to award reinstatement, back pay, benefits, or some combination thereof, when the decision to dismiss the teacher, in the arbitrator\u2019s judgment, was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Applying that history to this case, here, the arbitrator could well conclude that given the teacher\u2019s record, it was not in the students\u2019 best interests to terminate his employment. And the issue of elevation of performance standards is irrelevant because no one ever questioned his performance as a teacher.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">2. <em>Public policy. </em>Contrary to the concurring opinion of Justice Ireland, I do not believe that the arbitration award reinstating Geller violates public policy. <em>Ante </em>at 237 (Ireland, J., concurring in the result). Beginning with our decision in <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 16-19, and later reaffirmed in <em>BSI, supra </em>at 604-605, we have enumerated three prerequisites before a party can establish that an arbitration award reinstating a discharged employee violates public policy. First, any such public policy must be \u201cwell defined and dominant,\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>determined \u201cby reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.\u201d <em>BSI, supra, </em>quoting <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 16. Second, the conduct at issue cannot be disfavored in the abstract, but must be \u201cdisfavored conduct which is integral to the performance of employment duties.\u201d <em>BSI, supra </em>at 605, quoting <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 17. Third, there must be a \u201cshowing that the arbitrator\u2019s award reinstating the employee violates public policy to such an extent that the employee\u2019s conduct would have required dismissal.\u201d <em>BSI, supra, </em>citing <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 19. At a minimum, it is clear that the third prerequisite has not been met here, as there is no public policy that teachers\u2019 employment must be terminated for the conduct at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">My view that the arbitrator\u2019s award did not violate public policy is consistent with prior decisions of this court and those of the Supreme Court of the United States. In <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 13-14, for example, an employee of the Massachusetts Highway Department was fired after State police found a loaded handgun with an obliterated serial number in his tool box. An arbitrator ordered that the employee be reinstated. <em>Id. </em>at 14. The department argued that the award should be vacated because it violated the public policy against the unauthorized possession of handguns. <em>Id. </em>We disagreed. Although the department had a written policy against the presence of weapons on work premises, the policy did not require that the employee be discharged. <em>Id. </em>at 20. We stated that, while <em>the employee </em>may have violated criminal statutes and the policies that the statutes embody, <em>the award </em>reinstating him did not. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Thereafter, in <em>BSI, supra, </em>we applied the reasoning of the <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>case to uphold an arbitration decision reinstating two BSI employees who had used their access to Department of Revenue records to examine tax records of certain sport celebrities and BSI managers. We determined that, although there was a \u201cwell-defined and dominant\u201d public policy protecting confidential tax information and the employees\u2019 conduct in accessing confidential tax records was integral and directly related to the performance of their employment du<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ties, there was no public policy requiring that such employees be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 606 (employees \u201cviolated public policies embodied by statutes protecting confidential tax information,\u201d but \u201cthe collective bargaining contract did not require dismissal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Recently, in <em>Eastern Associated Coal Corp. </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers, Dist. 17, </em>531 U.S. 57, 62-63 (2000) (hereinafter <em>Eastern Associated Coal), </em>the Supreme Court of the United States addressed the issue whether public policy requires vacation of an arbitration award reinstating a discharged employee. The Court stated that the critical question is \u201cnot whether [the employee\u2019s conduct] itself violates public policy, but whether the agreement to reinstate him does so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Boston Med. Ctr. </em>v. <em>Service Employees Int\u2019l Union, Local 285, </em>260 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2001). The Court agreed \u201cin principle, that courts\u2019 authority to invoke the public policy exception is not limited solely to instances where the arbitration award itself violates\u201d laws or legal precedents. <em>Eastern Associated Coal, supra. </em>The Court emphasized, however, that \u201cthe public policy exception is narrow and must satisfy the principles set forth in <em>W.R. Grace </em>and <em>Misco.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Applying these principles to the case before it, the Court held that public policy considerations did not require the vacation of an arbitration award reinstating an employee truck driver who twice tested positive for drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 65-66. The Court concluded that there were several relevant policies as ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents but that the reinstatement award neither was contrary to public policy nor conflicted with any statute or regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65. Because \u201c[n]either Congress nor the Secretary [of Transportation] has seen fit to mandate the discharge of a worker who twice tests positive for drugs,\u201d the Court \u201chesitate[d] to infer a public policy in this area that goes beyond the careful and detailed scheme Congress and the Secretary have created.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">I believe that the reasoning of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Eastern Associated Coal </em>expresses the same policies and principles that we adopted in <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep \u2019t </em>and <em>BSI </em>and applies to the case before us today. It is undisputed that Geller\u2019s conduct of \u201cinappropriately touching] and yell[ing] at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>students\u201d was undesirable, to be discouraged, and worthy of a penalty. However, the question for this court is not whether Geller\u2019s behavior was wrong, but whether a \u201cwell-defined and dominant\u201d public policy requires his discharge. In my view, the answer to that question is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Arbitration awards have been vacated on public policy grounds only in the most exceptional cases or where there is clear legislative intent requiring dismissal. \u201c[E]xamples of arbitration results that so offend public policy that they should be set aside by a court are not readily to be found. This is not surprising. An arbitrator\u2019s result may be wrong; it may appear unsupported; it may appear poorly reasoned; it may appear foolish. Yet it may not be subject to court interference. The offending arbitrator\u2019s award which properly results in our setting it aside must be so offensive that one is to be seen only rarely.\u201d <em>BSI, supra </em>at 604 n.4, quoting <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>861 F.2d 665, 670 (11th Cir. 1988), cert, denied, 493 U.S, 871 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>426 Mass. 1, 3 (1997), for example, we upheld a police officer\u2019s discharge for smoking cigarettes because personnel administration rules and a State statute that prohibited the officer from smoking required her discharge: \u201cAny employee . . . who is found, after a hearing ... to have smoked any tobacco product . . . shall be terminated.\u201d This is an expression of public policy that cannot be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">There is no such expression in this case. No public policy requires that a teacher be fired in these circumstances. See <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 19 (\u201cIf an award is permissible, even if not optimal for the furtherance of public policy goals, it must be upheld\u201d). If the Legislature, which enacted a comprehensive statute, has not seen fit to mandate the dismissal of a teacher in this situation, then we should be extremely wary about inferring a public policy that goes beyond the legislative enactment. See <em>BSI, supra </em>at 604, quoting <em>E.I. DuPont de Ne-mours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Grasselli Employees Indep. Ass\u2019n of E. Chicago, </em>790 F.2d 611, 615 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 479 U.S. 853 (1986) (\u201cbecause the public policy \u2018doctrine allows courts to by-pass the normal heavy deference accorded to arbitration awards and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>potentially to \u201cjudicialize\u201d the arbitration process, the judiciary must be cautious about overruling an arbitration award on the ground that it conflicts with public policy\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We have consistently adhered to the principle that there is a strong'public policy favoring arbitration. See <em>BSI, supra </em>at 603, quoting <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 16; <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990). If this court is to continue applying that principle, it cannot simply espouse public policy as the ground for vacating arbitration decisions whenever it is unhappy with the arbitration result. We cannot purport to encourage arbitration and yet devise ways to undermine an arbitrator\u2019s authority. The public policy exception should be applied only in those cases where there is a legislative or regulatory requirement of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Defining public policy is inherently a legislative, and not a judicial, function. See, e.g., <em>Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>195 F.3d 1201, 1207 (10th Cir. 1999), cert, denied, 531 U.S. 1035 (2000) (\u201cdetermining public policy is a uniquely legislative endeavor, one not well suited to judicial resolution\u201d). The Legislature here provided guidelines for the arbitrator to decide whether teacher dismissal would be warranted, but chose not to specify the circumstances under which teacher dismissal would be required. I therefore cannot conclude that the award reinstating Geller offends any \u201cwell-defined and dominant\u201d public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">I would hold that there ar\u00e9 no statutory or public policy reasons for vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award in this case and would affirm the decision of the Superior Court judge upholding the award of reinstatement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\">I recognize that this language may have been included in part to restrict the occasions on which an arbitrator can overrule the school district on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>theory that the school district ordinarily is in a better position to know what is in the students\u2019 best interests and whether the objective of improving performance standards is being realized. On the other hand, the language used by the Legislature is general, and the most reasonable interpretation of it is that the arbitrator should be considering these criteria and then taking them into account in determining whether to agree with the school district or to overrule it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Justice Cordy\u2019s opinion recognizes that an arbitrator is required to \u201cconsider the best interests of the pupils in the district and the need for elevation of performance standards,\u201d but it offers no suggestion as to how an arbitrator is to fulfil such a requirement if he or she is limited to reviewing only whether grounds for dismissal exist. <em>Ante </em>at 235 (Cordy, J.' concurring). At one point, the opinion presumes that the students\u2019 best interests are relevant when they support a decision to discharge a teacher. <em>Ante </em>at 235 (Cordy, J., concurring) (students\u2019 \u201cstake in the dismissal of inadequate teachers must . . . be specifically taken into account\u201d). Then, when discussing the arbitrator\u2019s statement that it was in the students\u2019 best interests to retain Geller, the opinion concludes that it is not necessary to decide how to treat such a statement because the arbitrator exceeded his authority by making it. <em>Ante </em>at 236 (Cordy, J., concurring). In my view, an arbitrator can only satisfy the requirement that he or she consider the students\u2019 best interests and the need for elevating performance standards by determining when such considerations support a dismissal decision and when they call for a penalty, if any, that is less severe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In a footnote, Justice Cordy\u2019s opinion suggests that if the misconduct at issue is \u201cminor,\u201d although in theory falling under one of the enumerated grounds for dismissal, an arbitrator could modify a dismissal decision without exceeding the scope of his or her authority. See <em>ante </em>at 231 n.7 (Cordy, J., concurring). This is inconsistent with the opinion\u2019s conclusion that an arbitrator cannot review the penalty once he or she determines that the school district has established grounds that could support a dismissal decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">As the arbitrator here clearly considered the students\u2019 best interests and did not need to consider the elevation of performance standards, I do not address a case where the arbitrator refused to consider these interests and standards when such considerations were relevant to the dismissal decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
