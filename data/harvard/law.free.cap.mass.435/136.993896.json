(Victory), appeals from the decisions of a single justice of this court denying its two petitions under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. Victory sought orders from the single justice compelling the Ayer Division of the District Court Department (Ayer court) and the Marlborough Division of the District Court Department (Marlborough court) to \u201c[a]c-cept, process, hold show cause hearings and decide on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>merits\u201d its applications for criminal complaints.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Victory alleges that the Ayer court and the Marlborough court refused to accept its applications, a clerk-magistrate in each court received the applications for filing purposes and thus \u201caccepted\u201d them. See discussion, <em>infra. </em>Essentially, then, Victory sought orders compelling the Ayer court and the Marlborough court to hold show cause hearings and issue criminal complaints, should probable cause support such complaints. The single justice denied Victory\u2019s requests, concluding that Victory was not entitled to relief as the actions of the Ayer court and the Marlborough court did not violate a substantive right.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is available only in extraordinary circumstances. See <em>Montanino </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>425 Mass. 1025, 1026 (1997). A party seeking review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, must demonstrate that his or her substantive rights have been violated and that there is no other adequate or effective avenue of relief. See <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Knights, </em>427 Mass. 748, 749 (1998), quoting <em>McGuinness </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>420 Mass. 495, 497 (1995). We will not disturb an order of a single justice denying relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, unless there is an abuse of discretion or other error of law. See <em>Adoption of Iris, All </em>Mass. 582, 586 (1998), citing <em>Department of Mental Retardation </em>v. <em>Kendrew, </em>418 Mass. 50, 53 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Victory was entitled to file applications for the issuance of criminal complaints, which it did, and to have the divisions of the District Court act on those applications, which they did. Victory was not entitled to show cause hearings or to favorable court action on such applications. Accordingly, we affirm the decisions of the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">We summarize the facts from the undisputed documentary materials contained in the record. Victory, which owns and operates a chain of grocery stores, filed applications with the Ayer court and the Marlborough court at various times for criminal complaints against customers who had paid for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>groceries with \u201cbad\u201d checks. It alleged that these customers had committed larceny by check under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\"><em>The Ayer court. </em>Between April and August, 1999, Victory filed fifty applications for criminal complaints in the Ayer court. An assistant clerk-magistrate received the applications, and a hearing, on each application was scheduled for September 23, 1999. On that date, a Victory representative appeared before a District Court judge in the Ayer court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge said that he would not issue complaints on Victory\u2019s applications because the police, the district attorney\u2019s office, and the court lacked the resources necessary to pursue these matters. He stated that Victory was using the criminal justice system as a collection agency and that its recourse was the small claims session. On that same date, the assistant clerk-magistrate, authorized by the judge, noted on each of the fifty applications that no complaints would issue for the reasons given by the judge, and he referred Victory to the small claims department.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\"><em>The Marlborough court. </em>On September 10, 1999, Victory filed two applications for criminal complaints in the Marlborough court. A clerk-magistrate notified Victory in writing that she could not \u201caccept\u201d these two applications because the banks on which the checks were drawn were located outside the court\u2019s district.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The clerk-magistrate indicated that venue was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>proper only in the district in which the drawee bank is located. This interpretation was wrong as a matter of law. See <em>infra. </em>Although the clerk-magistrate termed her action a refusal to \u201caccept\u201d Victory\u2019s applications, she did receive, and thus \u201caccept,\u201d them for filing purposes. Her action effectively was a decision to deny the issuance of a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On September 22, 1999, Victory wrote a letter to a District Court judge in the Marlborough court informing the judge of the basis on which the clerk-magistrate had disposed of its applications and requesting that the judge \u201creview\u201d the applications. Victory did not request a hearing, and none was held. Cf. District Court Standards of Judicial Practice: The Complaint Procedures standard 3:21 (1975) (\u201cIf the clerk denies-an application and if the complainant manifests serious dissatisfaction, he should be told that he may request a new hearing before a judge of the court\u201d). But see commentary to standard 3:21 (\u201cA new hearing need not follow every denial of an Application. Indeed, the law does not specifically provide for a rehearing at all . . .\u201d). According to Victory, the District Court judge did not respond to its letter. We consider the judge\u2019s silence as a denial of Victory\u2019s request for review and an implicit affirmation of the clerk-magistrate\u2019s decision denying Victory\u2019s applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">One month later, Victory sent a letter to the Chief Justice for Administration and Management complaining about the applications it had filed in both the Ayer and Marlborough courts. An administrative attorney in that office responded that Victory was not a private person under Mass. R. Grim. P. 4 (b), 378 Mass. 849 (1979), and therefore was not authorized to file applications for the issuance of criminal complaints. See, in this regard, note 6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Victory then filed its petitions under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, requesting the single justice to order the Ayer court and the Marlborough court to \u201c[ajccept, process, hold show cause hearings and decide on the merits\u201d its applications for criminal complaints. The single justice denied the petitions. He held in each case that Victory was not entitled to relief \u201cbecause it is \u2018a private citizen ha[ving] no judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution of another.\u2019 <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Newton Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>416 Mass. 1006 (1993).\u201d The single justice also stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>that the Marlborough court clerk-magistrate\u2019s interpretation of the proper venue for the applications was \u201cunduly restrictive\u201d and that a \u201ccomplaint under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37, may be brought in the judicial district where the goods were received in exchange for the bad check.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Victory first contends that a private citizen<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has a substantive right to file an application for a criminal complaint and that the Ayer and Marlborough courts violated this right by refusing to accept its applications. A private citizen does have a right to file an application for a criminal complaint with respect to misdemeanors, but neither the Ayer court nor the Marlborough court violated this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">By enacting G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, the Legislature acknowledged that a private citizen can file an application for the issuance of a criminal complaint for a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Bradford </em>v. Knights, 427 Mass. 748, 751 (1998), citing G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A (\u201cthe Legislature has allowed private parties to seek criminal complaints in the case of misdemeanors\u201d). See also Mass. R. Grim. R 4 (b) (\u201cAn application for issuance of [criminal complaints] may be subscribed by ... a private person\u201d). The statute provides that \u201c[i]f a complaint for a misdemeanor is received,\u201d inter alia, by the District Court, the court shall notify the person against whom the complaint was made, give such person an opportunity to be heard, and \u201cmay upon consideration of the evidence cause [a complaint] to be issued.\u201d The provision \u201c[i]f a complaint for a misdemeanor is received\u201d assumes that a private citizen has the right to file an application for a criminal complaint for a misdemeanor. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A. We interpret statutes so as to avoid rendering any part of the legislation meaningless. See, e.g., <em>Volin </em>v. <em>Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>of Pub. Accountancy, </em>422 Mass. 175, 179 (1996), quoting <em>Ad-amowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 760 (1985). It follows that if a private citizen files an application for a criminal complaint, a clerk-magistrate cannot refuse to act on it. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Boston Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>432 Mass. 693, 695 (2000) (clerk-magistrate refused to grant or deny application for issuance of complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In the present cases, neither the Ayer nor the Marlborough court refused to act on Victory\u2019s applications. Clerk-magistrates in both courts received Victory\u2019s applications for filing purposes, notwithstanding the Marlborough court clerk-magistrate\u2019s statement to the contrary. The District Court judge in the Ayer court declined to issue criminal complaints due to lack of resources, and the clerk-magistrate in the Marlborough court disposed of the applications believing venue was improper. In sum, Victory had a right to file applications for the issuance of criminal complaints, which it did. It also had a right to court action on those applications, which it received. Victory therefore obtained all to which it was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Victory concedes, as it must, that a private citizen has no right to the issuance of a criminal complaint. Our prior decisions have held consistently that, if a judge or clerk-magistrate denies an application for a criminal complaint, a private party has no constitutional or statutory right to challenge that decision. See, e.g., <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Knights, supra; Tarabolski </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>419 Mass. 1001, 1001-1002 (1994); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Newton Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 1006; <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 961, 962 (1975). Nonetheless, Victory asserts that it has a right to a probable cause hearing on its applications before a judge or clerk-magistrate can deny such applications. The assertion is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">A private party\u2019s rights with respect to the criminal complaint process are limited to the filing of an application and court action on that application. Once a private party alerts the court of the alleged criminal activity through the filing of an application and the court responds to that application, the private party\u2019s rights have been satisfied. A probable cause hearing under G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>c. 218, \u00a7 35A, is held for the protection and benefit of the respondent named in the application, not for the benefit of the complainant. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A (if application for complaint is received, District Court shall give person <em>against whom complaint is made </em>opportunity to be heard in opposition to issuance of complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Further, a judge or clerk-magistrate can decline to issue a criminal complaint even in cases such as the present ones where probable cause may exist to support the issuance of complaints. See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37 (drawee bank\u2019s refusal to make payment of check prima facie evidence of larceny by check). General-Laws c. 218, \u00a7 35A, provides that the District Court, or an officer thereof, <em>\u201cmay </em>upon consideration of the evidence cause [a complaint] to be issued\u201d (emphasis added). Use of the word \u201cmay\u201d is recognition that circumstances will exist when, notwithstanding the existence of probable cause, a complaint should not issue and that, in such circumstances, a clerk-magistrate has discretion to refuse to issue complaints. See commentary to standard 3:08 of the District Court Standards of Judicial Practice: The Complaint Procedure (1975) (recognizing that complex factors beyond the determination of probable cause affect clerk-magistrates\u2019 decisions regarding applications for criminal complaints). As we recognized in <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Knights, supra </em>at 751, \u201c[t]he right of a citizen to obtain a criminal complaint is itself something of an anomaly\u201d: the Legislature may have provided private parties a right to file an application for a criminal complaint, but \u201cwe have uniformly held that the denial of [an application for] a complaint creates no judicially cognizable wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We recognize that our holding in this and prior decisions, that a private party suffers no judicially cognizable wrong when its application for a criminal complaint is denied, encompasses cases where an application is refused on the basis of an erroneous interpretation of the law, as was the situation in the Marlborough court. That possibility is implicit in the system of citizen complaints, and is consistent with the notion that the right to pursue a criminal prosecution belongs not to a private party but to the Commonwealth. See, e.g., <em>Tarabolski </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 1001-1002. A citizen complainant has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>substantive entitlements in this system, including no entitlement to a correct interpretation of the law, other than a right to court action on its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The discretion of judges and clerk-magistrates to decide whether to issue complaints is ancillary to the discretion of prosecuting authorities to decide whether to prosecute a particular case. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>428 Mass. 623, 629 (1999). If a judge or clerk-magistrate declines to issue a complaint, the private citizen may request the Attorney General or a district attorney to pursue the matter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Should one of these authorities decide to prosecute, neither a judge of the District Court nor a clerk-magistrate may bar the prosecution, as long as the complaint is legally valid. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quispe, </em>433 Mass. 508, 511-512 &amp; n.5 (2001).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Because Victory is not entitled to show cause hearings or to the issuance of criminal complaints, even though such complaints would be supported by probable cause, Victory cannot demonstrate a violation of any substantive right by the failure of the Ayer Division and the Marlborough Division of the District Court Department to hold probable cause hearings or to issue criminal complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\">A private citizen may file an \u201capplication for a criminal complaint.\u201d A judge or a clerk-magistrate then decides whether to issue the complaint. See, e.g., <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>Shufrin, </em>401 Mass. 593, 598 n.5 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\">According to an affidavit submitted by Victory\u2019s representative, forty of the fifty persons named in Victory\u2019s applications had not been notified of the hearing date. The representative stated that when he reviewed the applications on September 24, 1999, the copy of the application that is to be sent to the person named in it was still attached to the original application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Victory\u2019s affidavit states that it filed an additional fifty-five applications with the Ayer court between October, 1999, and May, 2000, and that, as of May 10, 2000, it had not received a response from the Ayer court. Victory has not indicated whether any action was taken on the applications since May 10, 2000. The number of applications at issue and the fact that these applications may still be pending does not alter our decision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Victory states in its brief (as it stated in its petition to the single justice) that the Marlborough court disposed of five earlier applications for the same reason, but copies of those five other applications were not included in the record. This does not affect our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The Attorney General, acting on behalf of the Ayer and Marlborough courts, does not contest this issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Victory argues that it is a private citizen. Both the single justice and the Attorney General have assumed that Victory is a private citizen for purposes of this appeal, and there is no- reason to conclude otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\">There is no contention in these cases that the applications did not involve misdemeanors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">A private citizen also may seek relief through civil process. See, e.g., <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Roxbury Dist, </em>372 Mass. 315, 317 (1977); <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>Victory argues that the fact that it can pursue a civil remedy \u201cis not grounds to deny Victory its day in court for the criminal conduct of people who defraud it by obtaining products by means of worthless checks.\u201d Victory overlooks the fact that no constitutional or statutory provision entitles it to \u201ca day\u201d in <em>criminal </em>court; it is only entitled to a day in <em>civil </em>court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The Attorney General or a district attorney may decide not to prosecute. Such decision rests in the executive branch. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Boston Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>432 Mass. 693, 700 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>428 Mass. 623, 629 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>410 Mass. 498, 500-501 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
