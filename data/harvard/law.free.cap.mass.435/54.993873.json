Instead of the discharge sought by the city for Thompson\u2019s alleged use of excessive force, the arbitrator determined that Thompson\u2019s only infraction amounted to conduct unbecoming an officer, for which the arbitrator imposed a two-week suspension without pay. The city sought review of the arbitrator\u2019s award in the Superior Court, where a judge vacated the award on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Thompson\u2019s reinstatement violated public policy. On appeal, the Appeals Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. <em>Lynn </em>v. Thompson, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 280 (2000). We granted Thompson\u2019s application for further appellate review. We now reverse, and order that judgment enter for the defendant affirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>On May 11, 1994, the city discharged Thompson based on three charges stemming from an involuntary commitment of a patient on September 15, 1993. Those charges were (1) use of more physical force than was necessary in the application of handcuffs, resulting in injury to the person being handcuffed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; (2) failure to cooperate with the investigation of the incident<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and (3) conduct unbecoming an officer in connection with both the incident and the investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties submitted to arbitration the following issues: \u201cWas there just cause for the discharge of the grievant, Terrance Thompson? If not, what shall the remedy be?\u201d After six days of hearings, the arbitrator concluded that only the third charge (conduct unbecoming an officer) had been proved, and that the appropriate discipline for that infraction was a two-week suspension. The arbitrator\u2019s conclusion was based on the following factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Thompson was employed as a police officer with the city for nineteen years. A series of seven civilian complaints had been filed against him back in 1984. On one of those complaints, the police department \u201cexonerated\u201d Thompson of any wrongdoing; on five others, the department determined that the complaints were \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d; and on the remaining complaint, the department determined that the complaint was \u201cpart-substantiated,\u201d but imposed no discipline on Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Thompson was later named as a defendant in a civil rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>action for injuries sustained by a civilian when Thompson used excessive force in applying handcuffs. In 1992, after jury trial, a judgment was entered against the city in the amount of $100,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The city imposed a disciplinary suspension on Thompson based on this incident, but that suspension was reversed by an arbitrator.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>On September 15, 1993, Thompson was dispatched to the apartment of a woman (whom we shall refer to as \u201cE.R.\u201d) following reports that E.R. had been threatening various family members. Thompson was accompanied by Officer Steven Anderson, and later joined by Sergeant John Karuzis. At the scene, Sergeant Karuzis determined that E.R. should be transported to a psychiatric hospital on an involuntary commitment. An ambulance was summoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, E.R. was sitting in a chair in the living room, smoking a cigarette. The family members whom she had been threatening had left the apartment, and she was no longer an imminent threat to them. However, the arbitrator found that E.R. was not \u201cunder control.\u201d E.R. told the officers that she would not go to the hospital, and threatened that she would not go \u201cwithout a fight.\u201d At one point, E.R. grabbed a set of keys and a cigarette lighter from a nearby table. Thompson, of the view that these items were potential weapons, grabbed E.R.\u2019s left arm and tried to pry her fingers open to remove the lighter. Meanwhile, Anderson took hold of E.R.\u2019s right arm, and E.R. dropped the keys out of her right hand. Sergeant Karuzis ordered Anderson and Thompson to place E.R. in handcuffs.* *<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Anderson began placing a cuff on E.R.\u2019s right arm, while Thompson was grappling with E.R.\u2019s left arm and hand to remove the lighter. The arbitrator credited the officers\u2019 testimony that E.R. was thrashing about in the chair while they held her by the arms. Although he also credited E.R.\u2019s testimony that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>told Thompson he was hurting her,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> he credited the testimony of Thompson and Anderson that they did not hear any such statement. The arbitrator\u2019s assessment was that, in the \u201cchaotic state of affairs,\u201d with the officers\u2019 \u201cfocus on controlling [E.R.\u2019s] hands\u201d and Thompson \u201cconcentrating on removing the objects from her hands,\u201d Thompson did not hear E.R.\u2019s warning to the effect that he was hurting her arm. In the course of this struggle, while Thompson had a hold of EJR.\u2019s left arm, E.R.\u2019s left arm broke.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Thompson introduced expert testimony from an orthopedic surgeon to the effect that E.R.\u2019s medical condition (in particular, her medications) would likely cause \u201cdeterioration of a person\u2019s bone structure\u201d and \u201closs of bone mass,\u201d affect her \u201cfracture threshold,\u201d and make her bones \u201cmore susceptible to fractures.\u201d The arbitrator credited this testimony, noting that it \u201ccast serious doubt\u201d on the city\u2019s assertion that E.R.\u2019s arm had broken from the application of excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The arbitrator concluded that the evidence did not support the charge of excessive force, and indeed that Thompson had been \u201cexonerated of the charge of excessive force.\u201d He rejected the city\u2019s assertion that Thompson had \u201clost his self control,\u201d \u201cintended to harm [E.R.],\u201d or retaliated against her for her \u201cverbal outbursts towards the police.\u201d Rather, he concluded that Thompson\u2019s \u201cactions were solely motivated to take the items away from [E.R.\u2019s] hand,\u201d and that Thompson had not used excessive force in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The arbitrator also addressed the city\u2019s concern that the continued employment of Thompson exposed the city to liability for civil rights violations. He noted that \u201c[t]here may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>a certain point where an employer decides that because an employee is often the defendant in civil rights actions and continuously places the City and Department in [szc] risk of civil right [szc] judgments, that the employer has the right to discharge an employee.\u201d However, he concluded that Thompson did not have such a record. The civilian complaints from 1984 had not been substantiated, and, while the 1992 civil rights action had caused monetary loss to the city, the arbitrator noted that the prior arbitration had found that Thompson\u2019s suspension for that earlier incident had been \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Thus, Thompson\u2019s official personnel record reflected no prior discipline, and the arbitrator concluded that Thompson had a nineteen-year unblemished career. As such, in the arbitrator\u2019s view, there was no \u201cpattern of callous rogue behavior\u201d that would justify Thompson\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The arbitrator also rejected the charge that Thompson had failed to cooperate in the investigation of this incident. Characterizing Thompson\u2019s postincident report as \u201cbrief\u201d and containing \u201cgrammatical errors,\u201d he found nothing untruthful in the report and noted that Thompson had never been asked to provide any \u201csupplemental report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The arbitrator did conclude that the charge of conduct unbecoming an officer had been proved, as Thompson\u2019s \u201chandling of this mentally unstable woman was lacking in sensitivity.\u201d However, in the arbitrator\u2019s view, \u201c[ljack of sensitivity\u201d on a single occasion was \u201cnot a dischargeable offense.\u201d Beyond that reference to \u201clack of sensitivity,\u201d the arbitrator did not identify any other conduct by Thompson that amounted to \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer,\u201d nor did he identify with any further precision what acts or statements of Thompson he considered \u201clacking in sensitivity.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For that conduct unbecoming an officer, the arbitrator imposed a two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>week disciplinary suspension and ordered Thompson reinstated with back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">2. <em>Events subsequent to the arbitration. </em>The city filed an action in the Superior Court seeking to set aside the arbitrator\u2019s award. In its complaint, the city alleged that a Federal civil rights action had been filed against Thompson stemming from the incident involving E.R., and that that matter was still pending. The city later amended its complaint to state that, on or about January 16, 1997, the city had settled the civil rights suit for the amount of $350,000, which amount was to be paid entirely by the city. The amended complaint annexed a copy of the settlement agreement, which reflects that the named defendants in the action included Thompson, Anderson, Karuzis, and the city. In exchange for the payment of $350,000, E.R. and her husband agreed to release their claims against all defendants. The settlement agreement recites that \u201c[a]ll parties agree that this is a compromise of disputed claims and that settlement of these claims does not constitute an admission of liability by any party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The city and Thompson filed cross motions for summary judgment with respect to the enforceability of the award reinstating Thompson. A judge in the Superior Court allowed the city\u2019s motion and vacated the arbitration award on the ground that it violated public policy. The judge\u2019s analysis was as follows: \u201c[T]he arbitrator made a finding of conduct unbecoming an officer, the conduct occurred in the course of the officer\u2019s employment duties, and the conduct posed a special risk to the public. The court must therefore respect the City of Lynn\u2019s public safety concerns regarding reinstatement of an officer who has broken the arms of two citizens while attempting to handcuff them,<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark> and whose conduct has resulted in two 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against the City, one resulting in a judgment against the City and one still pending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">On Thompson\u2019s appeal, the Appeals Court agreed that the arbitrator\u2019s award violated public policy and therefore affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. <em>Lynn </em>v. Thompson, 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 280 (2000). Framing the issue as \u201cwhether the arbitrator in this case has acted against public policy in reinstating an officer who has twice broken the arms of citizens with whom he was dealing in the performance of his duties,<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark> the last incident characterized as \u2018conduct unbecoming an officer,\u2019 and whose actions resulted in claims against him and his employer in Federal court for violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 286, the Appeals Court concluded that Thompson\u2019s reinstatement violated public policy. The arbitrator\u2019s decision \u201cpermits the continued presence on the police force of someone whose past and current conduct permits a strong inference that members of the public will be placed at risk of serious physical harm by an individual whose conduct is unbecoming an officer. The city should not be compelled to reinstate an individual who has, in the rather routine situation of this case, failed to exercise restraint and judgment in determining appropriate conduct for a police officer and where his conduct has resulted in serious injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288. \u201c[T]wo incidents of like nature, resulting in serious injury to members of the public, suffice to show that Thompson\u2019s continuing as a police officer poses a special risk of violent injury to the public and that the city-employer has been, and will continue to be, made \u2018an accessory to the wrongdoing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288-289, quoting <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>861 F.2d 665, 671 (11th Cir. 1988), cert, denied, 493 U.S. 871 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Unlike our \u201creview of factual findings and legal rulings made by a trial judge, we are strictly bound by an arbitrator\u2019s findings and legal conclusions, even if they appear erroneous, inconsistent, or unsupported by the record at the arbitration hearing. \u201cA matter submitted to arbitration is subject to a very narrow scope of review. Absent fraud, errors of law or fact are not sufficient grounds to set aside an award.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v.

Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp.

Yet, it may not be subject to court interference.\u201d <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, supra </em>at 670.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We are thus bound by the arbitrator\u2019s findings and conclusions in this case, no matter the extent to which we may believe that they are \u201cgrossly erroneous.\u201d <em>Trustees of Boston &amp; Me. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., supra. </em>Those findings include the express determination that Thompson did <em>not </em>use excessive or unnecessary force in restraining E.R. Rightly or wrongly, the arbitrator found that Thompson was justified in using force to extract the cigarette lighter from E.R.\u2019s hand, that he did not apply an excessive amount of force when he held up her arm and pried open her fingers, and that it was E.R.\u2019s exceptionally fragile bones and her own \u201cthrashing about\u201d that caused her injury. The arbitrator concluded that Thompson had been \u201cexonerated\u201d of the charge of excessive or unnecessary force, and we must accept that conclusion for purposes of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The city seeks to set aside this arbitration award on the ground that it violates public policy. See <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. Safety, </em>430 Mass. 601, 603-605 (2000); <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council 93, </em>420 Mass. 13, 16-19 (1995). To meet the criteria for application of the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>policy exception, the public policy in question \u201cmust be well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained \u2018by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council 93, supra </em>at 16, quoting <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union 759, Int\u2019l Union of United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983). \u201cThe public policy exception does not address \u2018disfavored conduct, in the abstract, but [only] disfavored conduct which is <em>integral to the performance of employment duties\u2019 \u201d </em>(emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 17, quoting <em>Delta Air Lines Inc. </em>v. <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, supra </em>at 671. \u201cFinally, we require[] a showing that the arbitrator\u2019s award reinstating the employee violates public policy to such an extent that the employee\u2019s conduct would have required dismissal.\u201d <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. Safety, supra </em>at 605, citing <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council 93, supra </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The Superior Court judge and the Appeals Court held that the reinstatement of Thompson would violate public policy, and that the arbitration award could therefore be set aside under the standards announced in <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council 93, supra. </em>However, they did so only by the expedient of ignoring the arbitrator\u2019s finding that Thompson had not used excessive or unnecessary force. They treated the arbitrator\u2019s holding that Thompson had engaged in \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer\u201d as a euphemism for the officer\u2019s having used excessive force and broken E.R.\u2019s arm. Thus, they concluded that it would violate public policy to reinstate an officer whose unbecoming conduct posed a risk of physical injury to the public. <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra </em>at 288. While the arbitrator was vague as to precisely what conduct of Thompson was \u201clacking in sensitivity\u201d and therefore was \u201cunbecoming an officer,\u201d that finding of \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer\u201d cannot be treated as equivalent to a finding of excessive force. Such an interpretation of the arbitrator\u2019s decision would be expressly contrary to his repeated, explicit findings that the charge of excessive or unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>force had not been proved and that Thompson had been \u201cexonerated\u201d of that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">By reference to Thompson\u2019s status as a defendant in two civil rights actions, including one emanating from this same incident, the Superior Court judge and the Appeals Court also assumed that Thompson\u2019s unbecoming conduct constituted a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Again, however, this is precisely what the arbitrator decided had <em>not </em>been proved. In concluding that Thompson had not exerted unnecessary or excessive force, and that E.R.\u2019s arm had broken while Thompson was exerting only a lawful and permissible degree of force, the arbitrator did not find any conduct on Thompson\u2019s part that would amount to a violation of E.R.\u2019s civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">One may well take issue with the arbitrator\u2019s analysis. The conclusion that an officer, whose record includes a civil rights judgment against himself and the city for excessive force (including an award of $30,000 in punitive damages), nevertheless has an unblemished record because another arbitrator determined that Thompson should not be disciplined for that incident, appears notably unsound. Similarly, the conclusion that force sufficient to break a person\u2019s arm, even the arm of a person with fragile bones, is not \u201cexcessive\u201d when the person does not even pose a current danger to the officers is a conclusion that seems indefensible. Finally, common sense would dictate that the city would not voluntarily pay E.R. $350,000 to settle her civil rights claim unless there were significant evidence supporting that claim. Yet, we are not free to ignore the arbitrator\u2019s conclusions merely because they appear unsound, poorly reasoned, or otherwise flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Accepting the arbitrator\u2019s conclusions, as we must, we are confronted with an officer who made insensitive remarks to a mentally unstable and, ultimately, seriously injured woman. Insensitive remarks, however offensive they may be, do not cause physical injury. From the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that there was merely \u201cinsensitive\u201d conduct that was unbecoming an officer, one cannot conclude that Thompson poses an ongoing risk of physical injury to members of the public. It may be distasteful to keep such an officer on the force, but it does not violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Effectively, the Superior Court judge and the Appeals Court held that it violated public policy to continue the employment of a police officer who had twice injured citizens by the excessive use of force, finding as a source of that public policy 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1994), and the city\u2019s own regulations against the use of \u201c [unnecessary\u201d physical force. We need not parse the application of the public policy exception to such a scenario, because it is a factual scenario that the arbitrator expressly determined had not been proved. There being no basis on which to set aside that express determination, there is no basis for invoking the public policy exception, and thus no basis on which we may set aside this particular arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and order that judgment be entered in favor of the defendant affirming the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The rules of the police department prohibit \u201c[t]he use of more physical force than that which is necessary to accomplish a proper police purpose.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Department rules require that an officer \u201ctruthfully state the facts in all reports as well as when he appears before any judicial, departmental or other official investigation\u201d and \u201ccooperate fully in all phases of such investigations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Department rules prohibit \u201c[a]ny specific type of conduct which reflects discredit upon the member as a police officer, or upon his fellow officers, or upon the police department he serves.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The city\u2019s brief explains that the original jury award was in the amount of $100,000, but the judgment was later amended. The amended judgment reflects the jury\u2019s findings that Thompson had used excessive force; that the city had a \u201cpractice, policy or custom of failing to take adequate steps to discipline, supervise and train Terrance Thompson,\u201d which caused the violation of the plaintiff\u2019s civil rights; and that the city was negligent. Compensatory damages were awarded in the amount of $28,700, plus punitive damages against Thompson in the amount of $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The city\u2019s brief states (in multiple places) that this earlier incident of excessive force also resulted in a broken arm, but the city provides no citation to anything in the record below that identifies the nature of that plaintiff\u2019s injuries. We have searched the entire record presented to us, and find in it no basis on which to draw any conclusion regarding the nature or the extent of the injuries sustained as a result of the prior incident. For reasons that are unclear, the Superior Court judge\u2019s memorandum of decision refers to the earlier incident as resulting in a broken arm, and the Appeals Court\u2019s decision adopted that same reference. <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 280, 281-282, 286, 288 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The requirement that a party provide \u201can appropriate and accurate record reference\u201d for each and every fact set forth in the brief (Mass. R. A. P. 16 [e], as amended, 378 Mass. 940 [1979]) is not an idle technical requirement. Among other things, it prevents parties from exaggerating or distorting the facts as presented below, or from inserting into the analysis on appeal facts that are simply nonexistent. We have, in an abundance of caution, checked the records of the Federal court relating to the earlier civil rights action. Albert Howard vs. Terrance Thompson, Civil Action No. 90-11213-H (D. Mass., May 20, 1992). The plaintiff in that case did not sustain a \u201cbroken arm\" or even allege that he had suffered a \u201cbroken arm.\u201d Rather, he claimed that, at the time Thompson placed him in handcuffs, he was recovering from recent surgery to his shoulder; that he so advised Thompson; that Thompson nevertheless cuffed his hands behind his back, thereby causing some reinjury to that shoulder; and that he therefore did not heal fully and properly from the earlier shoulder surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The city\u2019s assertion that the earlier civil rights action resulted in a verdict against it stemming from Thompson\u2019s use of excessive force is supported by the record. Its assertion that that excessive force caused a broken arm is not supported by the record and is, according to the records from that case, an assertion that could not have been supported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\">There was no written decision by that arbitrator, and the city did not seek further review of that arbitration award. The arbitrator who ruled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Thompson\u2019s favor on that matter was not the same arbitrator who issued the decision presently under review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Although the arbitrator concluded that the officers were not in any danger from E.R. at the time, he credited Thompson, Anderson, and Karuzis that they had a legitimate reason for wanting to dispossess her of the keys and cigarette lighter prior to the arrival of the ambulance. The city contended that Thompson had no need to approach E.R. at all, but the arbitrator noted that Sergeant Karuzis, the ranking officer at the scene, had ordered that E.R. be handcuffed and had endorsed Thompson\u2019s assessment that the objects should be removed from E.R.\u2019s hands. As such, the arbitrator concluded that Thompson had not unjustifiably \u201cinflamed the situation\u201d by approaching E.R. to remove the items.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\">E.R.\u2019s husband, who was present in the room at the time, testified that he heard E.R. make such a statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\">E.R. claimed that her arm broke while Thompson had her arm held up, bent backward, in the process of trying to open her fist. Thompson claimed that he had succeeded in prying E.R.\u2019s fingers open (at which point E.R. dropped the lighter) and was bringing her arm down to her side when the arm broke. The arbitrator did not resolve this dispute as to exactly how or when E.R.\u2019s arm broke. He did conclude that the fracture occurred as part of Thompson\u2019s maneuvers connected with the removal of the items from E.R.\u2019s hands, not as part of any attempt to handcuff her. It was Anderson, not Thompson, who was in the process of placing a cuff on E.R.\u2019s right wrist when E.R.\u2019s left arm broke.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">At the hearing before the arbitrator, E.R. testified that, while waiting for the ambulance to arrive, Thompson was smoking and was letting the ashes fall on the floor. E.R. told Thompson not to smoke if he could not keep the ashes off her floor, to which Thompson replied, \u201c[W]hy not[?] [Y]ou are.\u201d She also testified that, after her arm broke, Thompson refused to give his name. E.R. and her husband testified that, when E.R. then told Thompson that she was going to sue him, he responded, \u201c[S]o what[.] I am already being sued.\u201d These remarks, which displayed callous indifference to a mentally ill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>woman whom Thompson had seriously injured, would certainly qualify as \u201clacking in sensitivity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[10]\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\">10But see note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[11]\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\">11But see note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\">There is no allegation of fraud in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The city asks that we deviate from this long-standing precedent and adopt a scope of review akin to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, when reviewing an arbitration award involving public sector employment. To date, our extremely deferential review of arbitration awards has not been limited to the private sector. See, e.g., <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. Safety, </em>430 Mass. 601, 603 (2000); <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council 93, </em>420 Mass. 13, 15 (1995); <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990); <em>School Comm. of Waltham </em>v. <em>Waltham Educators Ass\u2019n, </em>398 Mass. 703, 705 (1986). The Legislature has identified the extremely limited grounds on which courts may vacate or modify arbitration awards, and it has not, in those statutory provisions, drawn any distinction between public and private sector arbitration. G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12. We reject the suggestion that we should enlarge the scope of our review of arbitration decisions in cases involving public entities or public employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b85-7\">Ireland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM\">(concurring). If the facts of the case were those reported by both the Superior Court and the Appeals Court, <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 280, 280-284, 286-288 (2000), I would reach the same conclusion for the same reasons. To my way of thinking, an arbitrator\u2019s award reinstating a police officer in the face of conclusive evidence that the officer inflicted excessive force on multiple occasions, would violate public policy. However, given that the evidence before us does not support such findings, see <em>ante </em>at 63-65,1 concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
