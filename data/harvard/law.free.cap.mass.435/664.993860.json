L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, to Drywall Systems, Inc. (Drywall), in a dispute that arose out of several construction subcontracts between Drywall and ZVI Construction Co., Inc. (ZVI). Drywall brought an action under G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 11, to enforce the arbitration award. On cross motions for summary judgment a Superior Court judge ordered judgment for Drywall on the award of damages under the contracts, but concluded that the statute did not authorize arbitrators to award multiple damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Both parties appealed. The Appeals Court held that the statute authorized an arbitration award of multiple damages, but not an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr. Co., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 353 (2001). We granted ZVI\u2019s application for further appellate review. We hold that multiple damages and attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded in arbitration of claims under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The following facts are undisputed. ZVI was the general contractor for construction projects at various Media Play retail stores. Drywall, as a subcontractor, agreed to perform certain work under five separate contracts at stores in Massachusetts, Ohio, and New York. Each contract contained a standard arbitration provision requiring the parties to submit to arbitration \u201c[a]ny controversy or claim . . . arising out of or related to this [subcontract.\u201d The general conditions in each contract likewise provided that \u201c[a]ny controversy or [cjlaim arising out of or related to the [cjontract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Disputes arose between the parties and on January 4, 1995, Drywall demanded arbitration, seeking unpaid balances due under the contracts, together with delay and business liquidation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>damages. Drywall also sought \u201ctreble damages and legal fees for violation of [G. L.] c. 93A.\u201d During the course of arbitration, ZVI filed a counterclaim alleging breach of contract, fraud, misrepresentation, violations of G. L. c. 93A, and damages of $57,250, plus treble damages, interest, legal fees, arbitration fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The arbitration panel awarded Drywall $447,365 under the five contracts, and found against ZVI on its counterclaim. They also found that ZVI engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11, \u201cprimarily and substantially within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\u201d and that ZVI\u2019s conduct was wilful or knowing. The panel awarded Drywall treble damages, plus $146,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">2. <em>Arbitration of multiple damage claims under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. </em>ZVI argues that (1) the parties never agreed to arbitrate G. L. c. 93A claims or multiple damages; (2) multiple damage awards in arbitration are expressly prohibited by G. L. c. 93A; and (3) public policy dictates that arbitrators may not award multiple or punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">(a) ZVI\u2019s contention that \u201cnone of the . . . contracts specifically expresses or references an agreement to submit [G. L.] c. 93A claims or claims for multiple damages or fees to arbitration,\u201d is unpersuasive. The parties agreed to submit to arbitration \u201c[a]ny controversy or claim\u201d arising out of or relative to the subcontracts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the agreement placed no limits on arbitrable claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">\u201c[W]here the contract contains an arbitration clause, there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that \u2018[a]n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage .... Such a presumption is particularly applicable where the clause is . . . broad.\u2019 \u201d <em>Local No. 1710, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Fire Fighters </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number><em>Chicopee, </em>430 Mass. 417, 421 (1999), quoting <em>AT&amp;T Techs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Communications Workers, </em>475 U.S. 643, 649 (1986). A broad arbitration clause, such as the one seen here, includes statutory claims under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. See <em>Greenleaf Eng\u2019g &amp; Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Teradyne, Inc., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 574-576 (1983). See also <em>Mugnano-Bornstein </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 347, 352 (1997) (broad agreement to arbitrate \u201cany controversy arising out of or in connection with . . . employment or termination of employment\u201d included statutory claim under G. L. c. 151B).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Inherent in the parties\u2019 agreement to submit statutory claims to arbitration was their acquiescence in any remedies available under G. L. c. 93 A, \u00a7 11. See <em>Greenleaf Eng\u2019 g &amp; Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Teradyne, Inc., supra </em>at 576 (broad form arbitration agreement includes claims of wilful or knowing violations under G. L. c. 93A). See also <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Automated Business Sys., Inc., </em>882 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1989) (agreement providing \u201call disputes\u201d arising from contract \u201cshall be settled\u201d through arbitration included award of punitive damages). Given the breadth of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate and the absence of any language that might be construed as a limitation on awards of'punitive damages, we conclude that the agreement encompassed an award of multiple damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">(b) ZVI next argues that, even if the parties\u2019 agreement encompassed G. L. c. 93A claims and multiple damages, because an arbitrator\u2019s award is not a \u201cjudgment\u201d under \u00a7 11, it cannot be the subject of multiplication for a wilful or knowing violation of the statute. Prior to 1989, multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A were limited to multiples of damages that were foreseeable and directly caused by an unfair or deceptive act or practice, i.e., loss of use damages. See <em>Bertassi </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>402 Mass. 366, 372 (1988); <em>Yeagle </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 654-655 (1997); <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 938, 939-940 (1986). In 1989, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, fifth par., to provide that the \u201cactual damages to be multiplied by the court shall be the amount of <em>the judgment </em>on all claims arising out of the same and underlying transaction or occurrence\u201d (emphasis added). St. 1989, c. 580, \u00a7 2, approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>December 5, 1989.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By expanding recovery of punitive damages to a multiple of all damages caused by the unfair or deceptive act or practice, the amendment effectively overruled the judicial limitation on multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A. See <em>R.W. Granger &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>J &amp; S Insulation, Inc., </em>435 Mass. 66, 80 (2001); <em>Yeagle </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., supra </em>at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The motion judge interpreted our decisions in <em>Bonofiglio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>411 Mass. 31, 37 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 612 (1992), and <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. 413, 425 (1997), as prohibiting application of the multiplying provision of G. L. c. 93 A, \u00a7 11, to an arbitration award because the award is not a \u201cjudgment\u201d within the meaning of the 1989 amendment. In <em>Bonofiglio, </em>an insured received an arbitration award against its insurer, which the insurer promptly paid. The insured then brought suit against the insurer, alleging unfair practices under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), and G. L. c. 93A, and requesting interest on the arbitration award as damages, plus multiple damages and attorney\u2019s fees. A jury returned a special verdict for the insured and doubled the amount based on the insurer\u2019s bad faith. The insured thereafter moved to double the arbitrator\u2019s award. The judge denied the motion, and we affirmed. Because the underlying contract damages had been determined in an unrelated arbitration proceeding, we held that they were not part of the \u201cjudgment\u201d in the G. L. c. 93A action and therefore were not \u201csubject to the multiplying provision of [G. L.] c. 93A.\u201d <em>Bono-figlio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., supra </em>at 38. Similarly, in <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra, </em>we rejected inclusion of a settled claim against an insured as a component of damages in the companion G. L. c. 93A claim against its insurer. Relying on <em>Bonofiglio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., supra, </em>we held that, \u201c[wjhen a case has been settled outside the courtroom, there is no \u2018judgment\u2019 on which to base the multiple damage calculus.\u201d <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra </em>at 424. The central holding in each case was that, where multiple damages are sought under G. L. c. 93A based on \u201cclaims arising out of the same and underlying transaction,\u201d those claims must be determined in the same proceeding with the multiple damages claims. Neither case construed the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u201cjudgment\u201d in the 1989 amendments as prohibiting an arbitral award of multiple damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The 1989 amendment to \u00a7 11, as discussed <em>infra, </em>expanded the base on which multiple damages may be awarded. There is nothing in the amendment suggesting any limitation on the existing right of commercial parties to arbitrate \u00a7 11 claims. See <em>Canal Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>406 Mass. 369, 378-379 (1990); <em>Greenleaf Eng\u2019g &amp; Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Tera-dyne, Inc., supra </em>at 576. Section 11 contains repeated references to the commencement of an action in \u201ccourt,\u201d and the findings required by the \u201ccourt\u201d before various levels of damages may be awarded. Clearly, an arbitrator is not a \u201ccourt,\u201d just as an arbitrator\u2019s award is not a \u201cjudgment,\u201d but we have never said that a claim under \u00a7 11 may not be arbitrated because an arbitrator is not a \u201ccourt.\u201d The use of the word \u201cjudgment\u201d in \u00a7 11 is merely contextual, referring to all damages that, in the aggregate, may be multiplied by a court for a wilful or knowing violation of \u00a7 11. The term does not preclude an arbitrator from imposing multiple damages any more than the term \u201ccourt\u201d precludes an arbitrator from considering a claim under \u00a7 11. An arbitrator\u2019s award of damages is the counterpart of a court\u2019s judgment for purposes of calculating multiple damages under \u00a7 11, and there is nothing in the 1989 amendment to suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Neither G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, nor G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 10, prohibits an arbitral award of multiple damages. \u201cAbsent contrary statutory direction, the strong public policy in favor of arbitration of commercial disputes should be given effect.\u201d <em>Minton Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass. 879, 880 (1986). In addition, absent a statutory prohibition, an arbitrator generally has the same powers as a court to award multiple damages. Cf. <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 626-627 (1985) (arbitrator may award punitive damages under Sherman Act). We conclude that G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, does not prohibit an arbitrator from awarding multiple damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">(c) ZVI\u2019s final argument on the issue of arbitral authority to award multiple damages is that it violates public policy. ZVI first contends that public policy disfavors punitive damages. There is no merit to this contention. Although \u201c[pjunitive dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ages are not allowed in this Commonwealth unless expressly authorized by statute,\u201d <em>Flesner </em>v. <em>Technical Communications Corp., </em>410 Mass. 805, 813 (1991), G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, expressly authorizes punitive damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">ZVI also contends that arbitration awards of multiple damages violate public policy because they constitute punitive damages that are valid only if imposed by a court, in a public forum, to vindicate the public interest. ZVI cites no Massachusetts authority in support of its argument, and relies on certain decisions from other jurisdictions, of which <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>Lyle Stuart, Inc., </em>40 N.Y.2d 354 (1976), is the signal case. There the court rejected arbitral authority to award punitive damages on the ground that \u201c[pjunitive damages is a sanction reserved to the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356. In its comprehensive and well-reasoned analysis of this issue, the Appeals Court declined to follow the <em>Garrity </em>rationale, finding more persuasive \u201cthose jurisdictions that \u2018have discounted the \u201cpublic\u201d nature of the punitive remedy and focused on the need to punish the individual defendant as well as the need to preserve arbitration as a respected alternative dispute resolution forum.\u2019 \u201d <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr. Co., supra </em>at 362, quoting Shell, The Power to Punish: Authority of Arbitrators to Award Multiple Damages and Attorneys\u2019 Fees, 72 Mass. L. Rev. 26, 31 (1987). We agree with the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We do not foreclose the possibility that some commercial disputes might affect public policy and might require different treatment, but the present case, involving a purely private dispute between two construction businesses, is not such a case. See <em>Canal Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp., supra </em>at 379; <em>Greenleaf Eng\u2019g &amp; Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Teradyne, Inc., supra </em>at 575-576. In the majority of cases under \u00a7 11 that consist of private commercial disputes, there is a \u201cstrong public policy in favor of arbitration.\u201d <em>Minton Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 880. Moreover, \u201cthe objectives' of punitive damages, which include compensating claimants for their legal costs and emotional injuries and punishing and deterring actual and potential wrongdoers . . . generally may be as well served by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>arbitrators as by judges and juries\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr. Co., supra </em>at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">That arbitration is not a public forum and does not yield published opinions, as argued by ZVI, does not detract significantly from the deterrence of other potential wrongdoers. \u201cIn the case of commercial arbitration, however, both traditional and modem electronic methods of information dissemination are likely to bring the news of arbitration awards to other members of the same trade or industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361 n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Allowing arbitrators to award the full range of relief under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, encourages arbitration as an alternative means of efficient commercial dispute resolution without the \u201cdelay and obstmction in the courts.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 28 (1980), quoting <em>Quirk </em>v. <em>Data Terminal Sys., Inc., </em>379 Mass. 762, 767 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Arbitration of multiple damages under \u00a7 11 furthers the legislative objective of promoting forthright conduct in commercial dealings, and the clear benefits therefrom outweigh any detractions that may result from conflicts with other policy considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">3. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Relying on <em>Floors, Inc. </em>v. <em>B.G. Danis of New England, Inc., </em>380 Mass. 91 (1980), the motion judge concluded that an arbitrator may not award attorney\u2019s fees absent the parties\u2019 express agreement. In that case the court held that a subcontractor was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, the public works payment bond statute, for legal services rendered during arbitration of the underlying contract claim. <em>Id. </em>at 95-101. The court reasoned that \u201c[ljegal fees incurred while arbitrating [the underlying dispute] are simply not the direct result of the right of action created by [G. L.] c. 149, \u00a7 29,\u201d which mandates an award of legal fees to a subcontractor who recovers judgment in an action on a surety bond. <em>Id. </em>at 99-100. The arbitration statute, G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 10, which prohibits an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the absence of an express agreement, was held to govern arbitration of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>claim. <em>Id. </em>at 97. The court recognized that the Legislature could mandate an award of attorney\u2019s fees by statute and thereby override the policy expressed in G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 10, but it gleaned no such intent in the language or legislative history of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29. <em>Id. </em>at 97, 101. The <em>Floors, Inc., </em>case construed G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 10, in a manner consistent with the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d regarding attorney\u2019s fees in civil actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 11, is a statute that overrides the general unavailability of attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 10, both in its language and in its purpose. It requires an award of attorney\u2019s fees on a finding that a claimant has been adversely affected by an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Specifically, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, sixth par., states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">\u201cIf the court finds in any action commenced hereunder, that there has been a violation of section two, the petitioner shall, in addition to other relief provided for by this section and irrespective of the amount in controversy, be awarded reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in said action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Unlike the distinct bond recovery provision under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, establishes both a cause of action and an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the same statute. Chapter 93A is unique in that it mandates an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party even if quantifiable damages are lacking. See <em>Jet Line Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>404 Mass. 706, 718 (1989) (claimant may recover attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 11 if claimant establishes unfair or deceptive conduct \u201chad some adverse effect . . . even if it is not quantifiable in dollars\u201d); <em>Raymer </em>v. <em>Bay State Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>384 Mass. 310, 319-320 (1981) (\u00a7 11 explicitly requires attorney\u2019s fees where they would otherwise be \u201canomalous\u201d). Provision for attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 93A reflects \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s manifest purpose of deterring misconduct by affording both private and public plaintiffs who succeed in proving violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a), reimbursement for their legal services and costs.\u201d <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 302, 316 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We conclude that the directive that a prevailing party be awarded attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, applies to arbitration awards of claims under \u00a7 11 despite the normal unavailability of attorney\u2019s fees in arbitration. The award of attorney\u2019s fees is required by \u00a7 11, and therefore overrides the effect of G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 10. Cf. <em>Floors, Inc. </em>v. <em>B.G. Danis of New England, Inc., supra </em>at 101. We acknowledge that attorney\u2019s fees for claims pursued in arbitration in conjunction with G. L. c. 93A claims are not recoverable under G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 10, if they can be apportioned accordingly. General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 11, sixth par., authorizes the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cincurred in connection with said action\u201d (i.e., the G. L. c. 93A action), but not for other actions. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Risk Mgt. Found, of the Harvard Med. Insts., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 421 (1994) (interpreting same language under c. 93A, \u00a7 9 [4]). Where claims \u201crepresent various elements of damage arising from a single chain of events,\u201d however, the attorney\u2019s fees need not be limited to G. L. c. 93A claims. <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 106 (1983), quoting <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 112 (1982). It is apparent from the arbitration panel\u2019s decision that the same events underlying the arbitration panel\u2019s conclusion that ZVI violated its contracts with Drywall governed its determination that ZVI violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11. As such, we need not remand the case for an apportionment of legal fees incurred in pursuit of Drywall\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">4. <em>Other claims. </em>ZVI claims that the arbitration panel exceeded its authority when it (1) denied its motion to compel Drywall to deliver certain lien waivers, (2) refused to hear relevant evidence, and (3) found that ZVI\u2019s unfair or deceptive acts or practices occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts. Under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a), </em>a judge\u2019s review of an arbitration award is limited.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Concerned Minority Educators of Worcester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, </em>392 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Mass. 184, 187 (1984). \u201cWe do not, and cannot, pass on an arbitrator\u2019s alleged errors of law and, absent fraud, we have no business overruling an arbitrator because we give a contract a different interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990). None of the points raised by ZVI warrants overruling the arbitration panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the motion judge\u2019s vacation of attorney\u2019s fees and order that the judgment of the Superior Court be modified to confirm the arbitration award in its entirety. Drywall may request appellate legal fees and costs in a motion for fees and costs, supported by affidavit, filed in the county court within fifteen days after the issuance of the rescript. See <em>Yorke Mgt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 20 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The contracts also provide that the parties agreed to be bound by the construction industry arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Section 43 of the those rules permits an arbitrator to \u201cgrant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The same provision was added to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3). St. 1989, c. 580, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The multiple damages authorized by \u00a7 11 are punitive damages. See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 856-858 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Parties who prefer to exclude multiple damage claims under G. L. c. 93 A, \u00a7 11, from arbitration may do so by the terms of their agreement to arbitrate, or they may elect to waive them entirely. See <em>Canal Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>406 Mass. 369, 377-378 (1990) (contractual provision limiting liability operated as waiver of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, claims).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Under the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d attorney\u2019s fees may not be recovered absent an agreement or statute to the contrary. See <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Gows, </em>429 Mass. 14, 17 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The relevant provisions of G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a), </em>provide that an arbitration award shall, on application of a party, be vacated in the Superior Court if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u201c(1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, or corruption in any of the arbitrators, or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party; (3) the arbitrators exceeded their powers or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by state or federal law; (4) the arbitrators . . . refused to hear evidence material to the controversy ... as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
