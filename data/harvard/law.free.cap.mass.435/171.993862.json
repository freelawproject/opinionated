Barros, was convicted in the District Court of carrying a firearm without a license and possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card. On appeal he claims error in the denial of his motion to suppress the firearm and the ammunition taken from his person after a police officer stopped him based on an anonymous tip and, he argues, without reasonable suspicion to believe he was committing a crime. The Appeals Court, concluding that the police of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ficer \u201chad insufficient basis to detain and search the defendant\u201d when he did, vacated the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and reversed his convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>49 Mass App. Ct. 613, 614 (2000). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We reach the same conclusion as the Appeals Court and reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The facts are set forth in the opinion of the Appeals Court, and need not be repeated in detail. Acting on an anonymous tip he had just received,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brockton police Officer Christopher McDermott, who was on duty and in uniform, drove his marked cruiser to the area of Main and Hancock Streets to look for a light-skinned Cape Verdean male, approximately five feet, six inches tall; wearing a blue baseball cap, a blue and white T-shirt, and blue jeans. The anonymous informant reported seeing the man take a handgun from his waistband and show it to others who were with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Within about three minutes of receiving the tip, McDermott came upon a group of Cape Verdean males walking along Main Street. One, the defendant, was similar in appearance to the description given by the informant. The officer recognized the defendant as someone he previously had told not to \u201chang around\u201d in front of stores in that neighborhood. He did not know whether the defendant was carrying a weapon. He drove alongside the group and said to the defendant, \u201cHey you ... I want to speak with you.\u201d The defendant looked at the officer, but otherwise kept walking and ignored the request. McDermott stopped his cruiser, got out, walked up to the defendant and, as two other officers arrived, pointed at him and said, \u201cHey you. I wanna talk to you. Come here.\u201d The defendant turned away from the officer, then stopped.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The defendant moved his hands toward the front of his waistband. Concerned for his safety, McDermott drew his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>service weapon and told the defendant to raise his hands. The defendant did not respond, so the officer repeated his command. The defendant raised his hands, then turned and faced the officer, taking four steps backward. Concerned that the defendant would flee, the officer handcuffed him, pat frisked him, and removed a loaded handgun from the front of the defendant\u2019s waistband. When asked whether he had a license to carry the firearm, the defendant said he did not. He was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In denying the motion to suppress, the motion judge concluded that (1) the initial interaction between the officer and the defendant involved merely two requests that the defendant stop and speak with the officer; (2) the information provided by the informant was corroborated by the officer\u2019s own observations of the defendant\u2019s appearance and the gesture the defendant made to the front of his waistband while his back was turned toward the officer; (3) the officer was justified in undertaking the precautionary measures that he did for his own safety; and (4) the defendant was seized in a constitutional sense only when the officer drew his service firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">2. <em>Seizure of the defendant. </em>The Appeals Court correctly perceived that determining the precise moment of seizure was critical to resolution of the issue of suppression. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 616-618 (2000). If, as the motion judge determined, seizure occurred when the officer drew his weapon out of concern for his own safety after the defendant made the gesture toward his waistband, then the motion to suppress was correctly denied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 544-545 &amp; n.4 (1991). If, however, seizure occurred when the officer pursued the defendant, pointed at him and said, \u201cCome here,\u201d as the defendant argues,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the result is altogether different. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, supra </em>at 616-617.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Police have seized a person in the constitutional sense \u201conly if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980) (opinion of Stewart, J.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the <em>Mendenhall </em>test, the police do not effectuate a seizure merely by asking questions unless the circumstances of the encounter are sufficiently intimidating that a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to turn his back on his interrogator and walk away. See <em>id. </em>at 555. See also <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 216-217 (1984); <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>403 Mass. 640, 644-645 (1988); 4 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.3(a), at 88-93 (3d ed. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The judge\u2019s finding that McDermott\u2019s initial request to the defendant to stop for questioning was not a seizure is supported by the record. McDermott remained in his cruiser while asking to speak to the defendant, and he did not impede or restrict the defendant\u2019s freedom of movement. As we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murdough, </em>428 Mass. 760, 763 (1999), \u201cofficers may make inquiry of anyone they wish and knock on any door, so long as they do not implicitly or explicitly assert that the person inquired of is not free to ignore their inquiries.\u201d See <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Delgado, supra </em>at 216 (\u201cpolice questioning, by itself, is unlikely to result in a Fourth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] violation\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 789 (1996) (\u201cnot every encounter between a law enforcement official and a member of the public constitutes an intrusion of constitutional dimensions requiring justification\u201d). See also <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Bos-tick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434 (1991); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Young, </em>105 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">However, the officer\u2019s second request had a compulsory dimension to it that his first request did not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[A]n initially consensual encounter between a police officer and a citizen can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>be transformed into a seizure or detention within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, \u2018if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u2019 \u201d <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Delgado, supra </em>at 215, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, supra </em>at 554 (opinion of Stewart, J.). See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19 n.16 (1968). Rights under art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth are similarly implicated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, supra </em>at 785-786. Such a transformation can occur if the target of the inquiry refuses to answer and the \u201cpolice take additional steps ... to obtain an answer.\u201d <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Delgado, supra </em>at 216. Here, after the defendant broke eye contact with McDermott and refused to respond to the first request, McDermott stepped out of his cruiser and pursued the defendant. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thi-beau, </em>384 Mass. 762, 764 (1981), we stated that \u201c[sjtops provoke constitutional scrutiny because they encumber one\u2019s freedom of movement. Pursuit that appears designed to effect a stop is no less intrusive than a stop itself. . . . [A] stop starts when pursuit begins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The Commonwealth contends that the second \u201crequest\u201d to stop does not transform the request into a seizure because the request was not \u201csufficiently intimidating.\u201d We disagree. The second request must be considered \u201cin view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, supra </em>at 554 (opinion of Stewart, J.). Although the uncommunicated subjective intent of the officer in attempting to effectuate a stop is irrelevant in the <em>Mendenhall </em>analysis,* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the fact that the officer pursued the defendant by leaving his cruiser and walking up to him after being rebuffed is highly relevant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>determining whether a reasonable person, in view of all the circumstances, would have felt free to terminate the encounter and leave. Moreover, when McDermott pointed at the defendant in the presence of two other officers and said: \u201cHey you. I wanna talk to you. <em>Come here\u201d </em>(emphasis added), he was communicating what a reasonable person would understand as a command that would be enforced by the police power. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, supra </em>at 790 (\u201cWe need not decide whether pursuit commenced when the officers drove after the defendant or [a more likely alternative] <em>when Officer Murphy made his second request to the defendant to stop\u201d </em>[emphasis added]). Evidence that the defendant did in fact stop suggests that he believed, as would any reasonable person, that he was not free to leave. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Quezada, </em>141 N.H. 258, 260 (1996) (submission after officer\u2019s statement to defendant, \u201cHey you, stop,\u201d indicated that compliance was not optional and was seizure). We conclude, as did the Appeals Court, that the defendant was seized when the officer pursued him and told him, \u201cCome here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">3. <em>Reasonable suspicion on the basis on an anonymous tip. </em>The question that remains is whether McDermott, at the time of seizure, had an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, based on specific and articulable facts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, supra </em>at 789, citing <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 21. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 18-19 (1990). See <em>Florida </em>v. <em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. 266, 271 (2000) (\u201creasonableness of official suspicion must be measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their search\u201d). The Appeals Court concluded that he did not, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u201c[I]f the police conduct an investigatory stop based on' an informant\u2019s tip, our evaluation of the tip\u2019s indicia of reliability will be focused on the informant\u2019s reliability and his or her basis of knowledge. Independent police corroboration may make up for deficiencies in one or both of these factors.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, supra </em>at 19. The tip, and McDermott\u2019s corroboration of the defendant\u2019s identity, did not provide suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ficient indicia of reliability for suspecting that the defendant had a handgun.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Florida </em>v. <em>J.L., supra </em>at 272 (\u201cAn accurate description of a subject\u2019s readily observable location and appearance . . . will help police correctly identify the person whom the tipster means to accuse. Such a tip, however, does not show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal activity\u201d). Moreover, even if the tip were reliable, McDermott still did not have reasonable suspicion that the defendant was doing anything illegal to justify seizure, and nothing in this record indicates that McDermott made any observations to support reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. As we said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>423 Mass. 266, 269 (1996), \u201c[cjarrying a gun is not a crime. Carrying a firearm without a license (or other authorization) is. G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a).\u201d An anonymous tip that someone is carrying a gun does not, without more, constitute reasonable suspicion to conduct a stop and frisk of that individual.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>407 Mass. 178, 183, cert, denied, 498 U.S. 951 (1990) (\u201cmere possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>handgun was not sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was illegally carrying that gun\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The Commonwealth argues that, assuming arguendo, the tip did not provide the requisite reasonable suspicion, we should consider the defendant\u2019s suspicious activities, including his breaking eye contact with the officer and his refusing to answer the officer\u2019s initial questions. Such factors cannot provide reasonable suspicion for justification of a detention or seizure. It was the defendant\u2019s right to ignore the officer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 406-407 (1974). As we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, supra </em>at 764, \u201c[an officer\u2019s] suspicion must be reasonable <em>before </em>the [stop] begins. Were the rule otherwise, the police could turn a hunch into a reasonable suspicion by inducing the conduct justifying the suspicion.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is vacated and an order shall be entered allowing that motion.

We disagree.

The test was adopted by a majority of the Supreme Court in <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 215 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\">While it is true that, in reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error, see, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990), a judge\u2019s \u201cfindings of ultimate fact deriving from the subsidiary findings are open to reexamination by [the reviewing] court, as are his conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v.

In support, the concurrence cites the concurring opinion by Justice Kennedy of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Florida </em>v. <em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. 266, 276 (2000). <em>Post </em>at 181 n.5. While Justice Kennedy\u2019s well-reasoned opinion provides valuable context to the issue of anonymous tips, the situation he described was not before the Court, and he was not writing for the majority of the Court. The concurring opinion also cites <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sierra-Hernandez, </em>581 F.2d 760 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 439 U.S. 936 (1978), for the proposition that face-to-face informants should be treated differently from unnamed anonymous callers. <em>Post </em>at 181 n.5. In the circumstances, we see no reason to depart from precedent that treats informants who wish to preserve their anonymity as anything other than anonymous informants. At the time of the stop, McDermott had corroborated only innocent details of the tip, and that is not sufficient to establish a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. See W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.4(a) (3d ed. 1996). Moreover, in the <em>Sierra-Hernandez </em>case there were other indicia of reliability that compensated for the deficiency of the anonymous tip. For example, the officer knew the location described to be the site of previous criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 763. The Commonwealth did not present any such evidence at the hearing. Additionally, in the <em>Sierra-Hernandez </em>case the target of the tip was in a moving vehicle. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, that case presented exigent circumstances which did not exist here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The Commonwealth referred to the tipster as an anonymous informant throughout the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The exigency which existed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>48 Mass.

While police officers have a duty to investigate potential dangers to the public, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 544-545 &amp; n.4 (1991), an anonymous tip of possession of a gun, without more, does not justify a police officer\u2019s stop and frisk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The Commonwealth, on appeal, for the first time asks us to recognize the objective authority of an officer to demand any person carrying a firearm to display his license. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C (\u201cAny person who, while not being within the limits of his own property or residence . . . shall on demand of a police officer or other law enforcement officer, exhibit his license to carry firearms, or his firearm identification card . . .\u201d). The Commonwealth\u2019s brief does not rise to the level of adequate appellate argument on this issue, so we decline to consider it. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). The author of the brief was not the attorney who argued for the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b198-8\">Sosman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5L\">(concurring, with whom Cordy, J., joins). I concur with the result reached by the court, as it is an unavoidable one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>on the record and argument presented to us, but write separately to echo the sentiments expressed in the concurring opinion of the Appeals Court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 620-621 (2000) (Jacobs, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">It appears likely that the circumstances known to Officer Mc-Dermott did include an objective basis for suspecting that the defendant did not have a license to carry a firearm (i.e., the defendant\u2019s apparent youth), but the Commonwealth failed to introduce sufficient evidence on that decisive issue. As the Appeals Court noted, evidence that the defendant appeared to be underage, had it been presented, would have justified a reasonable suspicion that the defendant did not have a license to carry a firearm. At the time of this stop, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, as amended through St. 1996, c. 200, \u00a7 28, provided that a license to carry firearms could not be issued to anyone under eighteen years of age.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant was seventeen years old. (one month shy of his eighteenth birthday) on the day he was stopped. Officer McDermott testified that he knew the defendant as one of \u201ca group of kids that live in that area,\u201d but provided no assessment (beyond characterizing him as a \u201ckid[]\u201d) as to whether his appearance was sufficiently youthful to make his eligibility for a license to carry firearms appear unlikely. The presentation of that additional piece of evidence would have taken only a single question of Officer McDermott.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the officer\u2019s mere reference to the defendant as a \u201ckid[j\u201d and the motion judge\u2019s reference to him as a \u201cyoung man\u201d do not allow us to draw the more precise conclusion that he appeared to be less than eighteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">On appeal, the Commonwealth\u2019s brief referenced another potential ground (G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C) that would arguably justify this stop, but did so only in a single, conclusory sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>that does not rise to the level of adequate appellate argument. Hence, the court\u2019s opinion justifiably refuses to consider the issue. <em>Ante </em>at 178 n.10. Mass. R. A. R 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The statute provides in part: \u201cAny person who, while not being within the limits of his own property or residence . . . shall on demand of a police officer or other law enforcement officer, exhibit his license to carry firearms .... Upon failure to do so such person may be required to surrender to such officer said firearm, rifle or shotgun which shall be taken into custody as under [G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129D], except that such firearm, rifle or shotgun shall be returned forthwith upon presentation within thirty days of said license to carry firearms . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C. The statute thus gives an officer the right to demand production of a proper license from anyone carrying a firearm and, if such license is not produced, to at least confiscate that firearm until such time as a valid license is produced.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have never addressed the power of an officer to stop someone in order to make a demand for a license under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, and the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to brief any of the issues surrounding the proper exercise of such a power prevents us from addressing those issues in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is, however, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>intriguing suggestion, and one that would at least arguably justify a stop on the facts of this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In my view, this stop was, either by reference to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, or by reference to the defendant\u2019s apparent age, probably justifiable. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth\u2019s less than \u201ccareful and thorough prosecution,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, supra </em>at 620 (Jacobs, J., concurring), both at the evidentiary hearing and in its brief to this court, prevents us from affirming the motion judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 347 (1974). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>387 Mass. 488, 502 (1982), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 468 U.S. 981 (1984), <em>S.C., </em>394 Mass. 381 (1985). Here, it appears unlikely that there was any police misconduct at all, and the invocation of the exclusionary rule is mandated instead by the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to present the entirety of the factual and legal justification for the officer\u2019s actions. As a result, our reversal now terminates a meritorious prosecution of an underage youth who was carrying a loaded handgun concealed on his person as he and his young friends proceeded along the streets of Brockton. \u201c[Tjhere are few more dangerous street scenarios than that of an adolescent with a gun.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, supra </em>at 621 (Jacobs, J., concurring). I thus join in the result reached by the court, but note that it is a regrettable result that was probably avoidable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The statute was subsequently rewritten and now permits issuance of a license to carry only to persons age twenty-one years or older. St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 41 (effective October 21, 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Other evidence as to the defendant\u2019s apparent age on the day in question must also have been readily available. Beyond Officer McDermott\u2019s observations, there was presumably a booking photograph taken that same day. Or, merely asking the motion judge to make observations of the defendant in the court room and include them in his findings would likely have sufficed. (The evidentiary hearing was held just two months after this stop, and the judge, having seen the defendant, referred to him in his findings as a \u201cyoung man.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The final sentence of the section leaves open the possibility of prosecution for any other firearms offenses: \u201cNothing in this section shall prevent any person from being prosecuted for any violation of this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Officer McDermott\u2019s failure to reference G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, in his testimony would not preclude us from considering the issue. It is true that the officer\u2019s testimony covered only what he actually said to the defendant \u2014 i.e., \u201cI want to speak with you\u201d and \u201cI wanna talk to you\u201d \u2014 and did not expressly state what the intended subject matter of that \u201ctalk\u201d was to have been. Because the encounter took a sudden turn when the defendant reached for his waistband, the record could not reflect the contents of the conversation that would have taken place had the defendant stopped and spoken with the officer. It is safe to infer, however, that because the only purpose in speaking to the defendant concerned his carrying of a weapon, that intended \u201ctalk\u201d had something to do with whether his possession of a gun was lawful. (After the gun was taken from the defendant, the officer did ask him if he had a license.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Moreover, as we have long held, it is not the precise thought process going through an officer\u2019s head that controls the constitutionality of any seizure. Rather, it is whether the surrounding facts and circumstances known to the officer would, viewed objectively, justify the requisite reasonable suspicion or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 208 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ceria, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 235 (1982) (\u201cpolice conduct is to be judged \u2018under a standard of objective reasonableness without regard to the underlying intent or motivation of the officers involved\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>399 Mass. 487, 491 (1987), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>McCambridge, </em>551 F.2d 865, 870 (1st Cir. 1977) (\u201cvalidity of an arrest is normally gauged by an objective standard rather than by inquiry into the officer\u2019s presumed motives\u201d). Thus, we need not concern ourselves with whether Officer McDermott actually intended to start his \u201ctalk\u201d with the defendant by demanding production of a license. Whatever Officer McDermott\u2019s precise intent or plan was, we need only consider whether the facts and circumstances known to him were sufficient to justify a stop of the defendant pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\">I do not agree with the court\u2019s assessment that the \u201canonymous informant\u201d in this case lacked sufficient reliability, <em>ante </em>at 176-177, and I thus conclude that there was reasonable suspicion that the defendant was carrying a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The facts surrounding Officer McDermott\u2019s encounter with the informant take this case well out of the category of the usual \u201canonymous tip.\u201d While on patrol in a marked cruiser, Officer McDermott was flagged down by a man driving a white Dodge pickup truck. Officer'McDermott described the man as a \u201c[m]iddle-aged white male, salt and pepper type hair, short, stocky.\u201d The man was \u201cwell-dressed,\u201d wearing slacks and \u201cmaybe a collared shirt.\u201d He identified himself as \u201ca local businessman\u201d who worked on Main Street. The man appeared \u201cconcerned.\u201d The man \u201casked to remain anonymous,\u201d and is thus properly referred to as an \u201canonymous informant,\u201d but he is hardly the equivalent of an anonymous telephone tipster who can never be located or identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The reliability of persons who contact the police face to face is greater than those who contact the police through completely anonymous and untraceable methods. \u201cAn instance where a tip might be considered anonymous but nevertheless sufficiently reliable to justify a proportionate police response may be when an unnamed person driving a car the police officer later describes stops for a moment and, face to face, informs the police that criminal activity is occurring.\u201d <em>Florida </em>v. <em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. 266, 276 (2000) (Kennedy, J., concurring). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sierra-Hemandez, </em>581 F.2d 760, 763 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 493 U.S. 936 (1978) (distinguishing unnamed informant who speaks to officer in person from unnamed informant making anonymous telephone call); <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>32 Va. App. 519, 524 (2000) (reports from two unnamed persons who approached police officer \u201cwere not an anonymous tip,\u201d noting that officers can assess credibility of informants who meet with them in person). Here, not only was the encounter face to face, but the man told the officer what he did and where he worked. He appeared both respectable and \u201cconcerned.\u201d Given the imminent dangers posed by unlawful firearms on the street (especially ones in the hands of \u201ckids\u201d), the information provided by this concerned citizen was sufficiently reliable to justify police action, notwithstanding the fact that he did not wish the defendant and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>compatriots to know that he was the one who had alerted the police to their possession of a gun. If reasonable suspicion that a person is carrying a firearm is a sufficient basis for the limited seizure contemplated by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, that threshold was satisfied here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
