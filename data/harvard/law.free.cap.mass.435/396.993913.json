Sahin (wife) filed a complaint against Kenan E. Sahin (husband) seeking relief from a prior divorce judgment by means of an independent equity action and pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 828 (1974). She alleged that fraud perpetrated by the husband had resulted in a divorce judgment that was manifestly unconscionable. A Probate and Family Court judge granted the husband\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the wife\u2019s complaint. We granted the wife\u2019s application for direct appellate review and now affirm the judgment of the Probate and Family Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>In the underlying action, the wife filed for divorce from the husband on June 30, 1994, following twenty-eight years of marriage. The central issue at trial was the value of the husband\u2019s business, Kenan Systems Corporation (KSC), a computer company founded in 1982 that developed billing software used primarily by telecommunications companies. Expert testimony was presented by each party, including a balance sheet showing actual revenue for the period January 1, 1995, to June 30, 1995, and projected revenue for the period July 1, 1995, to December 31, 1995 (1995 spreadsheet).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on all of the information that was presented, the judge concluded that the fair market value of the husband\u2019s interest in KSC was $4,912,717. Because the wife sought a specific cash payment, rather than a percentage of stock ownership in KSC,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judge awarded the husband 100% of the outstanding shares in KSC but ordered him to pay the wife 30% of KSC\u2019s established value, or $1,473,815, in annual instalments over five years. A judgment for divorce nisi was issued on February 22, 1996.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment became absolute on May 23, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In January, 1999, nearly three years after issuance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>divorce judgment, Lucent Technologies, Inc. (Lucent), announced that it was acquiring KSC in exchange for 12.88 million shares of Lucent, then valued at $1.48 billion. The sale was completed by March 1, 1999, and KSC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Lucent.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In light of the explosion in value of KSC and, consequently, in the husband\u2019s wealth, the wife filed with the Probate and Family Court a complaint seeking relief from the prior divorce judgment by means of an independent equity action and pursuant to rule 60 (b) (6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *She asserted that there were compelling and exceptional circumstances necessitating review of the division of property between the parties, particularly the huge disparity between the $4.9 million valuation of KSC in 1996 and its $1.48 billion sale price in 1999. The wife alleged that the gross discrepancy between the estimated fair market value of KSC in 1996 and its established fair market value in 1999 could not be explained by any market condition, by the economy, or by any internal changes in the company, including its product line or marketing strategy. Rather, it was the wife\u2019s contention that this discrepancy was directly attributable to the husband\u2019s misrepresentations and omissions during the divorce proceedings of material facts pertaining to KSC\u2019s financial outlook, which constituted fraud and denied the wife her day in court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Following the completion of discovery, the husband filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>motion for summary judgment on the grounds that there were no genuine issues of material fact, that the wife\u2019s bases for asserting fraud were insufficient as a matter of law, and that her claims were time barred. The judge first concluded that, viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the wife, there was no evidence that she had been defrauded by the husband. Furthermore, even if she had been able to present evidence of fraud by the husband, there was no exception in rule 60 (b) that would allow the judge to grant the wife relief more than one year after entry of the divorce judgment. Accordingly, the Probate and Family Court entered a judgment of dismissal on June 6, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The wife now argues that the judge erred in concluding that there was no avenue by which she was entitled to relief from the prior divorce judgment more than one year after the entry of such judgment. She contends that she should have been afforded relief pursuant to (1) an independent equity action under rule 60 (b); (2) an action to set aside the judgment for \u201cfraud [on] the court\u201d; and (3) a claim under rule 60 (b) (6). The wife asserts that her evidence demonstrated that the fair market value of KSC at the time of the divorce was corrupted by the husband\u2019s fraudulent scheme to misrepresent and omit significant facts that impeded her ability to obtain an accurate valuation of the company. As such, the husband\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been denied.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">2. <em>Independent equity action. </em>Rule 60 sets forth a comprehen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>sive framework for obtaining relief from a final judgment or order, balancing the competing needs for finality and flexibility to be certain that justice is done in light of all the facts.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>409 Mass. 727, 732-733 (1991). See also <em>Bankers Mtge. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>423 F.2d 73, 77 (5th Cir.), cert, denied, 399 U.S. 927 (1970). Rule 60 (b) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">\u201cOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59 (b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party ... or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken .... This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The wife would not have been able to prevail on a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to rule 60 (b) (2) or (3) because her complaint was filed more than one year after the final judgment in the divorce proceeding was entered. Unlike actions brought pursuant to subsections (b) (1), (2), and (3), which are subject to the one-year time limitation, there is no specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>time limitation for bringing an independent action for relief from judgment. Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b). <em>See Aronson </em>v. <em>Brookline Rent Control Bd., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 708 n.21 (1985). That said, however, \u201ca party should not be able to avoid the one-year or \u2018reasonable time\u2019 limits of Rule 60 (b) simply by commencing an independent action seeking the same relief.\u201d J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 60.16, at 488 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2001). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beggerly, </em>524 U.S. 38, 46 (1998) (\u201cIf relief may be obtained through an independent action in a case such as this, where the most that may be charged . . . is a failure to furnish relevant information that would at best form the basis for a [rjule 60 [b] [3] motion, the strict 1-year time limit on such motions would be set at naught\u201d). See also <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Springfield Sugar &amp; Prods. Co., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 979, 979-980 (1983). To the extent that the claims raised by a party\u2019s independent action appear to fall within those provisions of rule 60 (b) that mandate a specific time limitation, but materialized too late to file in a motion to the court which rendered the judgment, the party must raise some additional ground or reason justifying relief after the expiration of the time limitation. See <em>Geo. P. Reintjes Co. </em>v. <em>Riley Stoker Corp., </em>71 F.3d 44, 46-47 (1st Cir. 1995) (\u201cwhere the body of the Rule contains an explicit time limitation for motions invoking specified grounds for relief, it would make no sense to apply the final general provision, containing no limit of time, so broadly as to cover all the grounds for which the time limit is expressly stated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Rule 60 (b) does not identify the bases for an independent action. zThis substantive determination is made by recourse to \u201cjudicial principles governing untimely requests for equitable relief from fraudulent judgments\u201d that existed prior to the adoption of rule 60 (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 48. Historically, relief from a valid and final judgment required more than a showing of common-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>law fraud.* *<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford-Empire Co., </em>322 U.S. 238, 244-245 (1944) (untimely bid for relief justified only where enforcement of judgment would be \u201cmanifestly unconscionable\u201d); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>130 F.2d 40, 43-44 (4th Cir. 1942) (\u201cit is well settled that [a conspiracy between plaintiff and his witnesses to present perjured testimony] constitutes no ground\u201d on which court could deny enforcement of judgment in an independent action); <em>Chicago, R.I. &amp; P. Ry. </em>v. <em>Callicotte, </em>267 F. 799, 809-810 (8th Cir. 1920), cert, denied, 255 U.S. 570 (1921). Cf. <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>312 Mass. 452, 454 (1942) (petition for modification of decree mandating spousal support not open to attack simply because of false testimony or inadequate presentation of case where \u201cnew\u201d evidence was either known at the time of original hearing or was then readily ascertainable).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Cases addressing the scope of fraud necessary to support an independent action under the current version of rule 60 (b) have continued to follow this principle. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beg-gerly, supra </em>at 46-47 (independent actions reserved for those cases where relief from final judgment necessary to prevent a grave miscarriage of justice). See also <em>Geo. P. Reintjes Co. </em>v. <em>Riley Stoker Corp., supra </em>at 49 (claim of perjury relating to central issue in case, absent allegation of involvement by an officer of the court, insufficient to maintain independent action because possibility of perjury is a \u201ccommon hazard of the adversary process with which litigants are equipped to deal through discovery and cross-examination\u201d); <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Jan-drucko, </em>860 F.2d 556, 558 (2d Cir. 1988), and cases cited (type of fraud necessary to sustain independent action more narrow in scope than that sufficient to obtain relief by timely rqotion); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>761 F.2d 1549, 1552 (11th Cir. 1985) (allegations of perjury insufficient to obtain relief from judgment through independent action, which cannot be used as vehicle for relitigation of issues). Cf. <em>Olsson </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>373 Mass. 517, 531-532 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The wife has not presented any evidence to demonstrate that equity mandates granting her relief from the divorce judgment. The 1993 business plan setting forth projected revenues for 1996 and 1999 was not a statement of facts but merely of financial estimates. See <em>Rodowicz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>192 F.3d 162, 175-176 (1st Cir. 1999) (statements of opinion or belief as to business operations, made without certainty, do not rise to level of statements of fact and do not constitute fraudulent misrepresentations). Moreover, during the divorce proceedings, the wife never deposed the KSC employee who prepared the business plan. The wife also never deposed the two KSC employees on whose testimony she now relies to support her allegation that the husband received offers to invest in or purchase KSC as early as 1994. As to the purported \u201coffer\u201d by Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, the wife was on notice of it pursuant to documents she received from State Street Bank during discovery. The husband\u2019s statements in 1995 as to KSC\u2019s financial future, whether optimistic or pessimistic, were also opinions, not facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">To the extent that the 1995 spreadsheet understated or omitted potential streams of revenue, it was clear that the financial information for the time period from July 1, 1995, through December 31, 1995, constituted projected estimates. The wife admits that, during the divorce proceedings, she never deposed the former KSC controller, who prepared the 1995 spreadsheet, to ascertain how it was assembled and what potential revenues were not included. Moreover, the wife\u2019s expert prepared his own analysis of the fair market value of KSC and did not indicate that he relied on the 1995 spreadsheet as a source of information for his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">With respect to the wife\u2019s claim that the husband failed to disclose the existence of three licensing agreements entered into during the fall of 1995, as described in her request for production of documents, we note that the husband objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>request on the basis of confidentiality. The husband asserted that he was prohibited from disclosing this information absent a court order or the permission of the customers. There is no evidence that the wife sought either a court order or permission from the customers, notwithstanding the fact that the husband made KSC\u2019s customer lists available to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The husband admits that he did not disclose to the wife the existence of several new licensing agreements that were signed during 1996 on the ground that he had no duty to produce such documents after the divorce trial was over. He also contends that he was never asked to speculate about any potential future contracts. \u201cA division of marital assets anticipates a final and equitable distribution of the property owned by the parties at the time of the divorce, and it is from those assets only that a judge can make her division .... Thus, in making a division of assets the judge [is] limited, for better or worse, to the property owned by the parties at the time of the divorce.\u201d <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, </em>422 Mass. 477, 483-484 (1996). See <em>Baccanti </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>434 Mass. 787, 794-796 (2001) (spouse\u2019s existing stock options, although uncertain in value and not yet vested, considered assets that may be included when dividing marital estate). The new licensing agreements at issue herein were not entered into until 1996, and there was no indication that negotiations had been manipulated to postpone the execution of such agreements until after the divorce trial was over. The licensing \u2022 agreements did not become existing assets of KSC for valuation purposes until 1996. Therefore, they would not be included in the determination of the appropriate division of property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 154-155 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the husband\u2019s alleged fraud in misrepresenting and failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>disclose significant financial information about KSC during the divorce proceedings, and the wife\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence of such fraud, do not justify granting the wife equitable relief from the divorce judgment under rule 60 (b). She has failed to present any evidence demonstrating that enforcement of the judgment would be manifestly unconscionable. Much of the evidence that the wife contends was imperative to an accurate valuation of KSC was, in fact, available to her during the earlier proceedings. While the wife\u2019s experts in the present equity action were prepared to testify that the husband\u2019s financial misrepresentations and omissions had a significant and material impact on the valuation of KSC, those experts have not suggested that they could have predicted that KSC would explode in value and be worth $1.48 billion by 1999, particularly in light of the major fluctuations in the fortunes of computer companies. The husband did not conceal a marital asset from the wife \u2014 KSC was known, valued (albeit imperfectly), and divided. As such, the wife was afforded her day in court. We recognize that there may be instances when allowing a particular judgment to stand would be so contrary to principles of equity as to tip what would otherwise be ordinary fraud into the special category that can invoke a court\u2019s inherent power to breach finality. The wife has not presented evidence that this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">3. <em>Fraud on the court. </em>The wife\u2019s claim that she is entitled to relief from the divorce judgment because the husband\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and omissions constituted \u201cfraud upon the court\u201d under rule 60 (b) is equally unavailing. Even if the wife\u2019s allegations were true, the husband\u2019s conduct did not amount to fraud on the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">There is no time limitation that would bar a judge from setting aside a judgment for fraud upon the court. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b). See also <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>407 Mass. 196, 202 n.10 (1990). \u201cA \u2018fraud on the court\u2019 occurs where \u2018it can be demonstrated, clearly and convincingly, that a party has sentiently set in motion some unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial system\u2019s ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>claim or defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Paternity of Cheryl, </em>434 Mass. 23, 35 (2001), quoting <em>Rockdale Mgt. Co. </em>v. <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A., </em>418 Mass. 596, 598 (1994). The doctrine embraces \u201conly that species of fraud which does, or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery can not perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication.\u201d <em>Pina </em>v. <em>McGill Dev. Corp., </em>388 Mass. 159, 165 (1983), quoting <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>46 F.R.D. 625, 631 (D. D.C. 1969). \u201cA party seeking to demonstrate fraud on the court must prove \u2018the most egregious conduct involving a corruption of the judicial process itself. Examples are bribery of judges, employment of counsel to \u201cinfluence\u201d the court, bribery of the jury, and the involvement of an attorney (an officer of the court) in the perpetration of fraud.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Paternity of Cheryl, supra </em>at 36, quoting <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>MacDonald, supra </em>at 202. Conduct such as nondisclosure to the adverse party or the court of facts pertinent to the matter before it, without more, does not constitute fraud on the court for purposes of setting aside a judgment under rule 60 (b). See <em>id. </em>at 36. See also <em>Winthrop Corp. </em>v. <em>Lowenthal, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 187 (1990) (nondisclosure of contingent fee agreement did not amount to fraud on the court where disclosure required by contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">4. <em>Relief under Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (6). </em>We next consider the wife\u2019s argument that she was entitled to relief from the divorce judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 60 (b) (6), the catchall provision of that rule. \u201cIn essence, rule 60 (b) (6) vests \u2018power in courts adequate to enable them to vacate judgments whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. 809, 815 (1983), quoting <em>Klap-prott </em>v. <em>United States, </em>335 U.S. 601, 615 (1949). In the interest of finality of judgments, relief under rule 60 (b) (6) is only to be granted in extraordinary circumstances. See <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 254, 257 (1987), and cases cited; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>377 Mass. 217, 228 n.13 (1979). Moreover, relief under rule 60 (b) (6) is only appropriate when justified by some reason <em>other </em>than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>those set forth in rule 60 (b) (l)-(5). See <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 256. See also <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>407 Mass. 251, 257 (1990). \u201cIn other words, to prevail under rule 60 (b) (6), a party must show that there is a reason to justify the relief, and also that the reason is not within the grounds set forth in rule 60 (b) (l)-(5).\u201d <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, supra </em>at 814-815. The wife\u2019s proffered reasons for relief \u2014 the husband\u2019s alleged fraud in misrepresenting and failing to disclose significant financial information about KSC and her \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence of such fraud \u2014 clearly fall within subsections (2) and (3) of rule 60 (b). Because the wife\u2019s arguments are not requests for relief independent of subsections (b) (l)-(5), she may not seek relief under rule 60 (b) (6).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\">A Probate and Family Court judge had ordered that all discovery be completed by July 27, 1995.

The judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>determination whether the wife\u2019s evidence warranted relief under rule 60 (b) will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. See <em>Cullen Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Prop. Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>399 Mass. 886, 894 (1987). The judge\u2019s determination whether the wife\u2019s claims were time barred as a matter of law is reviewed without deference. See <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 621 (1992). Contrary to the wife\u2019s argument, the judge did not apply the wrong standard in considering the husband\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b420-15\">As a general principle, the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure are given the same construction as the cognate Federal rules. See <em>Chavoor </em>V. <em>Lewis, </em>383 Mass. 801, 806 n.5 (1981). In all pertinent respects, Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) is identical to Fed. R. Civ.

Fraud by omission requires both concealment of material information and a duty requiring disclosure. See <em>Roadmaster Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Columbia Mfg. Co., </em>893 F. Supp. 1162, 1179 (D.

L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, the wife asserts that the division of property between former spouses can be examined at any time after the divorce for fairness and reasonableness. Her argument is without merit. \u201cProperty settlements are designed largely to effectuate a final and complete settlement of obligations between the divorcing spouses. While alimony is modifiable on the showing of a material change in circumstances . . . property settlements are not.\u201d <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, </em>422 Mass. 477, 483 (1996). See <em>Drapek </em>v. <em>Drapek, </em>399 Mass. 240, 244 (1987). Contrast <em>Brash </em>v. <em>Brash, </em>407 Mass. 101, 102-105 (1990) (complaint for division of marital assets could be heard ten years after entry of judgment of divorce nisi where such judgment did not include division of marital assets).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The wife has not presented any evidence that the husband\u2019s attorneys were involved in the perpetration of any alleged fraud on the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b427-6\">On September 13, 1999, a stipulation and protective order governing confidential material (protective order) was entered in the Probate and Family Court. On August 14, 2000, the wife filed a motion to remove from impoundment the pleadings and exhibits that she had filed in the Probate and Family Court in opposition to the husband\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The wife\u2019s motion was denied, and the documents sealed pursuant to the protective order were impounded until September 27, 2010. The wife then filed with the Appeals Court a petition seeking relief from the order of the Probate and Family Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par. The petition was denied by a single justice of the Appeals Court. The wife now argues in her brief before this court that the Probate and Family Court and the single justice of the Appeals Court erred in continuing to impound the summary judgment record. We conclude that this issue is not properly before us for review. Following the denial of her petition for relief by the single justice of the Appeals Court, the wife pursued <em>no </em>further action on this matter. The wife should have filed a petition in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County seeking to invoke the court\u2019s general superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See <em>Boston Herald, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>432 Mass. 593, 601-602 (2000). Accordingly, this issue has been waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
