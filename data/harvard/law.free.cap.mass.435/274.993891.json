The trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant argues that (1) the judge improperly excluded evidence of prior bad acts committed by Steven Maynard, the victim\u2019s boy friend, who, the defendant alleged at trial, had committed the murder, and (2) a new trial is required as the result of the dual representation of the defendant (at trial) and another defendant, Charles Thompson (on appeal), by lawyers with the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS). In his pro se brief, the defendant argues that (1) he was entitled to a required finding of not guilty on the aggravated rape charge (and necessarily thereby on the felony-murder charge) because of the insufficiency of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, and (2) there was error in admitting testimony of the medical examiner characterizing the victim\u2019s killing as a \u201csexually related death.\u201d We reject the defendant\u2019s arguments on the required finding and evidentiary issues. On the principal issue, the allegation that a new trial is required because of the existence of an actual conflict of interest, we conclude that the defendant has failed to demonstrate the existence of such a conflict. Finally, we conclude that there is no basis to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or to reduce the verdict of guilt on the murder charge. Consequently, we affirm the judgments of conviction, and the orders denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, motion for reconsideration, renewed motion for reconsideration, and final motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Based on the evidence in the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the jury could have found the following facts. Concerned when learning that the victim had not reported to work on Monday, August 28, 1995, the victim\u2019s father, after having left a message for the victim on her answering machine, went to her apartment in Agawam. He knocked and tried opening the door to the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>apartment, but it was locked. The defendant, who lived with his girl friend in a nearby apartment unit, approached the victim\u2019s father and told him that he had not recently seen the victim or her car. At the family\u2019s request, police officers entered the victim\u2019s apartment and discovered her body. She was twenty-three years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The victim\u2019s nude body was found beneath a comforter on the floor of her apartment. The victim was discovered lying on her back. She had died the day before from multiple stab wounds, four to her chest and seven to her back. She had significant injuries to her head, neck, anal, vaginal, and groin areas. The victim\u2019s head and neck injuries were consistent with a blunt force trauma and with asphyxiation. She had also suffered defensive wounds to her hands and arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Although there were signs of a struggle near the victim\u2019s door, there was no indication of forced entry. One set of the victim\u2019s apartment keys was found, separate from the rest of her keys, in the kitchen sink. Other items found in the sink included a bloodstained towel, a black T-shirt, the broken handles of knives, a bent paring knife, and a very large knife blade. All the items in the sink were wet. There was dried blood on the kitchen floor, and dried blood and spattered blood elsewhere in the apartment. A bloodstained knife blade was recovered near the victim\u2019s bureau. The victim\u2019s underwear was found on the floor in front of a closet door, away from folded clothing that she had worn when she was last seen on the previous Sunday morning at about 3 a.m. by a police officer who had responded to her report of a burglary. Later that morning, a neighbor heard a woman\u2019s voice coming from the victim\u2019s apartment cry out, \u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, no\u201d; the neighbor heard \u201csomething bang after that,\u201d followed by silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">As police officers and State troopers investigated the crime scene, the defendant watched. When approached by a State trooper, the defendant falsely identified himself. The trooper subsequently returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment and obtained a written statement from him. Later that evening, the defendant reported to the Agawam police department for further questioning. During the interview, he confessed to having burglarized the victim\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>A subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s apartment revealed that the defendant was in the process of moving. Police found a bloodstained towel and wet bloodstained clothing in his apartment. One of the State troopers noticed bloodstains in the defendant\u2019s bathroom sink and on his medicine cabinet. Police seized a pair of wet \u201cbicycle riding\u201d gloves.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The defendant was arrested and was charged with burglary of the victim\u2019s apartment. In another statement, the defendant claimed to have returned to the victim\u2019s apartment (after having burglarized it) on the Sunday in question, and to have engaged in consensual sexual relations with the victim at that time. He told a State trooper that, \u201cWhen the evidence comes back, you will know who it points to,\u201d and \u201cI just can\u2019t admit to killing her.\u201d After being escorted to a cell, the defendant asked the trooper who had interviewed him when the police would have the results from the evidence they had collected. The trooper replied that it would be tested as soon as possible, and asked the defendant if he had killed the victim. The defendant replied, \u201cWhen you get your evidence back and it\u2019s positive, I would be more inclined to say \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d The defendant later told a police officer, \u201c[Ujntil your evidence comes back, I just can\u2019t admit it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Bloodstains from the victim\u2019s apartment and from objects seized therein were consistent with the blood types and DNA profiles of both the defendant and the victim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A boot print matching a boot seized from the defendant\u2019s apartment was discovered on the top of an air conditioning unit frame outside a rear window of the victim\u2019s apartment. Blood found in the defendant\u2019s apartment was consistent with his blood type and DNA profile. A pubic hair found lying on top of the victim\u2019s body was not consistent with her pubic hair, but was not inconsistent with one removed from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>1. The defendant\u2019s motions for a required finding of not guilty on the aggravated rape charge were properly denied. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, while largely circumstantial, was, when considered under the governing standard, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>La-timore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), sufficient to warrant a finding by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of aggravated rape. We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the absence of semen in or on the victim is significant. The presence of semen is but one way of proving penetration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>431 Mass. 30, 33 (2000), and cases cited. In this case, the victim was discovered nude lying on her back. Her underwear was found across the room. In addition to the injuries to her head, and stab wounds to her body, which resulted in serious bodily injury and death to the victim, the victim\u2019s thighs were bruised, and her vaginal opening had been injured. The medical examiner testified that the injuries to her vaginal opening were consistent with having been penetrated. The pubic hair consistent with the defendant\u2019s was found on top of her body. This evidence, together with the forensic evidence implicating the defendant in the victim\u2019s murder, was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had raped the victim. The jury also were able to consider the defendant\u2019s admission that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim in her apartment on the day before her body was discovered. The jury were free to reject the defendant\u2019s suggestion that his sexual intercourse with the victim was consensual. Additionally, the defendant\u2019s contention that Maynard, the victim\u2019s boy friend, committed the crimes went to the weight of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and was a contention for the jury to evaluate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGahee, </em>393 Mass. 743, 750 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">2. There was no error in admitting the medical examiner\u2019s testimony (which was not objected to) that the victim\u2019s killing was a \u201csexually related death.\u201d The statement was properly based on the evidence as to the nature of the killing, the medical examiner\u2019s examination of the crime scene, the results of his medical examination and autopsy of the victim, and his expertise and experience as a forensic pathologist. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>400 Mass. 550, 554-555 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>3. At trial, the defendant sought to introduce evidence that Maynard, the victim\u2019s boy friend who testified at the trial, had assaulted one Michael Mannix on two occasions in 1991, and that Maynard\u2019s mother (or stepmother) had provided an alleged false alibi for him in contesting criminal charges connected to one of the incidents. The defendant\u2019s intention in seeking to admit evidence of these assaults and other bad acts of Maynard was to demonstrate Maynard\u2019s jealousy over another man seeing the victim and to show that Maynard may have fabricated an alibi to remove suspicion from himself as the victim\u2019s killer. After Mannix testified at a voir dire hearing in response to the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to exclude the evidence, the judge disallowed the inquiry. The defendant argues that the exclusion of the evidence impermissibly undermined his defense that Maynard, not he, was the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The judge\u2019s ruling was within his discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghean, </em>412 Mass. 839, 841 (1992). The only evidence that Maynard had manufactured a false alibi (in defending against charges arising out of an altercation with Mannix that had taken place sometime in 1991) was Mannix\u2019s voir dire testimony to that effect. The judge correctly noted that this evidence was \u201cfar too tenuous\u201d and, thus, properly steered the trial away from a collateral issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Binkiewicz, </em>342 Mass. 740, 755-756 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">While the judge recognized the right of the defendant to put evidence before the jury showing that someone other than he committed the crime or had the motive to commit the crime, the judge properly excluded Mannix\u2019s testimony of his previous altercations with Maynard as too remote in time and as involving collateral issues. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>395 Mass. 296, 300-301 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Binkiewicz, supra. </em>As noted by the judge, the altercations in question took place approximately four years before the victim was murdered, and Mannix\u2019s testimony did not establish that Maynard directed any violence or threats toward the victim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">4. Some additional background is necessary before addressing the propriety of the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>for a new trial, which was based on the claim that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel had provided him with constitutionally inadequate representation because of the existence of an actual conflict of interest. On August 3, 1995, a few weeks before the victim in this case was killed, the body of Andrea Thompson was discovered. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>431 Mass. 108, 110, cert, denied, 531 U.S. 864 (2000). She had been stabbed twenty-four times. <em>Id. </em>at 111. There was no evidence of a sexual assault. <em>Id. </em>Her estranged husband, Charles Thompson (Thompson), was charged with her murder, and a jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree on theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty. <em>Id. </em>at 109. We affirmed the judgment of conviction and orders denying his motions for a new trial and for reconsideration. <em>Id. </em>at 122. Thompson\u2019s primary defense at trial was that he had been at work at the time his wife was murdered. <em>Id. </em>at 113. In addition to this defense, he \u201calso presented evidence of another stabbing [(the victim\u2019s murder)] that had occurred . . . after he was placed in custody, inviting the jury to draw the inference that the perpetrator was still at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Thompson was represented by private counsel at trial. In August, 1996, he was assigned counsel, Brownlow M. Speer (Speer) from the appeals unit of CPCS, for his appeal. In June, 1997, Speer learned that Andrew Klyman (Klyman), a CPCS trial attorney, was representing the defendant in connection with the victim\u2019s murder. Speer obtained an opinion from bar counsel that the dual representation of the defendant and Thompson by CPCS was a waivable conflict, and Speer obtained a waiver from Thompson. Klyman did not obtain a waiver from the defendant and proceeded to trial without informing the defendant of Speer\u2019s representation of Thompson. The defendant did not learn of Speer\u2019s representation of Thompson until after his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">On learning of Speer\u2019s representation of Thompson on appeal, the defendant moved for a new trial, asserting that CPCS\u2019s dual representation of the defendant (at trial) and of Thompson (on appeal) constituted an actual conflict of interest, depriving the defendant of effective assistance of counsel. CPCS is considered one law firm for purposes of a conflict of interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>claim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egardo, </em>426 Mass. 48, 50 (1997). The defendant argued that a genuine conflict existed because the representation of Thompson \u201crequired [CPCS] to pursue proof of [the defendant\u2019s] guilt of the crime allegedly committed by Thompson,\u201d which \u201cwas in actual conflict with [seeking the defendant\u2019s] acquittal.\u201d Put differently, the defendant\u2019s contention is that an actual conflict exists because CPCS, to-exonerate Thompson, has to show that the defendant killed both the victim and Andrea Thompson, and to exonerate the defendant, has to show that the defendant did not kill the victim. After a hearing on the motion, and an examination of the motions and affidavits, the judge entered a written decision denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In his decision, the judge found that Thompson\u2019s private trial counsel had been allowed access to the grand jury investigation of the victim\u2019s murder because Thompson had argued that the material was exculpatory. In addition, the judge found that Thompson had presented evidence at his trial from the grand jury\u2019s investigation of the defendant to show that the defendant was an alternate suspect in the Andrea Thompson case and to allege and argue that the Andrea Thompson murder and the murder of the victim in this case were \u201ccopycat\u201d crimes. The judge considered a letter from Speer (submitted in response to the defendant\u2019s motion to preserve and protect privileged information), in which Speer stated: \u201cBy the time I learned that Mr. Klyman was representing [the defendant], it had already been determined that the [victim\u2019s] murder did not present an issue of law for Mr. Thompson\u2019s appeal, because Mr. Thompson\u2019s trial counsel had been able to present the evidence of the [victim\u2019s] murder and also to cross-examine the medical examiner about it ... . Therefore I never suggested to Mr. Klyman that there might be any conflict in his continuing to represent [the defendant] on the charge of the [victim\u2019s] murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The judge concluded that the defendant had \u201cnot made a sufficient showing that CPCS\u2019s dual representation of [the defendant] and Thompson constituted a genuine conflict of interest for or prejudiced [the defendant].\u201d He reasoned that the existence of a conflict between Thompson and CPCS did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>compel the conclusion that a like conflict existed for the defendant. He explained that neither Thompson\u2019s trial nor his appeal were relevant or material to the defendant\u2019s trial, and that the defendant\u2019s trial did not present an issue for Thompson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The defendant, submitting copies of correspondence from Thompson and Speer requesting materials from the defendant\u2019s trial, filed a motion for reconsideration, a renewed motion for reconsideration, and a final request for reconsideration of the judge\u2019s denial of the motion for a new trial. The judge denied these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We agree with the judge that the defendant failed to satisfy his burden of establishing the existence of an actual or genuine conflict of interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, a defendant has the \u201cright to the full and undivided loyalty of his attorney. A defendant is entitled to the untrammeled and unimpaired assistance of counsel free from any conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. 16, 20 (1986). \u201cWhere a genuine conflict of interest exists, the defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed. Once a genuine conflict is shown, the defendant is not required under art. 12 to shoulder the additional burden of proving actual prejudice or an adverse effect on his counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden of proving the existence of a genuine conflict of interest lies with a defendant. <em>Id. A </em>defendant \u201cis obliged to present demonstrative proof detailing both the existence and the precise character of this alleged conflict of interest; we will not infer a conflict based on mere conjecture or speculation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn \u2018actual\u2019 or \u2018genuine\u2019 conflict of interest arises where the \u2018independent professional judgment\u2019 of trial counsel is impaired, either by his own interests, or by the interests of another client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. 670, 688 (2001), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Thompson was in custody when the victim in this case was murdered. Consequently, nothing in the Thompson case could have exonerated the defendant. The defendant\u2019s assertion of an actual conflict of interest, however, derives from CPCS\u2019s alleged interest and duty in \u201cin seeing [the defendant] convicted because the evidence at [the defendant\u2019s] trial and . . . conviction [of the defendant] could support Mr. Thompson\u2019s claim to a new trial.\u201d The defendant\u2019s argument ignores the significance of the uncontested f\u00e1ct that the defendant\u2019s case was not an issue in Thompson\u2019s appeal, because Thompson\u2019s trial counsel had presented evidence at Thompson\u2019s trial that the defendant was a suspect in the victim\u2019s murder and had been allowed to argue that Andrea Thompson\u2019s murder and the victim\u2019s murder were \u201ccopycat\u201d crimes. In convicting Thompson, the jury in that case rejected the theory that the two murders had been committed by the same person, and Thompson never raised any issues concerning this evidence in any postconviction motion or in his direct appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Further, any \u201cevidence\u201d from the defendant\u2019s trial would establish, contrary to Thompson\u2019s suggestion at his trial, that Andrea Thompson\u2019s murder and victim\u2019s murder were not \u201ccopycat\u201d crimes. While the evidence at the defendant\u2019s trial revealed that there were some similarities between the murders of Andrea Thompson and the victim,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> these similarities were not particularly distinguishable or unique. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>395 Mass. 296, 300-301 (1985). Although both victims had been stabbed to death, the fact that the victim in this case had been raped significantly distinguished the two murders, as there was no indication of any kind of sexual assault in Andrea Thompson\u2019s murder. Thus, no \u201cnew\u201d evidence could exist that could link the defendant to Thompson\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In short, the defendant has failed to make the required showing. Argumentative alchemy cannot transmute a speculative claim into a demonstrable conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>5. The defendant is not entitled to relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. There was sufficient evidence supporting the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant committed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">6. We affirm the judgments of conviction and the orders denying the motion for a new trial and motions for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The defendant did not dispute the forensic evidence linking him to the victim\u2019s apartment. He claimed that he cut his leg while burglarizing the victim\u2019s apartment and wiped the blood off with a towel. His counsel, in closing, argued that while the defendant was having consensual sexual intercourse with the victim the day before her body was discovered, his cut \u201creopened,\u201d thus explaining the presence of the defendant\u2019s blood on the floor in various areas of the victim\u2019s apartment. The victim\u2019s boy friend, Maynard, whom the defendant claimed killed her, was excluded as a source of blood found in the victim\u2019s apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Indeed, the evidence was that the victim had blamed Mannix, not Maynard, for the altercation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The defendant does not argue in the alternative that a potential conflict of interest existed. If a conflict is only \u201cpotential,\u201d a defendant must demonstrate that he suffered actual prejudice as a result of that conflict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogarty, </em>419 Mass. 456, 459 (1995). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>396 Mass. 549, 559 (1986), and cases cited. The defendant does not argue that he suffered actual prejudice as a result of CPCS\u2019s simultaneous representation of Thompson on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Both victims were young and pretty, and lived in neighboring towns. In addition, the victims were murdered within weeks of each other, possibly around the same time, and had been stabbed to death. The fact that the defendant falsely identified himself to the police as \u201cJames Thompson\u201d is an odd coincidence, but of no significance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
