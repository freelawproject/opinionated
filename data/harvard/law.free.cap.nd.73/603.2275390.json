J. Lord was the owner of the W-J of the NE|: of Section 28, twp. 158, range 66 in Towner County. The taxes levied for 1931 became delinquent and the land was sold to the county in December, 1932, and a tax sale certificate issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">On or about September 1, 1932, the owner mortgaged the land to the Security-First National Bank of Los Angeles as trustees under the last will and testament of Charles Grandison Reynolds, and the mortgage was recorded October 5, 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">It is stipulated that subsequent taxes were levied against this property as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">1931 \u2014 $49.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">1932\u2014 42.72</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">1933\u2014 33.78</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">1934\u2014 37.04</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-14\">1935 \u2014 $38.68</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-15\">1936\u2014 28.26</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-16\">1937\u2014 34.30</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-17\">1938\u2014 32.66</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">and that the county auditor \u201cin preparing the notice of expiration of the period of redemption . . . added to the face of those taxes the interest and penalty accrued to the time of the notice with the result that the taxes as therein computed were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>1931 $83.79; 1932 $58.13; 1933 $43.87; 1934 $45.80; 1935 $45.-43; 1936 $31.44; 1937 $35.85, making a total of $344.31.\u201d There is some confusion in the stipulation as to the taxes levied' in 1938, so we do not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">On January 10, 1939, the county auditor issued a notice of expiration of the time of redemption from tax sale, the notice stating: \u201cThere is given herewith the descriptions of such parcels of real estate, and set opposite each description is the amount which will be required upon the date of the expiration of the period of redemption to redeem such real estate from such tax sale exclusive of the cost of serving this notice personally upon the owner and the person in possession thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Au0\">This was served personally upon the plaintiff in this case as the occupant of the land in question, and on Vine Lord, the administrator of the estate of O. J. Lord. A notice similar in character was published in January, 1939, and set forth a description of the land involved here, the name of the title owner, and the amount required to redeem, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">Oando Township</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkN9\">Township 158 \u2014 Range 66</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asl\">Title Sec. Amount</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5I\">Owner or reqd. to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUm\">Block Redeem</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmLA\">O. J. Lord, W\u00cd NE| 28 344.31</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">This notice varied in many respects from the notice served upon the administrator and then on the occupant of the land and also added thereto the statement that the amount set opposite the description of the tract sold, as the amount that would be required to redeem from the tax sale, included \u201cthe amount for which the said land was sold, interest and penalty thereon, subsequent delinquent taxes <em>prior to those of the year 1988, </em>and the penalties and interest thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">It is stipulated as follows: \u201cThat exhibit 3 is a certified copy of the original notice of the expiration of the period of redemption in connection with the tax deed proceedings upon which the tax deed exhibit 2 was issued and that this is the only notice served in connection with the tax deed proceedings; that service was made as shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>on the back of the certified copy exhibit 3, and in addition thereto service was made by registered mail on the defendant Frederic P. Reynolds and upon the Security First .National Bank of Los Angeles, who is the original trustee in the mortgage upon which Mr. Reynolds obtained a sheriff\u2019s deed, which will later be offered in evidence; and exhibits 3A and 3B are receipts signed by the Bank of Mr. Reynolds for copies of the Notice of expiration of the period of redemption, and the service as made as shown on the exhibits plus service by registered mail as stipulated constitutes the entire service that was made, and that in addition thereto the notice of expiration of the period of redemption was published in the Cando Herald on January 26-1939 as shown by exhibit 4 now offered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The mortgage was foreclosed February 7, 1940, and certificate of sale issued to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The county' presented its tax sale certificate to the auditor, demanding a deed, and on October 1, 1940, the auditor issued a tax deed reciting that the deed was made by him as county auditor to Towner County, a municipal corporation; that the land had been sold to the county at tax sale for the sum of $52.55 and a tax sale certificate was issued to the county, that the time fixed by law for redeeming from the tax sale had expired, that no redemption had been made, and that the taxes with interest and penalty and cost now amounted to $346.62.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">December 5, 1940, the county sold this land to the plaintiff herein, giving a deed which recited that it was made \u201cbetween the County of Towner, North Dakota, party of the first part, acting by and through the Chairman of its Board of County Commissioners and its County Auditor, and H. B. Baeverstad, Cando, N. D., party of the second part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">It recited that the property had been offered for sale November 19, 1940, \u201cand no bid was received for same and said second party became the purchaser of the whole thereof for the sum of Six Hundred and no/100 Dollars.\u201d It is stipulated plaintiff \u201cis in possession of the land and using it for whatever purposes it is usable for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">February 13, 1941, the sheriff\u2019s deed to said property was issued to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">In July, 1941, the plaintiff commenced this action to quiet title to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the land in himself. He alleged that the defendant\u2019s claimed estates and interest therein were adverse to him and asked that the same be adjudged null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The defendant, as the trustee of the last will .and testament of Reynolds, answered, setting forth that he was the purchaser at the foreclosure proceedings and had received the sheriff\u2019s deed. The answer further alleges that the county took a tax deed to the land without giving the defendant an opportunity to redeem according to law, and that the notice of the expiration of the period of redemption \u201cdid not specify the proper or correct amount which was required to prevent the said lands from going to tax deed . . . the public officials . . . gave public notice which specified amounts greatly in excess of those amounts which were legally required to be paid to effect such redemption.\u201d It further alleges that the sale made to the plaintiff herein \u201cwas in all things irregular and void.\u201d ' He alleges the land was excessively assessed and taxed and asks the court to determine the proper amount of taxes which should have been legally charged as taxes. There are other allegations not necessary to set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">We are not concerned with the allegations that the land had been excessively assessed and taxed, nor with the demand that the court determine the proper amount of tax which should have been levied. The county is not a party to this action, nor are its interests in the land under the tax deed or the tax proceedings affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The plaintiff replied on November 1, 1941, alleging among other things that defendant had not made a deposit with the clerk of the court of an amount equal to what the plaintiff had paid to the county for the land, to wit: six hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">On February 3, 1942, the plaintiff moved the court \u201cfor an order requiring the defendant to deposit with the Clerk of the above named court, . . . the sum of $600.00, the amount paid by plaintiff to the county for the purchase of the property described in the complaint, together with an amount sufficient to pay the plaintiff\u2019s statutory costs of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">On February 19, 1942, the plaintiff made an amended reply alleging failure to make this deposit of six hundred dollars and that the tax title of the county \u201cwas based upon taxes for the years 1931, 1932, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>1933, and 1934,\u201d and that the county \u201cacquired such title on October 1, 1940.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">After the hearing on this motion to require a deposit, an order was made on March 24, 1942, requiring the defendant to make a deposit of an amount \u201csufficient to cover the unpaid taxes against this land to date together with penalty, interest and all subsequent taxes paid and interest thereon together with all costs and expenses connected with the tax proceeding not to exceed Six Hundred Dollars; that he should also pay into the Court as his deposit a reasonable amount to cover costs which amount is hereby fixed at Twenty-five Dollars to cover said costs and disbursements.\u201d It is stipulated that at this hearing the taxes with penalty and interest were computed to March 26, 1942, and it was found these amounted to $521.55 and thereafter the court required a deposit of this amount, and of $25.00 to cover costs \u2014 $546.55 in all\u2014 and this amount was deposited. There is nothing in the record to show any exception taken by the plaintiff as to the amount fixed by this order upon his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">It is stipulated that on December 1, 1941, the defendant tendered to the county auditor a certified check in payment of the taxes on the land in the sum of $452.45, which was rejected. There is no dispute but what this sum was ample to cover all of the taxes assessed against that land and due up to that time, with penalty and interest, and no exception is taken to the fact that the offer was made by means of a certified check, the only objection being that it was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Upon trial, the court found for the defendant, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cThat no sufficient notice of the expiration of the period of redemption from the tax sale of said premises was ever given or served; that said notice did not substantially comply with the law and did not substantially set forth the amount required to redeem; that the tax deed issued to Towner County is void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201cThat the defendant Frederic P. Reynolds as trustee under the last will and testament of Charles Grandison Reynolds, deceased, is entitled to redeem the said premises upon payment of the amount of the taxes from 1931 to 1939, inclusive; that the value of the use and occupancy of said premises by the plaintiff offsets the taxes against the said premises for the years 1941, 1942 and 1943.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The order for judgment required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">\u201cThat the Clerk of this Court, out of the moneys deposited by the defendant, Frederic P. Reynolds, as trustee under the last will and testament of Charles Grandison Reynolds, deceased, shall pay the taxes upon said land for the years 1942 and 1943 if the same shall not have been paid by the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201cThat the clerk from said funds, shall pay to the plaintiff the sum of Four Hundred Eighty One and 82/100 Dollars, less such amount as he shall be required to pay under Paragraph I of this order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201cThat upon making such payment the title of the defendant, Frederic P. Reynolds, as trustee under the last will and testament of Charles Grandison Reynolds, deceased, to said premises be quieted and that the plaintiff be adjudged to have no title to nor interest in or lien or encumbrance upon the said premises and that the tax deed to Town-er County and the deed from Towner County to the plaintiff be adjxidged null and void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\u201cThat any surplus remaining in the hands of the clerk from the deposit aforesaid be refunded to the defendant, Frederic P. Reynolds, as trustee under the last will and testament of Charles Grandison Reynolds, deceased.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">From the judgment entered in conformity therewith, the plaintiff appeals, specifying errors of law only and demanding a \u201cre-examination and review of the questions involving such errors of law and a retrial in the Supreme Court of the case as provided by law, in so far as a re-examination and review and retrial of the questions involving such errors of law require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">These errors of law are set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">\u201c1. The right of the Court to grant any relief to the respondent without first requiring him to deposit with the Clerk an amount equal to the purchase price paid by the appellant with costs as per statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">\u201c2. Sufficiency of the notice of expiration of period of redemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">\u201c3. If the notice is defective, then the amount the respondent is required to pay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">With reference to the first specification of error, the majority of the court, not including the writer, determines that this provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>\u00a7 21, chap 286 of the Sess. Laws of 1941, to wit: \u201cThat whenever any action at law or in equity is brought to test the validity of any deed issued and delivered by the county to the purchaser of lands acquired through tax deed proceedings, the Court shall not proceed with the trial of such action until the party assailing the validity of such deed, shall, within the time required by the Court, deposit with the Clerk thereof, for the benefit of the party claiming title under such deed, an amount equal to the sum paid by such party to the county for the purchase of the property covered by such deed, together with an amount sufficient to pay the defendant\u2019s statutory costs of the action, to be determined by the order of the Court,\u201d applies to the case at bar and that therefore the defendant should have been required to deposit the sum of six hundred dollars for the benefit of the plaintiff. We have had occasion to consider a somewhat similar provision in chap 235, Sess. Laws 1939 (Messer v. Henlein, 72 ND 63, 68, 4 NW(2d) 587, 590) and therein show that such a provision \u201cmerely provides that the action shall not proceed\u201d until the one assailing the deed makes the required deposit. This rule applies to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Such requirement is not a jurisdictional prerequisite. The statute is for the benefit of the one claiming under the deed. He need not demand a deposit, nor require the entire amount to be deposited, and he could have waived the entire deposit had he seen fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The plaintiff, in his reply of November 1, 1941, alleged no deposit had been made; but at that time no deposit had been required by him and the case was not on trial then. February 2 thereafter the plaintiff applied to a judge of the district court for an order requiring a deposit of six hundred dollars and on February 19 thereafter made an amended reply, reiterating failure to make the deposit. March 24, this judge fixed the amount to be deposited at $521.55 which sum was deposited. October 28 thereafter the case came on for trial before a judge other than the one who heard the motion. The plaintiff did not call the attention of the trial court to the amount actually deposited. He did not ask the court not to hear defendant\u2019s counterclaim until a further deposit was made. Even if the trial court knew as a fact that only $521.55 had been deposited, he had a right to assume this was satisfactory to the plaintiff. This court holds the plaintiff acquiesced in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>amount that was ordered and was deposited and he cannot raise the question now.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">As shown by Kelsch v. Miller, ante, 405, 15 NW(2d) 433, 155 ALR 1186, the amount which the redempt-ioner would be required to pay in order to redeem would be the amount for which the land was sold \u2014 that is, the taxes for 1931 and costs \u2014 and the amount due on all subsequent tax sale certificates due to the county, provided these subsequent certificates had been issued more than three years before the notice of expiration of the period of redemption. The county auditor therefore had the right to include in the notice of the expiration of time of redemption the. taxes for the years 1932 to 1934 inclusive. The taxes for the year 1935 would become delinquent in 1936 and therefore would not be delinquent for three years prior to the notice of expiration of the time of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">A subsequent tax sale certificate is deemed issued to the county each year after the first tax sale, for each subsequent year in which taxes become delinquent. Thus, we assume that in addition to the tax sale certificate received by the county in 1932 on the sale for the taxes of 1931 there were tax certificates issued for the taxes levied for the years 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, and 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">But for taxes which were levied in 1935 and became delinquent in 1936, and for taxes levied in 1936 which would become delinquent in 1937, and for taxes for the year 1937 which would become delinquent in 1938, while tax certificates would be issued to the county, the redemptioner would have the right to redeem from them any time up to three years from the time of the issuance of these tax certificates. He had the right to insist on partial redemption and make subsequent redemption on these later certificates of sale. Thus he would not be required to pay for any delinquent tax subsequent to the tax of 1934 which became delinquent in 1935. We need not quote from this case cited. We follow the rule set down therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The notice which was served upon him as shown by the record included the taxes for the years 1935, 1936, and 1937, and there was nothing in the notice showing their amount so as to inform defendant of the true amount necessary for redemption. He is entitled to know from the notice the amount of delinquency for each year as the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>\u201cdelinquent taxes\u201d implies in such case as this taxes on which certificates had been issued for more than three years prior to the service of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The amount specified in the notice, under the stipulated facts, included subsequent taxes for which tax sale certificates were issued, and for which the rights of redemption had not expired so as to entitle the county to deed or deeds. A defect which vitiates the notice of expiration of redemption, so as not to acquaint the redemptioner with the proper amount necessary to redeem, renders the tax deed issued thereon void. See Hodges v. McCutcheon, 72 ND 150, 5 NW(2d) 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The court was correct in holding that the defendant did not have proper notice and as the statutory requirements with reference to notice of the expiration of time of redemption must be followed strictly (Messer v. Henlein, supra) we hold the notice invalid and therefore the tax deed was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The third proposition set forth as an issue of law deals with the amount which the defendant is required to pay. As pointed out, the defendant was required to deposit with the clerk of the court for the benefit of the plaintiff $521.55, instead of the $600.00 which the plaintiff had paid to the county, or $78.45 less than the amount demanded by the plaintiff. In view of the holding of this court that the plaintiff has waived the deposit of this extra $78.45, we determine merely the status of the $521.55 that was deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The fact that the judge, who ordered the deposit, proceeded on the theory the plaintiff could recover only the amount of taxes that were due at the time the county sold the land to him with interest and penalty is not controlling. In the view of the majority of the court, not including the writer, the plaintiff is entitled to the deposit even though he failed to show any valid deed, as the defendant by his counterclaim assailed the validity of the deed and this deposit is required to reimburse the plaintiff for what he paid to the county. Therefore, the plain - tiff is entitled to the full amount of the $521.55 deposited. The trial court required the clerk to pay but $481.82. The judgment should be amended in this respect and the clerk be required to pay the whole sum to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The trial court, as a pre-requisite to judgment for the defendant, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>quired the defendant to pay the unpaid taxes upon the land for the years 1942 and 1943, this to be paid out of the deposit. The defendant has not appealed and so the requirement of the district court that he pay the taxes before having title to the land quieted in him is affirmed. However, this payment is not to be made out of the deposit. It is an extra payment to be paid to the county on taxes due.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The district court, in computing the amount of deposit which the defendant would be required to make under the provisions of chap. 286 of the Sess. Laws of 1941, included the amount of twenty-five dollars which the defendant was required to deposit to cover the statutory costs to which the plaintiff would be entitled if he recovered judgment. The trial court found that the plaintiff had no title to or interest in the land; hence his action would be dismissed. This judgment being affirmed, the defendant is entitled to the return of this amount, as plaintiff can not recover statutory costs on the trial of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">But the plaintiff, having received a substantial benefit by his appeal over the counterclaim of the defendant, is entitled to costs in this court. The clerk of the district court therefore will compute and enter defendant\u2019s costs upon the trial in the lower court, and also enter judgment for the plaintiff for the statutory costs upon the appeal. If appellant\u2019s costs, to which he is entitled, exceed those to which the respondent is entitled, then the deposit of twenty-five dollars will go to the appellant and judgment will be entered against the defendant for the remainder. If respondent\u2019s costs exceed those of appellant, then the amount of the appellant\u2019s costs as entered will be deducted from the twenty-five dollars and the remainder will be returned to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">As thus modified, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b631-7\">Nuessle and Morris, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b631-8\">Christianson, Oh.

I concur in the principles stated in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the syllabus and in those portions of the opinion prepared by Judge Burr to which those paragraphs relate.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">I do not agree, however, with those portions of the opinion relating to the order of the Trial Court requiring the Defendant to make a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>posit. In my opinion the provisions of \u00a7 21* chap 286, Laws 1941 requiring a deposit in certain cases do not apply to this case, and the order of the Trial Court requiring a deposit to be made was more favorable to the plaintiff than the law warranted. Chapter 286, Laws 1941 is a comprehensive enactment prescribing the procedure whereby a county may acquire tax deeds for lands that have been sold to it for delinquent taxes. It provides for the forms of notices of expiration of the period of redemption, and for the method of service of such notices. ND Rev. Code 1943, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, \u00a7\u00a7 57-2801 to 57-2807.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">It provides that after the expiration of the period of redemption, tax deed shall be issued to the county (in the name of the state as grantor) in the same manner as tax deeds are issued to individual purchasers at tax sales. Laws 1941, chap 286, \u00a7 9; ND Rev Code 1943, \u00a7 57-2801; Buman v. Sturn, ante, 561, 16 NW(2d) 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">It further provides for the classification and appraisal of such lands, for an annual public sale by the county of lands acquired by it pursuant to tax deed proceedings, for notice of such sale, for the manner of conducting the sale, and terms of the sale. Laws 1941, chap 286^ \u00a7.\u00a7 10-14, ND Rev Code 1943, \u00a7\u00a7 57-2810 to 57-2815.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The statute also prescribes the form of deed which the county shall execute and deliver to the purchaser.

Obviously, controversies may arise as to the validity of such deed, as for instance, in situations like that disclosed in Dockter v. Sheridan County, 72 ND 607, 10 NW(2d) 485, where the question arose as to whether the bidder at the public sale had acquired rights as a purchaser or whether the bid which he had made was rendered ineffective because of failure to make timely payment, so that no contract resulted, and the county still retained whatever interest it had in the land and, hence, had the right to sell the same to another party at private sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The statute provides for two different deeds: (1) The deed <em>to the county </em>for the land acquired by the county pursuant to tax deed proceedings; and (2) The deed <em>from the county </em>to a purchaser of the land which the county has acquired through tax deed proceedings. These are different contracts, between different parties. The deed from the state to the county is one thing and the deed by the county to one who purchases from it is quite another. The validity of one is not dependent upon the validity of the other. The validity of a deed is not dependent upon whether there are defects in the grantor\u2019s title to the property conveyed. The right of the county to sell lands to which it has acquired tax title is not dependent upon whether the deed which the county has received is valid. The deed from the county to the purchaser, if executed and delivered as prescribed by the law, is valid and will convey all the interest that the county has in the land, even though the tax deed from the state to the county is invalid. Buman v. Sturn, ante, 561, 16 NW(2d) 837. See also State ex rel. McKenzie v. Casteel, 110 Ind 174, 181, 182, 11 NE 219, 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">As applied to a deed or other contract \u201cvalid\u201d means \u201cof binding force or <em>legal </em>sufficiency.\u201d Morrison v. Farmers &amp; Traders\u2019 State Bank, 70 Mont 146, 225 P 123, 125; Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary. \u201cA deed, will, or other instrument, which has received all the formalities required by law, is said to be valid.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. Web<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>ster\u2019s New International Dictionary says that in the nomenclature of the law \u201cvalidity\u201d means: \u201cLegal strength, force, or authority; that quality of a thing which renders it supportable in law or equity; legal sufficiency; as, <em>validity </em>of a will, contract.\u201d The term \u201cvalidity of a will\u201d includes \u201conly questions of the genuineness of the instrument and the testamentary capacity of the testator, including his freedom from all restraint and undue influence, and not questions as to the operation of the will.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 3d ed p 1797.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The provision for a deposit originated in chapter 235, Laws 1939. That statute related to and prescribed the proceedings to be had, the notices of expiration of the period of redemption to be issued and served, in tax deed proceedings as to lands that had been bid in by the county for delinquent taxes, and for the sale of lands acquired by the county pursuant to proceedings had under the statute. That statute also prescribed the form of deed to be executed and delivered by the county to purchasers of lands which the county had acquired pursuant to such tax deed proceedings, and provided that, whenever in any action at law or in equity, the validity of any such \u201cdeed is questioned, upon the pleadings or otherwise, such action shall not proceed until the party assailing such deed shall within such time as the court shall deem reasonable deposit in court for the benefit of the party claiming thereunder, an amount equal to the sum paid by said party to the county for the purchase of the property\u201d covered by the deed together with costs and disbursements of the action then incurred by the party claiming under such deed. Laws 1939, p 298. This provision in the laws of 1935 was expressly repealed by Laws 1941, chapter 286, \u00a7 23, and in place thereof, there was inserted in said chapter 286 the above quoted \u00a7 21. It will be noted that there is a striking difference between the provisions of \u00a7 21, chapter 286, Laws 1941 and 'the provisions relating to the same matter in chapter 235, Laws 1939. Under the 1939 law, the requirement for a deposit became applicable whenever in any action the validity of the deed was \u201cquestioned, upon the pleadings or otherwise;\u201d but under \u00a7 21, chapter 286, Laws 1941, the requirement for a deposit is made applicable only \u201cWhenever <em>any action ... is brought to test the validity of any deed issued and delivered by the county to the purchaser of lands acquired through tax deed proceed</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>ings.\u201d </em>In other words, under the 1939 law, the requirement for a deposit was not restricted to an action \u201cbrought to test the validity\u201d of a deed; it applied in any action whenever \u201cthe validity\u201d of a deed from the county to a purchaser was \u201cquestioned, upon the pleadings or otherwise.\u201d Under the 1941 law, however, the requirement for a deposit applies only in an action that \u201cis brought to test the validity of any deed issued and delivered by the county to the purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The character, form and object of an action is to be determined from the essential allegations of the complaint. 1 CJS 1076, 1087. This action does not purport to have been \u201cbrought to test the validity of any deed issued and delivered by the county to the purchaser of lands acquired through tax deed proceedings.\u201d There are no allegations in the complaint to indicate that the validity of the deed that was issued and delivered by the county to the purchaser is in any manner questioned, nor is the validity of such deed questioned by any allegations of fact in the answer. The answer, however, does question the validity of the tax deed that was executed and delivered to the county, and that deed, as is held in the opinion prepared by Judge Burr, is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Section 21, chapter 286, Laws 1941 does not require a defendant in an action to determine adverse claims to make a deposit as a condition precedent to the right to assert as a defense that a tax deed that was executed and delivered to the county is invalid. According to the clear language of the statute, such deposit is required only in an action that is brought to test the validity of a deed given by the county to the purchaser.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b636-6\">Burke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGJ\">(Dissenting in part.) Before proceeding with the trial of this case the plaintiff moved the trial court to require the defendant to deposit in court a sum equal to the amount that plaintiff had paid to the County for its tax title together with an additional sum for costs to be fixed by the court. This motion rested upon \u00a7 21, chapter 286, Laws of 1941, ND Kev Code \u00a7 57-4510, which reads as follows: \u201cWhenever any action at law or in equity is brought to test the validity of any deed issued and delivered by the county to the purchaser of lands acquired through tax deed proceedings, the court shall not proceed with the trial of such action until the party assailing the validity of such deed, within the time required by the court, shall deposit with the clerk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>thereof, for the benefit of the party claiming title under such deed, an amount equal to the sum paid by such party to the county for the purchase of the property covered by such deed, together with an amount sufficient to pay defendant\u2019s statutory costs of the action, to be determined by the order of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The defendant resisted the motion upon the ground that the above section was repugnant to the state constitution. The trial court in effect overruled the motion but required the defendant to deposit in court a sum equal to the amount of the taxes delinquent at the time the county acquired title.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">1 am satisfied that any attack which challenges the title purported to be conveyed by the county\u2019s deed to the purchaser of land acquired through tax proceedings is an attack upon the validity of that deed. \u201cAn official sale, an order, judgment, or decree may be regular.\u00bb The whole practice in reference to its entry may be correct, but still invalid for reasons going behind the regularity of its forms. But when we say a judgment, decree, or sale is valid, it fully excludes the idea that it is void for any reason.\u201d Sharpleigh v. Surdam (CC) 1 Flipp 472, Fed Cas No. 12,711.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Without taking further exception the plaintiff went to trial on the merits. This act is considered by the majority of the court to be a waiver of the right to specify the ruling of the trial court upon this motion as error on appeal. I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In this case the amount paid by the plaintiff for the land was more than the amount of the delinquent taxes and in substituting the amount of the taxes as the measure of defendant\u2019s deposit, the trial court denied the plaintiff a substantial right, if the statute is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">ND Rev Oode \u00a7 28-1802 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">\u201cIn all trials in the district court and county court of increased jurisdiction the following matters shall be deemed excepted to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">1.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">2.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-12\">3. An interlocutory order or decision finally determining the rights of the parties or some of them; . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">I think plaintiff protected his record adequately by affirmatively seeking his rights under the statute, that the order denying him the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>full protection thereof is deemed excepted to by the provisions of \u00a7 28\u2014 1802, supra, and that we should consider the specification that this order was error. However, a majority of the court has held otherwise and under the rule adopted I agree with the disposition of the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
