MONTOYA TO CONFIRMATION OF PLAN\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Edward J. Coleman, III, Chief Judge\n   Before the Court is the objection (dckt. 36) filed by\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   creditor Orlando A. Montoya (\"Montoya\") to confirmation of the Chapter 13 plain (dckt. 4) filed by William B. Spinks (the \"Debtor\"). This is the Debtor's second Chapter 13 case. In the Debtor's first case, filed on April 2, 2015, Montoya claimed priority treatment for unpaid wages pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4), which requires such wages to have been earned within 180 days prior to the bankruptcy filing or to the debtor's cessation of operations. Before the Debtor completed payments under the plan, his 2015 case was dismissed on October 10, 2017. Ten days later, on October 20, 2017, the Debtor filed a second Chapter 13 case, in which Montoya was unable to claim priority treatment for the remaining unpaid wages because they were not earned within the 180-day \"lookback\" period. Montoya contends that this lookback period should be equitably tolled for the pendency of the Debtor's first bankruptcy case to allow his claim as a priority wage claim. For the reasons set forth below, the Court will overrule Montoya's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and the Standing Order of Reference signed by then Chief Judge Anthony A.

FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts in this case are not in dispute. From March 18, 2014, to January 8, 2015, Montoya worked for the Debtor as a tour guide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Montoya's employment ended, the Debtor owed him a total of $1,125.00 in unpaid wages for the months of October, November, and December of 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Montoya sued the Debtor in magistrate court, but his collection efforts were interrupted when, on April 2, 2015, the Debtor filed a Chapter 13 petition (2015 dckt. 1), commencing Case No. 15-40495-MJK (the \"first case\"). On May 7, 2015, Montoya filed a proof of claim in the amount of $1,125.00, consisting of $1,072.50 for which he claimed priority treatment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) and $52.50 in nonpriority wages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2015 Claim 7-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court entered an order confirming the Debtor's Chapter 13 plan on January 8, 2016. (2015 Dckt. 62). On October 10, 2017, the first case was dismissed (2015 dckt. 90) because the Debtor defaulted\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   under the terms of a consent order (2015 dckt. 87) entered on July 31, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Chapter 13 Standing Trustee's Final Report and Account (2015 dckt. 92), Montoya received a total of $199.36 in the Debtor's first case. Before Montoya could resume his state court remedies to collect the remaining $925.64, the Debtor filed a second Chapter 13 petition (dckt. 1) on October 20, 2017, commencing Case No. 17-41579-EJC (the \"second case\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same day, the Debtor filed a Chapter 13 plan, pursuant to which all \u00a7 507 claims would be paid in full over the life of the plan. (Dckt. 4). The plan, however, does not treat Montoya's claim as a priority claim. As amended, the Debtor's plan proposes to pay general unsecured creditors with allowed claims a minimum total of $19,219.00, resulting in a dividend of approximately 75%. (Dckt. 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 1, 2017, Montoya filed a proof of claim in the second case in the amount of $925.64. (Claim 2-1). Attached to the proof of claim, which was filed on an outdated form, were a series of emails between Montoya and the Debtor, a document entitled \"Disbursement History by Claim ID\" listing the disbursements to Montoya in the first case, and a letter from Montoya to the Court. (Claim 2-1, pp. 3-11). Pursuant to a deficiency notice entered that same day, Montoya was directed to file an amended proof of claim on a current form. (Dckt. 25). On December 13, 2017, Montoya filed an amended proof of claim on Official Form 410. (Claim 2-2). Question 12 on this form asks whether all or part of the claim is entitled to priority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Montoya, however, did not check the box for priority treatment because his unpaid wages were not earned within 180 days before the\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   case, and he did not want to make a false statement on the form under penalty of perjury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 9, 2018, Montoya filed the instant objection to confirmation (dckt. 36) on the basis that the Debtor's Chapter 13 plan \"reduces [Montoya's] wage claim to a non-priority status for no reason other than the Debtor's failure to comply with this court's order in the 2015 bankruptcy and Debtor's subsequent filing of another bankruptcy in 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    at p. 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Laura Grifka, counsel for the Chapter 13 Trustee, stated that the Chapter 13 Trustee does not believe Montoya's claim is entitled to priority status. The Debtor's counsel represented that the Debtor would not object to Montoya's claim as a priority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 2, 2018, a consent order on confirmation, which contained the following provision, was entered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   The Objection Of Orlando A.

If necessary, the Plan payment shall increase to pay the claim per the Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    At the hearing held on March 27, 2018, Montoya was unable to state with certainty whether he worked for the Debtor individually or for the Debtor's company, The Savannah Walks, Inc. He could not recall whether the Debtor ever paid him in the form of a personal check or ever sent him a W-2 or Form 1099. In any event, the Debtor's counsel represented that the Debtor would not object to Montoya's claim on the grounds that the wages were owed by an entity other than the Debtor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    According to Montoya, he quit on January 8, 2015.

(Dckt. 7, p. 2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Pursuant to the consent order, the Debtor was required to make monthly payments to the Chapter 13 Trustee in the amount of $585.00 beginning in August of 2017, with payments made under strict compliance for a period of eighteen months from entry of the consent order. (2015 Dckt. 87, pp. 1-2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Because the Debtor's first case was dismissed within one year before his second case was filed, the automatic stay ordinarily would have terminated on the thirtieth day after the filing of the second case.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(3)(A). On October 20, 2017, however, the Debtor moved to extend the stay under \u00a7 362(c)(3)(B). (Dckt. 7). No objections were filed, and the Court granted the Debtor's motion on November 7, 2017.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    The sole issue before the Court is whether to equitably toll the 180-day lookback period of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(4). Section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code\"sets forth 10 categories of claims that are entitled to be paid ahead of a debtor's general body of unsecured creditors.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Norwalk Furniture Corp.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4128043\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/418/631/#p634\">\n     418 B.R. 631\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 634 (Bankr.

The problem for Montoya is that his unpaid wages were not earned within 180 days before October 20, 2017, the date the Debtor filed the petition in the second case.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    Thus, under the plain language of \u00a7 507(a)(4), Montoya's claim is not entitled to priority status.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    As Montoya points out, however, the automatic stay provisions of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) prohibited him from pursuing any collection efforts against the Debtor between the filing of the Debtor's petition in the first case on April 2, 2015, and the dismissal of that case on October 10, 2017.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Accordingly, Montoya requests that the Court equitably toll the 180-day lookback period for the pendency of the Debtor's first bankruptcy case. \"The doctrine of equitable tolling applies to periods of limitation in appropriate circumstances. It permits a court to suspend the measuring period for a party to take action during the time the party was unable to act.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     Tidewater Fin.

D. Md. 2005). In other words, Montoya contends that the period from April 2, 2015, through October 10, 2017, should not count against the 180-day lookback period. If the Court equitably tolls this period, then a portion of Montoya's wages, which\n    <em>\n     were\n    </em>\n    earned within 180 days before the\n    <em>\n     first\n    </em>\n    case, would still be entitled to priority status in the second case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    This appears to be a matter of first impression, as Montoya does not cite, and the Court has not found, any cases in which a bankruptcy court addressed the issue of equitable tolling in the context of the 180-day lookback period of a \u00a7 507(a)(4) wage claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    Numerous courts, however, have addressed equitable tolling in connection with priority tax claims under \u00a7 507(a)(8), and these cases may assist the Court in resolving the present issue. Thus, the Court will briefly survey the history of equitable tolling of priority tax claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Section 507(a)(8) provides in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    (a) The following expenses and claims have priority in the following order:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    (8) Eighth, allowed unsecured claims of governmental units, only to the extent that such claims are for -\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    (A) a tax on or measured by income or gross receipts for a taxable year ending on or before the date of the filing of the petition -\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    (i) for which a return, if required, is last due, including extensions, after three years before the date of the filing of the petition ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(8)(A)(i). In other words, unpaid income taxes are entitled to priority status so long as the tax returns were due less than three years before the date the bankruptcy petition was filed. Further, \u00a7 523(a)(1)(A) renders such priority tax debts nondischargeable, stating:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    (a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt-\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    (1) for a tax or a customs duty-\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    (A) of the kind and for the periods specified in section 507(a)(3) or 507(a)(8) of this title, whether or not a claim for such tax was filed or allowed ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1)(A).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Prior to the seminal case of\n    <em>\n     Young v.

Although the Court has no reason to doubt that Montoya pursued his rights diligently by suing the Debtor in magistrate court, he fails to establish any extraordinary or exceptional circumstances. The relevant obstacle precluding Montoya's collection efforts was the automatic stay of \u00a7 362(a), which is \"one of the fundamental debtor protections in the Bankruptcy Code ... giv[ing] the debtor a 'breathing spell' from creditors and stop [ping] all collection efforts, all harassment, and all foreclosure actions.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Lopez,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176469\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/492/595/#p601\">\n     492 B.R. 595\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 601 (Bankr.

Here, although a debtor's good faith or lack thereof is immaterial in \u00a7 507(a)(8)(A)(i) priority tax cases pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Young\n    </em>\n    , the Court notes that Montoya presented no evidence of any bad faith on the Debtor's part in filing back-to-back Chapter 13 petitions. In seeking to extend the stay in the second case, the Debtor's counsel represented that the Debtor defaulted in the first case due to a health issue and to the hurricanes in 2016 and 2017, which affected his tour guide business. (Dckt. 7, p. 2). As to Montoya, he already received payments totaling $199.36 in the Debtor's first case. (2015 Dckt. 92). Moreover, the instant case is unusual in that the Debtor's Chapter 13 plan (dckt. 4) proposes to pay general unsecured creditors a dividend of approximately 75%. Most Chapter 13 debtors pay little or nothing to their general unsecured creditors, and thus even without priority status, Montoya is in a better position than most creditors. Thus, Montoya has not satisfied his burden of showing that the Court should exercise its equitable powers to toll the 180-day lookback period.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Montoya raises a novel argument concerning the Court's ability to equitably toll the 180-day lookback period for wage priority. However, there is no precedent under \u00a7 507(a)(4) for the relief he requests, and in any event he fails to establish that equitable tolling is appropriate in this case. Accordingly, the Court declines to equitably toll the 180-day lookback period. A separate order will be entered consistent with this Opinion.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-89\">\n     There is no indication that the Debtor's business has ceased operations, and thus the petition date is the relevant date for calculating the 180-day lookback period.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-90\">\n     For example, courts have equitably tolled the limitations periods set forth in \u00a7 546(a)(1) and \u00a7 549(d).\n     <em>\n      Gugino v.

March 24, 2003) (\"[T]he rule that the three-year look-back period is tolled during the pendency of a prior bankruptcy case when a subsequent case is filed functions as a\n     <em>\n      per se\n     </em>\n     rule and is not dependent upon any actual equitable considerations that may be advanced ....\");\n     <em>\n      In re Womble,\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9364373\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/289/836/#p853\">\n      289 B.R. 836\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 853 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 2003) (\"The Supreme Court indicated in\n     <em>\n      Young\n     </em>\n     that the motives underlying the previous filing and previous dismissal are immaterial, in which case tolling the one-year lookback period is appropriate per se.\"). The Court is not convinced that\n     <em>\n      Young\n     </em>\n     actually created a\n     <em>\n      per se\n     </em>\n     rule. But even if it did, such rule applies to priority tax claims, and the Court declines to apply it in the context of priority wage claims under \u00a7 507(a)(4).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
