(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hrg. Tr. at 1). With respect to the Motion for Contempt and Sanctions, Appellants' counsel contended that Appellees had violated the automatic stay that was effective as of the bankruptcy petition's filing date or the permanent\n   injunction that replaced it following the discharge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5). Appellants' counsel observed that \"the issue in this case may be pre-petition claims versus post-petition claims\" and argued that the allegations in the state court suit were \"general and vague.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Appellants' counsel also said that \"the issue here ... relate[d] to an objection to the sale of the assets of the estate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Appellants' counsel also argued that \"the interests of the debtors were in the bankruptcy estate\" and that Lemoine had investigated \"claims of fraud and the possibility that there were assets of LA-1 transferred to, to another company[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7). The bankruptcy court confirmed that Appellants had not objected to the sale or appealed from it when it occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). Appellants' counsel also argued that the state court suit \"willfully attacked ... [Abide's] tacit approval\" of the sale, contravening the goals of bankruptcy proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). In response to court questioning, Appellants' counsel reiterated that \"the basis for bankruptcy court jurisdiction\" was Appellees' \"attack on\" the bankruptcy court's judgment and sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During his argument, Appellees' counsel admitted that the state court petition was \"thin\" and reiterated that the state court suit sought recovery only for post-petition claims and was also not attacking the \"sale order.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12). Appellees' counsel argued that, during the sale, Appellees had acquired LA-1's claims concerning \"whatever occurred within LA-1,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the alleged transfer of LA-1's assets, property, and funds, and that these were not claims of the estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14). Appellees' counsel acknowledged that Appellees had not yet filed an amended petition in state court but stated that they were holding off on doing so until the removal and remand issues were resolved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14). In reply, Appellants' counsel emphasized his concern that a state court judge might review whether the bankruptcy court or Abide's actions were \"right.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The bankruptcy court orally denied the Motion for Contempt and Sanctions, noting that Appellees' counsel had repeatedly and consistently clarified that the state court suit challenged only post-petition conduct and that, as a result, the claims in the state court suit had not been discharged in bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In support of the Motion to Remand, Appellees' counsel reiterated that Appellees' claims were claims \"of LA-1\" arising post-petition and, for many of the same reasons addressed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , adjudication of those claims would have no effect on the administration of any bankruptcy estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-26). Appellants' counsel similarly reiterated that the state court suit would permit the state court to review the actions of the bankruptcy court and Abide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28). Appellants' counsel acknowledged during argument, however, that there was \"no objection and the sale [was] final[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28). He argued, however, that under state law a possible remedy for a \"fraudulent sale is the rescission of that sale.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The bankruptcy court granted the Motion to Remand, observing initially that Duncan and Simoneaux \"did not oppose [Abide's] motion to sell their membership interest in LA-1 to [Appellees]\" and did not appeal the order approving the sale to Appellees, and Appellees did not name Abide as a defendant in the state court suit or seek the bankruptcy court's permission to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 35). The bankruptcy court also characterized the state court suit as attacking only post-petition actions by Duncan and Simoneaux. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36). On that basis, the bankruptcy court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction, as the state court suit raised only state law claims unrelated to administration of the\n   bankruptcy estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37). The bankruptcy court ruled that, although LA-1's interest was property of the estate at the time of Duncan and Simoneaux's alleged wrongful acts, it no longer was, and the estate had \"no claim arising out of the alleged misconduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38). The bankruptcy court also noted that Duncan and Simoneaux had received a discharge in bankruptcy, and their pre-petition liabilities were \"gone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The bankruptcy court further ruled that \"discretional\" or \"permissive\" abstention and remand for equitable reasons was appropriate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Appellants' Brief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   According to Appellants, \"[t]he ultimate issue to be decided is whether the [bankruptcy court] erred by finding as a matter of law that [it] lacked jurisdiction over a suit filed in state court attacking a court approved bankruptcy trustee's sale of estate property.\" (Doc. 16 at 6). Appellants contend that the bankruptcy court's rulings amount to \"the allowance of claims against the debtor for actions of [Abide], which occurred during the administration of the estate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Appellants argue that a debtor \"is not a part of those proceedings and therefore cannot be held liable or sued [because] the purchaser is unhappy with what he bought.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Appellants maintain that the bankruptcy court's ruling \"imputes the actions of the [t]rustee and the [bankruptcy court] onto the debtors and allows creditors a way around the discharge and permanent injunction following closure of the case contrary to the intent of Congress and purpose of the bankruptcy code.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9). Appellants reiterate that the sale occurred subsequent to \"the appointment of an attorney to investigate allegations of fraud by [Duncan and Simoneaux],\" and that \"attacking the court approved [t]rustee sale\" is a violation of the permanent injunction effective after discharge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court's rulings allow Appellees to \"undo the sale\" even after an investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellants further maintain that they believed that Abide and Lemoine's involvement \"protected and insulated them from any irregularities of the sale and its process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

Appellees also maintain that the \"substitution and subrogation\" portion of the sale order relinquished to Appellees any rights that the bankruptcy estate or Abide may have had in LA-1's claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). Appellees reiterate that they have not attempted to \"rescind or attack\" the sale.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the heart of this case is a disagreement about the scope and subject matter of the state court suit. Appellants characterize the suit as \"attacking the court approved [t]rustee sale\" or \"question[ing] ... the actions of the trustee and the bankruptcy court,\" emphasize that a debtor is \"not responsible for the actions taken by a trustee pursuant to court order during the administration of the bankruptcy estate,\" fault the state court petition for \"conveniently fail[ing] to mention\" the discharge in bankruptcy or the actions Abide and Lemoine took, contend that allowing remand will \"allow the state court to question whether the bankruptcy court had made the correct decision and whether [Abide] bears responsibility for those decisions,\" and \"object to being forced to defend in state court, the actions of the [t]rustee and the [bankruptcy court] itself.\" (Doc. 16 at 6, 9, 13-16). The bankruptcy court rejected the aforementioned characterizations as \"remarkable,\" observing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Appellees' failure to name Abide as a defendant or seek the bankruptcy court's permission to do so. (Hrg. Tr. at 35). The bankruptcy court ruled that the state court petition \"attack[ed] the debtors only and attack[ed] only their conduct postpetition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After reviewing the state court petition and the proceedings before the bankruptcy court, this Court agrees with Appellees. The state court petition challenges only Duncan and Simoneaux's actions in allegedly mismanaging or diminishing the assets of LA-1, not anything that Abide or the bankruptcy court did. Adversary Proceeding, Doc. 1-1 at 7-9. Abide is not named as a party in that suit and, as the bankruptcy court correctly noted, leave of court would likely have been required to so name her. (Hrg. Tr. at 35);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villegas v. Schmidt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222340,4230188\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/156/\">\n    788 F.3d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (5th Cir. 2015) (leave of court generally required before bringing suit against bankruptcy trustee). Appellees have also repeatedly disclaimed any intent to seek rescission of the sale. (Doc. 18 at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Similarly, Appellants argue that the state court petition \"cites alleged conduct of [Duncan and Simoneaux] as far back as\n   October 22, 2015,\" (Doc. 16 at 10), but, as the Court noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , that date is described in the state court petition as the date on which LA-1 was \"created,\" not the date on which any of the actions actually at issue in the state court suit occurred. The bankruptcy court correctly rejected the advancement of that date as a basis for jurisdiction as \"a red herring.\" (Hrg. Tr. at 34-35). Moreover, Appellees have repeatedly and expressly limited their claims to post-petition conduct and set forth in fairly specific terms the conduct giving rise to their claims. Adversary Proceeding, Doc. 1-1 at 7-9; Bankruptcy Petition, Docs. 116 &amp; 116-1. The bankruptcy court did not err in concluding that the state court suit was so delimited. Whether the state court suit is likely to succeed in light of its limited scope is generally beyond the scope of the Court's inquiry at this stage. 1 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 3.01(3)(e)(ii) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Of course, \"related to\" jurisdiction sweeps broadly, and can encompass even attenuated, hypothetical effects of litigation.\n   <em>\n    In re Spillman Dev.

However, considering the posture of this case, this Court agrees with the bankruptcy court that jurisdiction does not exist. As set forth in the numerous cases and treatises cited previously, property that has left the estate typically loses any relationship to the bankruptcy case. 1 Norton Bankr. L. &amp; Prac. 3d \u00a7 4:103 (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Lemco Gypsum, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121634,10538709\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/784/\">\n    910 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   789 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Hall's Motor Transit Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121563,10530141\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/889/520/\">\n    889 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   522 ;\n   <em>\n    Matter of FedPak Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7634099,6465203\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/207/\">\n    80 F.3d at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the sale of Duncan and Simoneaux's interest in LA-1 was approved, and indeed Duncan and Simoneaux received a discharge, months before the state court suit was filed. Additionally, since the state court suit is based on post-petition conduct and is against Duncan and Simoneaux, the claims themselves were never part of Duncan and Simoneaux's estate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hrg. Tr. at 38).
