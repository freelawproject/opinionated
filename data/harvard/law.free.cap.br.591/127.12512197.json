Suffolk OTB is a public benefit corporation organized under Articles V and VI of the New York Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law (the \"Racing Law\"). (Disclosure Statement at 13, Case No. 12-43503-CEC, ECF No. 298.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 11, 2014, Suffolk OTB filed a second amended plan and second amended disclosure statement (the \"Disclosure Statement\"). (Case No. 12-43503-CEC, ECF Nos. 297, 298.) On that same date, the Disclosure Statement was approved. (Case No. 12-43503-CEC, ECF No. 300). Following a hearing on October 22, 2014, the Second Amended Plan for the Adjustment of Debts of Suffolk Regional Off-Track Betting Corporation (the \"Plan\") (Case No. 12-43503-CEC, ECF No. 318) was confirmed (Case No. 12-43503-CEC, ECF No. 326).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Plan provides for construction of a video lottery terminal facility (the \"VLT Facility\"), and the funding and feasibility of the Plan depends on its revenues. (Plan at 1-2, Case No. 12-43503-CEC, ECF No. 318.) The Plan contemplated that the VLT Facility would be constructed in Medford, New York. (Plan at 1-2, Case No. 12-43503-CEC, ECF No. 318.) However, Suffolk OTB subsequently decided to build the VLT Facility in Islandia, New York at the site of the former Marriott Hotel located at 3635 Express Drive North, Islandia, New York 11749 (the \"Location\"). (Status\n   Ltr., Case No. 12-43503-CEC, ECF No. 496.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 12, 2018, the Plaintiffs commenced this action in New York State Supreme Court, Suffolk County (the \"State Court\"), against the Village, the Board, and Delaware North, challenging Local Law No. 3-2017, a zoning amendment enacted by the Village and the Board, which provided the statutory basis for Delaware North (Suffolk OTB's operating partner) to obtain a permit for the construction and operation of the VLT Facility. Suffolk OTB moved to intervene in the action, and upon the State Court's decision and order authorizing Suffolk OTB to intervene as a defendant, Suffolk OTB removed the action to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The following are the relevant allegations of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In November 1994, the Board approved and adopted a zoning master plan entitled the \"Comprehensive Plan for the Village of Islandia, Suffolk County, New York,\" (the \"Master Plan\") which was applicable to the territorial jurisdiction of the Village, and which modified the existing zoning designations into new specialized zones, zoning districts, and district boundaries. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, ECF No. 10-1.) One new district created by the Master Plan was the office/industrial district (the \"District\"), to permit office uses and accessory facilities. (Compl. \u00b6 14, ECF No. 10-1.) Hotels were \"a permitted use by special exception approved by the [ ] Board\" and were not permitted to have multiple uses. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15, ECF No. 10-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Board also adopted Article X of Chapter 177 of the Village of Islandia Code (the \"Village Code\") in furtherance of the Master Plan, which prescribed permitted and non-permitted office and industrial uses of land within the District. (Compl. \u00b6 17, ECF No. 10-1.) Chapter 177 of the Village Code provided that land in the District may be used as a hotel if the Board issued a special permit, which was subject to a public hearing. (Compl. \u00b6 17, ECF No. 10-1.) It also prohibited any land in the District to be used for a gaming purpose. (Compl. \u00b6 18, ECF No. 10-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 1989, the Board approved a special permit authorizing the construction and operation of a hotel (the \"Hotel\") at the Location. (Compl. \u00b6 19, ECF No.10-1.) Delaware North is the current owner of the Hotel and the Location. (Compl. \u00b6 20, ECF No. 10-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The complaint alleges that, in 2016, the Board and Delaware North \"conspired amongst themselves to formulate a plan and scheme to enter into a contract whereby the Village would agree to permit Delaware North [and its affiliates] to use the Hotel as a video lottery terminal ... facility in exchange for Delaware North agreeing to make substantial annual payments to the Village.\" (Compl. \u00b6 22, ECF No. 10-1.) On March 28, 2016, Delaware North applied for a special permit authorizing the construction and use of the VLT Facility, including an off-track betting simulcast facility, as an accessory use of the Hotel (the \"Special Permit Application\"). (Compl. \u00b6 22, ECF No. 10-1.) Although Delaware North intended for the payments to be a gift to the Village, the Village accepted these payments in exchange for the approval of Delaware North's Special Permit Application. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-27, ECF No. 10-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 12, 2016, the Board approved the Special Permit Application and issued the special permit to Delaware North (the \"Special Permit\"). (Compl. \u00b6 28, ECF No. 10-1.) On August 16, 2016, Delaware North and the Village entered into an agreement entitled The Taxpayer Relief Agreement Between the Village of Islandia and Delaware North Islandia Properties, LLC (the\n   \"Agreement\"), memorializing the agreement of Delaware North to make annual payments to the Village. (Compl. \u00b6 30, ECF No. 10-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 13, 2016, the Plaintiffs and others commenced an Article 78 proceeding in State Court, Index. No. 2016-8907, challenging the Special Permit granted by the Board to Delaware North. (Compl. \u00b6 33, ECF No. 10-1.) On September 7, 2017, the State Court issued a decision and order which, among other things, vacated the Special Permit, finding that the VLT Facility, including the off-track betting simulcast facility, is not a permitted accessory use of a hotel in the District under Chapter 177 of the Village Code. (Compl. \u00b6 35, ECF No. 10-1; Compl. Ex. B, State Court Decision at 4-5, ECF No. 10-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After that ruling, the Village and Delaware North modified the Agreement so that the payments to be made by Delaware North thereunder were made in exchange for the Village amending the Village Code to permit the Hotel to be used as a VLT Facility with an off-track betting simulcast facility. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36, 37, ECF No. 10-1.) On November 28, 2017, in furtherance thereof, the Board adopted Local Law No. 3-2017, amending Article X of Chapter 177 of the Village Code, to \"provide for a Hotel/Gaming Facility as a permitted use in the [ ] District,\" thereby permitting the Hotel to be used as a VLT Facility with an off-track betting simulcast facility. (Compl. \u00b6 38, ECF No. 10-1; Compl. Ex. C, Local Law No. 3-2017 \u00a7\u00a7 1.4, 2.2, ECF No. 10-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Pursuant to Local Law No. 3-2017, Delaware North was granted a certificate of occupancy authorizing the use and occupancy of the Hotel as a VLT Facility with an off-track betting simulcast facility. (Compl. \u00b6 41, ECF No.10-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Plaintiffs challenge Local Law No. 3-2017 on the grounds that the Board (1) engaged in unlawful zoning by contract, (2) engaged in spot zoning, and (3) violated the requirement of MHRL \u00a7 23(2)(f) for a mandatory referendum. The Plaintiffs also asserted a claim to vacate the certificate of occupancy and a claim for a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Delaware North, the Village, the Board, and Suffolk OTB (as intervening defendant) moved to dismiss the claim pursuant to MHRL \u00a7 23(2)(f) (the \"Third Cause of Action\"), and the claims seeking vacatur of the certificate of occupancy (the \"Fourth Cause of Action\") and imposition of a permanent injunction (the \"Fifth Cause of Action\"). (Mot. to Dismiss, ECF Nos. 17, 18, 19.) The Plaintiffs opposed the motion. (Opp'n, ECF No. 29.) After a hearing held on July 11, 2018, and for the reasons stated on the record at that hearing, the Court issued an order on August 2, 2018, dismissing the Fourth Cause of Action and the Fifth Cause of Action, and reserving decision on the Third Cause of Action. This decision addresses the Third Cause of Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the \"Rules\"), made applicable to this adversary proceeding pursuant to Rule 7008 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (the \"Bankruptcy Rules\"), requires a pleading to contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\" Fed.

The Plaintiffs argue that\n   <em>\n    Elkind\n   </em>\n   is no longer good law because it pre-dates the enactment of MHRL \u00a7 23, which provides that any local law which abolishes, transfers, or curtails any power of an elected officer is subject to mandatory referendum. The Plaintiffs further argue that Local Law No. 3-2017 was subject to mandatory referendum under MHRL \u00a7 23 because it curtailed the Board's power by completely eliminating the Board's ability \"to determine the use of land in a Village as a casino.\" (Opp'n at 8, ECF No. 29.) The Defendants respond that Local Law No. 3-2017 was not subject to mandatory referendum because it did not abolish, transfer, or curtail the power of the Board -- which position, as will be discussed below, is clearly correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   MHRL \u00a7 23(2)(f) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Except as otherwise provided by or under authority of a state statute, a local law shall be subject to mandatory referendum if it:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   f.

(Opp'n at 8-9, ECF No. 29.) The Defendants argue that Local Law No. 3-2017 did not transfer any power to the building inspector because the Board remains in full and sole control of how a Hotel/Gaming Facility is classified in the local zoning law, consistent with the Board's undisputed authority to \"regulate the location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry residence, or other purposes.\" (Mem. of Law in Supp. at 16, ECF No. 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Contrary to the Plaintiffs' argument, Local Law No. 3-2017 did not abolish, transfer, or curtail the power of any elective official to issue special permits, but rather expanded the powers of the Board. Prior to the enactment of that law, the Board lacked the authority to grant a special permit to a hotel within the District with a gaming facility as an accessory use, as the State Court determined when it vacated the Board's issuance to Delaware North of the Special Permit authorizing the construction and use of the VLT Facility. The State Court found that the approval of a special use permit for a VLT Facility and off-track betting simulcast facility under prior law was beyond the scope of the Board's authority:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   It appears, therefore, not only that the administrative record is devoid of evidence on which the Village Board could properly base a finding that a VLT gaming and [off-track betting] simulcast facility is 'customarily incidental' to a hotel use in the [ ] [D]istrict, but also that no such finding is possible ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Compl. Ex. B, State Court Decision at 6, ECF No. 10-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Board also lacked the ability to approve any gaming use of any land within the District. (Compl. \u00b6 18, ECF No. 10-1.) Local Law No. 3-2017 amended the Village Code to specifically allow a Hotel/Gaming Facility (as defined in Local Law No. 3-2017) as a permitted use in the District (Compl. Ex. C, Local Law No. 3-2017, ECF No. 10-1), thereby expanding the Board's powers. Nothing in the Local Law No. 3-2017 curtailed or otherwise reduced Board's authority to issue special permits under the preexisting law to a hotel without a gaming use. Therefore, Local Law No. 3-2017 was not subject to the mandatory referendum requirement of MHRL \u00a7 23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stokes v.

(Opp'n at 8-9, ECF No. 29.) As discussed above, prior to the enactment of Local Law No. 3-2017, the Board completely lacked the authority to issue special permits to a gaming facility in the District. Nothing in Local Law No. 3-2017 transfers any power from the Board to the building inspector; rather, Local Law No. 3-2017 expanded the power of the Board by authorizing it to approve a Hotel/Gaming Facility as a permitted use in the District. The building inspector's duties are governed by preexisting law, including Village Code \u00a7 177-39, which vests him with the authority to issue certificates of occupancy for permitted uses, whether under Local Law No. 3-2017 or otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The delegation of duties to aid in the management of government, here the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a permitted use, does not abolish, transfer, or curtail the Board's statutory duties.\n   <em>\n    Shields v.

The ultimate power to determine whether a proposed use is a permitted use, or whether a special permit should be issued, remains in the hands of the Board, and therefore, MHRL \u00a7 23 was not implicated by the adoption of Local Law No. 3-2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants' motion to dismiss the Third Cause of Action is granted.
