Is a United States Bankruptcy Court a place where, when it comes to the areas of attorney conduct and non-disclosure, no harm equals no foul? Does ignorance of the law excuse misconduct?

The BK Billing Model\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Gallon is a consumer debtors' attorney based in Miami, Oklahoma. BK Billing, LLC (\"BK Billing\"), a Utah limited liability company, is a finance company that provides factoring services to bankruptcy counsel in Chapter 7 cases. On May 11, 2017, Gallon executed an Accounts Receivable Assignment Agreement (the \"AR Agreement\"), in which he established a factoring arrangement with BK Billing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AR Agreement set up a mechanism where Gallon would sell his accounts receivable for \"post-petition services\" to Chapter 7 consumer debtors based on client contracts that he uploaded to the BK Billing system. Gallon ultimately factored, or sold, 14 client contracts to BK Billing under the AR Agreement (\"the BK Billing Cases\"). Under the original AR Agreement, Gallon agreed to transfer each account receivable in exchange for 70% of the total contractual value of the account, which amount was to be received by Gallon with 2-3 business days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   An amendment executed on July 5, 2017, increased the total amount paid to Gallon upon the submission of an account to 75% of the value of the contract, but lowered the amount immediately available to Gallon to 60%, and set the other 15% aside in an escrow account to be maintained by BK Billing as security for performance of the transferred accounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AR Agreement gives BK Billing the \"right to approve of [Gallon's] form engagement agreement prior to accepting any [accounts].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition,\n   Gallon is obligated to \"cooperate with the collections by BK Billing of the [accounts], including, but not limited to providing evidence reasonably required for any legal action, arbitration, or mediation instituted by BK Billing for collection purposes, and permitting BK Billing to use [Gallon's] name, address, and telephone number for collection purposes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition to the factoring services, BK Billing provided Gallon with various pleadings and templates to effectuate a business model whereby Gallon would enter two separate retention agreements with his clients. The first, executed prior to filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, was for services up to and including filing the petition. The second, executed after the case was filed, was for all remaining services that were rendered to a debtor post-petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At a hearing in these matters, Gallon testified that upon meeting with a new client, if he determined that the client was in need of immediate bankruptcy relief but was unable to pay his fee prior to filing the case, Gallon would present them with the \"BK Billing Model.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Key features of the BK Billing Model include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. The debtors entered into a \"Contract for Pre-Petition Legal Services in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Case\" (the \"Pre-Petition Agreement\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   with Gallon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   B. Under the Pre-Petition Agreement, the debtors were to pay Gallon a specified fee\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   for various pre-petition bankruptcy services, including \"meeting and consulting with [Gallon] as needed,\" a \"detailed analysis of [ ] client questionnaire,\" and \"preparation and filing of a Chapter 7 Voluntary Petition, Statement About Social Security Numbers[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The debtors agreed to pay additional fees for a \"Pre-filing Credit Counseling Briefing Certificate\" and a credit report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   C. The Pre-Petition Agreement gave the debtors the option to pay the Bankruptcy Court filing fee of $335 in full up front, apply to pay it in installments, or request that Gallon pay the fee and seek reimbursement from the debtors at a later time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   D. The Pre-Petition Agreement stated that Gallon's contractual responsibilities would end \"upon completion of the filing of [the] bankruptcy case.\" It also stated that \"the Law Firm will remain professionally obligated to serve as counsel for Client in the case until the Bankruptcy Court allows the Law Firm to formally withdraw.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   E. The Pre-Petition Agreement laid out various options regarding the completion of the debtors' bankruptcy case through discharge. The debtors could 1) retain Gallon under a second retainer agreement to be\n   executed post-petition, where Gallon would complete the case for an additional specified fee;\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   2) seek other counsel to complete the case; or 3) proceed without legal representation, i.e.,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . If the debtors did not choose to retain Gallon for post-petition services within 10 days after filing the bankruptcy petition, they agreed to consent to Gallon's withdrawal as counsel in the case. The Pre-Petition Agreement also placed the responsibility on the debtors to notify their creditors once the bankruptcy case was filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   F. After execution of the Pre-Petition Agreement, Gallon filed what is colloquially referred to as a \"bare-bones\" Chapter 7 petition on behalf of the debtors. That means the documents filed represent the bare minimum necessary to successfully open a bankruptcy case and invoke the automatic stay. In all cases, this consisted of Official Form 101, Voluntary Petition for Individuals Filing for Bankruptcy, required by Rule 1002(a); a Certificate of Counseling, required by Rule 1007(b)(3)(A); a list of creditors, required by Rule 1007(a)(1); and a Verification as to Official Mailing Matrix, required by Rule 1008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the seven cases filed prior to August 24, 2017, the initial filing also included Official Form 106Sum, Summary of Your Assets and Liabilities and Certain Statistical Information, required by Bankr. N.D. Okla. Local Rule 1007-1(G); Official Form 106D, Schedule D: Creditors Who Have Claims Secured by Property, required by Rule 1007(b)(1)(A); Official Form 106E/F, Schedule E/F: Creditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, required by Rule 1007(b)(1)(A); and Official Form 106Dec, Declaration About an Individual Debtor's Schedules, required by Rule 1008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   G. In eleven of the seventeen Captioned Cases, Gallon filed Bankruptcy Form 103A, Application for Individuals to Pay the Filing Fee in Installments (the \"Installment Application\"), on behalf of the debtors, requesting that they be allowed to pay the Court filing fee in installments of $83.75 per month for four months, beginning one month from the date the petition was filed. At the time the Installment Application was filed in each case, the Court had no information regarding the financial condition of the debtors, i.e., no schedules of current income or expenditure had been filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   H. In each of the BK Billing Cases, Gallon and the debtors executed a \"Contract for Post-Petition Legal Services in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Case\" (the \"Post-Petition Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Post-Petition Agreement, the debtors agreed to retain Gallon to represent them in the post-petition proceedings of their bankruptcy case in exchange\n   for a specified fee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   described as a non-refundable flat fee. Gallon agreed to perform the following services for debtors:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   1) Preparation and filing of the Statement of Financial Affairs and Schedules;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   2) Preparation for and attendance at the Section 341 Meeting of Creditors;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   3) Review and attendance (if necessary) to motions for stay relief;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   4) Review of any redemption agreements;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   5) Review of any reaffirmation agreements;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   6) Follow through with case administration and monitoring;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   7) File motions to reopen (if necessary)[.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   I. The Post-Petition Agreement included the following statements:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    I acknowledge and agree that as all of these fees are for post-petition services, they are not dischargeable in my Chapter 7 case. In the event of nonpayment of the agreed-upon fees, the Law Firm may commence legal proceedings for collection.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   I understand that the Law Firm may assign my post-petition accounts receivable to BK Billing, LLC. I authorize the Law Firm or BK Billing to communicate with me via e-mail, text, and/or telephone. I explicitly give my consent to the Law Firm to share my client file information with BK Billing, including my contact information and social security number. I acknowledge that my payments to BK Billing will be reported to credit bureaus. I acknowledge that on-time payments can help my credit and late payments can hurt my credit. I have been provided an opportunity to ask the Law Firm questions regarding the Law Firm's accounts receivable assignment agreement with BK Billing. The Law Firm has answered all such questions to my satisfaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   I agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Oklahoma courts with respect to such action, and Oklahoma law will apply. If such collection procedures shall become necessary, I agree to pay all reasonable costs of such collection, including reasonable attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   I understand that I am to notify my creditors of my bankruptcy case once my case is filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   J. Attached to the Post-Petition Agreement was a \"Recurring Payment Authorization and Consent Form\" in which the debtors authorized Gallon or BK Billing, LLC, referred to as an \"independent billing company,\" to charge their debit card a specified fee per month until a specified amount was paid in full.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   That form included the following statement:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   I give my consent that the Law Firm may sell or factor the accounts receivable associated with my contract to BK Billing. I acknowledge my payments would then be made directly to BK Billing on behalf of the Law Firm. I authorize the Law Firm or BK Billing to communicate with me via mail, e-mail, text, and/or telephone. I give\n   my consent for the Law Firm to share my client file information, including my Social Security Number, with BK Billing for the purpose of processing and reporting my payments. I acknowledge that my payments may be reported to the Credit Bureaus. I acknowledge that on-time payments may help my credit and late payments may hurt my credit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   K. In all of the Captioned Cases, Gallon filed the remaining schedules and statements required by \u00a7 521 and Rule 1007(b) sometime after the petition date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   L. Among the documents filed post-petition in each case was a Disclosure of Compensation of Attorney for Debtor (\"Disclosure of Compensation\"), which indicated that Gallon had agreed to accept a specified fee\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"for services rendered or to be rendered on behalf of the debtor(s) in contemplation of or in connection with the bankruptcy case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gallon stated that he had received a specified fee\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   prior to filing the statement, leaving a specified balance due.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   In every case, he checked the box next to the statement \"I have not agreed to share the above-disclosed compensation with any other person unless they are members and associates of my law firm.\" Gallon also indicated that \"by agreement with the debtor(s), the above-disclosed fee does not include the following service: 1) Lien Avoidance; 2) Adversary Proceeding; 3) Judgment Lien Removal; 4) Re-Affirmation (sic) Agreement; 5) Re-Affirmation (sic) Agreement Recession; 6) Amendment to Peition (sic), Schedules and Statements; 7) Objection to Discharge.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Conventional Cases\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Between June 13, 2017, the date Gallon filed the first BK Billing Case, and October 17, 2017, the date of the hearing where Gallon first disclosed his relationship with BK Billing to the Court, Gallon filed nineteen cases that did not utilize the services of BK Billing (the \"Conventional Cases\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gallon's disclosed attorney fee\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the Conventional Cases ranged from $900 to $1,250, and averaged $1,160.53.\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   In each of the Conventional Cases, the debtor paid the filing fee on the filing date and did not seek to pay it in installments. In each of the Conventional Cases, Gallon attached all required schedules and statements to the petition on the filing date, i.e., none were filed as bare-bones cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    3. Court proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Completely unaware of the bifurcated contractual relationships Gallon had entered into with his clients, the Court set the Disclosure of Compensation in the\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   case for hearing, noting that the Court had previously ruled that some of the excluded services were required to be performed by counsel for debtors in every Chapter 7 case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the Court noticed an unusual spate of Installment Applications filed by Gallon in the previous few months without sufficient information for Court review, and set the Installment Agreement in the\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   case for hearing to inquire about this practice. It was at this hearing (the \"October 17 Hearing\") that the Court was first informed of Gallon's use of the BK Billing Model and his factoring arrangement with BK Billing. The UST stated that she had only become aware of the arrangement the day before when preparing for the hearing with Gallon. At the hearing, the Court bluntly asked Gallon to explain \"Why wouldn't this be disclosed?\" His answer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   MR. GALLON: Well, it might -- the reason I did not disclose it, Your Honor, in my mind, is that once -- I mean, what, what is happening here is there, is a bifurcation process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   So the client hires you to perform, to, to file the petition and the creditors and the verification. Then once that's done,\n   you have a second meeting, which is the bifurcation, where they rehire you to finish the, the schedules, statements, and all that. Then once that's done, that's whenever it is factored. And so it is just my way of receiving, I mean, I could collect it from the debtor instead of BK Billing. And so I didn't, I mean, I just didn't think it was something that I was required to disclose. It's my receivable. It's monies that's owed me.\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Two days after the October 17 Hearing, Gallon filed an amended Disclosure of Compensation in the\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   case (the \"Amended Disclosure\"), which added the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Counsel may receive financing from a third-party via a financing or factoring facility. Although in undersigned counsel's view such financing or factoring facility should not be considered an agreement to share compensation, the terms of such agreement will include the granting by undersigned counsel of an interest in the undersigned counsel's accounts and the creditor may have rights to receive payment from the client. Any such financing or factoring facility agreement will clearly provide that client must first give consent to the party relationship and under no circumstances will any of the terms of the financing or factoring facility agreement require counsel to disclose any information that is either confidential or may be considered a privileged communication with the client. The actual agreement will be made available upon request by a party-in-interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Gallon has since filed the same Amended Disclosure in all of the BK Billing Cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court continued the hearing to allow the UST to gather more information regarding Gallon's relationship with BK Billing and decide on a course of action. At the continued hearing, the Court heard from the UST and Gallon, and discussed the UST's Motion filed in the\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Motion proposed an agreement between the UST and Gallon, whereby Gallon would: 1) disgorge his fee in the\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   case \"in part;\" 2) continue to represent debtors in any of the open BK Billing Cases; 3) continue representing debtors in the Non-Factored Cases;\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 4) cease doing business with BK Billing going forward. A proposed agreed order along those lines was later submitted to (not filed with) the Court that indicated Gallon would disgorge $855 received post-petition (presumably from BK Billing) and cancel any post-petition contract that allowed BK Billing to further collect from Wright. The Court found the proposed agreement wholly unsatisfactory, and held a telephonic hearing on January 31, 2018, at which it requested more information from Gallon regarding the Captioned Cases. The Court subsequently issued an Order Scheduling Hearing and Directing Counsel for the Debtor to Address Issues of Compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Order outlined the concerns of the Court and advised Gallon of the various types of sanctions or remedies the Court was contemplating in these cases. Among the possible sanctions was disgorgement of all fees paid by debtors in\n   any of the Captioned Cases and the indemnification by Gallon of his clients against any further collection action brought by BK Billing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   On May 10, 2018, the Court held a hearing (the \"May 10 Hearing\") on these matters. Gallon's arguments and defenses were presented in a pre-hearing brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n   His arguments can be summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   1. Use of the BK Billing Model made Gallon financially worse off than if he had used a conventional, pre-petition billing method.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   2. Gallon relied on BK Billing, based on the vigor and sophistication used to induce him to adopt the BK Billing Model. BK Billing appeared to be a highly professional organization, presented a polished sales pitch, and was a high-level sponsor of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys annual meeting. Gallon was given the impression that its model was widely and successfully used.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   3. Gallon did not disclose the BK Billing Model because 1) he relied on BK Billing to advise him of the need to change his usual procedures; 2) he was not aware that BK Billing provided a specific form of disclosure to be filed with the Court; and 3) \"it just did not occur to him that such disclosure was required.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   4. Gallon did not understand that participating in the BK Billing program might involve violation of bankruptcy law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   5. A significant motivation for Gallon to offer the BK Billing Model \"was to allow clients to obtain relief from their debt problems more quickly.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   6. Gallon's long-time bankruptcy legal assistant was distracted and ultimately quit during the period he was utilizing the BK Billing Model. He states that many of the mistakes in the disclosures and statements were due to that distracted assistant, his own inept efforts at learning the software, and finally the learning curve of training a new assistant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   7. Each of the debtors in the Captioned Cases received a discharge without complaint or complication. Gallon suggests that this is a vindication of any charge that his pre-petition investigation and analysis of the debtors' cases, without preparing schedules and statements, was inadequate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   When questioned about the reason for the bifurcation and performance of services post-petition, Gallon admitted that the practice was not for the benefit of debtors, but was done solely to facilitate the BK Billing Model of collection, by making all fees attributed to post-petition work non-dischargeable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gallon valued\n   his time at $250 per hour, based on the amount he charges in Chapter 13 cases. He acknowledged that he did not accurately account for services provided pre-petition to debtors, and often spent more time working on their cases pre-petition than the debtors paid for before the case was filed. For example, if a debtor paid only $100 prior to the case being filed, Gallon acknowledged that he spent more than 4/10 of an hour preparing the case for filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the BK Billing Model, Gallon then shifted the remainder of his fee to be collected post-petition, even though some of the services being compensated had already been provided pre-petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Gallon testified that he immediately stopped using the services of BK Billing as soon as he became aware of the concerns of the Court and the UST. The UST stipulated that Gallon cooperated fully in amending disclosures and providing documents and information during their investigation of these matters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the May 10 Hearing, Gallon reiterated his understanding that the factoring of his fee to BK Billing did not involve any sharing of fees since they were simply a collection agency and not providing any services to the debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    1. Counsel's duty of disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 329\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Section 329 of the Bankruptcy Code lies at the heart of these cases. Under that section, if a debtor pays or makes an agreement to pay an attorney for services related to a bankruptcy case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n   that attorney is required to file a statement with the Court that discloses: 1) any compensation paid to the attorney, if the payment was made after one year before the date of the filing of the petition; 2) any compensation agreed to be paid to the attorney, if such agreement was made after one year before the date of the filing of the petition; and 3) the source of such compensation paid or agreed to be paid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   For Chapter 7 debtors' counsel, \u00a7 329 is implemented by Bankruptcy Rule 2016(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to\n   the duties specified in \u00a7 329, the Rule adds the requirement that counsel disclose \"whether the attorney has shared or agreed to share the compensation with any other entity,\" including \"the particulars of any such sharing or agreement to share by the attorney[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    168\n   </footnotemark>\n   These disclosures are required to be filed within 14 days after the case is filed, and supplemented within 14 days after any payment or agreement not previously disclosed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Counsel's duties of disclosure apply whether or not the attorney applies for compensation from the estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n   The disclosure requirements of \u00a7 329 are \"mandatory not permissive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    171\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute is \"designed to prevent bankruptcy attorneys from extracting more than their fair share from prospective debtors willing to do whatever is necessary to obtain their counsel of choice and avoid unfavorable bankruptcy proceedings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    172\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Counsel's fee revelations must be direct and comprehensive.

Counsel could avoid disclosure of any or all of the fees paid to them by making a covert decision that the undisclosed fee was so unrelated to the bankruptcy case that its disclosure was not required, and eliminating the possibility of Court review in the process. The Court's ability to make a meaningful review of attorney's fees would be hindered if not destroyed. Such a result can be neither condoned nor allowed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Nothing presented to the Court in these matters suggests that any lesser standard should prevail. Nor does the Court find that a \"pure heart,\" without a subjective intent to violate the Code or Rules, provides counsel any defense to the failure to file the proper disclosures under \u00a7 329.\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Negligent or inadvertent omissions 'do\n   not vitiate the failure to disclose.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    184\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Court finds Gallon's original Disclosure of Compensation in each of these cases to be grossly misleading and indicative of a wanton disregard-\n   <em>\n    to the point of negligence\n   </em>\n   -for the level of candor required under \u00a7 329. Some of Gallon's errors defy comprehension. For example, in the\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   case, Gallon disclosed that he had agreed to accept $1,500 for legal services with a balance due of $1,425, when he actually had agreed to receive $855, plus $213.75 paid to escrow, from BK Billing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    185\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statement is flat-out deceptive, whether or not that is what Gallon intended. The disclosure conflates the total amount a debtor agreed to pay for his services with the amount he agreed to accept for his services, even though those amounts differ by several hundred dollars in each of the BK Billing Cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Other errors demonstrate the general level of sloppiness evident in much of Gallon's record keeping. For example, in the\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   case, Gallon disclosed that \"prior to the filing of this statement I have received $75,\" even though his Pre-Petition Agreement indicated Ms. Wright had agreed to pay $200 plus an additional $42 in fees. An internal office memo indicated that she had actually paid $200. Although Gallon blamed such mistakes on the loss of his long-time assistant and the difficulty in training a new one, Gallon has duties of competence to his clients that transcend bankruptcy law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    186\n   </footnotemark>\n   He should not accept clients if he does not have the basic skills to file their cases in a complete and competent manner. This Court does not accept laying the blame at the foot of an employee as an excuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Of equal concern is that Gallon indicated in each Disclosure of Compensation that he had not shared his fee with any other person. Both in his written brief and testimony, Gallon insisted on his understanding that he was not sharing fees because \"it was his receivable\" that he could dispose of or sell in any way he wanted, and that BK Billing was simply a collection agency. The Court is not particularly concerned here with the legal or ethical violations involved with any possible sharing arrangement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    187\n   </footnotemark>\n   What concerns the Court is Gallon's rather brazen position, with no citation to authority, that collection of a fee from his client that is split between himself and BK Billing does not constitute sufficient \"sharing of compensation\" that it should-\n   <em>\n    at a minimum\n   </em>\n   -be disclosed to the Court. Courts have found that a failure to comply with disclosure requirements is sanctionable even if proper disclosure would have shown no violation of the Code\n   or Rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    188\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Gallon filed an Amended Disclosure in each of the cases in an effort to remedy the deficiencies in the original. His efforts fell woefully short. His statement that \"counsel may receive financing from a third-party\" does not adequately disclose that in each of the affected cases he\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     did in fact\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   receive such financing, and on what terms. He goes on to state his view that the arrangement does not involve sharing of fees, but gives no particulars of the arrangement. Offering to make the agreement available upon request does not satisfy Rule 2016(b)'s requirement of disclosing \"the particulars of any such sharing or agreement to share.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    189\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    2. Counsel's duty of candor to the tribunal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In addition to the statutory duties provided in the Bankruptcy Code, Gallon has other duties to his clients and the Court based on his role as an officer of the court. An attorney becomes an officer of the court upon taking an oath and meeting other requirements imposed by state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    190\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Oklahoma, that oath requires counsel to show complete candor toward the tribunal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    191\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oklahoma Rule of Professional Conduct 3.3 reinforces the requirement of candor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    192\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such candor is vital to the integrity of the bankruptcy process itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Court is troubled by Gallon's practice of charging a higher fee to his clients that use the BK Billing Model than to his conventional clients. Gallon charged his average conventional client $1,250 when the fee was fully paid prior to filing a debtor's petition. Under the BK Billing Model, a debtor was charged a total of $1,500 for attorney fees. From the debtor's perspective, that is a $250 premium, or 20% above the fee charged in a conventional case, for the convenience of paying the fee over 12 months. From Gallon's perspective, the math is even worse. For example in the\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   case, Gallon invoiced Wright's account to BK Billing for $1,425. He actually received $855 from BK Billing. That means Wright agreed to pay a 66% markup over\n   the amount Gallon actually received for providing her services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    193\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, if Gallon was willing to accept roughly $1,069, or 75% of $1,425, in a typical BK Billing Case, assuming he received the escrowed payments, the Court could rightly conclude that he consistently overcharges his conventional clients for the value of his services. Gallon's only defense of the practice of charging higher fees to BK Billing clients was that it was encouraged by BK Billing as part of their training package.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   It is clear to the Court that a prominent feature of the BK Billing Model is the designation of the bulk of services as \"post-petition\" in order to render them beyond the Chapter 7 discharge and therefore collectable by BK Billing. There are (at least) two problems with this approach. First, by waiting until after the petition is filed to perform most of the actual services, such as filing out schedules and statements, counsel risks overlooking essential information regarding the debtors' financial condition, which may have been missed in the cursory interview conducted pre-petition. Counsel may discover too late that he or she should have chosen a different chapter, or not filed the case at all. Second, the amount of Gallon's fees designated pre- or post-petition was motivated by how much money the debtor was able to pay up front, and not related in any way to when Gallon's services were actually performed. Valuing his time at $250 per hour, Gallon admitted that in several cases he spent much more time pre-petition than he was paid for, but then designated the remaining fee as \"post-petition,\" thus turning an otherwise dischargeable pre-petition claim into a non-discharged claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    194\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a scheme works a fraud both on the debtor and the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Of additional concern to the Court is that Gallon indicated that the source of the compensation to be paid to him was the debtor, even though Bankruptcy Form 2030 presented him with another option. Courts have consistently held that payment of funds from a third-party payor to pay a debtor's legal fees does not alter counsel's obligation of proper disclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    195\n   </footnotemark>\n   In each of the BK Billing Cases except\n   <em>\n    Gomes\n   </em>\n   , Gallon received a direct deposit equal to 60% of the invoiced account value from BK Billing, with an agreement he would be paid an additional 15% if the accounts were sufficiently remitted by the debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    196\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clearly, \"the \"source of such compensation\" is directly required to be disclosed under \u00a7 329. Gallon tries to deflect responsibility for this failure by stating that he relied on BK Billing to train and advise him on the use of their model. Such reliance on BK Billing in the discharge of his professional duties and judgment is a breach of the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    197\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite not being\n   \"trained\" or provided a form by BK Billing, Gallon certainly understood that he was only indirectly being compensated by his clients, but that the actual funds he received came directly from BK Billing. He should have known that the information provided to the Court in the Disclosure of Compensation filed in these cases was grossly misleading, if not out right false. His declaration that it simply \"did not occur to him that such disclosure was required\" is both disheartening and astonishing. This Court has published no less than three opinions directly related to the failure of debtors' counsel to properly disclose all financial dealings with their clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    198\n   </footnotemark>\n   As an officer of the Court, Gallon is expected to be aware of such rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Gallon tries to rationalize his failures by citing the blind faith he put in BK Billing as a company. He suggests that he was induced to adopt the BK Billing Model based on the company's slick sales pitch and high-profile sponsorship of a leading bankruptcy conference. While the Court does not doubt that BK Billing rolled out a persuasive marketing campaign, the Court believes that any reasonable attorney would have at least questioned the \"too good to be true\" aspect of the model. Instead, Gallon blindly adopted the BK Billing Model, without conducting even a minimal inquiry into the legal or ethical issues that such a system might raise. The Court finds that such abdication of his professional judgment is unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   This Court has previously noted the bankruptcy system is a fragile one, built on the principles of full and candid disclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    199\n   </footnotemark>\n   Its operation and survival rely on the integrity and professionalism of its practitioners. Only through serendipity were these matters brought to the Court's attention. \"This is not an area where the Court will engage in or tolerate a game of 'catch me if you can,' or allow 'I guess I did not know better' to be a palatable excuse.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    200\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds Gallon's disclosures regarding the nature and source of his compensation in these cases to be grossly inadequate to the point of being misleading. The Court is aware that it has discretion when determining the degree of sanctions for non-disclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    201\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds Gallon's entire fee in each of these cases to be unreasonable. His failures are sufficiently severe and pervasive to warrant disgorgement. The Court would be justified in disgorging all fees received by Gallon or collected by BK Billing, but finds that such an order would be administratively unworkable, since some of the funds paid by the debtors pre-petition were allocated to court fees and other miscellaneous services. The Court will limit disgorgement to the value of fees actually collected by BK Billing from each of the debtors in the Captioned Cases after their petitions were filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    202\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such funds shall be remitted by Gallon to the debtor that made the payment. The Post-Petition Agreements in each case are found to be void, and neither\n   Gallon nor BK Billing may enforce any claim against the debtors under those contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    203\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is aware this is a harsh sanction, but anything less would minimize the serious nature of Gallon's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <em>\n    3. Debtors' violations of Rule 1006\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Section 1930 of title 28 of the United States Code sets out the schedule of fees to be collected by the clerk when a bankruptcy case is filed. The statute explicitly allows a debtor in a voluntary case to pay the required fee in installments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    204\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 1006 implements this statute, but adds that a debtor that utilizes the installment provision may make no further payments \"to an attorney or any other person who renders services to the debtor in connection with the case\" until the filing fee is paid in full.\n   <footnotemark>\n    205\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In eleven of the seventeen Captioned Cases, Gallon filed an Installment Application. In each of those cases, the application included a statement executed by both the debtors and Gallon that the debtors understood they must pay their entire filing fee before they make any more payments or transfer any more property to an attorney\n   <em>\n    or anyone else\n   </em>\n   for services in connection with their bankruptcy case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    206\n   </footnotemark>\n   In eight of those cases, due to the scheme orchestrated by Gallon, debtors unwittingly made payments to BK Billing toward Gallon's attorney fee before their entire filing fee was paid to the Court, in direct violation of Rule 1006. The remaining three cases were not submitted to BK Billing for factoring, therefore no violation occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Gallon, as an attorney admitted to practice before this Court, is charged with knowing and understanding the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, as well as the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. His signature on the Installment Application was a violation of both his ethical and statutory duties. Rule 9011(b)(3) outlines counsel's ethical duty of candor in signing an application submitted to the Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   (b) Representations to the court\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   By presenting to the court (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) a petition, pleading, written motion, or other paper, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   (3)\n   <em>\n    the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support\n   </em>\n   or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery[.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    207\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (\"BAPCPA\") was enacted \"to correct perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    208\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among its reforms were \u00a7\u00a7 526-528,\n   which target debt relief agencies, \"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , professionals who provide bankruptcy assistance to consumer debtors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    209\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a debt relief agency, Gallon is bound by duties of candor therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    210\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevant subsection of \u00a7 526 reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   (a) A debt relief agency shall not-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    make any statement\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    or counsel or advise any assisted person\n   </em>\n   or prospective assisted person\n   <em>\n    to make a statement\n   </em>\n   in a document filed in a case or proceeding under this title,\n   <em>\n    that is untrue or misleading\n   </em>\n   , or that upon the exercise of reasonable care, should have been known by such agency to be untrue or misleading[.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    211\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Considering he set these events in motion by factoring his fee to BK Billing, Gallon knew or should have known that BK Billing would begin collection activity prior to the debtors' court fees being paid in full. He is also charged with knowing that such payment to BK Billing was a violation of the debtors' duties under Rule 1006. His signature on the Installment Agreements is a violation of his duty of candor under both Rule 9011(b)(3) and \u00a7 526(a)(2). Gallon compounded the violation of \u00a7 526(a)(2) by advising his clients to sign the Installment Agreements and causing them to make misleading statements regarding their payment of his fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Court does not take these violations lightly. The bankruptcy system requires complete candor from both debtors and their engaged professionals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    212\n   </footnotemark>\n   Standing alone, the Court would find cause to sanction Gallon under Rule 9011(c) or \u00a7 526(c)(5) for filing and endorsing the debtors' misleading statements found in the Installment Agreements. The Court notes that in all eleven cases, all required Court filing fees were eventually fully paid, either by the debtors or Gallon, and each of the debtors received their discharge. Therefore, despite the authority to do so, the Court will not impose additional sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <em>\n    4. Counsel's duties under BAPCPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   As soon as Gallon became aware of his missteps in these cases, he worked diligently to assist the UST to investigate this matter and cut ties with BK Billing. As such, he offered no defense of the BK Billing Model of bifurcating services into pre- and post-petition categories or its factoring practice, which required debtors to incur debt to pay their attorney's fee. Several courts across the country have faced variations on this theme. Some have offered advice and recommendations in order to craft an acceptable scheme whereby attorneys may offer bifurcated services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    213\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Others have noted that various provisions added to the Code by BAPCPA appear to thwart such schemes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    214\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has reviewed the cases carefully and believes that BAPCPA presents serious impediments to the legality of this kind of bifurcated services scheme, such as the BK Billing Model.\n   <footnotemark>\n    215\n   </footnotemark>\n   The difficulty here is that\n   no one appears in these cases to defend the model or offer an alternative argument to the Court. That seems like shaky ground to rule or comment on the validity of the model. Because the Court has disposed of these matters under section 329, it is not necessary to review them further on alternative grounds. Therefore the Court will wait until issues of bifurcation of services and fee factoring are before it in an actual case or controversy before it weighs in on \u00a7\u00a7 526 and 528. The Court raises these issues in the hope that counsel considering use of a similar scheme will carefully review the legal and ethical provisions of BAPCPA and state ethics rules\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   they file a petition in this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Gallon must disgorge the value of all fees actually collected by BK Billing from the debtors after their petitions were filed in each of the Captioned Cases. Such funds shall be remitted by Gallon to the debtor that made the payment.
