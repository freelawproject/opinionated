The United States and Appellees Matthew A. Copley and Jolinda M. Copley (the \"Appellees\" or \"Debtors\") have filed their respective briefs. (ECF Nos. 16, 17, 19.)

On May 29, 2014, the Debtors filed a petition for bankruptcy, along with Schedules A through J.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On Schedule E,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Debtors identified the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") as a creditor holding unsecured priority claims for \"Income Taxes\" for tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010 in the cumulative amount of $13,547.10. (App. 0025, \u00b6 2.) On Schedule C,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Debtors listed as exempt a \"refund from\n   <em>\n    2014\n   </em>\n   federal ... income taxes\" in the amount of $3,208.00\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 34-4 (Virginia's Homestead Exemption).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App. 0026, \u00b6 4 (emphasis added).) The parties agree that the Debtors intended to exempt the 2013 federal income tax overpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 3, 2014, the Debtors each filed a Homestead Deed with the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Spotsylvania County, Virginia, claiming as exempt a \"Refund from\n   <em>\n    2014\n   </em>\n   federal ... income taxes [in the amount of] $3,208.00.\" (App. 0026, \u00b6 6 (emphasis added).)

The Debtors reported that their 2013 tax liability totaled $7,054.00, but that $10,262.00 had been withheld from their earnings. Because the Debtors overpaid federal income\n   taxes in 2013 by $3,208.00, they claimed a refund in that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about June 30, 2014, IRS records demonstrate that the IRS mailed a Notice to the Debtors, informing them that their \"2013 Form 1040 overpayment was applied to tax [they] owe[d].\" (App. 0027, \u00b6 9.) The Debtors deny receiving this notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The summary identified the Debtors' \"overpayment for 2013 in the amount of $3,208.00\" and listed $3,208.00 as the \"[a]mount applied to tax owed for [years] 2008 [and] 2009.\" (App. 0027 \u00b6 9 (brackets in original).) Using the $3,208.00, the IRS paid in full the Debtors' $158.76 unpaid tax balance from 2008, and applied the remaining $3,049.24 to the Debtors' 2009 unpaid tax balance.

The Debtors sought the tax refund return because they had listed it as an exempt asset pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 34-4 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the debtor's right to exempt), 542(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (requirement to turn property over to the estate), and 553(b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the right to setoff). Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 22, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final order and memorandum opinion. The Bankruptcy Court granted the United States's motion for summary judgment on Count I, denying the Debtors' request for turnover of the tax overpayment under the Virginia common law principle of assumpsit. The Bankruptcy Court granted the Debtors' motion for summary judgment on Count II, granting the Debtors' request for turnover of the tax overpayment under \u00a7\u00a7 522 and 542(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 6, 2016, the United States filed an amended notice of appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenging whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to hear the case and claiming, for the first time on appeal, that it did not waive sovereign immunity for the purpose of the Debtors' claims. The United States\n   never asserted in the Bankruptcy Court that sovereign immunity barred the Debtors' claim, so the Bankruptcy Court did not reach that issue. The Court remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court to rule on the issue of sovereign immunity. After considering the parties' briefing on the issue, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that Congress abrogated the United States's sovereign immunity under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The United States renewed its appeal, on four grounds: (1) the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to compel the IRS to refund the tax overpayment; (2) the Debtors' 2013 federal income tax overpayment did not become part of the bankruptcy estate until after the IRS set off the overpayment against the Debtors' prepetition income tax liability pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206402\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) the United States did not need to object to the Debtors' claim for a refund to preserve its setoff rights because the Debtors' refund claim lacked any value; and, (4) the United States's setoff right under \u00a7 553 supersedes the Debtors' exemption rights under \u00a7 522. The Court begins, as it must, by assessing the threshold jurisdictional challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. Analysis: Sovereign Immunity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The United States argues that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the Debtors' refund suit because the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity from such cases under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the United States says that none of the Bankruptcy Code sections referenced in \u00a7 106 -specifically, 505,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   522, 542, and 553-provides the Debtors with \"an avenue for bringing a suit to recover a tax overpayment.\" (Appellant's Br. 15, ECF No. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court held \u00a7 505 inapplicable, found \u00a7\u00a7 522 and 553 directly implicated, and determined that the United States was \"bound by the abrogation of sovereign immunity provided in \u00a7 106(a).\" (App. 0074.) On appeal, the United States argues that \"[\u00a7] 106(a)'s waiver allows a court to take action against the United States\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in the manner and to the extent set out in the listed Code provisions.\" (Appellant's Br. 12.) The United States argues that the listed code sections at issue-505, 522, 542, and 553-do not abrogate the United States's sovereign immunity in this case because none of the applicable code sections create a cause of action like the one at bar.

The United States invites the Court to adopt this construction without citing to any legal precedent for this proposition. Indeed, contrary Virginia law exists.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Benson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272838\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/566/800/#p805\">\n    566 B.R. at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that claims almost identical to the claims at bar fit within the meaning of \u00a7 522 ).

In short, \"the obvious purpose of [\u00a7] 106(a), and the most reasonable interpretation to give effect to its provisions, is to bring adjudication of all those matters [including those related to the tension between \u00a7\u00a7 522 and 553 ] under one roof-that of the bankruptcy court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Benson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272838\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/566/800/#p805\">\n    566 B.R. at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section 106(b), which permits a court to \"hear and determine\n   <em>\n    any issue\n   </em>\n   arising with respect to the application of such sections to governmental units,\" further supports this interpretation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ) (emphasis added). The Bankruptcy Court highlighted this provision in holding that \u00a7 106 abrogates the United States's sovereign immunity. The United States asserts that adopting the Bankruptcy Court's interpretation \"would substantially widen the scope of suits to which the United States is subject.\" (Appellant's Br. 22.) According to the United States, were the Court to affirm the Bankruptcy Court's interpretation of sovereign immunity under \u00a7 106(a), \"the only rule would be that a debtor cite to one of the enumerated sections without needing to actually fit within that section's language.\" (Appellant's Br. 25.) The United States overstates the effect of the Bankruptcy Court's holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The present case does not simply cite to \u00a7\u00a7 522 and 553, but directly implicates the application of \u00a7\u00a7 522 and 553. The Debtors' claim \"fits within\" \u00a7 522 because they allege that the IRS improperly withheld the $3,208.00 in violation of the Debtors' claimed \u00a7 522 exemption. The United States invoked \u00a7 553 to perform the disputed offset. The application of these provisions constitute the heart of the case. Nothing in the Bankruptcy Court's interpretation of the United States's abrogation of sovereign immunity under \u00a7 106(a) commands the expansive consequence suggested by the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As have other courts to address the issue, this Court concludes that \u00a7 106(a) abrogates the United States's sovereign immunity under \u00a7\u00a7 522 and 553, meaning that the Bankruptcy Court properly exercised jurisdiction over the claims before it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Benson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272838\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/566/800/#p805\">\n    566 B.R. at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   For this reason, the Court will affirm the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion that the United States was subject to suit under \u00a7\u00a7 522 and 553 pursuant to \u00a7 106(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.

The Bankruptcy Court considered the parties' arguments and existing bankruptcy court decisions from the Western District of Virginia to hold that \u00a7 522 supersedes \u00a7 553 in this case. The Court recognizes that \"a bankruptcy court necessarily abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous view of the law or clearly erroneous factual findings.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Gould\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3339866\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/401/415/#p421\">\n    401 B.R. at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As discussed below, after thoroughly reviewing the cases that the Bankruptcy Court relied on, cases from other jurisdictions, and the parties' arguments, the Court determines that the Bankruptcy Court did not err in its application of the law or rely on clearly erroneous facts to reach the conclusion that \u00a7 522 supersedes \u00a7 553.

This case presents a difficult legal issue, and one lacking a straightforward\n   resolution. But after evaluating the statutes and extant caselaw, the Court concludes that the Debtors retain their right to the 2013 overpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, the Debtors' claim to the $3,208.00 overpayment for their 2013 federal taxes vested on December 31, 2013, at midnight. Next, the $3,208.00 overpayment became part of the bankruptcy estate upon the Debtors' filing, on May 29, 2014. At that juncture, any right the United States had to the Debtors' overpayment became subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Finally, the Debtors' rights under \u00a7 522 supersede the United States's right to offset under \u00a7 553. Section 553's discretionary application, concerns over nullification, and the fundamental policy goals of the Bankruptcy Code support this conclusion. The United States shall release the $3,208.00 overpayment to the Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Applicable Statutory Provisions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Several statutory provisions undergird this case.

It would be difficult to find that a court that weighed these competing interests, as the Bankruptcy Court did here, abuses its discretion when ultimately deciding between allowing or disallowing a \u00a7 553 offset. Moreover, the Court does not necessarily see the apparent conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 522 and 553 as irreconcilable. First, the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its equitable discretion in holding that the IRS's right to setoff under \u00a7 553 appropriately gave way to the Debtors' claimed exemption under \u00a7 522. Section 553 is permissive in application, not mandatory. Setoff rights \"should be enforced 'unless compelling circumstances' require otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Gould\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3339866\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/401/415/#p421\">\n    401 B.R. at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Buckenmaier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6486310\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/127/233/#p237\">\n    127 B.R. at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted in original) ). The Court concludes that the Bankruptcy Code's authorization of the claimed exemption under \u00a7 522 creates a compelling circumstance here. Next, the Court adopts the majority position that interpreting \u00a7 522 to supersede \u00a7 553 avoids nullifying either provision in its entirety, although the Court recognizes that nothing remains in this particular case for the IRS to offset. Finally, after reviewing the policy rationale throughout existing case law, the Court finds that prioritizing \u00a7 522 over \u00a7 553 best supports the fundamental goals of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   For all of these reasons, the Court will affirm the Bankruptcy Court's holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Fundamental Principles of Statutory Interpretation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The purpose of statutory interpretation is \"to try to determine congressional intent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Dole v.

The apparent tension between \u00a7 553 and \u00a7 522 dissipates because \u00a7 553's permissive application must yield to \u00a7 522's unqualified authorization to Debtors to exempt property pursuant to its requirements. The Court finds that this exemption right, imbedded in the same Code as the permissive application of offsets, creates a compelling circumstance that justifies the disallowance of an offset if the Debtor properly exempts the property prior to the offset being invoked.

The Bankruptcy Court in\n   <em>\n    In re Bourne\n   </em>\n   reached the opposite conclusion: \"It is just as logical to give effect to both provisions by holding that a debtor may claim an exemption which is valid as to all creditors except one having a right of offset.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11098954\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/262/745/#p756\">\n    262 B.R. at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Each position has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   After considering the applicable statutory provisions, the Court adopts the majority position that interpreting \u00a7 522 to supersede \u00a7 553 would give meaning to both provisions in more circumstances than the reverse. Interpreting \u00a7 553 to supersede \u00a7 522 would seem to risk nullifying \u00a7 522 more regularly. This is true because the exemptions allowed in \u00a7 522 do not grant debtors unlimited leave to file exemptions. Section 522 limits the debtor's right to exempt property in two ways. First, \u00a7 522 constrains exemptions to specific allowable categories of property\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   or, as applicable here, to exemptions authorized by state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In this case, the Debtors invoked \u00a7 522 in conjunction with Virginia Code \u00a7 34-4, an exemption limited to $5,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   After carving out the properly exempted $3,208.00 overpayment, \u00a7 553 still permits offsets on any remaining property in the bankruptcy estate. Although nothing remains of the Debtors' overpayment to subject to the \u00a7 553 offset provision in this particular case, the Court finds that the monetary limits in Virginia Code \u00a7 34-4, imputed to \u00a7 522 in this case, offers a sound limitation on the application of \u00a7 522 and allows \u00a7 553 to retain meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Were the Court to allow \u00a7 553 to supersede \u00a7 522, the likely effect would be to broadly nullify exemptions claimed under \u00a7 522. Nothing in \u00a7 553 limits the amount a creditor can apply to offsets: here, the Debtors owed the IRS $13,547.10 in unpaid taxes from 2008, 2009, and 2010. The amount greatly exceeds the Debtors' ability to exempt up to $5,000 of an expected tax refund under \u00a7 522 and Virginia Code \u00a7 34-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing would remain of\n   the overpayment for the Debtors to exempt if the IRS could apply \u00a7 553 offsets first.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   This creates a compelling circumstance which justifies disallowing the offset in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   On the factual record before it, a finding that either provision applies before the other will necessarily appear to \"nullify\" one provision in this case because of the dollar amounts at issue. Considering the applicable provisions in this case, though, the Court finds that the monetary limits set by \u00a7 522 through Virginia Code \u00a7 34-4 adequately ensure that \u00a7 553 will often retain its force when the United States claims a right to offset tax overpayments against preexisting tax liabilities under \u00a7 553 and \u00a7 6402. Allowing an exemption under \u00a7 522 would limit the application of \u00a7 553, but would seemingly rarely nullify its application. Section 553 would still apply when debtors have reached the statutory limits, or when a debtor cannot exempt property under \u00a7 522 due to varying state provisions. For these reasons, the Court finds that concerns over nullification justify prioritizing the application of \u00a7 522 over \u00a7 553's permissive application in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    d.\n    <em>\n     Interpreting Section 522 to Supersede Section 553 Supports the Bankruptcy Code's Goal of Giving Debtors a Fresh Start\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In addition to \u00a7 553's permissive application and evaluation of nullification, the Bankruptcy Code's goal of giving debtors a fresh start creates a compelling circumstance that justifies interpreting \u00a7 522 to supersede \u00a7 553.

But \u00a7 523(a) does not control here. The operative provision here, \u00a7 522, unambiguously authorizes the Debtors' claimed exemption.

The United States argues that the Bankruptcy Code's \"general principle of a 'fresh start' is not enough to override the express language.\" (Appellant's Br. 48.) This Court agrees, but sees the policy rationale as persuasive when weighed against the findings above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In conclusion, the Court recognizes that many courts have addressed the tension between \u00a7\u00a7 522 and 553 in well-reasoned and thoughtful decisions which nevertheless reach contrary results. Persuasive arguments exist on either side of the debate. After a thorough review of the law, the Court finds that the Bankruptcy Court did not err in its application of the law, and did not abuse its discretion in disallowing the setoff in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court acted within its equitable discretion because compelling circumstances exist to disallow the setoff. First, Section 553's historically permissive application must yield to the unambiguous authorization in \u00a7 522. Second, the doctrine of interpreting statutes to prevent nullification favors a conclusion that \u00a7 522 applies before \u00a7 553, even if that will sometimes, as here, result in leaving no money available for the United States to offset pursuant to \u00a7 553. Finally, the Bankruptcy Code's fundamental goal of providing debtors with a fresh start supports the Court's conclusion that compelling circumstances exist in this case that justify disallowing the offset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court finds that the Debtor's $3,208.00 overpayment became part of the bankruptcy estate upon the Debtors' petition for bankruptcy and that the Debtors properly exempted it pursuant to \u00a7 522 and Virginia Code \u00a7 34-4, without objection from the United States.
