Drain, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 25, 2018 the Court issued a bench ruling on the portion of the reorganized debtors/defendants' (the \"Debtors\") motion for an order dismissing this adversary proceeding pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7009 and 7012 that the Court had not previously granted in its prior bench ruling on January 30, 2018. As I alerted the parties at the hearing, I am filing this modified bench ruling to correct and improve on the syntax and structure of the May 25, 2018 oral ruling, the result of which has already been memorialized by an order dated June 4, 2018 granting the motion to dismiss in full. This Modified Bench Ruling is more colloquial and immediate than a memorandum of decision (and delivered faster), but I hope it is more readable than the bench ruling transcript which it supersedes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is the adjourned hearing from January 30, 2018 on the Debtors' motion to dismiss the first amended complaint herein\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7009 and 7012, incorporating Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the January 30, 2018 hearing, I granted certain aspects of the Debtors' motion to dismiss: I denied the claims of the relator plaintiff, Mr. De Pietro (the \"Plaintiff\") in this\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action based on the Debtors' alleged violations of the Stark Law, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395nn, which were premised on alleged offers of patient referrals, including as a basis for the Debtors' alleged violations of the False Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and I ruled against the Plaintiff regarding his proffered interpretation of the application of section 1141(d)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201146\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(6), to his own right to recovery under the False Claims Act (as opposed to the claims that he is pursuing on the United States' behalf).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As to the latter ruling, I concluded that the plain language of Bankruptcy Code section 1141(d)(6) and Southern District of New York precedent limit the Plaintiff's right to a declaration of non-dischargeability to his claim for his fees in a successful\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and not to his right under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) to a percentage of a recovery on the claims that he is pursuing on behalf of the United States for alleged violations of the False Claims Act or in any other way through the Government's possible recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The latter, far larger potential claim I concluded is clearly not a claim that would be owed to the Plaintiff individually but, rather, would be owed to the United States and, therefore, is outside the coverage of section 1141(d)(6)'s plain terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(6) : \"The confirmation of a plan does not discharge a debtor that is a corporation from any debt-(A) of a kind specified in paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(B) of section 523(a) that is\n   <em>\n    owed to a domestic governmental unit\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    owed to a person\n   </em>\n   as the result of an action filed under subchapter III of chapter 37 of title 31 or any similar State Statute.

As with the complaint's False Claims Act allegations based on the Stark Law, claims would arise under the False Claims Act if the Debtors violated the Anti-Kickback Statute and then, as the complaint alleges, failed to disclose such violations in their certifications to the United States in connection with enrolling in and billing for Government-reimbursed health programs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), (B), (C) and (G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The motion to dismiss contends that the complaint's False Claims Act claims based on violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute fail because the Plaintiff does not satisfy\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) and (B) in that, as alleged by the Debtors, the crux of those Anti-Kickback Statute claims was publicly disclosed by other sources before the Plaintiff shared them with the Government and the Plaintiff lacks knowledge that is independent of and materially and timely added to such publicly disclosed allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the January 30, 2018 hearing, I reserved ruling on what I'll refer to as this \"prior public disclosure issue,\" based in large part on the need for briefing on a second, related issue deriving from the fact that the complaint's allegations that the Debtors violated the False Claims Act based on their violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute in turn depend almost entirely on alleged conduct by the Debtors' lobbyist, Bill Rubin (\"Rubin\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I noted at the January 30, 2018 hearing that False Claims Act claims sound in fraud,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, therefore, that Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7009, which incorporates Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) applies to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the complaint's lack of particularity in describing the scope and conduct of Rubin's agency on the Debtors' behalf (indeed, as discussed later, most of the complaint's references to Rubin's agency are wholly conclusory), I asked the parties to brief whether and to what extent Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) applied to those portions of the complaint focusing on the relationship between Rubin and the Debtors and the complaint's allegations with respect to Rubin's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The prior public disclosure issue and this Rule 9(b) issue are related because, as discussed in more detail later, the only aspect of the complaint that arguably materially adds to the prior public disclosure of the facts underlying the complaint's remaining False Claims Act claims relate to Rubin's lobbying role on the Debtors' behalf; if that role is insufficiently pled or the complaint's description of Rubin's conduct, to the extent sufficiently pled, does not substantially add to the prior public disclosures, the remaining False Claim Act claims should be dismissed, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Having reviewed the parties' post-hearing briefs and considered all of the pleadings filed in connection with the motion to dismiss, as well as the transcript of the January 30, 2018 hearing and, of course, the complaint, I have determined to grant the remaining aspect of the motion to dismiss for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As noted, in this\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action the Plaintiff/relator asserts False Claims Act\n   claims on behalf of the United States based on alleged false certifications by the Debtors in their transactions with the Government, primarily in connection with the Debtors' enrolling in and billing for the Government's Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 211-343.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The complaint alleges that the Debtors' certifications were false or fraudulent because they failed to disclose the Debtors' violations of federal law, namely the Stark Law and the Anti-Kickback Statute incurred in connection with the Debtors' entry into a contract with North Broward Hospital District (\"Broward Health\") to supply Broward Health with radiation oncology services (the \"Broward Contract\"). Having on January 30, 2018 concluded to dismiss the complaint's claims for violation of the False Claims Act based on the Debtors' alleged violation of the Stark Law premised on the Debtor's offer of improper patient referrals, I now address the complaint's claims based on the Debtor's alleged violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When considering a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), incorporated by Fed. R. Bankr.

The Plaintiff does not contest that such disclosures occurred as quoted by the Debtors before he made the complaint available to the Government, or that he did not provide any original information to any of those sources, but he does contest whether the disclosures preclude the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When considering a motion to dismiss, one must accept the complaint's factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Tellabs, Inc. v.

See, for example, complaint \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10, 11, 16, 47, 52, 68, 90, 226 and 317. Clearly, offering a bribe in return for payments under a Federal health care program violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2) states that \"Whoever knowingly and willfully offers any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to any person to induce such person-(A) to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, or (B) to ... arrange for or recommend ... ordering any facility, service or item for which payment may be made in\n   whole or in part under a Federal health care program, shall be guilty of a felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Courts have defined \"remuneration\" as used in the Anti-Kickback Statute broadly, such that it is not limited to monetary kickbacks or bribes,\n   <em>\n    Hanlester Network v.

However, in common parlance one thinks of a \"bribe\" as at least a promise of financial reward that the offeror can plausibly deliver. What the complaint actually alleges besides the conclusory use of the terms \"bribes\" and \"financial inducements\" is something less than that and, moreover, it does so without sufficient particularity as to the scope of Rubin's agency and his actions on the Debtor's behalf when he allegedly made such offers, assuming that Rule 9(b) applies to those allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although there is some confusion in the case law as to when Rule 9(b) applies to pleading the circumstances of an alleged agency, I conclude that Rule 9(b) applies here to the complaint's allegations pertaining to Rubin's agency and that the complaint fails to comply with the Rule. A host of cases hold that where the agency relationship is central to a fraud claim it needs to be pled with particularity under Rule 9(b). That is clearly the situation here: Rubin's agency is, as previously noted and discussed later in more detail, the only substantially new fact not included in the prior public disclosures.

Before turning to them, however, it is worth noting paragraphs 41 through 46 of the complaint, which are referred to in paragraphs 51 and 52. Those earlier paragraphs state that the Debtors had been seeking a contract for Broward Health's radiation therapy service line since \"as early as 2006.\" Complaint \u00b6 41. As part of that effort, the complaint alleges that the Debtors through their CEO, Daniel Dosoretz (\"Dosoretz\") offered patient referrals to Broward Health, but Broward Health's CEO at the time rejected the proposed contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. The complaint also alleges that at some time between 2007 and 2009 Dosoretz offered the Treasurer of Broward Health's Board of Commissioners \"the opportunity to manage surgery centers in Jacksonville Florida,\" and the Treasurer also received but did not accept a call from a Florida congressman ostensibly on the Debtors' behalf, but the Treasurer also opposed the proposed contract, which was not then agreed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Paragraph 51 of the complaint then states, \"In 2011, Dosoretz and [the Debtors] hired lobbyist Bill Rubin to approach Broward Health's then Chief Executive Officer, Frank Nask, with a similar proposal as was previously rejected by [Broward Health's former CEO and Treasurer].\" Notably, this is one of the complaint's two paragraphs describing the scope of Rubin's agency as the Debtors' lobbyist for the Broward Contract-and the only one that does so in more than conclusory terms-and that scope does not involve offering any bribes or other remuneration to Nask or anyone else. Rubin is instead stated to have been hired to make a similar contract proposal to provide radiation oncology services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Paragraph 51 continues by stating that \"Dosoretz and [the Debtors] deliberately chose and retained Rubin as their agent and lobbyist because he was and is a close friend of [Florida's] Governor Scott.\" But this is an innocuous allegation: lobbyists are generally retained because of their political connections. Moreover, as discussed later, before the filing of the complaint two \"Florida Bulldog\" articles separately linked the award of the Broward Contract to the Debtors' political influence with Florida's governor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Paragraph 52 is the only other paragraph in the complaint purporting to describe the extent of Rubin's agency, but it does so in general and conclusory terms, stating, \"Dosoretz directed Rubin to offer financial inducements and bribes to the new CEO, Frank Nask in exchange for his support of the [Broward Contract]. At all times relevant, Bill Rubin acted at the direction of [the Debtors] as its [sic] agent.\" Thus the complaint merely repeats the gravamen of the Anti-Kickback Statute-the offer of financial inducements or bribes-as applied to the scope of Rubin's agency. Nor does it place Dosoretz's charge to Rubin in any specific time frame or state the basis for the complaint's assertion that Dosoretz directed Rubin to offer Nask specific bribes or kickbacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Indeed, at oral argument counsel for the Plaintiff acknowledged with respect to this paragraph that \"[t]here is no direct evidence of that,\" and that, \"[t]he evidence of the scheme is the attempt by Dr. Dosoretz to bribe the former CEO.\" Transcript of January 30, 2018 hearing on Debtors' motion to dismiss, at 118-19. As noted, however, those paragraphs of the complaint describing Dosoretz's interaction with the former CEO over four years before the events underlying the complaint's Anti-Kickback Statute claims do not allege the offer of bribes or kickbacks, let alone describe any such offers with particularity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Paragraph 53 of the complaint then states, \"Nask's job was in jeopardy because he had been appointed under the prior administration of Florida Governor Charlie Crist. Nask had supported a plan to privatize the [Broward Health] District, which would have undermined Governor Scott's control of the District exercised through the appointment of its commissioners. Under Nask's watch, the Federal Government was also investigating Broward Health's compensation arrangements with 27 employed physicians for suspected violations of the Stark Laws.\" (It is clear from the rest of the complaint that this investigation did not have anything to do with the Debtors.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Paragraph 54 states, \"Nask was several years away from retirement and had power, compensation and benefits as CEO. His career options were limited due to his age and the ongoing federal investigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Paragraphs 55 through 57 then allege, \"Acting as agent for [the Debtors], Rubin contacted Nask in 2011. Rubin told Nask that he controlled the Governor's appointments to the Broward Health Board of Commissioners and thereby controlled Nask's continued employment, which depended upon whether newly appointed commissioners would support Nask as CEO. As [the Debtors'] lobbyist and agent, Rubin asked Nask to support [the Debtors'] plan to obtain full control over all radiation oncology services provided at Broward Health. In exchange, Rubin promised Nask that he would protect Nask's continuing employment, salary, pension benefits and severance when he retired as CEO. Rubin told Nask that if [the Debtors] did not obtain the contract, then Rubin would make sure that new Commissioners would be appointed who would terminate Nask's employment.\" Again, whether Rubin was empowered by the Debtors to make such threats and promises is stated in the most conclusory terms, and, in addition, the complaint fails to state when and where Rubin's alleged promises and threats were made or the basis for believing that they were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Paragraph 59 concludes, \"In this manner executives at [the Debtors] hired and paid Rubin to offer political protection and financial security for Nask in exchange for an exclusive prized contract.... [The Debtors] and Dosoretz intended for Rubin to offer illegal inducements to Nask in\n   order to obtain their contact.\" Once more, the complaint fails to state the scope of Rubin's agency except in the most conclusory terms, reciting the gravamen of the Anti-Kickback Statute, and does not state the particulars of how and when the Debtors gave Rubin this assignment or how and when Rubin made his threats and promises or the basis for believe that such things happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, because the offer of \"financial security\" is tied by the complaint only to Rubin's \"political protection\" from Governor Scott one has to ask whether the complaint alleges in even a plausible way for purposes of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 that Rubin's influence was sufficient to override the Governor's legitimate exercise of discretion over the appointment of Broward Health's Board of Commissioners-that is, whether Rubin's influence exceeded his statement that he got to know the Governor \"in 1991 when he started his hospital company, and we've stayed close ever since. I love him. ... He's a very good friend. We've stayed in touch ever since.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51 n. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The complaint does state that on August 29, 2011, before he was appointed to Broward Health's Board of Commissioners, the Plaintiff \"met Rubin at Timpanos restaurant in Fort Lauderdale. Rubin told [the Plaintiff] that he was 'controlling the appointments' for the Broward Health Board.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the complaint never states the apparent basis for this boast with the exception that, apparently at the same meeting, \"Rubin told [Plaintiff] that the owner of the Debtors, Daniel Dosoretz, was a 'close friend' of Governor Scott and a major contributor to his campaign and that securing the [Broward Contract] was a 'top priority.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. The complaint goes on to state that the Plaintiff was in fact appointed to Broward Health's Board several days later,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   leading to the inference that Rubin may have had some sway over the appointment, but that the Plaintiff was not involved in Broward Health's entry into the Broward Contract, which occurred before he attended his first Board meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The complaint goes on to allege that Nask obtained Board approval of the Broward Contract by making false representations regarding the Contract's merits and the defects of the existing contact with an entity known as HealX that it would replace.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91 through 106. The complaint does not cite any sources for these allegations of what transpired at the Board meeting, which the Plaintiff did not attend; apparently they are taken from the published Board minutes. Opposition to the contract by one of the Commissioners in the minutes publicly highlighted its primary defects, moreover, pointing out that \"the contract was awarded without bids and could be extended for up to 25 years\" and \"no economic analysis had been provided to support [it].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Paragraph 107 of the complaint sums up the foregoing allegations, again in a conclusory fashion, as follows: \"Nask did all of the foregoing because (1) Rubin, the Debtor's agent, got Nask what he wanted-the continuation of his lucrative salary, benefits,\n   and a rich retirement package, and (2) [although I've already found that this was not actually sufficiently pled in the complaint to establish a violation of the Stark Law], Dosoretz promised increased patient referrals to Broward Health from [the Debtors'] major network of employment of employed physicians.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The complaint also discusses a meeting between the Plaintiff and Dosoretz in 2013, after the Plaintiff had developed and expressed concerns to Rubin and others, including Governor Scott about the Broward Contract, the related termination of HealX, and Rubin's influence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185-88. However, this description only references Dosoretz's statement that he had a 'close relationship' with Governor Scott, that Broward Health was a 'strong partner,'\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187, and that Dosoretz \"was arranging for meetings with Nask and Governor Scott so that 'the Governor would know that Frank [Nask] is a good guy.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 188. It contains nothing about the scope of Rubin's agency on the Debtors' behalf when the Broward Contract was being considered nor more than Dosoretz's boast that he, Dosoretz has political influence based on his relationship with Governor Scott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Thus there are three problems with the complaint's allegations pertaining to the Anti-Kickback Statute. First, the scope of Rubin's agency on behalf of the Debtors, which-given the Plaintiff's contemporaneous belief that Rubin was the Debtors' lobbyist, the Plaintiff had the opportunity to explore but did not-is not described with sufficient particularity for purposes of Rule 9(b). (And, when the complaint describes the scope of Rubin's agency with any particularity, it merely discusses the Debtors' unsuccessful 2007 attempt to obtain a long-term contract with Broward Health and Rubin's boasting that he has Governor Scott's ear). There is a clear explanation for this failing: counsel for the Plaintiff has acknowledged that she has no basis to know if the Debtors charged Rubin with the assignment of offering valuable consideration to Nask beyond what Governor Scott could already deliver or withhold in return for his support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, to the extent described in anything other than conclusory terms, the complaint's assertions that Ruben was able to control Governor Scott, Svengali-like, as opposed to exerting ordinary political influence on him on behalf of a well-heeled client, are not plausible, at least without additional detail confirming more than ordinary political loyalties and the governor's exercise of power under Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   And, last, it is only by properly pleading Rubin's role that the complaint might overcome the gatekeeping requirement of section 3730(e)(4)(A) and (B) of the False Claims Act, because, as discussed in greater detail later, the Debtors' influence, though not specifically control, over Governor Scott was already publicly disclosed in the \"Florida Bulldog\" articles that the Debtors' motion to dismiss quotes and which I can take judicial notice of. In fact, the Debtors' political influence, if not control, over Florida's governor was the main focus of those articles, which also disclose unusual, non-market features of the Broward Contract (which also, they state, were previously publicly disclosed in the Broward Health Board minutes and are available in the Debtors' SEC filings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As far as the complaint is concerned, therefore, Rubin is just the mouthpiece for the Debtors' previously publicly disclosed political influence, nothing more. Because the complaint does not assert anything material beyond what was already publicly disclosed, it thus runs afoul of section 3730(e)(4)(A) and (B) of the False Claims Act. That is, the complaint's remaining Anti-Kickback Statute allegations are, at\n   their core, substantially the same as previously published in the news media and the Board's minutes, and the complaint does not evince a knowledge that is independent of and materially added to those publicly-disclosed allegations or transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Again, the complaint fails the initial, critical test of establishing the scope of Rubin's agency and what Ruben did in that role. Florida law, which applies here to the complaint's description of Rubin's agency relationship since all the relevant activity occurred in Florida, recognizes three ways that a principal can be held liable for the acts of its agent within the scope and course of the agency-a proposition that, if in fact the agency is properly established, is clear.\n   <em>\n    Roessler v.

Apparent authority \"rests on appearances created by the principal and not by the agent that the agent is, in fact, acting as an agent for the principal.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrington v.

Again, though, the complaint does not satisfy these requirements except in a conclusory or ineffective fashion. It fails to allege the context and scope of Rubin's agency-and therefore also fails to allege the Debtors' acknowledgment of Rubin's power to act on their behalf or that the Debtors retained the right to control Rubin-with any particularity, let alone that the Debtors' authorized Rubin to exert improper pressure on Nask. The complaint also does not provide the details required by Rule 9(b) as to Rubin's performance of his agency with Nask.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, \"implied authority\" can be established under Florida law for an agent to act in a way incidental to or as is reasonably necessary to accomplish an actual agency relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Board of Trustees of the City of Delray Beach Police and Firefighters Retirement System v.

Having failed to plead Rubin's actual or apparent agency with any particularity, however, the complaint does not plead \"implied authority,\" either, let alone implied authority to offer improper inducements to Nask.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, Rubin's agency is at the center of the Anti-Kickback Statute claim: in the complaint, the Debtors act through him. If the complaint is to add materially to the prior public disclosures, it therefore would be in the complaint's description of Rubin's agency and actions.

LEXIS 27503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *42 n.22, the complaint alleges that the Plaintiff understood Rubin to be the Debtors' lobbyist based on Rubin's (although not the Debtors') statements. Indeed, the complaint alleges that some time after the Broward Contract was entered, the Plaintiff met again with Rubin, who reiterated that he was the Debtors' lobbyist, as well as met with Dosoretz. Nevertheless, the complaint fails to plead the scope of Rubin's agency with any particularity and Plaintiff's counsel has acknowledged it to be unknown although it was within Plaintiff's power to explore whether, for example, the Debtors directed Rubin to threaten Nask with the loss of his job, or directed Rubin to control Florida's governor to direct Broward Health's Board of Commissioners to improve Nask's retirement and severance package.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Thus I conclude that these deficiencies in the complaint raise two independent grounds for the complaint's dismissal. First, because the complaint hinges upon allegations that Rubin acted on behalf of the Debtors in making threats to Nask that he could actually deliver on, such as that Nask would lose his job and retirement benefits, or that he would keep his job and keep the retirement benefits, depending on whether he supported the Broward Contract, the complaint fails because it does not describe the scope and nature of Rubin's lobbying role with sufficient particularity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Indeed, I believe that Rubin's role and actions are not even pled sufficiently for purposes of Rule 8, given the conclusory nature of its allegations and the implausibility, without more, that Rubin, even if directed to do so by the Debtors, had the power actually to control Governor Scott regarding Broward Health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Last, the motion to dismiss correctly states that under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4) the relator must assert claims that are not substantially similar to the allegations or underlying facts previously publicly disclosed in the \"news media\" unless the person bringing the action is an original source of that information or provided it in a timely fashion to the Government.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Given all of the other disclosures in the articles and the Board minutes-such as that the Debtors obtained a no-bid contract of extraordinary length, Nask's statement that the prior contractor lost $3.5 million annually, and questions therefore raised about the reason for the Debtors' eagerness to obtain the contract-the complaint's HealX discussion falls into the \"extra detail\" category described as insufficient in\n   <em>\n    Chen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Patriarca\n   </em>\n   and the other cases cited earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   That leaves, then, the complaint's discussion of Rubin's lobbying effort, which was\n   not mentioned in the \"Florida Bulldog\" articles or otherwise publicly disclosed. But, as I have already held, the complaint does not discuss the nature and scope of Rubin's alleged agency with sufficient particularity to satisfy Rule 9(b), and, indeed, when discussing Rubin's role the complaint has serious plausibility problems under Rule 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Lobbyists generally are hired because of their political connections. It would be odd to hire a lobbyist who doesn't have a good relationship with the politician that he or she is supposed to lobby. The good relationship between the alleged principal, 21st Century, and Governor Scott is already highlighted in the \"Florida Bulldog\" articles. The complaint's additional allegations with regard to Rubin's lobbying relationship I believe therefore would need be more specific-and more specific in particular as to wrongdoing-than simply standing for the fact that Rubin had political influence. To add materially to the prior public disclosure, the complaint would have to allege, I believe, that Rubin actually controlled Governor Scott, as if Governor Scott were his puppet, for example, and that the Debtors hired him for that purpose, as opposed to Rubin's simply being able to remind Governor Scott that the Debtors were a campaign contributor and a significant supporter, which the \"Florida Bulldog\" articles already disclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The complaint clearly does not make that kind of allegation other than, I believe, in an implausible and conclusory way when it asserts that the Plaintiff was told he needed to speak to Rubin to enhance his chances to be appointed to the Broward Health Board and that Rubin separately boasted that he \"controlled\" the appointments (which frankly I view as puffery).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Even assuming that all of Rubin's agency relationship on behalf of the Debtors was outside of the Plaintiff's ken, which I don't think is a fair assumption based on the complaint's own allegations, the Plaintiff has the burden to at least allege a substantial basis in fact to draw the inference that Rubin (a) was tasked by the Debtors with obtaining the Broward Contract by improperly offering remuneration to Nask and (b) plausibly had the power over Governor Scott to deliver on his threats and promises, and I do not believe that the complaint does so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   I have not yet addressed whether the Plaintiff satisfies the second, additional test of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B)(2), which is that he be an \"original source\" of information that materially and timely contributed or added to the public disclosure. However, based on the foregoing analysis, it is clear that the complaint does not meet that test, either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The people of Florida elected Governor Scott, giving him the power to select Broward Health's Board of Commissioners, subject to the people's displeasure depending on how he uses it. The complaint adds nothing material to the prior public disclosure that the Debtors had political influence with the Governor, which he, in turn, might exert over the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Accordingly, the remaining aspect of the motion to dismiss is granted. Counsel for the Debtors should submit an order granting the motion in full for the reasons stated in my bench rulings. The order should provide that the Plaintiff has 30 days from the date of such order to file a motion for leave to amend the complaint under Bankruptcy Rule 7015, which motion should attach the proposed second amended complaint, blacklined against the complaint that I have dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Although the complaint at issue is styled a \"First Amended Complaint to Determine Dischargeability of Debt Pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(6),\" this is the first motion to dismiss that the Court has considered in this adversary proceeding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    It is also worth noting that this adversary proceeding actually involves two complaints: the first being the complaint in this adversary proceeding, which seeks a declaration of non-dischargeability under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(6) of the claims under the False Claims Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n     31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -33, which were asserted against the Debtors in the second complaint, in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to and is incorporated in the first complaint.
