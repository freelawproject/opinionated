The first is a motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 24) filed by Plaintiffs Frank and Josephine Coluccio (\"Plaintiffs\") seeking to deny discharge of a debt owed to them by Debtor John Sevastakis (\"Debtor\") under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). Debtor opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion (ECF No. 27) seeking summary judgment in his favor on all counts of Plaintiffs' Complaint. The Court has read all submissions, considered the arguments made during the hearing on August 6, 2018, and has reviewed the state court materials and transcripts supplied by counsel. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' motion is GRANTED and Debtor's motion is DENIED. The debt is deemed nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The pertinent facts, which are undisputed and determinative of this case, are as follows: Plaintiffs entered into a written contract with Sevas Builders, Inc. for certain renovations and an addition to their single-family home. On September 28, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Ocean County, seeking damages from Sevas Builders, Inc. and from Debtor (individually and as owner of Sevas Builders, Inc.) based upon breach of contract, negligence, breach of warranty, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, and violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, N.J. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 56:8 (\"NJCFA\"). After a fourteen-day nonjury trial in Monmouth County Superior Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the state court judge issued an Opinion and an Order for Judgment-dated June 7, 2013-and an Amended Order for Judgment-dated June 17, 2013-finding Debtor and Sevas Builders, Inc. jointly and severally liable to Plaintiffs in the amount of $761,527 for fraud and various misrepresentations. Debtor appealed and the New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed the superior court decision. The specifics of the state court's findings, as they relate to the motions presently before this Court, will be discussed in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 5, 2017, Debtor filed a voluntary petition for chapter 7 relief.

Br. Supp. Summ. J. 17, ECF No. 24-2. Therefore, Plaintiffs implicate all three grounds for relief under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and focus on the second method for establishing a \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) claim against a debtor-contractor: material misrepresentation of fact or qualifications. In support of their motion, Plaintiffs rely solely on the state trial court's findings of fraud and misrepresentation. In relevant part, Plaintiffs' motion cites: (1) Debtor's forgery of Plaintiff's signature on the permit application, and related misrepresentations; (2) Debtor's misrepresentations regarding his ability to draw architectural plans; (3) Debtor's misrepresentations to the township regarding the proposed non-residential use for the addition; (4) Debtor's failure to advise Plaintiffs that they would need a licensed architect or design professional to prepare drawings; (5) Debtor's failure to provide the project with a crawl space as indicated in the initial plans and agreement; and (6) Debtor's failure to build the addition to conform with requirements under the applicable building code. Plaintiffs argue that the opinion of the state trial court in the prior litigation makes findings with respect to each of these frauds and/or misrepresentations sufficient to satisfy the elements of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). Accordingly, Plaintiffs assert that the award of treble damages and attorney's fees and costs for violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act is nondischargeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In his cross motion, Debtor takes the position that the state court did not make any findings with respect to his intent and, therefore, Plaintiffs cannot satisfy their burden under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) as a matter of law. Debtor also asserts that issues exist as to his individual liability and seeks summary judgment in his favor as to Plaintiffs' claims under \u00a7 523(a)(6) and \u00a7 727(a)(5). The Court does not find Debtor's arguments persuasive and, for the reasons set forth below, determines that Plaintiffs have established all elements of\n   \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) in the debtor-contractor context by a preponderance of the evidence and, as such, are entitled to summary judgment on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Material Misrepresentations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On this record, the Court determines that Debtor made significant misrepresentations and created a false pretense when he entered into the contract with Plaintiffs. As an initial matter, the state court determined that Debtor had \"fail[ed] to advise the plaintiffs of the requirement that they retain a licensed architect or design professional to prepare the drawings.\" Pls.'

Instead, Debtor \"misrepresent[ed] that [he] was qualified to design a roof that would comport with the plaintiffs' expectations under the contract.\" State Court Opinion at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Further, by entering into the contract with Plaintiffs, Debtor represented-both expressly and impliedly-that he would \"obtain [the] necessary building permits,\" comply with all applicable ordinances, and complete the project in a lawful manner. State Court Opinion at 14. Despite these representations, Debtor engaged in the work without regard to appropriate permits, inspections, or compliance with other rules and laws. As the state court observed, Debtor \"was comfortable with 'bending the rules' if needed to make the job more profitable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. It is evident from the record that Debtor not only bent the rules-but broke the rules-during the permit process. Debtor fraudulently signed the owner-Plaintiff's name on the permit application that he submitted to the township. With respect to this issue, the trial court found that Debtor had\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   signed [Plaintiff's] name on the permit application to the township under the 'owner's certification section,' rather than signing his own name under the section to be completed by an agent 'if the applicant is not the owner in fee.' [Debtor] admitted that [Plaintiff] had not given him express authorization to sign his name and could give no good reason for signing [Plaintiff's] name, other than to say that he did it 'because I felt they trusted me.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   State Court Opinion at 24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The state court further noted that the permit indicated that Plaintiff had prepared the plans, and that the building was being used exclusively as a single-family residence. In fact, the plans were drawn by Debtor and the addition should have been labeled for \"mixed use.\" The state court also found that Debtor made an intentional misrepresentation to the township when he referred to the addition as a \"great room\" on the permit application, as opposed to a \"school room\" as contemplated by the parties and memorialized in the contract documents. State Court Opinion at 26 n.20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At trial, Debtor gave no plausible explanation for the actions he took and the misrepresentations he made, nor does he dispute or explain these misrepresentations in his Opposition to Plaintiffs' motion. In light of Debtor's undisputed statements and actions, this Court determines that Plaintiffs have met their burden of establishing the first element of a claim under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) by a preponderance of the evidence. This Court finds that Debtor made false material misrepresentations regarding his qualifications to prepare plans for the project, the need for an architect or design professional to prepare plans, and\n   his method for obtaining permits and performing work as contemplated in the parties' contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Knowledge that the Representation was False\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Another element which must be shown to establish a cause of action for nondischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) is that, at the time that the debtor made the representations or omissions, he knew that those representations were false, or that they were made with gross recklessness as to their truth.\n   <em>\n    In re Purington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201945510\">\n    2012 WL 1945510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Cohen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6469381\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/191/599/#p605\">\n    191 B.R. 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605 (D.N.J. 1996)\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6476205,7649718\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/52/\">\n    106 F.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1997),\n   <em>\n    aff'd sub nom.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen v. de la Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/\">\n    523 U.S. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"168136\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/118/1212/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Here, there is no question that Debtor knew that the representations he was making were false. As an experienced contractor, Debtor understood his qualifications and limitations regarding his ability to draw plans, and he was familiar with the permit process. Nevertheless, he withheld the need for an architect or design professional from Plaintiffs and misrepresented his own ability to draw the plans. Debtor also was aware of his obligation to obtain the necessary building permits under the contract and knowingly skirted that obligation when he forged Plaintiff's signature and falsely reported who would be performing the work, who had prepared the plans, and the type of work that was to be done. Debtor gave no explanation during the state court proceedings, or in his submissions in the present case, which would dissuade this Court from concluding that his misrepresentations were knowingly false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Intent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In order to succeed in a claim under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), a plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that a debtor possessed the requisite intent to deceive. Because a debtor will rarely admit to intentional deception, the intent element of a claim under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) is generally inferred from totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    In re Bocchino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317532,4286062\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/376/\">\n    794 F.3d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Chung-Hwan Kim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20671467\">\n    2018 WL 671467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *28 (collecting cases and observing that, because a debtor will rarely admit to acting with an intent to deceive, courts may consider circumstantial evidence regarding the debtor's intent);\n   <em>\n    In re Altieri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203595298\">\n    2012 WL 3595298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (holding that \"courts may infer the element of intent based on circumstantial evidence\"). In this case, Plaintiffs assert that the state court's findings are sufficient to satisfy their burden of establishing intent. In his Opposition and Cross-Motion, Debtor contends that the state court opinion contains no discussion with regard to intent to deceive; accordingly, Debtor concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to, and on this record cannot, establish the requisite intent. In support of his position Debtor observes that the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act does not require a finding of \"intent to deceive,\" and he argues that a finding of violation of the NJCFA cannot have a preclusive effect when determining nondischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). This Court agrees to an extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A dischargeability determination rooted in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) cannot rely\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on a state court judgment under the NJCFA because \"the NJCFA applies a strict liability standard to unlawful conduct by contractors while section 523(a)(2)(A) requires actual intent to defraud.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Altieri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203595298\">\n    2012 WL 3595298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Purington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201945510\">\n    2012 WL 1945510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13 (holding that a debtor's violation of the NJCFA did not render a debt nondischargeable because the NJCFA does not require the element of intent to deceive). However, this Court's determination is not bottomed on Debtor's violation of the NJCFA. Rather, it rests on the entirety of the record\n   and the totality of the circumstances-including a state court opinion replete with factual findings evidencing Debtor's deceitful intent.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Melendez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512069\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/260/\">\n    589 B.R. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2018) (holding that collateral estoppel allows a bankruptcy court to accept certain factual findings from a previous action as evidence of nondischargeability and to consider whether those findings establish the elements of dischargeability exception).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Specifically, as discussed above, Debtor misrepresented his qualifications and ability to design a roof that would comport with Plaintiffs' expectations under the contract. The Court is mindful that in the debtor-contractor context breach of contract or shoddy workmanship is insufficient to establish a claim under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Chung-Hwan Kim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20671467\">\n    2018 WL 671467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *22. However, the facts of this case go beyond mere breach of contract or poor work performance. In this case, the state court found that Debtor was an experienced contractor; yet he did not give thought as to how to build a roof consistent with the terms of the contract until after the project was well underway-at which point it was too late. The Debtor could have employed an architect or design engineer to assist, but purposefully opted to mislead the Plaintiffs and the township regarding a need for such independent expertise. In short, Debtor represented to Plaintiffs that he was qualified to draw up plans for their roof without actually giving consideration to a workable design or his ability to draw same. At a minimum, such conduct constitutes gross recklessness sufficient to establish the intent element of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bocchino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317532,4286062\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/376/\">\n    794 F.3d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As stated, Debtor withheld the need for an architect or design professional from Plaintiffs. Such a material omission cannot be considered merely negligent when one considers the lengths to which Debtor went to avoid drawing both Plaintiffs' and the township's attention toward the project and the architect requirement. Specifically, Debtor made material misrepresentations on the permit application as to who would be performing the work, who had prepared the plans, who would serve as general contractor, and the type of work being performed. The state court explicitly found that Debtor made these misrepresentations because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [i]f [Debtor] disclosed that he was the principal contractor and was the person making the application, he could not use his own drawings to support the application. Similarly, had [Debtor] disclosed that the construction had a potential 'mixed use,' the Town would not have accepted [Debtor's] plans and the plaintiffs, in all probability, would have been required to engage an architect - a circumstance which would have undoubtedly avoided many of the problems that arose during this project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   State Court Opinion at 25-26. Accordingly, the record indicates that Debtor intentionally lied on the permit application to avoid drawing attention to the project, and to trick the township and Plaintiffs into using his own drawings as opposed to those of a licensed architect or design professional. Furthermore, Debtor admittedly forged Plaintiff's signature on the application document to accomplish this goal. Debtor does not offer any explanation or present any argument suggesting that his intentions were honest in this respect. Based on these circumstances, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that Debtor made these misrepresentations intentionally to deceive the township and Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Given the totality of the circumstances in the instant case, this Court concludes\n   that Plaintiffs have established the intent element of a \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) claim by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

At the very least, Plaintiffs were justified in their reliance on Debtor to obtain the necessary permits and inspections, and were under no obligation to conduct an investigation to ensure that Debtor had not forged their signature or misreported information on the permit application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

D.N.J. 2004) ). In this case, there is no question that Plaintiffs were damaged by Debtor's actions and representations. The state court made extensive findings regarding the damages,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   State Court Opinion at 35-44, and determined that the extensive defects in the construction required demolition and reconstruction. Those defects could have been avoided if Debtor had not misrepresented his qualifications and, instead, had adhered to the contract, submitted proper drawings, and subjected the project to inspections by accurately filling out the permit application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Debtor's Arguments and Opposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As set forth above, in his Motion and Opposition, Debtor asserts that\n   Plaintiffs have failed to make any argument regarding \"piercing the corporate veil\" or based on an \"alter ego\" theory and, thus, cannot show that Debtor, individually, is liable for the entire amount of the judgment. Debtor further states that the state court's opinion did not distinguish between Debtor and his company when it made the relevant findings. Debtor's argument fails for several reasons. First, contrary to Debtor's assertion, the state court's opinion is replete with specific findings with respect to Debtor's actions as an individual.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , State Court Opinion at 25, 26, 29. Moreover, the concepts of an alter ego and of piercing the corporate veil are employed as a method of determining liability. In this case, the state court already settled the issue of liability and determined that Debtor, in his individual capacity, and Sevas Builders, Inc. are jointly and severally liable for the amount of the judgment. \"A liability is joint and several when the creditor may sue one or more of the parties to such liability separately, or all of them together, at his [or her] option.\"\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v.
