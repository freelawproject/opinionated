Collins, and Janelle Collins's appeal from the Bankruptcy Court's order entering judgment in favor of Appellee Nancy L. Wolf. (ECF No. 1.) Appellants filed an amended opening brief, (\"Appellant Br.,\" ECF No. 9), Appellee filed an answering brief, (\"Appellee Br.,\" ECF No. 16), and Appellants then filed a reply brief, (\"Reply,\" ECF No. 17). Having considered the parties' arguments, the record on appeal, and the law, the Court rules as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This lawsuit arises out of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing by Debtor-Appellant Chadwick Collins (\"Chadwick\") and the sale of a property located at 1480 Beechtree Road, San Marcos, California 92078 (\"the Property\"). Chadwick and his spouse, Janelle Collins (\"Janelle\"), purchased the Property on December 19, 2000, and took title from a third party developer, Shea Homes Limited Partnership. (Excerpt of Record (\"ER\"), ECF No. 9-1, at 62.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The grant deed from Shea Homes to the Collins was granted to \"Husband and Wife as Joint Tenants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Only the third-party developer signed the deed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2002, the Collins subsequently decided to sell the property to Chadwick's father, Charles Collins (\"Charles\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2002, Charles drafted a Purchase Agreement identifying Chadwick and Janelle as \"Sellers\" and Charles as \"Purchaser.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65.) The Purchase Agreement intended to transfer the Collins' interest in the property to Charles, with title to be held in joint tenancy between Charles and a family trust (\"The Collins Family Trust\"). The Purchase Agreement quoted a $385,000.00 purchase price, which was comprised of a $93,000 down payment Charles would pay to Chadwick and Janelle and Charles' assumption of Chadwick and Janelle's $292,000 mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Chadwick later testified that he understood that the Purchase Agreement meant that Charles would make all loan payments and Chadwick would no longer be responsible for loan payments. (Appellee Br. 13.) However, Charles never assumed the existing loan and the loan remained\n   in Chadwick's name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) The agreement also provided that, \"upon closing,\" title to the Property would be held by Charles in joint tenancy with the Collins Family Trust. (ER 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2002, before moving out of the Property, Chadwick refinanced the existing loan through an employee loan program available through Chadwick's then-employer, Merrill Lynch. (Appellee Br. 14.) At the time he applied for the new loan, Chadwick represented that he owned the Property and did not disclose the pending purchase agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Chadwick also testified that, at the time he acquired the new financing, he believed that he had not transferred any interests in the property to Charles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.) Both the existing financing (pre-September 2002) and new financing documents-both through Merrill Lynch-provided that Merrill Lynch could demand repayment of the loan in full if Chadwick transferred his interest in the Property without prior written approval from Merrill Lynch Credit Corporation, the lender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2002, Chadwick and Janelle vacated the Property and Charles assumed control of the Property as of January 1, 2003. (ER 81-82.) The Collins \"closed\" the Purchase Agreement in December 2002, but did not execute a deed transferring title. From January 2003 until December 2016, when Charles turned over the Property to Appellee, Charles had received, paid, and claimed all income and expenses for the Property on his state and federal income taxes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85.) Chadwick and Janelle have paid no expenses, received no income, and have not claimed either expenses or income on their income taxes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74-76.) Charles leased out the Property and paid the monthly mortgage, property taxes, insurance, and homeowners' association (\"HOA\") fees. (Appellee Br. 15.) Chadwick testified that he changed the mailing address on the Merrill Lunch statements to Charles's office, but left his own name on the account. (Trustee's Excerpt of Record (\"TER\"), ECF No. 16-1, at 34-37.) Chadwick also retained his property insurance policy in his own name and had billing statements mailed to his new home. Property taxes and HOA statements remained in Chadwick and Janelle's names. (Appellee Br. 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2008, Chadwick refinanced the loan and deed trust on the property with Merrill Lynch. (ER 43.) In the loan application, Chadwick represented that he and Janelle were the sole owners of the Property and there were no unrecorded encumbrances. (Appellee Br. 15.) Chadwick testified that he did not tell Merrill Lynch that Charles had any interest in the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Charles did not sign the note or trust deed and did not make any representations to Merrill Lynch. The terms of the refinanced loan stated \"[t]his loan is not assumable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) And, like the prior refinancing, Merrill Lynch could require full repayment of the loan if the Property was sold or transferred without Merrill Lynch's prior written consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 26, 2011, Chadwick signed a quitclaim deed to Charles and the Collins Family Trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Janelle did not sign the quitclaim deed and the deed was never recorded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On December 7, 2011, Chadwick filed bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; Janelle did not join the petition and is not a co-debtor. The Property remained in Charles' possession and he continued to rent the Property out to tenants. Chadwick scheduled the Property as \"held for another person,\" i.e., for Charles, on his bankruptcy schedule. On March 7, 2013, the Trustee-Appellee Nancy Wolf filed suit against Chadwick, Janelle, and Charles asserting claims for declaratory relief, sale of jointly held property under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h),\n   and turnover of the Property. (ER 4-18.) Appellee's legal theory was that Charles acquired no right, title, or interest in the Property under the 2002 Purchase Agreement; that the Purchase Agreement had lapsed and was no longer in effect; the Property was the community property of Chadwick and Janelle; and that the Property belonged to the bankruptcy estate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Charles had no right, title, or interest in the Property. Additionally, Appellee did not initially assert a claim for net rents against Charles for the rents he collected from tenants from when Chadwick filed his bankruptcy petition until the time Charles turned over the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellants moved for summary judgment in 2014, asserting that Chadwick and Janelle held the Property in joint tenancy, rather than community property. Judge Peter Bowie found that Chadwick and Janelle held legal title to the property as joint tenants, i.e., as separate property and not community property. (ER 37-38.) Judge Bowie retired and the case transferred to Judge Laura Taylor's docket. Judge Taylor tried the case in two phases. At the conclusion of the first phase, Judge Taylor issued an oral ruling finding that Charles had no right, title, or interest in the property and that Chadwick and Janelle owned the property at the time Chadwick filed his bankruptcy petition. (TER 38-68.) Judge Taylor subsequently determined that Judge Bowie's previous community property holding was interlocutory and should be revisited in light of the California Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Valli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4000671\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/58/1396/\">\n    58 Cal. 4th 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=171%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20454\">\n    171 Cal.Rptr.3d 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20P.3d%20274\">\n    324 P.3d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Judge Taylor then ruled that Chadwick and Janelle owned the Property as community property and, therefore, the Property belonged entirely to the bankruptcy estate. (ER 104-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Judge Taylor also determined that Appellee had a valid claim against Charles for turnover of post-petition rent, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 114-18), and later ordered Charles to turn over the property, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 119-20). The Collins appealed the turnover order on December 27, 2016, but did not obtain a stay of the turnover order. (TER 73-75.) On September 19, 2017, Judge Roger T. Benitez granted Appellee's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99-107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Judge Taylor tried the second phase and found that Appellee had a valid claim for post-petition net rent, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142), and ordered Charles pay $44,313.41 in net rent to the bankruptcy estate, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 148-60). In July 2017, Appellee moved to sell the Property under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which Judge Taylor approved, and the Collins did not obtain a stay of the sale order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90-93.) The Property was sold to a third party purchaser in August 2017. The sale proceeds were paid to several creditors and the remainder to Chadwick's bankruptcy estate. On October 4, 2017, Judge Taylor entered a final judgment against the Collins, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 163-67), and this timely appeal followed the next day, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 166-71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Federal district courts have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final judgments, orders, and decrees of bankruptcy courts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellee contends that Appellants' appeal is moot because the bankruptcy court entered an order approving sale, (Appellee Br. 26 (citing TER 90-93) ), and Appellants did not request or obtain a stay of the sale order, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Appellants contend that their appeal is not moot for two reasons: Appellee waived the mootness issue and Appellants do not seek to set aside the sale of the property or payments made to secured creditors. (Reply 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Generally, there are three mootness doctrines in bankruptcy cases-constitutional, equitable, and statutory-and only equitable and statutory mootness are at issue in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will first address Appellants' waiver issue and then address the mootness issue on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Waiver of Mootness Issue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As a threshold to the mootness issue, Appellants argue that Appellee waived her mootness argument because Appellee did not designate mootness as an issue on appeal, did not bring a motion, and did not cross appeal. (Reply 5.) Appellants contend Appellee is not entitled to raise this issue for the first time in her answering brief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The appellant in a bankruptcy appeal has the burden to include a statement of issues. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8009(a)(1)(A). The appellee may designate additional issues. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8009(a)(2). An appellant's opening brief must contain the statement of issues and arguments to support the issues. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8014(a)(5), (7). The appellee's brief must conform to the same requirements as the appellant, but need not include a statement of the issues unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the appellant's statement. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8014(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, Appellants' opening brief included at least two issues relevant to the mootness question: \"Did the Bankruptcy Court err in determining that Plaintiff could sell, use or lease the Property pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ?\" and \"Did the Bankruptcy Court err in ordering Chadwick, Janelle, and Charles to immediately deliver to Plaintiff any and all possession,\n   custody, or control of the Property?\" (Appellant Br. 10.) These two issues directly implicate whether the bankruptcy court correctly issued the turnover order and the sale order. Appellants characterize mootness as a discrete issue, separate and apart from the turnover and sale orders. It is not clear to the Court how it could reverse the bankruptcy court on those issues without addressing whether those same issues are also moot. Instead, the Court finds that mootness is an argument bound up with Appellants' issues and will address mootness on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, as will be seen, the Court finds mootness only applies to the sale of the Property, which Appellants state they do not seek to set aside. (Reply 5.) Thus, Appellants are not unduly prejudiced by considering mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

(Appellee Br. 26 (citing ER 119-20, 163-67; TER 90-93).) Appellants do not contest that they did not seek a stay at any stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because Appellants did not obtain a stay, they cannot challenge the order of sale.

While\n   <em>\n    Thorpe\n   </em>\n   limited its analysis to plan consummation, the Ninth Circuit has held that the same principle applies to any equitable mootness analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mortgs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4312036,4290838\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1211/\">\n    771 F.3d at 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As previously discussed, Appellants did not seek a stay. Substantial consummation of the plan has occurred; the Property was sold and nearly fifty percent of the assets have been distributed to creditors. A remedy against the property or proceeds already distributed to creditors would create negative effects on their rights and interests. The bankruptcy court could not easily unwind the sale order and Appellants do not seek to unwind the sale. Thus, under both statutory and equitable mootness principles the property sale should not be undone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Appellee next contends that equitable mootness should extend to Charles's defense against Appellee's claim for turnover of post-petition rent. (Appellee Br. 28.) Appellee does not explain her reasoning other than referencing that \"those issues should also be considered equitably moot based on the same factors set forth above.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For their part, Appellants focus on the payment of fees from the sale proceeds to Appellee. (Reply 5.) The bankruptcy court ordered payment of fees from the sale proceed funds to Appellee, Appellants objected, but the court overruled the objection, stating \"[a]ll fee and costs allowed by this order may be subject to disgorgement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Bankr. Case No. 1-19790, ECF No. 140).) Appellants acknowledge, however, that the fee orders were not designated as an issue on appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 n.1.) Appellants are silent on post-petition rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court discerns the following possible relief. First, Appellants argue the bankruptcy court improperly denied Charles compensation for the loss of exclusive possession of the property and his $93,000 down payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Second, they contend the court erred by ordering Charles to turnover post-petition net rents to the bankruptcy estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Third, though not designated on appeal, the bankruptcy\n   court could order fees and costs be disgorged. The\n   <em>\n    Thorpe\n   </em>\n   factors do not support applying equitable mootness as to these avenues of relief. If the Court were to remand the case, the bankruptcy court could order payments made to Charles from the sale proceeds or excuse Charles from turning over rental proceeds (or order reimbursement of rent if turnover has already occurred). Those remedies could be awarded by the bankruptcy court without substantial disruption to third parties or creating an uncontrollable situation. It would simply mean less money in the bankruptcy estate and less money for creditors. Thus, considering the heavy burden to demonstrate mootness, the Court is satisfied that some potential relief remains available for Appellants and their appeal is not entirely moot. Accordingly, the Court will address the remainder of the appeal on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Transmutation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Appellants first argue that the bankruptcy court erred by determining the Property was community property. (Appellant Br. 16.)

Appellants' theory is that the Property was separate property, not community property, as evidenced by the fact that Chadwick and Janelle held record title to the Property as joint tenants. (Appellant Br. 20.) There are two California statutes that are relevant here. First, California Evidence Code \u00a7 662 provides that the \"owner of legal title to property is presumed to be the owner of the full beneficial title. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing proof.\" Second, California Family Code \u00a7 760 states, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, all property, real or personal, wherever situated, acquired by a married person during the marriage while domiciled in this state is community property.\" The dispositive issue here is whether the bankruptcy court erred by determining that the community property presumption, i.e., section 760, applied over the form of title presumption, i.e., section 662.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Appellants urge a similar result here. (Appellant Br. 32; Reply 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Appellee maintains that the doctrine of equitable conversion is a form of specific performance, which requires a breach by one party of the contract. (Appellee Br. 42.) Appellee then contends that the bankruptcy court reviewed the extrinsic evidence to determine that Chadwick and Janelle did not breach the 2002 purchase agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43.) For example, Chadwick testified that he and Janelle did not transfer the Property to Charles because Charles wanted to keep Chadwick's favorable Merrill Lynch loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2008, in order to secure a new favorable loan, Chadwick represented to Merrill Lynch that he and Janelle owned the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Charles knowingly accepted the benefits of Chadwick's performance by taking advantage of the lower interest rate available only by Chadwick representing to Merrill Lynch that he and Janelle owned the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Appellee contends that the bankruptcy court did not err in finding that the parties waived the transfer provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Appellants respond that the bankruptcy court's ruling that the parties waived the right to title or modified a term simply meant that the sellers (Chadwick and Janelle) retained a legal interest in the Property, but did not divest Charles of his equitable interest in the Property. (Reply 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   It is clear that specific performance is a remedy for a breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , 28 Cal. App. 4th at 1220,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20716\">\n    34 Cal.Rptr.2d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   court stated, \"[i]t is apparent that plaintiffs' insistence on proving their right to specific performance was premised on the principle that '[a]n unconditional contract for the sale of land, of which specific performance would be decreed, grants the purchaser equitable title, and equity considers him the owner.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1222,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20716\">\n    34 Cal.Rptr.2d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Thus, without a breach of the 2002 purchase agreement, there is no specific performance and no equitable conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The bankruptcy court determined that title was never transferred to Charles, as was required by the agreement, and the parties mutually agreed to abandon or waive that term. (ECF No. 13-2, at 129.) The court went on to hold that the Collins either never intended to comply with the title transfer term or at some later date mutually agreed not to comply with that\n   term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130.) The court based its findings on several factors: (1) the failure to record a deed after the purchase agreement closed; (2) Janelle's failure to execute the deed dated in 2011, by which Chadwick and Charles tried to change ownership; and (3) representations Chadwick made to his employer-lender when he obtained favorable financing for the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Every time Chadwick financed or refinanced the Property, he represented that he, not Charles, owned both the legal and beneficial interest in the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the court, the motive to abandon the transfer of title term was clear: the Collins could only obtain a favorable loan from Chadwick's employer, Merrill Lynch, if Chadwick and Janelle, but not Charles, had 100% ownership interest in the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The interpretation of a contract is a mixed question of law and fact. An appellate court reviews de novo interpretation of contract language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Safeco Title Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"311910\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/758/364/#p367\">\n    758 F.2d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 367 (9th Cir. 1985). \"When the inquiry focuses on extrinsic evidence of related facts, however, the trial court's conclusions will not be reversed unless they are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"311910\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/758/364/#p367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). The bankruptcy court determined there was no breach of the 2002 purchase agreement because the unfulfilled term-transfer of title-was either waived or abandoned. (ECF No. 13-1, at 1238 (bankruptcy court's April 8, 2012 oral order).) This is a conclusion based on extrinsic facts and is reviewed for clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The facts support the bankruptcy court's holding; the Collins failed to transfer title and had a clear financial benefit for maintaining title in Chadwick and Janelle's names. The bankruptcy court found that when Chadwick applied for a financing loan from his employer, he represented that there was no transfer of the Property and that he would notify the lender if the Property were transferred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1228-30.) Chadwick and Janelle insured the Property and named themselves as the insureds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1230.) Further, when the Property suffered water damage in a later year, the invoice to the insurer was submitted in Chadwick's name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1230-31.) The monthly HOA statements were mailed to Charles' office, but named Chadwick and Janelle as the owners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1231.) The court also determined that Charles knew that a quitclaim deed would be required to close the 2002 purchase agreement, but Charles never asked for a deed to be executed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court did not find credible Charles' statement that he \"forgot\" to take title in his name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1238-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Appellants focus mostly on what Charles did-he made a down payment, paid the mortgage, and otherwise fulfilled his obligations. While there is evidence to support the finding that Charles fulfilled his terms, the appropriate focus is on the unfulfilled term-whether Chadwick and Janelle transferred title. The court determined that Chadwick and Janelle did not breach the unfulfilled term because Charles consented to the failure to transfer title. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1241.) Moreover, the court found that Chadwick testified that he and Janelle fully performed the 2002 purchase agreement when they departed the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1231.) The court also found Charles testified that \"the purchase agreement would close when he paid the down payment and got possession of the property. There were no other requirements for closing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1234.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The facts here are clearly distinguishable from those in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ; there, the seller refused to sign the escrow documents and therefore breached the contract. Here, Chadwick did not refuse to carry out the transfer; instead, the parties either waived\n   or abandoned that term and the factual findings support that conclusion. Without breach, there can be no equitable conversion. Therefore, the bankruptcy court did not err in holding that there was no equitable conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Oral Modification\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Appellants also argue that the bankruptcy court erred by finding that the 2002 purchase agreement had been modified because there are limited circumstances, not met here, in which a written contract may be orally modified. (Appellant Br. 34.) Appellants contend that because the purchase agreement was not modified, then the parties were obligated to perform according to the original terms of the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.) Thus, the failure to perform meant that there was a breach of the purchase agreement entitling Charles to damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Appellee does not address the oral modification argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Appellants are correct that a contract in writing may be modified by an oral agreement \"to the extent that the oral agreement is executed by the parties.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201698\">\n    Cal.

However, the bankruptcy court did not determine there was an oral modification of the contract; it determined that the parties either mutually abandoned the term, (ECF No. 13-1, at 1241), or waived the term, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1242 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gould v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Appellants contend that if the purchase agreement required formal assumption of the secured note by Charles and transfer of record title by Chadwick and Janelle to Charles, then both sides had substantial outstanding performance\n   obligations such that the contract was an executory agreement subject to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38.) Finally, Appellants contend that because Appellee did not assume the executory contract under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), then Charles was entitled to remain in possession of the property and have Appellee turn title over to him under \u00a7 365(i).

(Appellee Br. 45.) The bankruptcy court determined that Charles waived the requirement for a transfer of title in order to take advantage of Chadwick's favorable Merrill Lynch loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Appellee, only Charles had unperformed obligations-assumption of the existing loan-and the agreement was not executory on both sides. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Chadwick omitted the purchase agreement from his Bankruptcy Schedule G, which required disclosure of executory contracts, thus impliedly admitting the purchase agreement was not executory.

While Charles had remaining obligations, i.e., to assume the existing loan, there was no corresponding outstanding obligation on the part of Chadwick and Janelle. Appellants contend that Chadwick and Janelle had not relinquished the right exclusively to possess and control the Property. (Appellant Br. 37-38.) This position stands in direct contrast to Appellants' factual assertions, in which they state, \"[e]ffective January 1, 2003, Charles obtained exclusive possession of the Property, assumed full financial responsibility for and control over it, including the September 2002 secured note, and began renting it to a tenant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (citing ER 43, 81-85).) In support of a 2014 motion for summary judgment before Judge Bowie, Janelle declared, \"[i]n 2002, my father-in-law renovated, assumed full financial responsibility for and control over Beechtree, and began renting out the home.\" (ECF No. 13-1, at 44.) She went on to state, \"[m]y father-in-law has had exclusive control over Beechtree from his 2002 purchase through the present date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly, Chadwick declared:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Since purchasing Beechtree from us in August 2002, my father has paid each and every expense for the home (all loan payments, taxes, insurance, repairs, upkeep, etc.). He has made all decisions regarding it and received all net rental income. Janelle and I have had nothing to do with Beechtree since its sale in 2002 to my father, other than applying for and receiving a refinance on a mortgage\n   always paid by my father. My father has had exclusive control over Beechtree from his 2002 purchase through the present date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 901 (Chadwick's trial testimony stating, \"I believed that we had transferred ownership to my father.\").) Charles likewise made similar representations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   There is sufficient factual evidence in the record for the bankruptcy court to determine that Chadwick and Janelle had performed their outstanding obligations under the 2002 purchase agreement. The parties waived or abandoned the transfer of title provision and the parties believed that Charles had possession and control of the Property. No outstanding obligation remained for Chadwick and Janelle. Therefore, the bankruptcy court did not err in finding the purchase agreement was not an executory contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Quitclaim Deed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Next, Appellants contend that Chadwick signed a 2011 quitclaim deed and intended to transfer title to Charles when he signed the deed. (Appellant Br. 39.) Though the deed was unrecorded, Appellants argue that quitclaim deed was effective to transfer Chadwick's fifty percent joint tenancy interest in the Property to Charles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Appellee maintains that the bankruptcy court correctly determined that the quitclaim deed was ineffective because Janelle did not sign it. Under California law, a deed to community property in both spouses' names must be signed by both spouses. (Appellee Br. 45-46 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201102\">\n    Cal. Fam.

Moreover, at trial, Chadwick expressed his belief that Janelle had to sign the quitclaim deed in order for it to effectively transfer any interest. (ECF No. 13-1, at 898.) Thus, the bankruptcy court did not err in determining Charles did not acquire an interest in the Property after Chadwick signed the 2011 quitclaim deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

Charles did not have a good faith belief that he had legal title to the property; in fact, he believed that Chadwick maintained legal title. The parties knew transfer of title was required; the bankruptcy court found that Charles was a sophisticated real estate business person. (ECF No. 13-1, at 1233-34.) Despite this sophistication, no transfer of title occurred and the bankruptcy court made a factual finding that the parties believed the purchase agreement closed when Charles paid the down payment and received possession of the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1234.) The bankruptcy court's factual findings were not erroneous and support a finding of no color of title. Without color of title, Charles could only establish adverse possession through claim of right. However, a claim of right fails because Charles cannot demonstrate his possession was hostile to Chadwick and Janelle. The court in\n   <em>\n    Vieira Enterprises\n   </em>\n   describes the hostility requirement as \"not that the parties must have a dispute as to the title during the period of possession, but that the claimant's possession must be adverse to the record owner, 'unaccompanied by any recognition, express or inferable from the circumstances of the right in the latter.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461955\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-5th/8/1057/#p1075\">\n    8 Cal.

The evidence supports\n   that finding. For example, Chadwick testified that he did not inform Merrill Lynch of any interest his father had in the Property and Chadwick further testified that he believed that he owned the Property after he signed the purchase agreement. (ECF No. 13-1, at 848.) The reason for the omission on the loan application is obvious: the Collins needed to maintain Chadwick's role as record owner in order to secure a favorable mortgage rate from Merrill Lynch. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 50 (Charles' declaration stating, \"[b]y leaving title in Chadwick's and Janelle's names, in 2009, Chadwick and Janelle were able, solely for my benefit, to refinance the mortgage on Beechtree at a lower, more favorable interest rate.\").) Because he cannot establish hostility, Charles' adverse possession claim must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Damages Under California Civil Code \u00a7 3306\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Appellants contend that if Charles was not the legal or equitable owner of the Property, then he was entitled to damages under California Civil Code \u00a7 3306. (Appellant Br. 43.) Charles paid $93,000 in down payment, as well as all mortgage and property tax obligations since January 1, 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Appellants contend that because the bankruptcy court required Charles to relinquish the Property to Appellee, Charles was entitled to damages arising from the sellers' failure to transfer the rights to which the parties agreed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   A necessary element of California Civil Code \u00a7 3306 and Appellants' theory is \"the breach of an agreement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203306\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bankruptcy court determined there was no breach of contract. Instead, as previously discussed, the parties waived or abandoned the obligation for Chadwick to transfer title to Charles.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   section III.A. The same reasoning applies with equal weight here; because Chadwick did not breach the contract, Charles is not owed damages under \u00a7 3306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. Statutory Lien\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Next, Appellants assert that Charles, as buyer under the purchase agreement, was entitled to a lien secured by the Property on his $93,000 down payment. (Appellant Br. 45.) California Civil Code \u00a7 3050 provides that a purchaser \"who pays to the owner any part of the price of real property under an agreement for the sale thereof, has a special lien upon the property, independent of possession, for such part of the amount paid as he may be entitled to recover back, in case of a failure of consideration.\" Appellants contend that Charles met his obligations under the purchase agreement and his damages should be secured by a lien on the sale of the proceeds of the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Appellee argues that there was no failure of the sale for any reason that was not the fault of the purchaser. (Appellee Br. 47.) Instead, Chadwick and Janelle did not transfer an interest in the Property to Charles because Charles agreed that Chadwick and Janelle should retain the Property to take advantage of the favorable loan interest rate.

(Appellant Br. 46.) They argue that Appellee cannot recover on a claim not included in the complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Alternatively, Appellants assert that the bankruptcy court should not have calculated net rent damages from the petition date because Judge Bowie's decision-that Chadwick and Janelle held the Property as joint tenants-was not overturned until August 29, 2016, and Judge Taylor's decision was not retroactive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47.) Because Charles possessed the Property with the express permission of Janelle, a joint tenant, Charles was entitled to retain the net rents during the term of his lawful possession. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Along the same lines, Charles' possession was not terminated until the bankruptcy court's December 13, 2016 order and, because Charles had the express permission of Janelle, he could retain net rents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Appellee responds that Appellants disregard the bankruptcy court's finding that the Trustee included in her initial discovery disclosures, filed shortly after the complaint, that damages sought included \"the value of net rental income for the subject property from December 7, 2011.\" (Appellee Br. 48 (quoting CER 114-18).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The bankruptcy court determined that the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) required the turnover of rents to the Trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Collins\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-19790-LT7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202964800\">\n    2017 WL 2964800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (Bankr. S.D. Cal. July 10, 2017). The court then rejected Appellants' argument that Janelle gave permission to Charles to collect rent because the court had previously determined that the Property was community property and thus belonged to the bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The court then determined that the entirety of rents belonged to the bankruptcy estate and, once Chadwick filed bankruptcy, the Bankruptcy Code required turnover of all rents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Section 542(a)\"allows a turnover motion to be brought against the entity at any time during the pendency of the bankruptcy case, even if the entity no longer possesses or has custody or control over the property, at the time the motion is filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Shapiro v.

Thus, the Ninth Circuit has held that \"a trustee may seek turnover from an entity that had 'possession, custody, or control' of the subject property during the bankruptcy case whether or not the entity had 'possession, custody, or control' at the time the turnover motion is filed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670355,4083278\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/1198/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670355,4083278\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/1198/\">\n    at 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Together, the plain language of \u00a7 542(a) and\n   <em>\n    Shapiro\n   </em>\n   dictate that Appellee did not need to assert a turnover claim in the adversary complaint in order to seek turnover. The motion could be filed at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Further, the plain language of the statute makes clear that the proper turnover date was the date of the filing of the petition. Section 542(a) states, \"an entity, other than a custodian, in possession, custody, or control,\n   <em>\n    during the case\n   </em>\n   , of property that the trustee may use, sell, or lease under section 363... shall deliver to the trustee, and account for, such property or the value of such property, unless such property is of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added).

Charles owed all rents belonging to the\n   Property for the duration of the case, i.e., when the petition was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Finally, Charles had express permission from Janelle to possess the Property. (ER 127, 132.) Once appointed, a trustee assumes all assets and claims belonging to the debtor and the trustee is the proper party in interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moneymaker v.

This theory assumes that Janelle and Chadwick held the Property as joint tenants as separate property and Janelle could give her permission to Charles without Chadwick. Yet, the bankruptcy court correctly determined the Property was held as community property. As the bankruptcy court points out, California Family Code \u00a7 1102 requires both spouses to participate in a transfer of an interest in real property. Moreover, under the Bankruptcy Code, the community property of the debtor and debtor's spouse belongs to the bankruptcy estate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teel v.
