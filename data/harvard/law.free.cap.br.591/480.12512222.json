BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The basic facts are not in dispute. Together, Debtor Frank Mongelluzzi (\"Debtor\") and his wife Anne Mongelluzzi owned about 100 corporations and limited liability companies (the \"Mongelluzzi Entities\"). The Mongelluzzi Entities engaged in numerous diverse businesses, including a restaurant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   pawn shops,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   a movie theatre,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   airplane ownership,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and temporary staffing to the construction and construction-related industries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Debtor, Anne Mongelluzzi, and the Mongelluzzi Entities maintained 61 bank accounts at Regions (the \"Mongelluzzi Accounts\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two of the Mongelluzzi Accounts, Account Nos. 4648 and 9671, belonged to Debtor and Anne Mongelluzzi. Regions also had a significant lending relationship with the Mongelluzzis and the Mongelluzzi Entities, including a revolving credit line (the \"Revolver\"), with an original balance of $7.5 million (the \"Regions Loans\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor personally guaranteed the Revolver and was obligated to Regions on two of the Regions Loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 28, 2010, Regions' fraud prevention department flagged some of the Mongelluzzi Accounts as suspicious for a possible check-kiting scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same day, the fraud prevention department sent an email to Regions' management notifying them of the suspicious activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two days later, on June 30, 2010, Regions' monitoring and reporting operations department confirmed the fraudulent check-kiting activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regions' investigation revealed that within the six days prior to June 30, 2010, suspect deposits totaling $6,065,702.30 had been made to the Mongelluzzi\n   Accounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has found that Regions had actual knowledge of the check-kiting scheme as of at least June 28, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early July 2010, Regions froze all the Mongelluzzi Accounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regions then entered into a forbearance agreement (the \"Forbearance Agreement\") with the Mongelluzzis and some of the Mongelluzzi Entities. Shortly thereafter, Regions set off millions of dollars on deposit in the Mongelluzzi Accounts-including funds in accounts of Mongelluzzi Entities that were not obligated on the Regions Loans-to the outstanding balances on the Regions Loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Mongelluzzi Entities also maintained 77 bank accounts at Synovus Bank (\"Synovus\") and had loans with Synovus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Regions froze the Mongelluzzi Accounts in July 2010, Regions returned to Synovus numerous checks drawn on the Mongelluzzi Accounts that had been deposited to accounts at Synovus, resulting in $15 million in overdrafts in the Synovus accounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Bankruptcy Filings and Commencement of the Adversary Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2011, Debtor filed a voluntary Chapter 11 case and shortly thereafter converted the case to a Chapter 7. Plaintiff was appointed as the Chapter 7 trustee. In January 2014, Plaintiff commenced this adversary proceeding by filing a complaint against Regions in the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, Case No. 14-cv-188-EAK-TGW. The District Court referred the case to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 7, 2016, Plaintiff filed her second amended complaint (the \"Complaint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Meanwhile, in May 2013, Plaintiff filed Chapter 7 cases for sixteen of the Mongelluzzi Entities (the \"Corporate Cases\"). Christine Herendeen was appointed as the Chapter 7 Trustee in the Corporate Cases. In January 2015, Trustee Herendeen filed complaints against Regions in 14 of the Corporate Cases seeking,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to avoid fraudulent transfers arising from the Forbearance Agreement and subsequent transfers of funds to Regions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In November 2016, the pending adversaries against Regions were consolidated for administrative and discovery purposes only, with this adversary proceeding (8:14-ap-653-CED) serving as the lead adversary proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 2, 2018, the Court entered an order terminating the joint administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff and Trustee Herendeen also filed complaints against Synovus to avoid and recover alleged fraudulent transactions relating to Debtor and the Corporate Cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court approved the settlement of the claims against Synovus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Plaintiff's Claims for Relief and Regions' Counterclaim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Mongelluzzi Accounts and the Revolver were used to orchestrate a massive check-kiting scheme between 2007 and 2010;\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Regions had knowledge of the check-kiting scheme; and that Regions allowed the scheme to go on for years so that Regions could collect substantial fees, charges, interest, and other forms of revenue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff further alleges that Regions had actual knowledge of Debtor's intent to hinder and/or delay creditors by virtue of significant circumstantial evidence. This alleged circumstantial evidence includes the Mongelluzzis' and Mongelluzzi Entities' pattern of writing checks on accounts without sufficient available balances to cover the checks; chronically overdrawn accounts, including $1.7 million in overdrafts during the May to August 2010 time period; sales of Mongelluzzi Entities' accounts receivable; cash flow issues; and overly leveraged financial condition, etc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Doc.

City of Atlanta,\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     42\n    </footnotemark>\n    succinctly summarized the analysis of the burdens of the moving and non-moving parties on summary judgment. For issues on which the movant bears the burden of proof, the movant must come forward with credible evidence that would entitle the movant to a directed verdict, if not controverted at trial. But for issues on which the nonmovant bears the burden at trial, the moving party may either show that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's claim or may come forward with affirmative evidence showing that the non-moving party will be unable\n    to prove its claim or defense at trial. If the moving party carries its initial burden, the responsibility moves to the non-moving party to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n    <footnotemark>\n     43\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    If the movant meets it burden, then the nonmovant's burden depends upon how the movant's burden was met. If the movant put on affirmative evidence, then the nonmovant must respond with evidence sufficient to withstand a motion for directed verdict.\n    <footnotemark>\n     44\n    </footnotemark>\n    If the movant pointed to the absence of evidence supporting the nonmovant's claim or defense, the nonmovant must either show that the movant overlooked or ignored evidence in the record that would withstand a motion for directed verdict, or come forward with sufficient evidence to withstand a motion for directed verdict.\n    <footnotemark>\n     45\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Here, Plaintiff bears the burden of proof at trial to establish each element of her fraudulent transfer and recovery claims. Therefore, as the moving party on summary judgment, Regions has the burden to show that there is an absence of record evidence to support Plaintiffs' case or to show affirmative evidence that Plaintiff will be unable to prove her claims. Although Plaintiff argues that the Motions are not supported by affidavits, Regions relies on Plaintiff's own exhibits to the Complaint to meet its burden.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      B.

At the time of deposit, the check is not supported by sufficient funds in the account at Bank A. However, Bank B, unaware of this fact, gives the check kiter immediate credit on his account at Bank B. During the several-day period that the check on Bank A is\n    being processed for collection from that bank, the check kiter writes a $50,000 check on his account at Bank B and deposits it into his account at Bank A.

Whether that autonomy and unfettered ability arose in the context of a Ponzi scheme or a check-kiting scheme does not change the analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The Court finds that there are no factual issues regarding Plaintiff's summaries of Overdraft Loan Repayment Transfers and Deposit Transfers. To the extent that Deposit Transfers exceeded Overdrafts, $11,664,431.59, they were \"regular deposits\" and not \"transfers\" because Debtor had unfettered access to those funds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      (ii) Deposit Transfers that Were Applied to Overdrafts Are Transfers Subject to Avoidance.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Plaintiff contends that the $1,229,374.38 in Overdrafts were extensions of credit and that deposits made to repay those extensions of credit are avoidable\n    as fraudulent transfers and recoverable by the Trustee.\n    <footnotemark>\n     62\n    </footnotemark>\n    Regions' own policies and procedures deem account overdrafts to be extensions of credit.\n    <footnotemark>\n     63\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Courts have held that deposits into a debtor's bank account that are used by the bank to cover overdrafts are transfers that may be avoided as preferences under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The court, citing to its decision in\n    <em>\n     IBT Int'l, Inc. v.

The\n    <em>\n     IBT\n    </em>\n    Court acknowledged that \"[a] strictly literal interpretation of the statutory term would suggest that the 'initial transferee' of a transfer is the first party which received possession of the property in question after it left the hands of the debtor.\" We observed that the \"courts are disinclined to construe the statute [ \u00a7 550(a) ] in such a rigid manner\" and \"have created a more malleable approach to \u00a7 550(a)\" which recognizes that a \" 'mere conduit' cannot be considered an 'initial recipient' for purposes of an avoidance action.\" We added that \"[t]he mere conduit rule is\n    used most frequently in situations where banks act as an intermediary in transferring assets.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    In explaining the conduit or control test, this Court in\n    <em>\n     IBT\n    </em>\n    eschewed the literal statutory language of \u00a7 550(a), saying that a rigid interpretation would be unfair \"because in many instances the initial recipient may have nothing to do with the debtor's property other than facilitating its transfer.\" Banks and other intermediary institutions are to be shielded from \u00a7 550 liability \"because [they] never exercised any control over the Debtor's funds.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    After referring to the mere conduit rule as an \"exception\" to the statutory language, we explained that: \"\n    <em>\n     As we read it, the conduit rule presumes that the facilitator of funds acts without bad faith, and is simply an innocent participant to the underlying fraud.\n    </em>\n    \" (emphasis added).\n    <footnotemark>\n     68\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Harwell\n    </em>\n    court held that in most cases, funds transferred in and out of a lawyer's trust account, just like bank transfers, will be entitled to mere conduit status because the lawyer lacks control over the funds. But the court concluded in\n    <em>\n     Harwell\n    </em>\n    that the defendant attorney could not claim he was a mere conduit for funds transferred to his trust account because he had been involved in the debtor's scheme to use the funds to pay preferred creditors and insiders. The Eleventh Circuit stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n    Consistent with our precedent, we conclude that good faith is a requirement under this Circuit's mere conduit or control test. Accordingly, initial recipients of the debtor's fraudulently-transferred funds who seek to take advantage of equitable exceptions to \u00a7 550(a)(1)'s statutory language must establish (1) that they did not have control over the assets received, i.e., that they merely served as a conduit for the assets that were under the actual control of the debtor-transferor\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    (2) that they acted in good faith and as an innocent participant in the fraudulent transfer.\n    <footnotemark>\n     69\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Here, Plaintiff contends that Regions was not the mere recipient of deposits to Debtor's accounts but, that Regions knowingly participated in Debtor's and the Mongelluzzis' check-kiting scheme over a period of years for its own gain.

In\n    <em>\n     Petters\n    </em>\n    , the debtor was involved in a massive Ponzi scheme. The bankruptcy trustee sought to avoid and recover six transfers to a depository bank that had covered overdrafts on the debtor's accounts on the theory that the transfers were payments on short-term loans.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    In other words, in\n    <em>\n     Petters\n    </em>\n    , as in the facts presented here, the bank would honor a check when the debtor's account had insufficient funds to cover the check by making a short-term \"loan.\" When the debtor deposited funds into the account to cover the check, the bank would apply those funds to the negative balances in the account in the exact amount of the short-term credit extended.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    In granting the depository bank's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the\n    <em>\n     Petters\n    </em>\n    court found that the repayment of a negative account balance was tantamount to the repayment of a principal indebtedness and that the trustee's complaint failed to establish the element of reasonably equivalent value.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    As in\n    <em>\n     Petters\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiff alleges that the Overdrafts were loans and has not moved to recover any interest or fees associated with the Overdrafts.

Therefore, the Court will deny the Motions to the extent that the Deposit Transfers would otherwise be recoverable,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , to the extent applied to Overdrafts in the amount of $1,229,374.38.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      E.

Plaintiff cites\n    <em>\n     Welch v. Highlands Union Bank\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <footnotemark>\n     80\n    </footnotemark>\n    where the court explained that reasonably equivalent value is determined by a variety of factors including the good faith of the parties, the disparity between the fair value of the property and what the debtor actually received, and whether the transaction was at arm's length.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    But as the Eleventh Circuit explained in\n    <em>\n     In re Caribbean Fuels America, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <footnotemark>\n     81\n    </footnotemark>\n    while these factors may apply where the purported benefits to the debtor are indirect, they do not apply where the debtor directly received the benefit of the transfer at issue. The court noted that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n    This framework [the factors of good faith, disparity in value, and whether the transaction was arm's length] may apply where the purported benefits to the debtor are indirect. But in cases like this one, where the debtor directly received property, goods, or services as a result of the transfers at issue, that test cannot be squared with\n    <em>\n     Federated Title's\n    </em>\n    demand that \"value\" be measured by the objective \"value of the goods and services provided rather than on the impact that the goods and services had on the bankrupt enterprise.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     82\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The Court finds that although reasonably equivalent value may in certain cases be a factual determination, here, Debtor directly received dollar for dollar credit for the Overdraft Loan Repayment Transfers. By definition, dollar for dollar credit is reasonably equivalent value.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      G. Regions' Counterclaim and Defenses in Another Action Do Not Preclude This Court's Grant of Summary Judgment.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Plaintiff argues that judicial estoppel precludes summary judgment because Regions asserted a counterclaim against Plaintiff and Trustee Herendeen as to the ownership of the funds on deposit in the Mongelluzzi Accounts\n    <footnotemark>\n     83\n    </footnotemark>\n    and because Regions has asserted alternate legal theories in defending Trustee Herendeen's claims against it in the Corporate Cases.\n    <footnotemark>\n     84\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    But judicial estoppel does not apply here; it applies when a party asserts a claim in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a previous proceeding.\n    <footnotemark>\n     85\n    </footnotemark>\n    In the Eleventh Circuit, courts are directed to examine two factors when deciding whether judicial estoppel is applicable: \"first, it must be established that the allegedly inconsistent positions were made under oath in a prior proceeding; and second, the inconsistencies must have been calculated to make a mockery of the judicial system.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     86\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Here, Plaintiff alleges that Debtor made deposits into his accounts, and that Debtor incurred Overdrafts and later paid Regions the amount of the Overdrafts. Regions does not dispute these factual allegations and merely argues, as a matter of law, that they do not give rise to avoidable fraudulent transfer claims. The fact that Regions' counterclaim raises the question of the entitlement or ownership of the funds on deposit does not contradict Regions' positions taken in its counterclaim or its defense to Trustee Herendeen's claims. And to the extent that Regions asserted alternate legal theories in its defense of Trustee Herendeen's fraudulent transfer claims on the issue of reasonably equivalent value, this is merely a divergent legal position. Divergent legal positions do not warrant the application of judicial estoppel.\n    <footnotemark>\n     87\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    <strong>\n     III. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    The Court finds, as a matter of law, that to the extent that Deposit Transfers were\n    not applied to Overdrafts, the Deposit Transfers were not \"transfers\" subject to avoidance under FUFTA or\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n    </extracted-citation>\n    and Regions is not an \"initial transferee.\" However, to the extent that Deposit Transfers were applied to Overdrafts, they were \"transfers\" and Regions is an \"initial transferee.\" But even if the Deposit Transfers were \"transfers\" and Regions is an \"initial transferee,\" the Deposit Transfers, whether or not applied to Overdrafts, were for reasonably equivalent value.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Therefore, on Plaintiff's claims to avoid the Transfers as constructively fraudulent transfers (Counts II, III, V, VI, VIII, IX, XI, XIII, XV), the Court finds that Regions, as the moving party, has met its burden by pointing out the absence of evidence to support Plaintiff's claims, and that Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden to show that Regions overlooked or ignored evidence in the record that would withstand a motion for directed verdict or to come forward with sufficient evidence to withstand a motion for directed verdict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    On Plaintiff's claims to recover the Deposit Transfers as actual fraudulent transfers (Counts IV and XII), the Court finds, first, that the Deposit Transfers were \"transfers\" only to the extent that they were applied to Overdrafts and as to the amount of the Overdrafts, $1,229,374.38, Regions was an \"initial transferee.\" The remaining issue is whether these transfers to Regions were made with the requisite intent to hinder, delay, or defraud; Regions has not met its summary judgment burden on this issue. Second, the Court finds that the remaining amount of the Deposit Transfers, $11,664,431.59, were not \"transfers,\" and as to that amount of the Deposit Transfers, Regions was not an \"initial transferee.\" Therefore, the Court will grant the Motions as to Counts IV and XII in part and deny in part.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    And last, because Plaintiff's Count XVI recovery claim is dependent upon the underlying avoidance claims, the Court will grant the motion as to that claim in part.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds it appropriate to grant Plaintiff's Motions for Partial Summary Judgment in part. Accordingly, it is\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    <strong>\n     ORDERED:\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    1.
