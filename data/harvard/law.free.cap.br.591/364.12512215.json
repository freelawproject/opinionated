Michael Halfenger, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Gilbert Schouten gave debtor Robert Jakubiak a loan, and Jakubiak gave Schouten investment advice. The loan went unpaid. The advice was bad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Schouten sued. He commenced an arbitration proceeding with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) against Jakubiak; Jakubiak's cohort, Timothy Stout; and Jakubiak's former employer, MML Investors Services, LLC, an entity regulated by FINRA. After Jakubiak failed to answer the arbitration complaint, the arbitrator awarded Schouten $75,000 against Jakubiak. A Wisconsin Circuit Court entered a judgment confirming that award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When Schouten tried to collect, he discovered for the first time that this court had granted Jakubiak a chapter 7 discharge. Schouten hadn't received notice of Jakubiak's bankruptcy because Jakubiak\n   hadn't listed Schouten, scheduled his debt to Schouten, or included Schouten on the mailing matrix. Schouten now asks this court to declare that Jakubiak's discharge does not bar Schouten from collecting his $75,000 judgment. Both parties seek summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are uncontested, except as otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Schouten had retired before the dealings with Jakubiak happened. His income came from a modest retirement fund. CM-ECF Doc. No. 18, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Schouten says that he and Jakubiak were bowling buddies. CM-ECF Doc. No. 14, at 2. Beginning in May 2006, Jakubiak, who has worked as a financial advisor, offered to assist Schouten with his investments. CM-ECF Doc. No. 18, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26, 28 &amp; 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Jakubiak advised Schouten to make several transfers of Schouten's retirement funds among a variety of index-based annuities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 44; CM-ECF Doc. No. 25-2, \u00b6 8. Acting on Jakubiak's advice, Schouten moved his retirement funds several times: first to Physician's Mutual in 2006; then to American Investor's Life in 2007, which became AVIVA; then to Forethought Destination Indexed Annuity in 2009. CM-ECF Doc. No. 18, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 31, 37-38 &amp; 45. Jakubiak signed as \"Agent\" for the 2006 and 2007 transfers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29 &amp; 32. Stout, Jakubiak's colleague at MML Investors Services, LLC, was the agent for the 2009 transfer, though Jakubiak referred to himself as \"agent\" on a cover letter for the annuity contract with Forethought.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In August 2008, Jakubiak first asked Schouten for a loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Schouten agreed. He loaned Jakubiak $25,000 sometime between August 30 and September 2, 2008; $10,000 on September 8, 2008; $15,000 in December 2008; and another $25,000 in November 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35; CM-ECF Doc. No. 16, at 35. To make these loans, Schouten drew down on a line of credit secured by his home. CM-ECF Doc. No. 18, \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Jakubiak's promises of repayment went unfulfilled. He repaid only $338.25.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2011, Jakubiak recommended that Schouten transfer the annuity funds from Forethought back to AVIVA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. A Forethought representative tipped off Schouten that Jakubiak, pretending to be Schouten, had been calling Forethought to expedite issuance of a surrender check.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-56. This revelation led Schouten to ask Tony Drake, a certified financial planner, about how the funds had been handled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. According to Schouten, Drake discovered that the Jakubiak-advised annuity transfers followed a path of escalating commissions, and the Forethought application misrepresented Schouten's net worth and assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-60; CM-ECF Doc. No. 16, at 13, \u00b6 30. After meeting with Drake, Schouten stopped the Forethought-AVIVA transfer and his dealings with Jakubiak. CM-ECF Doc. No. 18, \u00b6 59; CM-ECF Doc. No. 16, at 14, \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 25, 2012, Schouten filed an arbitration claim with FINRA against\n   Jakubiak; Stout; and MML Investors Services, Jakubiak's and Stout's former employer. CM-ECF Doc. No. 18, \u00b6 1. Schouten alleged four claims against Jakubiak: (1) fraud and misrepresentation, (2) breach of a duty to recommend only suitable investments, (3) breach of contract, and (4) breach of fiduciary duty. CM-ECF Doc. No. 22-1, \u00b6\u00b6 36-64. Schouten alleged against all of the defendants \"jointly and severally\" actual total damages of $216,418.58: he claimed alleged losses of $74,705.62 in surrender charges from annuity flipping; $67,712.96 of lost interest accrual; and $75,000 of unpaid loans (which a keen reader will realize totals $217,418.58, rather than $216,418.58). CM-ECF Doc. No. 16, at 7-24; CM-ECF Doc. No. 22-1, at 22. Jakubiak did not appear or otherwise contest the claims. CM-ECF Doc. No. 18, \u00b6\u00b6 3 &amp; 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 10, 2014, the FINRA arbitrator issued a $75,000 default award against Jakubiak. CM-ECF Doc. No. 20-2. The award states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Respondent Jakubiak knew, or should have known, that securities law prohibits brokers from borrowing money from clients. Attachments to claim (Exhibits C, D, E &amp; H) [i]ndicate that Respondent Jakubiak personally received four checks from Claimant Schouten without an indicated investment purpose or action for Claimant.... Respondent, Robert Joseph Jakubiak, is liable for and shall pay to Claimant $75,000.00 in compensatory damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The award further states, \"All other relief requests are denied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Schouten filed a petition in the Milwaukee County Circuit Court to confirm the award. CM-ECF Doc. No. 18, \u00b6 12. Jakubiak did not appear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. On July 8, 2014, the circuit court entered an order for default judgment directing entry of judgment against Jakubiak in the amount of $75,000, plus $1,283.73 in prejudgment interest. CM-ECF Doc. No. 1, Ex. L. The circuit court docketed a judgment to that effect on December 4, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3; CM-ECF Doc. No. 18, \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 19, 2015, Jakubiak and his wife jointly petitioned for bankruptcy under chapter 7. Case No. 15-21424 (Bankr. E.D. Wis.). The Jakubiaks did not list Schouten in their list of creditors or schedule the debt owed Schouten. Case No. 15-21424, CM-ECF Doc. No. 1. The clerk notified the Jakubiaks' listed creditors that the Jakubiaks' bankruptcy estate appeared to have no assets to distribute to creditors, so creditors should not file a proof of claim unless later told to do so. Case No. 15-21424, CM-ECF Doc. No. 3 &amp; 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On May 1, 2015, soon after the Jakubiaks amended their schedules to list additional personal property and claim further exemptions, the chapter 7 trustee reported that the estate had no property available for distribution. The court granted the Jakubiaks a discharge on June 3, 2015, two days after the June 1, 2015 deadline for objecting to discharge or dischargeability. Case No. 15-21424, CM-ECF Doc. No. 9. The court then closed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Six months later, Schouten moved to reopen the Jakubiaks' case to file a complaint seeking a determination that the $75,000 judgment was not discharged. Case No. 15-21424, CM-ECF Doc. No. 11. No one objected to that request, so the court granted it. Case No. 15-21424, CM-ECF Doc. No. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Two adversary proceedings followed. Schouten filed this proceeding. The United States trustee filed an adversary proceeding\n   requesting that the court revoke the Jakubiaks' discharge, alleging that the Jakubiaks had falsely testified that they had listed all their creditors and scheduled all of their debts, even though they had failed to list Schouten and schedule their debt to him. Adv. Proc. No. 16-2194 (Bankr. E.D. Wis. filed May 31, 2016), CM-ECF Doc. No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Several months later, the U.S. trustee moved to dismiss his proceeding. Adv. Proc. No. 16-2194, CM-ECF Doc. No. 7. In so doing, he reported only that counsel for the Jakubiaks in the adversary proceedings had made an \"admission that the errors and omissions that were the basis for the Complaint were not intentional on the part of the Debtors but rather were due to an oversight of [the Jakubiaks' former] bankruptcy counsel.\" Adv. Proc. No. 16-2194, CM-ECF Doc. No. 7, at 2. No one objected. The court dismissed that proceeding. Adv. Proc. No. 16-2194, CM-ECF Doc. No. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Schouten then actively pursued in this proceeding a declaration that Jakubiak's debt to him is excepted from the discharge. After discovery closed, both parties moved for summary judgment. CM-ECF Doc. Nos. 13 &amp; 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This court has jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding by operation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Eastern District of Wisconsin's order of reference under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). See Order of Reference (E.D. Wis. July 10, 1984), available at http://www.wied.uscourts.gov/local-rules-and-orders. This proceeding to determine the dischargeability of a debt is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(I). Thus, \u00a7 157(b)(1) authorizes this court to enter a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) (made applicable to this adversary proceeding by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056 ) provides, \"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" The court must \"construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party ... and give that party the benefit of genuine conflicts in the evidence and all reasonable, favorable inferences.\"\n   <em>\n    Carman v.

Jakubiak's debt to Schouten arose before the order for relief, so the debt has been discharged unless \u00a7 523 provides otherwise. The parties' dueling motions for summary judgment dispute whether Jakubiak owes Schouten a debt that is excepted from discharge under subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(6), and (a)(19) of \u00a7 523.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The parties have principally focused their summary judgment arguments on the extent to which the confirmed arbitration award is determinative of Schouten's \u00a7 523(a) claims. Schouten argues that the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine, as well as claim and issue preclusion, support his request for summary judgment. Jakubiak responds that preclusion principles instead support awarding him summary judgment. Ultimately, these principles do not carry the day for either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Schouten contends that \"\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   precludes any argument in this Court that the [state-court judgment confirming the arbitration award] made invalid or mistaken findings.\" CM-ECF Doc. 14, at 12. From there, he leaps to a conclusion that the doctrine entitles him to judgment on his \u00a7 523(a)(19) claim. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   There's no need to move past the launch point.\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   is the doctrinal call sign for the fact that title 28 of the United States Code primarily gives federal trial courts original, as opposed to appellate, jurisdiction. See, e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\"), 1332(a) (\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction\" of certain diversity suits.), 1333(1) (\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction ... of ... [a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction ....\") &amp; 1334(a) (\"[T]he district courts shall have original ... jurisdiction of all cases under title 11.\"). Federal trial courts, including bankruptcy courts, thus generally lack jurisdiction over claims by persons who have litigated and lost in earlier state-court proceedings, if the relief they seek is inconsistent with the judgment in those earlier proceedings.

CM-ECF Doc. No. 14, at 10-12, 14; CM-ECF Doc. No. 20, at 8 &amp; 10. These arguments are misplaced to the extent directed toward Schouten's claim that the debt is excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(19) because, as will be discussed further below, that section excepts debts, as applicable in this case, that result from a judgment for a violation of securities laws covered by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(19). Determining whether the judgment is for a violation of a covered securities law involves determining first what the judgment is for (a state-law question) and then whether it is for a violation covered by \u00a7 523(a)(19)(A) (a federal-law question). None of this involves application of preclusion doctrines, which define a judgment's limiting effect on subsequent litigation by parties to the judgment. Compare\n   <em>\n    Meyer v.

Schouten's focus on a violation of the FINRA rule, which is not itself a violation of a securities law or regulation within the scope of \u00a7 523(a)(19), underscores the difficulty of inferring from the award that the award is for the violation of a covered securities law. If, as Schouten supposes, the award's statement that \"Jakubiak knew, or should have known, that securities law prohibits brokers from borrowing money from clients\" was premised on FINRA rule 3240, then the award is not for a violation of securities laws to which \u00a7 523(a)(19) applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The award's text simply does not reasonably establish that the award is based on a violation of a securities law that\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   covered by \u00a7 523(a)(19). As the award's\n   summary of Schouten's claims explains, Schouten alleged causes of action for \"fraud and misrepresentations; unsuitability;\n   <em>\n    breach of contract\n   </em>\n   and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; breach of fiduciary duty; negligent supervision; and respondeat superior.\" CM-ECF Doc.

No. 20-2, at 2. While the arbitrator's finding is opaque, it could be understood in context as ruling that in borrowing $75,000 from Schouten, Jakubiak knowingly failed to disclose, in violation of Rule 10b-5 and Wisconsin securities law, that he was prohibited from making that solicitation. The arbitrator might have based his decision to direct Jakubiak to pay the principal loan amount-$75,000-on Schouten's allegation that part of his claimed injury from the fraudulent omission was the loss of the \"loan principal\".

And, although this breach-of-contract claim incorporates all of the complaint's previous allegations, nothing about the claim's allegations suggests in context that the claim should be understood to arise under federal or state securities law. The breach-of-contract claim arises at least in part, if not entirely, under state contract law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The award's findings that \"Jakubiak knew, or should have known, that securities law prohibits brokers from borrowing from clients\" and that Jakubiak received loans from Schouten are just as consistent with understanding the award to be based on Schouten's breach-of-contract claim, which includes an allegation that Jakubiak recklessly disregarded contractual obligations, as with Schouten's fraud claim. In his breach-of-contract claim Schouten alleged, among other things, \"Respondents' recommendations to switch annuities multiple times,\n   <em>\n    and four-time solicitation of Schouten for personal loans\n   </em>\n   , constitutes a gross breach of the duty of care of investment advisers, breach of good faith and fair dealing, and\n   <em>\n    reckless disregard for their contractual obligations\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20551.509\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20551.509\">\n    \u00b6 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Based on these acts, Schouten pleaded in the breach-of-contract claim that he \"incurred actual damages as a direct and proximate result in an amount to be determined at hearing.\" CM-ECF Doc. No. 16, at 21, \u00b6 58. The arbitrator's finding that \"Jakubiak knew, or should have known, that securities law prohibits brokers from borrowing from clients\" thus can also be understood to base liability on the reckless-disregard-of-contractual-obligations theory for relief contained in Schouten's breach-of-contract claim. The arbitrator might have concluded that the loss Schouten \"incurred as a direct and proximate result\" of this (allegedly reckless) breach of contract amounts to \"$75,000.00 in compensatory damages\"-the amount the arbitrator awarded against Jakubiak. Again, the simplest explanation of the $75,000 award is that it is compensation\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   the $75,000 unpaid loan principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Neither of these competing ways of understanding the arbitration award is satisfactory. The fraud and misrepresentation\n   claim alleges that (a) \"[t]he intent of [the] representations and omissions was to induce Schouten into switching his annuities despite the significant surrender penalties,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   to induce Schouten into providing personal loans to Jakubiak\"; and (b) \"[b]y reason of the aforementioned acts of Respondents, Schouten suffered substantial surrender charges, lost future earnings,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   lost loan principal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20551.509\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20551.509\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 40 &amp; 42 (emphasis added). The award limits the compensatory damages against Jakubiak to $75,000-the loan principal. But it also awards compensatory damages of $16,142.41 against Stout-damages the award bases on the surrender penalties from one of the annuity switches; a switch Schouten's complaint alleged was orchestrated by Jakubiak. If the arbitrator determined that Stout was liable on the misrepresentation claim, there is no apparent reason why the award does not also require Jakubiak to pay at least $16,142.41 to compensate Schouten for the wrongful annuity flipping. If the award was based on an allegation that Jakubiak violated the securities laws, why was the award limited to the amount Schouten loaned Jakubiak? And, in awarding damages limited to the loan principal, why did the arbitration award emphasize that Jakubiak \"knew, or should have known, that securities law prohibits brokers from borrowing from clients\"? CM-ECF Doc. No. 20-2, at 2. Ultimately, the context and circumstances leave substantial doubt about whether the confirmed arbitration award is for a violation of federal or state securities law, as \u00a7 523(a)(19)'s exception from discharge requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \"Exceptions to discharge are to be narrowly construed, and because of the fresh start objectives of bankruptcy, doubt is to be resolved in the debtor's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Affordable Bail Bonds, Inc. v.

In 2015, when the Jakubiaks commenced their case, Rule 3002(c) provided in relevant part that \"[i]n a chapter 7 liquidation ... a proof of claim is timely filed if it is filed not later than 90 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors called under \u00a7 341(a) of the Code\".

Even if all that Jakubiak means by this is that Schouten did not have notice or actual knowledge of the bankruptcy before the 90-day period stated in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy 3002(c) ended, \u00a7 523(a)(3) excepts Jakubiak's debt to Schouten from discharge if the general deadline set forth in Rule 3002(c) controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   a\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Rule 3002(c)'s general deadline, though, is subject to several exceptions, one of which, Rule 3002(c)(5), applies in so-called no-asset cases under chapter 7, like the Jakubiaks' case. Rule 3002(c)(5) states that when the bankruptcy clerk has given creditors\n   notice \"of insufficient assets ...\n   <em>\n    and subsequently\n   </em>\n   the trustee notifies the court that payment of a dividend appears possible,\" the bankruptcy clerk must \"give at least 90 days' notice by mail to creditors of that fact and of the date by which proofs of claim must be filed.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002(c)(5) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   By its plain terms, Rule 3002(c)(5) does not apply here-at least, it does not apply\n   <em>\n    yet\n   </em>\n   . The bankruptcy clerk sent the Jakubiaks' creditors a no-asset notice, but that notice is merely\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to trigger the exception to Rule 3002(c)'s general deadline for filing proofs of claim, it is not\n   <em>\n    sufficient\n   </em>\n   . To activate Rule 3002(c)(5), the trustee must notify the court that payment of a dividend appears possible, and the clerk must then notify creditors \"that payment of a dividend appears possible ... and of the date by which proofs of claim must be filed.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002(c)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In the Jakubiaks' case, the trustee never notified the court that payment of a dividend appeared possible. So Rule 3002(c)(5) has neither required nor authorized the clerk to give creditors notice of a new deadline for filing proofs of claim. By the plain language of Rule 3002(c), therefore, the \"time [for] ... timely filing of a proof of claim\" under \u00a7 523(a)(3) ended 90 days after the March 31, 2015 first meeting of creditors, and has never been expanded by operation of subparagraph (c)(5). Jakubiak, as discussed earlier, has admitted that the 90-day period passed before he either listed or scheduled his debt to Schouten and before Schouten had either notice or actual knowledge of the case. Thus, under a plain reading of Rule 3002(c) and \u00a7 523(a)(3), Jakubiak's debt to Schouten is excepted from discharge, regardless of whether it is of a kind specified in \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), or (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   b\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Courts have eschewed this plain reading. They largely disregard the text of Rule 3002(c) and reason that the clerk's notice of no assets means that there is no deadline to file proofs of claim unless the clerk sets a deadline under Rule 3002(c)(5).

And achieving this outcome by reading Rule 3002(c)(5) to eliminate the deadline by which creditors must file proofs of claim leads to peculiar results. For example, in a no-asset chapter 7 case in which payment of a dividend never appears possible, each unscheduled garden-variety debt\n   <em>\n    is excepted\n   </em>\n   from discharge until the moment the creditor gets notice of the bankruptcy case, at which point it is discharged. Recall \u00a7 523(a)(3)'s text: all unscheduled debts are excepted from discharge\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the creditor has notice or actual knowledge of the bankruptcy case in time to file a timely proof of claim. If a debt is never scheduled and there is no deadline to file a proof of claim, then the debt is discharged at the instant the creditor learns of the case. Until then, however, \u00a7 523(a)(3) excepts the debt from discharge because the debt is not scheduled and the creditor lacks notice or knowledge of the case \"in time\" to file a claim. A no-asset debtor can thus discharge omitted garden-variety debts simply by informing creditors months or years after the case closes that the debtor received a bankruptcy discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   For the most part, courts do not acknowledge these oddities, though the Sixth Circuit did in\n   <em>\n    Zirnhelt v. Madaj (In re Madaj)\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   In a Chapter 7 no-asset case, ... the creditors cannot recover from the estate because there is nothing to recover. For this reason, there is no deadline for filing a timely proof of claim in a no-asset case. Technically speaking, therefore, no matter when the creditor learns of the bankruptcy, he is able to file a timely claim. Because \u00a7 523(a)(3)(A) excepts the unscheduled debt from discharge \"unless such creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the case in time for such timely filing,\"\n   <strong>\n    the moment the creditor receives notice or knowledge of the bankruptcy case, \u00a7 523(a)(3)(A) ceases to provide the basis for an exception from discharge\n   </strong>\n   .

For the most part, creditors in a no-asset case do not stand to gain by having their debts scheduled, nor do they stand to lose by having their debts omitted from the schedules.

Rec. 32282, 32399 (Sept. 28, 1978) (statement of Rep. Edwards); 124 Cong. Rec. 33872, 33998 (Oct. 5, 1978) (statement of Sen. DeConcini). On its face, this might suggest that Congress, in deriving \u00a7 523(a)(3) from \u00a7 17a(3), meant to strip the provision of the \"punitive\" construction applied to it by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Birkett\n   </em>\n   .

Compare \u00a7 17a(3) (last codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2035\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) (1976) ), with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) (1982). The clearest inference that arises from this change, given the legislative history, is that Congress meant to displace\n   <em>\n    Birkett\n   </em>\n   's holding that an unscheduled debt can only be discharged based on the creditor's actual knowledge of the bankruptcy case if the creditor learned about the case \"in time to give him an equal opportunity with other creditors\" to \"avail [himself] of the benefits of the law\".

Congress chose, instead, to permit the discharge of an unscheduled debt based on the creditor's actual knowledge of the case so long as the creditor knew about the case in time to meet certain deadlines broadly imposed upon creditors in a bankruptcy case-namely, the proof-of-claim deadline and the deadline to request a determination that a debt is of a kind excepted from discharge by \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), or (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Nothing about \u00a7 523(a)(3) itself or the relevant legislative history indicates that Congress meant for that provision to not \"attach[ ] a punitive consequence\" to a debtor's \"neglect of [his] duty\" to schedule his debts and list his creditors fully and accurately, as required by the Code, just like its predecessor, \u00a7 17a(3), did.

A debtor's duties under the Code, as\n   <em>\n    Birkett\n   </em>\n   observed, are \"all directed to the purpose of a full and unreserved exposition of his affairs, property and creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3633447\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/195/345/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That purpose is no less significant in a no-asset case than it is in any other bankruptcy case. In fact, that purpose may be\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   significant in a no-asset case because \"no asset claims are easy to make; a creditor might want notice precisely to argue that there are assets even though the debtor asserts otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Colonial Sur.

Thus, there is no historical reason why \u00a7 523(a)(3) should be understood to operate differently depending\n   on whether the debtor's case lacks assets to distribute to creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   This is not to say that Congress designed \u00a7 523(a)(3) to serve a single purpose or that the provision does not also serve to protect the right of creditors to file proofs of claim, as identified by\n   <em>\n    Madaj\n   </em>\n   and other decisions. Rather, the foregoing historical analysis shows that, even if one accepts the argument that courts can and should depart from the text of the Code and the Rules to advance some perceived underlying legislative purpose, that argument does not necessarily support the conclusion that there is no deadline for timely filing proofs of claim in all no-asset cases. The history of \u00a7 523(a)(3)'s discharge exception, which dates back to the late 19th century, suggests that the exception was written to serve at least one purpose that is no less salient in no-asset cases and, thus, that \u00a7 523(a)(3) should not operate any differently in such cases except to the extent actually stated in the text of the Code and the Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Jakubiak argues that, whatever conclusions one may draw from the preceding analysis, binding circuit precedent provides that \u00a7 523(a)(3) does not except his debt to Schouten from discharge.

Because \"a proof of claim ... in a Chapter 7 case\" serves only as \"the creditor's assertion of a right to participate in the distribution of the assets of the estate\", such courts reason, \"[i]n a case without assets to distribute the right to file a proof of claim is meaningless and worthless.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 867. That \u00a7 523(a)(3) serves\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   purpose of protecting creditors' rights to file a timely proof of claim, however, does not mean that it does not serve other bankruptcy purposes. As discussed above, the history of \u00a7 523(a)(3) suggests that it also serves to incentivize debtors to schedule their creditors and debts completely and accurately by punishing debtors who neglect their duty under the Code to do so. This purpose is not tied to a creditor's right to file a proof of claim, so\n   <em>\n    Stark\n   </em>\n   's language does not preclude \u00a7 523(a)(3)'s application in no-asset cases where an unscheduled creditor would have nothing to gain by filing a proof of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Further, courts have read\n   <em>\n    Stark\n   </em>\n   to provide that a debtor can move to reopen a closed no-asset case and amend his schedules to add previously unlisted or incorrectly listed creditors, thereby discharging initially unscheduled debts, at least where \"the error in the original schedules was a result of mistake or inadvertence and not because of any fraud by the debtor.\" E.g.,\n   <em>\n    In re Beshensky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6109538\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/68/452/#p453\">\n    68 B.R. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 453-55 (Bankr. E.D. Wis. 1987). The Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Stark\n   </em>\n   did not expressly hold that reopening a case and amending the schedules discharges a previously unscheduled debt, but that is likely the outcome the court contemplated. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6128232,11955427\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/717/322/\">\n    717 F.2d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting the parties' statement of the case, which provided that the Starks moved to reopen their bankruptcy case \"in order that the HOSPITAL's debt could be added and subsequently discharged\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6128232,11955427\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/717/322/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6128232,11955427\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/717/322/\">\n    at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming the district court's order reversing the bankruptcy court's denial of the Starks' motion to reopen their case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Yet, it is difficult to discern how reopening a closed case to schedule an omitted debt would affect the debt's dischargeability. On the one hand, if there is no deadline for filing proofs of claim in a no-asset case, as many courts maintain, then an unscheduled debt is discharged the moment the creditor learns about the bankruptcy case-because the unscheduled debt is excepted from discharge by \u00a7 523(a)(3) unless (or until) the creditor learns of the bankruptcy in time to file a proof of claim, viz., before the end of infinity. Under this view, it is the creditor's knowledge of the bankruptcy that removes \u00a7 523(a)(3)'s discharge exception without regard to whether the debtor ever amends filings to add an unscheduled debt or unlisted creditor. Conversely, if Rule 3002(c)'s deadline for filing proofs of claim applies in no-asset cases and that deadline has passed by the time the debtor moves to reopen to amend schedules, scheduling the debt will not affect application of \u00a7 523(a)(3)'s discharge exception, since the debt would not have\n   been scheduled \"in time to permit ... timely filing of a proof of claim\". Again, reopening and amending schedules would serve no purpose (unless undisclosed assets are later discovered and the clerk gives notice of a claims-filing deadline under Rule 3002(c)(5) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   c\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Seventh Circuit's own references to and discussions of\n   <em>\n    Stark\n   </em>\n   , sparse as they are, perhaps provide some greater clarity about its scope and meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Seventh Circuit first cited\n   <em>\n    Stark\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    In re Shondel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6509730,10527204\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/950/1301/\">\n    950 F.2d 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1991), in which the court considered \"whether a bankruptcy case may be reopened and the permanent injunction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   modified to permit recovery from the debtor's insurer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    at 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And the two provisions contain substantially identical text. If the debtor's mental state is relevant (or irrelevant) to one, it must be relevant (or irrelevant) to the other, as well.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   's contrary\n   assertion is inscrutable, at least as a textual matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   d\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Considering all of this,\n   <em>\n    Stark\n   </em>\n   seems best conceived as recognizing and applying an equitable exception to \u00a7 523(a)(3)(A). So conceived,\n   <em>\n    Stark\n   </em>\n   means that, in a no-asset case under chapter 7 in which the clerk has given creditors notice that they need not file proofs of claim unless the clerk sends subsequent notice, a debtor who fails to list a creditor with a claim for a garden-variety debt (or to schedule such a debt) may reopen his case after discharge and amend his filings to list the omitted creditor (or schedule the omitted debt), thereby placing the debtor and the creditor in the positions they would have occupied had the debtor properly listed the creditor (or scheduled the debt) in the first place, unless the debtor's omission was fraudulent or intentional or the creditor was harmed in some way by the omission. If matters are equitably reset,\n   <em>\n    Stark\n   </em>\n   implies that \u00a7 523(a)(3)(A) does not apply to except omitted garden-variety debts from discharge.
