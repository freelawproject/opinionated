The Motion seek to reopen this case, to enable the Debtor to file a Financial Management Course Certificate (\"Certificate\") and receive a discharge. The Motion was filed more than 10 months after this case was closed. The case was closed on September 26, 2017, without a discharge, due to the Debtor's failure to timely file the Certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the following reasons, the Court will deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 on June 16, 2017, commencing this case. That same day, the Clerk issued a notice that the first meeting of creditors would be held on July 26, 2017 at 8:30 a.m. (Docket # 7, the \"Notice\"). On June 16, 2017, the Notice was served by the Bankruptcy Noticing Center by email on some of the creditors, the Chapter 7 Trustee, and the Debtor's attorney, and on June 18, 2017, the Notice was served by the Bankruptcy Noticing Center by mail on the Debtor and the remainder of creditors (Docket # 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under\n   Fed.

The Debtor also failed to file a motion to extend the deadline to file the Certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 26, 2017, after the case had been fully administered, the case was closed without a discharge, due to the Debtor's failure to file the Certificate. (Docket # 11). Notice of the Final Decree entered that day (Docket # 12) was served on Debtor's counsel and some of the creditors by e-mail on September 26, 2017, through the Court's ECF system. And a notice that the Debtor's bankruptcy case had been closed without a discharge was served by the Bankruptcy Noticing Center by mail on September 28, 2017 on other creditors, and on the Debtor. (Docket # 12). Such notice stated: \"All creditors and parties in interest are notified that the above-captioned case has been closed without entry of discharge as Debtor(s) did not file Official Form 423, Certification About a Financial Management Course.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   More than 10 months later, on August 3, 2018, the Debtor filed the Motion (Docket # 14).

The Court finds that the Debtor has not shown either cause to reopen this case, or cause to grant the Debtor an retroactive extension of more than 10 months of the deadline to file the Certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factor 1: whether there is a reasonable explanation for the failure to comply\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Motion does not provide any reason whatsoever why the Debtor was unable to timely complete a financial management course and file a Certificate, more than 10 months ago. The Motion also does not explain why the Debtor waited 10 months after the case was closed to move to reopen the case. The Debtor was informed, by the notice described above, which was mailed to her on September 28, 2017, that her case had been closed without a discharge, and why it had been so closed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in this case the Debtor was represented by an attorney, who also received this notice, by e-mail on September 26, 2017. Yet the Debtor did nothing to try to rectify this for 10 months, and the Motion alleges no reason whatsoever, let alone a valid excuse, for such a long delay by the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factor 2: whether the request was timely\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The delay of more than 10 months in the Debtor's completion of the financial management course and in filing the Certificate in this case is far too long. So is the Debtor's delay in moving to reopen this case for more than 10 months after the case was closed. Such a long delay frustrates the goals of the legislation which added the financial management course requirement as a condition for obtaining a Chapter 7 discharge. In\n   <em>\n    Chrisman\n   </em>\n   , the Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Congress added participation in a post-petition financial management instructional course as a condition to obtaining a Chapter 7 discharge to the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(11). One of the goals of the legislation and this requirement was to restore individual financial responsibility to the bankruptcy system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The main purpose of a bankruptcy filing is to obtain a discharge, and any action that delays that benefit is mystifying and therefore requires additional justification. Justification supports the goals of not only the bankruptcy system, but also the purpose of the financial management course. Allowing a debtor to take the financial management course years after its target completion provides no educational benefit to the debtor for the intervening years and denigrates its purpose. Moreover, it maligns the integrity of the system and its fairness to all parties....It is unfair to creditors to allow a debtor to avoid the responsibilities established by the bankruptcy code and rules, only to later want to fulfill those requirements when faced with a resulting unpleasantness.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Chrisman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204447251\">\n    2016 WL 4447251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, *2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Heinbuch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201417913\">\n    2016 WL 1417913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ). In\n   <em>\n    Chrisman\n   </em>\n   , \"neither the instructional component nor the paperwork component were timely accomplished,\" and the court found that \"[t]he Congressional purposes in adding the post-petition financial management instructional requirement to the Bankruptcy Code as a condition of discharge [had] been completely stymied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The magnitude of the Debtor's delay in this case is significant, and this factor strongly weighs against granting the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factor 3: whether fault lies with counsel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Debtor was represented by counsel in this case at all times until the case was closed, but the Debtor does not allege in the Motion that her failure to timely complete the Financial Management Course and to file a Certificate was in any way the fault of her counsel. The fault for failing to timely complete the Financial Management Course and to file a Certificate appears to have been entirely due to the Debtor's own fault and neglect. This factor weighs against granting the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factor 4: whether creditors are prejudiced\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Chrisman\n   </em>\n   , the Court reasoned, with regard to the prejudice factor, that \"[t]o spring a discharge on creditors more than seven years later that many of them will now not even receive, at peril of violating the unknown discharge, is simply unfair.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The delay in this case, although shorter than the delay in\n   <em>\n    Chrisman\n   </em>\n   , is still long. Generally speaking, the longer the delay, the greater the prejudice. Here, there was a long delay. This factor therefore, also weighs against granting the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In summary, all of the relevant factors weigh against a finding of cause to reopen\n   this case. The Debtor has failed to demonstrate cause to reopen this case. Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1.
