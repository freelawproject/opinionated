The matter was set for hearing on August 8, 2018, at which time the parties argued their respective positions and following the hearing, the motion was taken under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court has considered the briefing, affidavits, and oral argument presented, as well as the applicable law, and now issues the following decision which resolves the motion.

The agreed upon price was $250,000 to $265,000. Voit paid Defendant a total of $122,000 during the course of construction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.

BK Dkt. No. 1. Discharge was entered in favor of the debtors on December 6, 2017. BK Dkt. No. 56. On November 13, 2017, Martin and Voit commenced individual adversary proceedings against Defendant, alleging in Count I of each adversary complaint that he represented that he was a licensed contractor, knowing the same to be false, and that Voit and Martin each relied on that representation in entering into the respective agreements and paying him a sum to do the work. By accepting the money and failing to complete the project or return the money, Plaintiffs allege Debtor has committed fraud and they have been damaged.

In order to meet the required elements of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), Plaintiffs rely on the two guilty pleas entered into in West Virginia, in combination with the doctrine of issue preclusion. They contend that because Defendant pled guilty to obtaining the money by fraud and false pretenses in West Virginia, the issue of fraudulent conduct concerning the Voit and Martin construction projects has already been adjudicated, and seek summary judgment on their \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response, Defendant contends first that Plaintiffs utilized Idaho preclusion law in their briefing rather than that of West Virginia, and second, that the elements of the larceny statute in West Virginia to which he pled included a property value of less than $1,000, and thus the pleas establish the value of the claims as less than $1,000 each for nondischargeability purposes in this Court. Defendant does not, apparently, argue that issue preclusion is not applicable here to establish fraud.

Both require a finding of an intent to deceive/defraud, the committing of the fraudulent act, and reliance upon it. In addition, the Code requires proof of a knowledge of the falsity or deceit, while the West Virginia code remains silent on this element. However, the cases interpreting \u00a7 61-3-24 have implied a knowledge requirement. The Supreme Court of West Virginia cited with approval the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [i]n cases of obtaining property by false pretenses, it must be proved that any misrepresentations of fact alleged by the People were made knowingly and with intent to deceive.

The\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   court stated that \"[p]ersons guilty of nothing more than innocent breaches or ordinary defaults are protected from criminal prosecution by the requirement that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt the fraudulent intent of the defendant at the time the promise was made.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20L.%20Ed.%20707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, this Court concludes that knowledge is a required element of both the West Virginia statute and \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It is the final element where the difference is manifest. Section 523(a)(2)(A) contains a requirement that the creditor be damaged, while the West Virginia statute is silent on damages. While the victim\n   must have parted with money or property due to the false pretense, there is no requirement that damages must be sustained. Indeed, the West Virginia Supreme Court has spoken to this issue, observing that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The crime of obtaining money or property by false pretenses is complete when the fraud intended is consummated by obtaining title to and possession of the property by means of a knowingly false representation or pretense. The crime is not purged by ultimate restoration or payment to the victim. It is sufficient if the fraud of the accused has put the victim in such a position that he or she may eventually suffer loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The appellant in the case now before this Court relies upon ... the minority view that an essential element of the crime of obtaining money or property by false pretenses is a pecuniary loss by the victim.

[The victim] has lost his [or her] chance to bargain with the facts before him [or her].

Final adjudication\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A plea to a misdemeanor in West Virginia is a proper basis for the application of issue preclusion.

He plead to misdemeanors for the same offense. A charge for that offense necessarily puts the allegations of intent to defraud and obtaining money or property via that fraud directly at issue.

His suggestion in his affidavit that he plead guilty because he did not have the time or funds to contest the charges, rather than because he was guilty, indicates that the pleas were a conscious and intentional act on his part. The plea form stated that the magistrate judge informed Defendant that he had the right to plead not guilty, to a trial, and to legal representation. It also indicated that Defendant had legal counsel in the criminal proceedings. Dkt. No. 11-5 at Ex. B.

While there has been a final adjudication on the merits, the Defendant is the same in the two actions, and he had a full and fair opportunity to litigate\n   the issues, ultimately the issues decided were not identical, as damage is not a required element of the crime of obtaining property by false pretenses in the State of West Virginia.
