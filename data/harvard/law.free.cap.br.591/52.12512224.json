JACOBVITZ, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   THIS MATTER is before the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on Susan Jesmer d/b/a Native Trading Associates\n   (\"Jesmer\")'s claim set forth in her proof of claim (Claim No. 2) and the Debtor's objection to the claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Primarily at issue is whether a provision in a promissory note constitutes an enforceable liquidated damages provision or an unenforceable penalty. The original principal amount of the promissory note made by WM Distribution, Inc. (\"WM\") and Sandia Tobacco Manufacturers, Inc. (\"STM\") in favor of Jesmer is $1,300,000. The provision of the promissory note in question requires payment of an additional $600,000 upon the occurrence of certain events of default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Based on the facts not in genuine dispute, the Court concludes that WM and STM are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law with respect to the $600,000 additional amount. Summary judgment will be denied with respect to the fees and expenses components of Jesmer's claim because facts are in genuine dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Summary judgment can streamline litigation and avoid the unnecessary expense of proceeding to trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farnell v.

It is undisputed that the principal balance of $1.3 million, plus the regular interest payments due on the principal under the Note, are now paid in full.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Facts Not Subject to Material Dispute, \u00b6 33,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   The Court will address Jesmer's claim to the $600,000 first and then will discuss the attorney fee claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Whether the $600,000 obligation under the Note is enforceable because it represents a discount in the amount WTM and STM would have owed Jesmer if no settlement had been reached.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   WM and STM reached an agreement with Jesmer that settled litigation among the parties. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, WM and STM executed a Promissory Note in the original principal amount of $1.3 million. The Note provides that WM and STM have an obligation to pay an additional $600,000 upon the occurrence of one or more of two defined events of default: 1) the dissolution, liquidation, or reorganization of either WM or STM (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   a bankruptcy filing)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or, the appointment of a receiver; or 2) the inability of WM or\n   STM to pay debts when they become due, or in the ordinary course of business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Promissory Note, \u00b6\u00b6 9(c) and (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Jesmer argues that the $600,000 provision is an enforceable term included in the Note as part of a vigorously negotiated settlement. She characterizes the $600,000 as a discount of the amount she sought and reasonably believed she would have been awarded in the State Court Action. She maintains that she was poised to recover actual damages of $1.8 million against WM and STM, which could have trebled or increased by an award of punitive damages, interest, attorneys' fees, and costs. When viewed this way, Jesmer argues the $600,000 is not a penalty but a negotiated compromise as part of a settlement to which WM and STM agreed in exchange for Jesmer agreeing to accept $1.3 million in satisfaction of her $6 million claim ($500,000 less than her claimed actual damages). Jesmer maintains that she accepted $1.3 million to settle her $6 million claim, instead of insisting on a larger amount, only on the condition that STM and WM would pay the $1.3 million before certain events of default occurred. When viewed in this manner, Jesmer argues, the $600,000 represents reasonable liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court disagrees with the notion that the reasonableness of the $600,000 provision should be considered based on the likely outcome of the State Court Action in which Jesmer asserted claims totaling $6 million. Jesmer agreed to settle the State Court Action for $1.3 million. That figure fixed the value of the claims in the State Court Action for settlement purposes. The Court concludes that Jesmer's requested damages asserted in the State Court Action, and her likelihood of success in that litigation, is irrelevant to whether the $600,000 provision is enforceable. The $600,000 does not represent a discount from Jesmer's likely litigation recovery given in settlement, as Jesmer maintains, but instead represents liquidated damages that are in addition to the agreed settlement amount, triggered upon the occurrence of certain defaults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The settlement documents belie Jesmer's characterization of the $600,000 as a \"discount.\" The Settlement Agreement provides that the settlement is without any admission of liability by any party and represents a compromise for the purpose of avoiding further controversy, litigation and expense. The Settlement Agreement provides that WM and STM shall pay Jesmer $1.3 million. It does not provide for a settlement in the amount of $1.9 million with a $600,000 discount if payment is made prior to default. The Settlement Agreement defines \"Indebtedness\" to include the $1.3 million, but not the $600,000. There is no reference in the Settlement Agreement to the $600,000 additional amount except as may have been set forth in the form of promissory note attached as an exhibit to the Settlement Agreement and incorporated by reference into the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement characterizes that form of Promissory Note as stating the terms of payment of the $1.3 million indebtedness under the Settlement Agreement. Further, nothing in the Settlement Agreement suggests that the $600,000 provision in the Note was included in exchange for Jesmer not insisting on a higher settlement amount, or was given in exchange for Jesmer discounting the original principal balance of the Note. Further, consistent with the settlement amount of $1.3 million stated in the Settlement Agreement, the Security Agreement requires WM and STM to obtain insurance in the amount of $1.3 million to insure the collateral pledged to secure the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Likewise, the Promissory Note, does not suggest that the additional $600,000 was included in exchange for a discount to the original principal of $1.3 million. To the contrary, the Note characterizes the additional $600,000 as agreed upon damages for which WM and STM will be liable upon the occurrence of either of two events of default: 1) the dissolution, liquidation, or reorganization of either WM or STM, or the appointment of a receiver; or 2) the inability of WM or STM to pay debts when they become due, or in the ordinary course of business. Note, \u00b6\u00b6 9(c) and (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Jesmer asserts that she was confident she would be awarded actual damages of $1.8 million against WM and STM in the State Court Action if she did not settle, and estimated the value of her claims to be $6 million, including her claims for treble and punitive damages. She points to this as support for the $1.3 million settlement amount being a discount from her valid $1.8 million actual damages claim and an even larger discount from her total claim. However, WM and STM disputed the claims and asserted counterclaims in the State Court Action. The fact that Jesmer settled for $1.3 million, which was far less than the $6 million she claimed, does not by itself suggest that the $600,000 additional amount was a discount given in settlement that was conditioned on payment of $1.3 million prior to occurrence of an event of default of the type that triggered a $600,000 default remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Jesmer has offered numerous emails between counsel who negotiated the Settlement Agreement regarding the $600,000 payment provision in the Promissory Note in support of her position that it reflects a negotiated discount of the amount she was likely to recover as damages in the pending litigation. The emails are inadmissible if offered for this purpose and therefore will not be considered by the Court. The \"Entire Agreement\" clause of the Settlement Agreement provides that the agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties relative to the subject matter of the agreement, and that the agreement supersedes all previous communications, representations or agreements between the parties relative to the subject matter of the agreement. The emails upon which Jesmer relies would be inconsistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement if they suggested that the $600,000 was intended as a discount. However, even if the emails were admissible, they fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact that could establish: 1) the $600,000 was a discount; or 2) WM or STM agreed they were liable to Jesmer in any amount prior to the parties reaching the settlement. At most, the emails show that the parties vigorously negotiated the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Jesmer relies on\n   <em>\n    Nippon Credit Bank, Ltd. v.

The $600,000 is not a discount from the settlement amount but instead is additional damages owed under a default remedy in the Note triggered by the occurrence of certain events of default. No judgment was entered as part of the Settlement Agreement for $1.9 million with a $600,000 discount upon payment of $1.3 million within a specified time. Nor was a discount given from the agreed settlement amount in exchange for payment faster than what the settlement agreement required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The settlement amount of $1.3 million to which Jesmer, WM and STM agreed as a compromise was the agreed value of Jesmer's claims for purposes of settling the State Court Action. Jesmer's own disputed estimation of the value of her claims in the State Court Action, including her disputed actual damages claim of $1.8 million and her disputed $6 million damages claim based on treble or punitive damages, is not the benchmark for the reasonableness of the $600,000 default damages provision. Where, as here, the parties settle disputed claims for a stated amount without any admission of liability, and the provision at issue awards liquidated damages in addition to the settlement amount on default, it is unnecessary to require the parties to present evidence of the likely outcome of the very litigation they chose to settle to determine the enforceability of the liquidated damages provision.

Those damages are covered by other provisions of the Note. WM does not dispute that Jesmer is entitled to compensation under the separate attorneys' fees clause in the Promissory Note for her reasonable attorneys' fees incurred to collect the Note, including her reasonable attorneys' fees incurred as a result of WM's bankruptcy filings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note, \u00b6 8. Further, the Note separately compensates Jesmer for other costs of collection and for damages incurred from delayed collection by imposing interest that continues to accrue on the past due balance and a late charge of 5% of the amount due on all past due payments. Thus there would be no reason to fix a liquidated damages figure to compensate for anticipated attorneys' fees and costs necessitated by a bankruptcy filing or collection difficulties. Jesmer's claim for attorneys' fees, costs and difficulty of collection is covered by the attorneys' fee, interest and late fee provisions in the Note, not by the $600,000 liquidated damages provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Further, under the settlement agreement, Jesmer reduced her risk of nonpayment from WM and STM by obtaining a lien against collateral to secure payment of the Note that must at all times be insured in an amount not less than $1.3 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In addition, Jesmer's damages arising from nonpayment of the Note other than attorneys' fees and costs of collection (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   failure to pay the amounts due on the schedule provided in the Note) are readily ascertainable and can be determined adding accrued interest to the unpaid principal balance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Market Center East\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5717611\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/433/335/#p360\">\n    433 B.R. at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen a cash payment is not made it is not difficult to estimate the damage.

Consequently, the $600,000 liquidated damages provision constitutes an unenforceable penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Whether Jesmer's claim for attorneys' fees in WM's bankruptcy case has already been satisfied\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   WM does not dispute that Jesmer is entitled to her reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in for collecting the Note but asserts that her claim for attorneys' fees represents the same fees the Court has already allowed Jesmer in STM's bankruptcy case and that satisfy her attorneys fee claim in the WM case. To support this contention, WM relies on two orders entered in STM's bankruptcy case: 1) Order Approving Compromise Resolving Disposition of Proceeds of Sale of Asset (\"Compromise Order\") - Docket No. 207; and 2) Order Resolving Entitlement of Susan Jesmer to Attorney Fees (\"Attorney Fee Order\") - Docket No. 243. In the Compromise Order, Jesmer agreed to accept payment of $31,779.00 in full satisfaction of her claims against STM, other than her claim for attorneys' fees. Compromise Order, \u00b6 B. The Attorney Fee Order recites that Ms. Jesmer produced billing statements for fees incurred between September 20, 2016 and June 30, 2017 related to STM and the Promissory Note.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attorney Fee Order, \u00b613. The Attorney Fee Order included the following provisions: 1) STM's \"payment of $12,000 to Ms. Jesmer shall constitute full and complete satisfaction of any claim that Ms. Jesmer has against [STM] for attorneys' fees and expenses\"; 2) \"Ms. Jesmer will not present any portion of the billing statements heretofore produced in this matter for payment by WM Distribution, Inc.\" Attorney Fee Order, \u00b6\u00b6 B and C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Jesmer's WM Claim requests attorneys' fees of $68,582.98 for the period of September 2016 through March 9, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Claim No. 2-2 (Attachment 6). One possible inference from the Attorney Fee Order and Jesmer's WM Claim is that the attorneys' fees sought in WM's bankruptcy case duplicate the billing statements presented to STM that resulted in the Attorney Fee Order. Jesmer, however, points out that the Attorney Fee Order only limited Jesmer from seeking fees for payment that had already been presented for payment in the STM bankruptcy case and compromised Jesmer's claims only with respect to STM. Because the none of the billing statements are currently before the Court, the Court cannot determine for from the evidence before it whether the attorneys' fees Jesmer included in her WM Claim are the same fees she compromised in the STM bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The facts not subject to material dispute establish as a matter of law that the $600,000 default damages amount is an unenforceable penalty. Such amount is so\n   extravagant or disproportionate to the damages Jesmer would suffer from a default triggering the liquidated damages provision that it functions as a punishment rather than compensation. However, facts not in material dispute fail to establish whether Jesmer is entitled to the attorneys' fees component of her claim. The Court will, therefore, deny summary judgment with respect to the attorneys' fees included in Jesmer's claim. The Court will enter a separate order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Debtor's Motion for Summary Judgment - Docket No. 156; Motion for Summary Judgment on Sandia Tobacco Manufacturers, Inc.'s Objection to Proof of Claim of Susan Jesmer (Claim 2) (\"STM's Motion for Summary Judgment\") - Docket No. 180; Susan Jesmer d/b/a Native Trading Associates' Motion for Summary Judgment on Objections to her Claims by Debtor and Sandia Tobacco Manufacturers (\"Jesmer's Motion for Summary Judgment\") - Docket No. 183.
