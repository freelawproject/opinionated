No. 4066] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   \") brought by LCP SLJV 2008-1 IL-1, LLC (\"\n   <em>\n    LCP\n   </em>\n   \"), the current owner of real property once owned by a non-Debtor (Debtor defined\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), but related, entity, and assignee of Debtors' personal property in the above-captioned bankruptcy case. The Motion is opposed by Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland (\"\n   <em>\n    F &amp; D\n   </em>\n   \"), a surety on projects relating to those assets and a creditor of the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The core of this dispute is not one of first impression for this court. Under similar but not identical circumstances, this court previously found that F &amp; D violated the confirmation order in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Kimball Hill, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272879\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/878/\">\n    565 B.R. 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

The TRG Decision guides much of the court's analysis herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The differences, however, are meaningful. As a result while, for the reasons more fully set forth below, the court will grant in part the Motion, damages in this matter will be less straightforward.

The court also has constitutional authority to enter a final order with respect to the Motion because both parties have consented to this court's hearing and determining\n   the issues therein-LCP by filing the Motion and F &amp; D by filing its claim and by its participation in this case.

TRG, in turn, first sought in the state courts dismissal of the collection actions brought by F &amp; D. That was largely successful until, in 2015 and 2016, appeals reversed several of the dismissals. At that time, TRG brought its motion to this court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272879\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/878/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   TRG alleged and the court found that terms of the Plan and F &amp; D's participation thereunder and in the bankruptcy cases foreclosed F &amp; D's ability to pursue TRG as a successor in interest to the Debtors.

The subdivision at issue is located in Sugar Grove, Illinois and is named Settler's Ridge. Settler's Ridge had two owners, each owning a portion of the property that was to become the subdivision-Alexander Family of Illinois Limited Partnership (\"\n   <em>\n    AFILP\n   </em>\n   \") and KH SRAV I, LLC (\"\n   <em>\n    KHS\n   </em>\n   \"). KHS, a non-Debtor, was managed and majority owned by Kimball Hill Homes Illinois, LLC (\"\n   <em>\n    KHH\n   </em>\n   \"), a Debtor. KHS executed a mortgage with respect its portion of Settler's Ridge in favor of Wachovia Bank, N.A. (\"\n   <em>\n    Wachovia\n   </em>\n   \") to secure a $40 million loan for the development of Settler's Ridge. KHI, another Debtor, guaranteed the Wachovia loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As was customary and had occurred with TRG, the municipality having jurisdiction over the Settler's Ridge project entered into an annexation agreement with AFILP and KHS as owners and KHH as developer (the \"\n   <em>\n    Annexation Agreement\n   </em>\n   \"), which Annexation Agreement set forth the terms and conditions under which Settler's Ridge would be developed, including the duties and rights of each of the parties. KHH, as the developer, was required to post bonds to ensure its performance under the Annexation Agreement and it did so, with F &amp; D as the surety (the \"\n   <em>\n    Performance Bonds\n   </em>\n   \"). The municipality, the Village of Sugar Grove (the \"\n   <em>\n    Village\n   </em>\n   \"), had the right to pursue F &amp; D under the Performance Bonds if certain public improvements were not completed. If F &amp; D was forced to pay funds under the Performance Bonds, F &amp; D had a right of indemnity from KHH that was memorialized in an indemnity agreement (the \"\n   <em>\n    Indemnity Agreement\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   LCP acquired the Wachovia mortgage and related notes as a part of a pool of defaulted mortgage loans in October 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 3, 2009, the trust created under the Plan (the \"\n   <em>\n    KHI Trust\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   KHS and LCP (as subsequent holder of the Wachovia mortgage) entered into an Agreement of Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure to address the mortgage liability owed by KHS and the guaranty of the same by KHI. Reply, Exh. C [Dkt. Nos. 4223-4 to 4223-7] (the \"\n   <em>\n    DIL Agreement\n   </em>\n   \"). The DIL Agreement provided for the transfer to LCP of the Settler's Ridge real property owned by KHS via a quitclaim deed and the sale of KHH's and KHI's personal property interests relating to the real property in exchange for a covenant by LCP not to sue KHS or KHI on account of the mortgage, thereby resolving LCP's (previously Wachovia's) bankruptcy claim against KHI as guarantor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In 2010, the Village sought relief from the Plan Injunction in order to permit them to continue enforcement of the regulations governing Settler's Ridge by suing F &amp; D and other sureties under the Annexation Agreement. On April 30, 2010, the court approved a stipulation by the Debtors, F &amp; D and the Village to resolve the Village's request. Stipulation and Agreed Order for Modification of Plan Injunction [Dkt. No. 2365] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Village Stip\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ulation\n   </em>\n   \"). In the Village Stipulation, all parties stipulated that under the Plan the Debtors rejected the Annexation Agreement as part of their rejection of executory contracts generally. However, parties with damages stemming from the rejection of these contracts were allowed to file claims. The Village filed a claim on account of rejection of the Annexation Agreement for $6,533,653.32 [Claim No. 2363] (defined in the Village Agreement as the \"\n   <em>\n    Village Claim\n   </em>\n   \"). F &amp; D filed multiple claims relating to the Settler's Ridge project (defined in the Village Agreement as the \"\n   <em>\n    Zurich Claims\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Village Stipulation provides specifically that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The Plan Injunction shall be modified for the limited purpose of permitting the Village to proceed against the Bonds, at no cost to the KHI Trusts, so that the Village may establish liability against [KHH] under the Annexation Agreement for the sole purpose of recovering\n   <em>\n    against the proceeds of the Bonds, if any\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   To the extent that a Surety actually satisfies any portion of the Village Claim pursuant to the Bonds, ... the Village hereby agrees to (a) assign the Village Claim to such Surety in an amount equal to the payment(s) made by such Surety in discharge of its obligations under the Bonds and (b) waive any and all of its remaining claims described in the Village Claim to the extent not assigned to the Surety. For the avoidance of doubt, a Surety may succeed to the Village's rights in the Village Claim solely to the extent the Surety satisfies any portion of the Village Claim pursuant to the Bond;\n   <em>\n    provided, however, under no circumstances may a Surety obtain a double recovery on account of the Zurich Claims\n   </em>\n   ...

F &amp; D replies that the court should not look at the claims asserted in the Sugar Grove Lawsuit, but instead look at the nature of the parties. Neither party is entirely correct. Claims and parties in this matter cannot be considered in isolation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As was the case with TRG, LCP must first show that the claims upon which F &amp; D proceeds in the Sugar Grove Lawsuit were subject to the Release or Plan Injunction.

The same is true here.

In the TRG Decision, it was clear that TRG was a successor to the Debtor. The Plan itself provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The rights, benefits, and obligations of any Entity named or referred to in the Plan shall be binding on, and shall inure to the benefit of any heir, executor, administrator,\n   <em>\n    successor or assign\n   </em>\n   , affiliate, officer, director, agent, representative, attorney, beneficiaries, or guardian, if any, of each Entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plan, at XV.F (emphasis added). The court therefore concluded that, because TRG purchased estate assets from a Debtor,\n   TRG was the successor owner to property of the estate and entitled, pursuant to the express terms of the Plan, to claim the protections afforded Released Parties thereunder.\n   <em>\n    TRG Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272879\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/878/\">\n    565 B.R. at 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   That conclusion is not nearly as clear here. In order to determine if the claims against LCP in the Sugar Grove Lawsuit were affected by the Release or the Plan Injunction, the court must ask if LCP was a party protected by the Release or the Plan Injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   To do so, the court must therefore examine LCP's rights and how and from whom they were acquired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   LCP acquired the Settler's Ridge real property via a quitclaim deed from KHS, a non-Debtor entity. F &amp; D argues that because of this difference from TRG, LCP is at best a successor in title only. The court agrees with this basic assumption, but the matter is not so cut-and-dried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The transfer of the real property from KHS to LCP was done under the DIL Agreement, but there are also other elements to the transaction. The DIL Agreement addresses the transfer of multiple interests to LCP and provides a list of steps to effectuate the transfers. DIL Agreement, at \u00b6 1. Focusing on one element while ignoring the rest is problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Personal Property from KHH and KHI\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   While the real property under the DIL Agreement was transferred from a non-Debtor, the personal property and rights of Debtors KHH and KHI were also transferred to LCP thereunder. Specifically, KHH assigned contract rights to LCP related to the development of Settler's Ridge [Reply, Exh. D] (the \"\n   <em>\n    KHH Assignment\n   </em>\n   \"), allowing LCP to continue development of the real property. The KHH Assignment provides that it is in connection with the DIL Agreement and is \"for good and valuable consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272879\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/878/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   KHI also sold its intellectual property relating to Settler's Ridge to LCP \"for good and valuable consideration\" and in connection with the DIL Agreement. Reply, Exh. F (the \"\n   <em>\n    KHI Bill of Sale\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The KHH Assignment and the KHI Bill of Sale were transfers of interests of the Debtors. As the successor to and/or assign of those interests, LCP is entitled to enforce the Release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan, at XV.F;\n   <em>\n    TRG Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272879\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/878/\">\n    565 B.R. at 887, 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . F &amp; D's argument to the contrary is unavailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   F &amp; D also argues that LCP should not be protected by the Release and Plan Injunction because LCP did not provide value to the Debtors. This argument is not supported by the facts. As previously mentioned, the Plan Administrator negotiated the DIL Agreement in exchange for the release of KHH and KHI's liability to Wachovia and subsequently to LCP. A release of debt provides value to a bankruptcy estate and ultimately to F &amp; D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    4100 W. Grand LLC v.

Just as F &amp; D would be hard-pressed to argue that an interest of KHH or KHI transferred to LCP would not be subject to the Release and Plan Injunction, LCP would be hard-pressed to argue that an interest of a non-Debtor, in this instance KHS, transferred to LCP was subject to the Release and Plan Injunction. Nonetheless, LCP attempts to do so, belatedly asserting at the June 13, 2018 hearing on the Motion that the transfers under the DIL Agreement constituted a single transaction and thus that the real property transferred thereunder should be afforded the same protection as the personal property transferred from the Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This simply cannot be the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plain language of the Release and Plan Injunction clearly only extends to claims against the Debtors and their Affiliates, not against KHI as a whole. In no way did the Plan or the Confirmation Order extend these protections to non-Debtors unless such parties were Affiliates. Extending releases and injunctions to non-debtors, without more, is contrary to generally-accepted bankruptcy practice.\n   <em>\n    Hotel 71 Mezz Lender LLC v. Nat'l Ret.

Therefore, F &amp; D seeks the same relief against both LCP and TRG under those counts as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Because F &amp; D's rights as against LCP under Count I are the very same rights as existed against KHH, a Debtor, under the Indemnity Agreement, and because claims under the Indemnity Agreement, as a contract with a Debtor, were subject to the Release and Plan Injunction, the court's holding in the TRG Decision holds equally true as against LCP as it did against TRG.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of F &amp; D's original claims in the Sugar Grove Lawsuit asserted the theories espoused in the Elgin Decision. Because the claims as asserted in the Sugar Grove Lawsuit were released and enjoined, the Third-Party Complaint as brought against LCP in the Sugar Grove Lawsuit violated the Release and Plan Injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Further, LCP, as a Released Party insofar as the personal property rights acquired from KHH, is entitled to invoke those protections. The Third-Party Complaint as brought in the Sugar Grove Lawsuit is, therefore, in direct violation of the terms of the Plan and F &amp; D is in contempt of the Confirmation Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Request for Leave to Amend\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Having determined that F &amp; D filed the Sugar Grove Lawsuit in violation of the Release and the Plan Injunction, the court concludes that by the same token, the filing of the Request for Leave to Amend also violated the Plan Injunction. As an attempt to continue a lawsuit brought in direct violation of the Plan Injunction and during the ongoing litigation in this court where F &amp; D represented that it would not do so, the Request for Leave to Amend violates the Plan Injunction and is sanctionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hall-Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5712951\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/445/873/#p876\">\n    445 B.R. 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876 (Bankr.

Okla. 1998) (\"Section 524(e) was intended to insure that co-debtors or guarantors (who are not debtors in the bankruptcy case), and their property, are not automatically released from the debt or guaranty upon the discharge of a debtor, and that the rights of creditors are not impaired by the debtor's discharge. For example, in the case of a guaranty, the guarantor is not released upon the discharge of the debtor who is primarily liable on the debt; Section 524(e) preserves a creditor's right to pursue a guarantor notwithstanding the discharge of the debtor, which might be deemed a modification of the underlying debt without the creditor's consent, and which might otherwise release the guarantor under state law.\"), would be released from that guarantee liability by acquiring the underlying collateral from the bankruptcy estate where a release had been ordered. The obligations stand independent from one another and do not merge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    F &amp; D relies heavily on the state court's Elgin Decision to argue that its claims against LCP are not claims under the Indemnity Agreement, but rather are claims that arise first out of the Annexation Agreement and then out of the real property itself. This is consistent with the Elgin Decision, which found that the duty of KHH as developer to complete the public improvements, as set forth in the Annexation Agreement, was a covenant that ran with the land that was not \"discharged\" by this bankruptcy case.\n    <em>\n     City of Elgin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20Ill.%20Dec.%20900\">\n     402 Ill.Dec. 900\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20N.E.3d%2031\">\n     53 N.E.3d at 40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
