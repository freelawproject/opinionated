Old GM knew about the defects but did not disclose them to car buyers, regulators or the public, and most relevant to the bankruptcy case, Old GM did not disclose to the owners of defective vehicles that they had to file claims against Old GM for personal injuries, wrongful death, property damage and economic losses caused or contributed to by the defects before the bankruptcy claims bar date-November 30, 2009. On July 5, 2009, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of substantially all of Old GM's assets to General Motors LLC (\"New GM\") in a section 363 sale. The sale closed on July 10, 2009 and, fortunately, New GM continues to prosper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in February 2014, New GM began recalling cars due to a potentially lethal defect in their ignition switches. As recounted in a Second Circuit opinion, \"from February until October 2014, new GM would issue over 60 recalls, with the number of affected vehicles in the United States alone surpassing 25 million.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliott v.

Old GM's Chapter 11 Plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on March 29, 2011, well before disclosure of the serious product defects and well past the bar date for filing proofs of claim. The Chapter 11 Plan authorized the creation of the GUC Trust to oversee the claims allowance process and distribute assets for the benefit of Old GM's unsecured creditors pursuant to the terms of the GUC Trust Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Motors Liquidation Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p536\">\n    529 B.R. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536 (Bankr.

The cases filed in federal courts were transferred to Judge Jesse M. Furman in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for pretrial proceedings (the \"MDL\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2015, after the vehicle defects were disclosed, the bankruptcy court addressed the issue of whether parties injured by the previously undisclosed defects could recover from the GUC Trust. The bankruptcy court concluded, among other things, that the confirmed Chapter 11 Plan was substantially consummated, and any effort to recover damages from the GUC Trust for previously unasserted claims was equitably moot.\n   <em>\n    In re Motors Liquidation Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p536\">\n    529 B.R. at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   stated that \"the amount of purportedly barred liabilities was substantial-an estimated\n   $7 to $10 billion in economic losses, not to mention damages from pre-closing accidents.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343079,4339735\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Utilizing the theory of follow the money, the injured parties (the \"Claimants\") focused their efforts on claims against New GM, on a variety of theories including successor liability. New GM expressly assumed liability for personal injury, wrongful death and property damage claims caused by Old GM's misconduct for accidents that occurred after New GM acquired the assets of Old GM (\"Post-Sale Accidents\"). New GM did not, however, assume liability for personal injury, wrongful death and property damage claims for accidents that occurred before New GM acquired Old GM's assets (\"Pre-Sale Accidents\"). Nor did New GM assume liability for any economic losses resulting from defective vehicles manufactured by Old GM. The MDL proceeding has been carefully and methodically addressing the issues in hundreds of individual and putative class-action lawsuits against New GM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Pre-Sale Accident claimants and the economic loss claimants now seek to recover from the GUC Trust, the successor of Old GM's estate with respect to unsecured claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Second Circuit's July 2016\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   decision affirmed in part and reversed in part earlier bankruptcy court rulings. In the portion of\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   most relevant to the issues now before this Court, the Second Circuit addressed the bankruptcy court's decision \"that relief for would-be claims against the GUC Trust was equitably moot.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343079,4339735\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the issue of equitable mootness, the Second Circuit vacated the bankruptcy court's ruling, concluded that the ruling was advisory, and remanded to the bankruptcy court. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Neither GUC Trust nor Old GM are parties to the multi-district litigation now ongoing in the district court. Only one defendant is named: New GM. Likewise, as GUC Trust confirmed at oral argument, plaintiffs have not filed any proofs of claim with GUC Trust, nor have they even asked the bankruptcy court for permission to file late proofs of claim or to lift the bar date, as would be required before relief could be granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343079,4339735\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343079,4339735\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Second Circuit further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Instead, it appears from the record that GUC Trust became involved at\n   <em>\n    New GM's\n   </em>\n   behest. New GM noted \"well there is a GUC Trust\" and suggested that because the Sale Order's bar on successor liability, any claims remained with Old GM and thus GUC Trust. But New GM has not sought to implead and bring cross-claims against GUC Trust in the multi-district litigation under\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 14 or to do the same in the Groman Plaintiffs' adversary proceeding in bankruptcy under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343079,4339735\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343079,4339735\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    at 168-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (record citation omitted) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As this excerpt from the Second Circuit opinion shows, New GM sought to use the GUC Trust as a foil against claims that New GM is liable for defects in vehicles manufactured by Old GM by arguing that the GUC Trust is liable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the tables have now turned. For the last several years, the Claimants injured by Old GM-manufactured vehicles, no longer burdened by an equitable mootness ruling, have been seeking to assert and recover late claims in Old GM's bankruptcy case. For too long, the GUC Trust, \"at New GM's behest,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343079,4339735\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , worked to thwart the Claimants' efforts to recover compensation for their injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   That situation is now changed. The GUC Trust has been working constructively with the Claimants to develop a program that will expeditiously provide a mechanism for potentially millions of Claimants to be compensated for their injuries. Rather than working cooperatively with the GUC Trust and Claimants to facilitate a fair resolution of claims, New GM has worked assiduously to torpedo efforts to streamline a workable claims resolution process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   What is clear is that the Claimants injured by Old GM-manufactured vehicles may have a source of recovery-\n   <em>\n    namely, New GM\n   </em>\n   -without requiring Old GM's creditors who have already received distributions to pay back distributions, and without any finding of successor liability or wrongdoing by New GM. How so? The confirmed Chapter 11 Plan and Sale Order contain an \"accordion\" feature, which provides that New GM is required to issue \"Adjustment Shares\" to the GUC Trust if allowed unsecured claims exceed $35 billion dollars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   If that occurs, the injured parties could recover from the GUC Trust\n   <em>\n    without any finding of wrongdoing or successor\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    liability of New GM.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As things currently stand, allowed unsecured claims total $31.85 billion and Claimants assert that their claims exceed over $7 billion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliott,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343079,4339735\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, if Claimants' claims are allowed, it appears possible that the accordion will be triggered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   New GM's phalanx of lawyers has aggressively done everything in its capacity to build roadblocks in the way of the Claimants' efforts to obtain allowed unsecured claims against the GUC Trust. For its part, the GUC Trust now wants to bring an end to the years of litigation, and to provide for the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of recovery by Claimants. Therefore, the GUC Trust has entered into a proposed settlement with the \"Signatory Plaintiffs,\" a group composed of 549 individuals claiming personal injuries, wrongful death and property damage for Pre-Sale Accidents and 59 individuals claiming economic loss damages; the Signatory Plaintiffs asserting economic loss claims seek to serve as representatives for the millions who own automobiles with one or more alleged defects that were the subject of some of the vehicle recalls in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   New GM denies direct liability to any of these injured parties. The settlement would permit late claims against the GUC Trust (for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage and economic losses), but leave the determination of the proper amount of aggregate allowed claims to an estimation proceeding under section 502(c), followed by development and court approval of a distribution plan. New GM opposes approval of the settlement for a long list of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This opinion primarily deals with New GM's argument that no settlement of economic loss claims for all individuals that suffered an economic loss may be approved unless the economic loss Claimants certify for settlement purposes one or more classes under Bankruptcy Rule 7023.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The GUC Trust and the Signatory Plaintiffs (collectively, the \"Movants\") have proposed a settlement construct that, they say, does not require class certification. Their proposed settlement consists of: (i) a notice program, designed to give all potential claimants notice and an opportunity to appear and be heard (\"Notice Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 14292); (ii) a Bankruptcy Rule 9019 settlement that does not fix the amount of damages, if any, but waives Claimants' right to recover from anything other than the Adjustment Shares or New GM (if their claims against New GM succeed in the District Court) (\"Settlement Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 14293); (iii) an estimation proceeding under Bankruptcy Code section 502(c) to estimate aggregate claims for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage and economic losses. The GUC Trust and Signatory Plaintiffs are hopeful that their proposed settlement will (1) require New GM to contribute Adjustment Shares to the GUC Trust (\"Estimation\n   Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 14294); and (2) lead to a negotiated and court approved distribution plan for recoveries by Claimants who suffered compensable injuries. The proposed settlement construct is creative, using the statutory section 502(c) estimation procedure that is available in a bankruptcy case but not available in the actions pending in the District Court. Moreover, it would no doubt speed the resolution of claims. But, despite New GM's intransigence and unwillingness to negotiate, the Court agrees with New GM that the settlement construct does not work-Rule 7023 class certification of the economic loss claimants is required before all the economic loss claims can be estimated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court will explain the reasons for this conclusion in greater detail below, but in short, the proposed settlement both compromises and proposes to bind millions of putative economic loss claimants who are not currently represented in this Court. The GUC Trust seeks instructions from the Court that it may enter into the proposed settlement, authority which the Court may clearly exercise, but that does not answer the question about the procedures that must be followed to approve a settlement that binds all economic loss claimants who have not appeared in the bankruptcy case. If the settlement were part of a proposed chapter 11 plan that was subject to the usual notice, right to be heard, voting requirements, and court approval, class certification probably would not be required. The GUC Trust and Signatory Plaintiffs do not contemplate a plan modification under Bankruptcy Code section 1127, which probably would not be feasible at this point in any event.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules' procedural safeguards that ordinarily make class certification unnecessary in a collective bankruptcy proceeding cannot be used in place of Rule 7023 for achieving a binding settlement. As explained below, section 105, upon which the GUC Trust and Signatory Plaintiffs rely, cannot be used to bypass the existing statute and rules-based procedures for achieving a settlement that binds millions of economic loss claimants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While the Court expects that New GM will continue its efforts to thwart any settlement that requires New GM to contribute Adjustment Shares, a path forward for the GUC Trust and Signatory Plaintiffs appears viable based on Second Circuit precedent that the parties did not address in their briefs.\n   <em>\n    In re Joint Eastern and Southern District Asbestos Litigation\n   </em>\n   arose out of the bankruptcy of Johns-Manville Corporation (\"Manville\"), an asbestos manufacturer.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"36568,6520777\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/982/721/\">\n    982 F.2d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 725 (2d Cir. 1992),\n   <em>\n    opinion modified on reh'g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6526226,10508749\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/7/\">\n    993 F.2d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1993).

The Settlement Amount and Adjustment Shares will be reserved for the exclusive benefit of the Plaintiffs. With the oversight and assistance of Magistrate Judge Cott and subject to approval by this Court, Plaintiffs will determine the overall allocation of the value of the Settlement Fund between economic loss claims, personal injury claims, and wrongful death claims. Plaintiffs will also determine the eligibility criteria for payment to Plaintiffs from the Settlement Fund; this determination will also be subject to the supervision of Magistrate Judge Cott and subject to this Court's approval. (Movants Br. at 11-12.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Plaintiffs.\n   </strong>\n   In exchange, the Settlement Order, which will only be entered after the Plaintiffs receive notice and an opportunity to be heard, will contain a waiver provision that irrevocably waives and releases all Plaintiffs' claims against Old GM, the Old GM estate, the GUC Trust, the GUC Trust Administrator, Unitholders, and the Motors Liquidation Company Avoidance Action Trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Proposed Settlement contemplates successive stages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   the Settlement Motion \u00b6 7). First, the Movants will seek approval of the Notice Procedures laid out in the Notice Motion (the \"Notice Procedures\"), whereby the GUC Trust will provide notice of the Settlement Agreement to all Plaintiffs in order to bind all Plaintiffs, including those who did not execute the Settlement Agreement. (The Notice Motion.) Thereafter, the GUC Trust will seek the Court's approval of the Proposed Settlement. In the event the Court approves the Proposed Settlement, the GUC Trust will then ask the Court to estimate Plaintiffs' aggregate allowed General Unsecured Claims on a class wide basis. (The Settlement Motion \u00b6 51.) If the Court enters the Proposed Estimation Order and concludes that the Plaintiffs' claims exceed $35 billion, the GUC Trust will then ask the Court to direct New GM to issue the Adjustment Shares to a Settlement Fund, and the Plaintiffs will establish procedures for asserting claims against the Settlement Fund. (Proposed Settlement \u00a7 2.11.) Finally, the Court will decide whether to approve the allocation of the Settlement Fund and the criteria for determining Claimants' entitlement to the fund. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The core of New GM's opposition is the broad nature of the Proposed Settlement, and its potential to trigger New GM's obligation under the Sale Agreement to issue Adjustment Shares (in which case New GM would essentially be responsible for funding the entire Proposed Settlement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The signatory parties to the Proposed Settlement include 549 PIWD (Personal Injury and Wrongful Death) Plaintiffs, who are listed by name on Schedule 2 (Proposed Settlement, 41-46), and 59 \"Economic Loss Plaintiffs,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   who are also listed by name on Schedule 3 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-59), or 608 plaintiffs in total. But the Proposed Settlement also seeks to resolve the claims of millions of plaintiffs who are not signatories. It contemplates the provision of procedures including: (i) due process notice, (ii) an opportunity to object to the Proposed Settlement and the estimation of the parties' claims and (iii) the opportunity to object to the subsequent allocation and distribution methodology. (Movants Br. at 11.) New GM does not dispute that the Movants may settle, estimate and allow the approximately 600 claims that the Signatory Plaintiffs have sought leave to file against the GUC Trust. (New GM Br. at 8.) New GM argues, however, that the Court cannot estimate and allow the\n   <em>\n    unfiled\n   </em>\n   potential claims of the millions of non-signatories who would be bound by the Proposed Settlement (at least not without deciding whether the proposed nationwide classes would be certified under Rule 23). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) According to New GM, the only claims capable of being settled are those of the individually-named plaintiffs that filed proofs of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Rule 23 Gating Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Rule 23 Gating Issue is whether Rule 23 must be applied to the Proposed Settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties initially entered into the Proposed Settlement on April 25, 2018. Thereafter, on May 2, the GUC Trust filed a motion seeking approval of their proposed Notice Procedures. (The Notice Motion.) On May 3, the GUC Trust filed a motion seeking approval of their settlement agreement, (the Settlement Motion), and a motion seeking estimation of the Plaintiffs' Claims. (The Estimation Motion.) On May 10, the Court entered an order raising questions regarding the Settlement Agreement with respect to the impact on the PIWD Plaintiffs' jury trial\n   rights in light of the Proposed Settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Doc. # 14301.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On May 25, the Court held a conference regarding the three pending motions and instructed the parties to brief the issue of whether Rule 23 must be applied to the Proposed Settlement. In its brief, New GM argues that the Court should not estimate and allow hypothetical unfiled claims of putative class members without first determining whether to certify a class under Rule 23. New GM argues that since the Proposed Settlement seeks to settle, estimate and allow the claims of 11.4 million individuals, Rule 23 must apply. New GM reasons that there is no precedent for settling or allowing the claims of 11.4 million individuals without first certifying a class. In addition, it argues that doing so would violate bankruptcy law and New GM's contractual rights because the Sale Agreement requires the Court to estimate \"aggregate allowed general unsecured claims,\" not just \"claims,\" when determining whether New GM must issue Adjustment Shares. In any estimation proceeding, New GM argues, the Court must consider whether the \"claims\" the Movants ask the Court to settle and estimate are even capable of being allowed-and it cannot do so if claims are unfiled or if classes are not certified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Movants counter that the Court has the authority to proceed under both Bankruptcy Rule 9019 and section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and may approve the Proposed Settlement without applying Rule 23. The Movants argue that the Court has exclusive\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over the assets of the bankruptcy estate and can, therefore, issue orders to effectuate settlements that will speed the administration of the estate, even if the rights of parties are affected. Moreover, according to the Movants, requiring Rule 23 certification would contravene the fundamental principle that bankruptcy is a collective proceeding and would impose unnecessary restrictions on how the Court can proceed. The Movants emphasize that the Plan and the GUC Trust Agreement allow for the estimation of \"claims,\" not just \"proofs of claim,\" and that section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code similarly allows for the estimation of \"claims\" for allowance purposes. The Movants also stress that claimants would all receive due process through elaborate Notice Procedures, which would eliminate any concern that noncompliance with Rule 23 might shirk due process requirements. Finally, the Movants argue that New GM lacks standing to assert its defenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   To complicate matters, the parties have also raised the issue of whether a ruling in this Court that a Rule 23 certification of economic loss plaintiff classes is required would implicate overlapping issues between this Court and the MDL currently before Judge Furman in the District Court. The MDL concerns litigation brought by pre-closing accident and economic loss plaintiffs against New GM, addressing the same types of claims asserted against Old GM that are before this Court. Judge Furman will also address the Rule 23(b)(3) class certification issues concerning economic loss claimants' claims against New GM in the MDL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Movants argue that the \"issues here are distinct from those in the MDL bellwether class certification process,\" so \"this Court could certify a settlement class without fear of conflict with the major rulings that Judge Furman might make ....\" (Movants Br. at 30.) The Movants argue that if class certification is required in this Court, class certification is appropriate under Rule 23(b)(1), rather than Rule 23(b)(3), raising different issues than certification in the District Court. According to the Movants, there are significant differences between certification in the MDL and certification here because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (i)\n   <em>\n    there is very little overlap between the [Proposed] Settlement's Economic Loss Plaintiffs and the MDL class Plaintiffs;\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    (ii) only the Settlement Plaintiffs can obtain 'limited fund' certification because New GM is not a limited fund; and (iii) even if the Court considers Rule 23(b)(3) in lieu of using Rule 23(b)(1)(B) for a limited fund, certification will be decided under the settlement-mandated structure that does not consider trial manageability factors.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Amchem Prods., Inc. v.

(\"Stay Br.\" \u00b6 54, ECF Doc. # 14315.) The Proposed Settlement \"presumes the certification of putative economic loss classes containing 11.4 million purportedly 'common' claims of the same economic loss claimants who are putative\n   class members in the MDL.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Relevant Provisions of the Sale Agreement, Plan, and GUC Trust Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   New GM argues, and the Court agrees, that to determine whether the Court can approve the Proposed Settlement without certifying economic loss plaintiff classes, in addition to looking to the relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules and case law, the Court must consider the applicable sections of the Sale Agreement (\"Sale Agreement,\" ECF Doc. # 2968-2), the Plan (\"Plan,\" ECF Doc. # 9941-1) and the GUC Trust Agreement (\"GUC Trust Agreement,\" ECF Doc. # 13332), all of which bear on New GM's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This is because a \"key objective\" of the Proposed Settlement is to \"seek the maximum amount of Adjustment Shares and to make the value of the Settlement Fund and the Adjustment Shares available to satisfy, in part, the Plaintiffs' Claims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Proposed Settlement \u00b6 NN.) The process for issuing Adjustment Shares is governed by the Plan, the Sale Agreement and the GUC Trust Agreement. New GM's obligation to issue Adjustment Shares is addressed in \u00a7 3.2(c)(i) of the Sale Agreement. If the Court enters an order at the GUC Trust's request \"finding that the estimated aggregate allowed general unsecured claims against Sellers' estates exceed $35,000,000.000,\" then New GM must issue Adjustment Shares. (Sale Agreement \u00a7 3.2(c)(i).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Sale Agreement, Plan and GUC Trust Agreement each repeatedly refer to the estimation of \"Allowed General Unsecured Claims,\" when referring to the Adjustment Shares, and the Side Letter discusses \"allowed eligible claims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   As New\n   GM's counsel acknowledged, these provisions only make sense if they contemplate estimation of unliquidated or contingent claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 502(c)(1) (\"There shall be estimated for purpose of allowance ... (1) any contingent or unliquidated claim, the fixing of which, as the case may be, would unduly delay the administration of the case ....\"). The amounts of \"allowed claims\" have already been fixed and require no estimation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Claims and Allowance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The basic requirements creditors must meet to benefit from bankruptcy's collective distribution process are generally uncontroversial, but here these requirements bear acutely on the parties' dispute. New GM claims that the Court cannot approve the settlement and estimate unfiled hypothetical claims, while the Movants argue that the Court may do so because of its inherent powers to determine the rights of parties to the assets of an estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A \"creditor\" is defined by section 101(10) of the Bankruptcy Code to mean anyone with a provable claim against the debtor's estate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10).

While section 706(a) gives the debtor a right to convert the case, section 706(d) mandates that the debtor qualify as a \"debtor\" under chapter 13. Because section 1307(c) provides that a chapter 13 case can be dismissed \"for cause,\" the Bankruptcy Code expressly authorizes dismissal for debtor's bad-faith conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In this matter, removing the protections of Rule 23 is not \"necessary or appropriate\" to carry out the provisions of the Code. Before plan confirmation, the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules include protections for debtors and creditors that, in many instances, make application of Rule 23 unnecessary and indeed inappropriate. For example, section 1141(d)(1)(A) provides that confirmation of the plan discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before confirmation, whether creditors filed proofs of claim or not,\n   <em>\n    provided that those creditors received notice of the case and claims bar date\n   </em>\n   . A discharge of the GUC Trust's liability to millions of putative claimants is a material part of the Proposed Settlement; Rule 23 provides the means to accomplish that end, but neither section 105 nor Bankruptcy Rule 9019 does so. After confirmation, the Bankruptcy Code does not provide additional authority for discharge of debts that were not discharged by plan confirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Rule 23 certification establishes the procedural rules that must be satisfied before millions of putative claimants may be bound; neither section 105 nor Bankruptcy Rule 9019 does so. The Movants argue that Bankruptcy Rule 9019 vests this Court with broad discretion to approve settlements between adverse parties. (Movants Br. at 6.) But under Bankruptcy Rule 9019, the focus of a bankruptcy court's analysis of whether to approve a settlement is whether the proposed settlement is fair, equitable and\n   <em>\n    in the best interests of the estate\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4150823\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/478/627/#p640\">\n    478 B.R. 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640-41 (Bankr.

Before confirmation of a reorganization plan, the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules provide numerous safeguards and simplified procedures for debtors and creditors that do not and cannot apply here, nine years after this bankruptcy case was filed and seven years after the Chapter 11 Plan was confirmed. For example, section 1141(d)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that confirmation of the plan discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of confirmation, whether or not a proof of claim of such debt is filed. The application of that section depends on creditors receiving notice of the case and the bar date, however, which Claimants did not receive here. The simplified procedures for filing proofs of claim, and deeming them allowed if no objection\n   is made, make perfectly good sense when applied in the usual case, making use of Rule 23 unnecessary, but not under the circumstances here. New GM would no doubt prefer that each economic loss claimant be required to file a separate proof of claim, assuming the bar date was extended to permit them to do so, but such an approach for over 11 million potential economic loss claimants would be unwieldy and unnecessary, guaranteeing years of continued litigation. In the absence of section 1141(d)(1)(A), the Bankruptcy Code doesn't provide any other authority to bind all potential claimants who have not filed proofs of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Rule 23 supplies express authority to bind class members to any proposed settlement or compromise if the court approves the settlement after a hearing and the court finds that the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.

But under applicable law and New GM's contracts, the Court cannot settle, estimate and allow unfiled hypothetical economic loss claims. Thus, the Court must first certify a class or classes of economic loss plaintiffs, and then estimate and allow class proofs of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Second, based on a review of the case law, courts do not estimate unfiled claims where the claimants can be specifically identified, and their injuries are known and extant. Courts have estimated either filed unliquidated, disputed or contingent claims, or future unknown \"claims\" (specifically, in asbestos or other mass tort cases where damages or injury has not yet manifested) to protect those whose rights to recover for future injuries otherwise would be unprotected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither situation is present here. In this case, a group of individuals have sought leave to file late claims on behalf of over 11 million economic loss Claimants, the entire class of plaintiffs' injuries is known, and their ability to file claims for existing injuries is present. Therefore, cases in which courts estimated unfiled claims are inapplicable. The cases the Movants cite are distinguishable on several additional bases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Lastly, a claim is only deemed filed and allowed as a class claim after the Court\n   certifies the class. Without class certification, a class claim purportedly filed on behalf of the absent claimants only asserts claims on behalf the named claimants in their individual capacities. A settlement under Rule 9019 does not obviate the need for the Court to apply Rule 23 requirements to a purported class claim, regardless of whether notice is provided to potential claimants. Furthermore, as discussed in greater detail above (\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.), Rule 9019 and section 105 do not authorize the Court to approve the Proposed Settlement without Rule 23 certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Court Will Not Estimate Hypothetical Unfiled Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Proposed Settlement seeks to settle, estimate and allow the purported claims of any person \"suffering economic losses who, prior to July 10, 2009, owned or leased an Old GM vehicle subject to the Recalls\" (Settlement Motion \u00b6 1 n.4), and therefore applies to millions of individuals. But under New GM's contracts, and relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules, the Court here should only estimate \"Aggregate Allowed General Unsecured Claims,\" which New GM argues (and the Court agrees) means claims\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of being allowed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Doc. # 14360 at 25:3-11.) Here, the construct of the Proposed Settlement would have the Court estimating hypothetical unfiled claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   As noted above (\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C), a \"key objective\" of the Proposed Settlement is to seek the issuance of Adjustment Shares (Proposed Settlement \u00b6 NN), and in Section 2.5 of the Proposed Settlement, the GUC Trust agrees to seek the entry of an Estimation Order that estimates the aggregate allowed General Unsecured Claims of Plaintiffs pursuant to Section 5.1 of the GUC Trust Agreement, Section 7.2 of the Plan, Section 3.2(c) of the Sale Agreement, and the Side Letter. Since New GM's obligation to issue Adjustment Shares is defined by the Sale Agreement and New GM's other contracts, the Court must look to the relevant provisions of those agreements to determine whether it is constrained in any way from approving the Proposed Settlement. A review of these contracts shows that the Court is constrained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The plain language of New GM's contracts makes clear that in any estimation proceeding, the Court will need to consider whether the \"claims\" the Movants ask the Court to settle and estimate are capable of being allowed-and it cannot do so if claims are unfiled or if classes are not certified. The Sale Agreement provides that Old GM (now the GUC Trust Administrator) may seek an order \"estimating the\n   <em>\n    aggregate allowed general unsecured claims\n   </em>\n   \" against Old GM, and if the Court enters an order \"finding that the estimated\n   <em>\n    aggregate allowed general unsecured claims\n   </em>\n   against Seller's estates exceed $35,000,000,000,\" then New GM will issue Adjustment Shares. (Sale Agreement \u00a7 3.2(c)(i) (emphasis added).) New GM's obligation to issue Adjustment Shares is contingent on the Court's estimation of the aggregate amount of filed claims, and not unfiled hypothetical claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Sale Agreement, Plan, GUC Trust Agreement, and Side Letter consistently refer to the estimation of \"Allowed General Unsecured Claims\" when discussing the estimation of possible claims in the context of issuing Adjustment Shares. The Court should not render these provisions meaningless, thereby ignoring the intent of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Republic of Rwanda v. Ferone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Fed.%20Appx.%20600\">\n    307 Fed.Appx. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 602 (2d Cir. 2009) (\"Courts should construe a contract so as to give meaning to all of its language and avoid an interpretation that effectively\n   renders meaningless a part of the contract.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Helmsley-Spear, Inc. v.

For example, the Plan states that \"New GM Stock\" means the stock of New GM, including \"any additional shares issued if the Bankruptcy Court determines ... that the estimated or actual amount ... of Allowed General Unsecured Claims ... exceeds $35 billion.\" (Plan \u00a7 1.99.) The Plan also specifies that the \"Purpose of the GUC Trust\" is in part to determine the amount of \"Allowed General Unsecured Claims that will be eligible for distribution ... under the Plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.2(b).) The GUC Trust Agreement echoes the Plan and Sale Agreement, stating that the GUC Trust Administrator shall act to determine whether the GUC Trust is entitled to receive additional shares \"as a result of the aggregate amount of Allowed General Unsecured Claims exceeding $35 billion ....\" (GUC Trust Agreement \u00a7 2.3(d).) The Side Letter similarly focuses on allowed claims, stating that the GUC Trust Administrator will request a Claims Estimate Order if it determines that \"allowed eligible claims\" are likely to exceed $35 billion. (Side Letter at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The Movants' counterargument that the GUC Trust Agreement and Plan provide for the estimation of \"claims\" rather than \"allowed claims,\" or \"proofs of claim,\" is unconvincing. The Movants contend that Section 5.1(e) of the GUC Trust Agreement calls for the estimation of \"claims\" because it states that the GUC Trust Administrator \"may at any time request that the Bankruptcy Court estimate any contingent claim ...,\" and Section 7.3 of the Plan similarly refers to the estimation of \"claims,\" a term that is \"more expansive than 'proofs of claim.' \" (Movants Br. at 2, 25.) But, as New GM correctly argues, here, the\n   <em>\n    Plan\n   </em>\n   dictates the form of estimation contemplated under the Proposed Settlement, and refers explicitly to allowed claims: \"The Bankruptcy Court [may] estimate[ ] any contingent, unliquidated, or Disputed Claim[,]\" and \"the amount so estimated shall constitute either the Allowed amount of such Claim or a maximum limitation on such Claim as determined by the Bankruptcy Court.\" (Plan \u00a7 7.3; GUC Trust Agreement \u00a7 5.1(e).) Therefore, the only permissible form of estimation under the Plan that can trigger the issuance of Adjustment Shares, is estimation of the allowed amount of Claimants' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The Movants argue that section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code permits estimation of unfiled claims because the statute \"calls for the estimation of claims without qualification\" and unlike section 502(a) it does not contain an explicit proof of claim requirement. (Movants Br. at 2.) This argument fails for the same reason. The Movants claim that \"bankruptcy courts regularly estimate claims under Bankruptcy Code Section 502(c) to avoid delay in 'determin[ing] issues of liability or amount owed' and to 'promote a fair distribution to creditors through a realistic assessment of uncertain claims.' \" (Movants Br. at 24 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Adelphia Bus. Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2899501\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/341/415/#p422\">\n    341 B.R. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2003) ).) The Movants also emphasize that courts have broad discretion to estimate groups of claims instead of estimating claims on an individual basis. (Movants Br. at 24 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Cont'l Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123262\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/57/842/#p844\">\n    57 B.R. 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 844-45 (Bankr.

Va. 1988) ).) But, as New GM argues, regardless of the theoretical applications of estimation under section 502(c), or courts engaging in estimation in different contexts, here, the Plan dictates the form of estimation, and the Court should not circumvent this limitation. (New GM Br. at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The Movants' argument that a bankruptcy court may estimate unfiled claims likewise misses the mark because it ignores the fact that the relevant documents direct the Court to estimate \"allowed\" claims. For example, the Movants cite to\n   <em>\n    In re MSR Resort Golf Course LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 11-10372 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y), in which Judge Lane entered an order scheduling the estimation of a rejection damages claim on an expedited basis, prior to the executory contract being rejected. As discussed in greater detail below (\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.), the case is easily distinguishable. There, Judge Lane was not constrained by the parties' agreements specifying that the Court could only estimate the aggregate amount of allowed claims. Moreover, at least one case holds that if an unfiled claim cannot be allowed, it cannot be estimated for purpose of allowance.\n   <em>\n    In re Am. Solar King Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6114160\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/90/808/#p830\">\n    90 B.R. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 (Bankr.

Cases in Which Courts Estimate Unfiled Claims Without Applying Rule 23 are Distinguishable from this Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The Movants rely heavily on asbestos cases for the proposition that the Court can estimate unfiled claims. Although those cases show that section 502(c) is not expressly limited to estimation of filed claims, they are distinguishable on various grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   First, in those cases the courts estimate the claims of\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   claimants who, by definition, cannot file proofs of claim because their injuries have not yet manifested. Therefore, those courts had to estimate the likely value of future, unfiled \"claims\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   to establish sufficient reserves to allow those claimants an opportunity to be compensated in the future.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is not the situation before the Court. Those cases highlight that courts interpret section 502(c) to allow a court to estimate unfiled future \"claims\" in certain situations. But the Movants here are skipping a step and putting the cart before the horse because the claimants and their injuries have manifested and are known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Second, in those cases, unlike here, parties-in-interest generally did not contest the court's authority to estimate future claims; rather, they contested the valuation and methodology underlying such valuation. Courts estimate potential aggregate future liabilities at the pre-confirmation stage, often to establish a reserve and set up a channeling injunction directing present and future claims to a trust established pursuant to a plan of reorganization. It is undisputed that the courts can estimate the value of future injuries to establish these reserves for potential claimants. In every reported case where a court has estimated unfiled claims without certification, the court does not estimate claims for\n   <em>\n    purposes of allowance\n   </em>\n   ; rather, it estimates claims of future and unknown claimants to protect those claimants when necessary to confirm a plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Third, the Movants argue that this Court's prior authorization in this case for estimation of asbestos personal injury claims is a blueprint for the estimation the Movants seek in the Proposed Settlement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Doc. # 8121.) This argument is flawed because the Court was estimating\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   asbestos personal injury claims. There, the Debtors noted that they sought estimation \"[i]n view of the approximately 28,500 Asbestos Personal Injury Claims\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   and the delay that would be occasioned in the absence of estimation ....\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Doc. # 7782 \u00b6 15 (emphasis added).) The prior estimation in this case can be further distinguished because the Court was not estimating the allowed amounts of asbestos claims, as would be required under the Sale Agreement; rather, Old GM sought estimation \"to facilitate confirmation and consummation of a plan\" and provided that, notwithstanding such estimation, \"each such holder will be free to liquidate the ultimate allowance of his or her claim following confirmation ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) The estimation of Old GM's asbestos liabilities was \"crucial for the Plan confirmation and consummation process\" and \"is exactly what occurred in several other chapter 11 cases in order to facilitate confirmation and consummation of a plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Fourth, courts in other asbestos cases used estimation to determine plan feasibility or voting rights, not to estimate the allowed amount of claims. For instance, the court in\n   <em>\n    In re Garlock Sealing Techs.

S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2012), where the court estimated a \"claim\" before the court in a non-proof of claim setting. However, once again, this case is distinguishable, and therefore unpersuasive. There, the court entered an order scheduling the estimation of a rejection damages claim on an expedited basis, prior to the executory contract being rejected. The estimation was requested by the debtors to provide \"a clear understanding of [the debtors'] potential liability under the [executory contract]\" and enable the evaluation of competing bids for the debtors' assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <em>\n    Motion of MSR Resort Golf Course\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LLC, et al., for Entry of an Order Authorizing Rejection of the Marriott Management Agreement and Owner Agreement and Approving the Schedule for Estimating Damages Resulting from Rejection of the Marriott Management Agreement and Owner Agreement\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MSR Resort Golf Course LLC\n   </em>\n   (No. 11-10372), ECF Doc. No. 842. It is true that Judge Lane used section 502(c) to estimate an unfiled claim, but the court did so to enable the debtor to decide whether to accept or reject an executory contract. The court did not estimate the value of an unfiled claim to fix the distribution to the creditor. That distinction is key to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   While the case law cited by the Movants does not support that a bankruptcy court's estimation authority is limited to filed claims, these cases make clear that courts do not estimate unfiled claims where the claimants' injuries are known and extant, let alone to do so years after plan confirmation. Without class certification, courts estimate filed, as well as future unknown claims to protect those who otherwise would have no protection. Neither situation is before the Court. The Claimants' injuries are known, and assuming the Court grants leave to file late claims, individual or class claims can be filed for existing injuries. These cases thus do not support the Movants' contention that the Court can estimate unfiled claims for allowance purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Because the Court Can Only Estimate Filed Claims, the Proposed Class Claims Must Satisfy Rule 23 Requirements to be Settled, Estimated and Allowed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   As explained above, this Court can only estimate filed claims that are capable of being allowed. In the absence of claims filed by the millions of individuals who will be bound by the Proposed Settlement, this Court may only estimate claims of absent economic loss Claimants if the Court first certifies a class proof of claim filed on their behalf. There is no foundation in case law supporting the Movants' argument that the requirements of Rule 23 are obviated by (i) the Court's discretionary authority under Bankruptcy Code section 105(a), (ii) it's\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over the bankruptcy estate, (iii) Rule 9019, or (iv) the proposed Notice Procedures. Here, the Claimants filed proposed class claims, and therefore must meet Rule 23 requirements. When faced with motions for class certification under Rule 23 in the settlement context, courts consistently analyze whether the settlement class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p620\">\n    521 U.S. at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p620\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that specifications of Rule 23, other than whether the case would present intractable management problems if tried, demanded \"undiluted, even heightened, attention ...\");\n   <em>\n    Ephedra Prods.

The Movants cannot\n   bypass Rule 23 requirements. The importance of complying with the provisions of Rule 23 in the settlement context is emphasized in cases where parties sought to stipulate that the settlement class complied with Rule 23. In\n   <em>\n    Riedel\n   </em>\n   , the parties had stipulated that \"for purposes of settlement only ... this class meets all of the requirements for Rule 23 class certification,\" but the court held that \"even where the parties are willing 'to stipulate to the facts necessary for the certification of the class for settlement purposes, the Court bears an independent responsibility to make a determination that every Rule 23 requirement is met.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203144375\">\n    2016 WL 3144375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Farinella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4214822\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/611/250/#p260\">\n    611 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   260-61 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Movants cannot circumvent the Court's independent duty to ascertain that all the protections afforded by Rule 23 are satisfied by the Proposed Settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The Movants argue that \"[b]ecause of the comprehensive Rule 9019 notice in accordance with due process, Rule 23 is not necessary.\" (Movants Br. at 20.) But case law makes clear that the settlement under Rule 9019 does not obviate the court's independent duty to establish that the class certification requirements imposed by Rule 23 are met. The Movants' argument fails because Bankruptcy Rule 9019 does not provide a \"work-around\" of Rule 23, as bankruptcy courts \"routinely make clear that application of Rule 9019 does not immunize a settlement of a class proof of claim from scrutiny under Rule 23.\" (New GM Br. \u00b6 39.) In fact, bankruptcy courts asked to approve the settlement of a class claim under Rule 9019 analyze whether the settlement is appropriate both under Bankruptcy Rule 9019 and Rule 23. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Pinsker v. Borders, Inc. (In re BGI, Inc.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676310\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/465/365/#p372\">\n    465 B.R. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 (Bankr.

Like the\n   <em>\n    BGI\n   </em>\n   case, the fact that the Movants seek to approve the Proposed Settlement under Bankruptcy Rule 9019 and contend that the Notice Procedures comply with the notice requirements of Rule 9019, does not relieve the Court from its duty to also establish that the certification requirements imposed by both Rule 23 are met before approving the broad releases included in the Proposed Settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, compliance with Rule 23 is especially important here given the Proposed Settlement's inclusion of the Claimants' broad consent to the Court's estimation of their claims and waiver of any jury trial rights with respect to the estimation, allowance, or payment of their claims. The Proposed Settlement makes a lot of sense, ending years of uncertainty and litigation and providing Claimants with the possibility of recovery, but approval of the Proposed Settlement first requires Rule 23 class certification for settlement purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The Movants also contend that New GM does not cite any authority requiring Rule 23 certification for approving a settlement that would bind millions of absent individuals, and that certification of a class under Rule 23 is \"only one avenue for binding absent individuals to a court order, not the exclusive method.\" (Movants Br. at 21.) The Movants seek to bypass the requirements of Rule 23 in favor of the proposed Notice Procedures, which purportedly provide adequate due process to the millions of economic loss Claimants by offering them an opportunity to object to the approval of the Proposed Settlement. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Proposed Settlement \u00b6 2.11(b).) Yet, while it does not appear that any reported cases have held that a court may not approve a settlement agreement that seeks to bind millions of claimants that did not file a proof of claim outside the framework of Rule 23, cases that deal with such an issue like the one before the Court complied with the Rule 23 procedures. The Movants have not cited any precedent approving an avenue other than Rule 23 for binding millions of absent individuals, absent a settlement included in a reorganization plan that is subject to the usual plan confirmation requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Although the Movants may be right that the proposed Notice Procedures provide notice to individual claimants that satisfy due process requirements-a determination that the Court need not make at this\n   time-the protections provided by Rule 23 constitute safeguards intended to protect the interests of absent claimants. For instance, under Rule 23(a), plaintiffs must demonstrate that \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(4). Because class members are bound by any judgment in a Rule 23 class action, \"[t]his requirement protects the due-process interests of unnamed class members ....\"\n   <em>\n    Lane v.
