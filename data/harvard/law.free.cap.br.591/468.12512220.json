The parties filed legal briefs and the Court is now prepared to rule, and hereby finds and concludes as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts are not disputed. Debtors filed their Chapter 13 case on October 3, 2017. Debtors are \"above median\" income debtors with a combined monthly income of $8,886.47 and monthly expenses of $6,225.53\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , for monthly net income of $2,660.94.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Schedules I and J filed February 23, 2018 (Docket # 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Debtors filed their Second Amended Chapter 13 plan on February 15, 2018 (Docket # 32) (hereafter, the \"Plan\"), proposing to pay 100% of all timely filed unsecured, general non-priority claims (Class IV) over 60 months. In the Plan,\n   Debtors propose to make the following payments: $1,094.00 for month 1; $1,222.00 per month for months 2 through 4; $1,028.00 per month for months 5 through 59; and $1,034.00 for month 60. The Plan provides \"Debtors will amend or modify their plan to pay all Class IV claims in full.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan, Part 12, p. 6 (Docket # 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Trustee objects to the Plan because Debtors could pay all amounts due under the Plan in far fewer than 60 months but are electing not to do so, effectively preventing creditors from recouping funds they would receive sooner if the Plan payments were increased. Trustee argues Debtors' full disposable income should be committed to plan payments now (while those funds are available) to mitigate risk of loss to the creditors, since there is no certainty their disposable income will remain sufficient to repay 100% of general unsecured creditors for the duration of the proposed 60-month term. Accordingly, Trustee contends the Plan violates Section 1325(a)(3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the purpose and spirit of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Trustee argues in the alternative that if the Court does not order higher plan payments and thus decrease the duration of the Plan, the Court should impose modifications in order to mitigate the risk of loss to the creditors, such as adding provisions to the Plan requiring concurrent payments to general unsecured creditors, or limiting Debtors' ability to obtain a Chapter 13 discharge if they fail to pay 100% of the unsecured claims as proposed, or prohibiting Debtors from seeking to modify the Plan at a later date to reduce the dividend to unsecured creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Debtors maintain the Plan fully complies with the letter and spirit of the Bankruptcy Code by proposing a 100% plan over the applicable commitment period pursuant to Section 1325. Debtors contend Trustee seeks to deprive them of their rights under the Bankruptcy Code and Trustee's proposed modifications to the Plan deprive them of due process while giving creditors rights that do not exist under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties agree confirmation of the Plan hinges upon a legal issue: whether above-medium debtors can be forced to pay a 100% plan in fewer than 60 months simply because they have the ability to do so. If the Court accepts Debtors' position, the Court must then consider whether Trustee's proposed modifications to the Plan should be required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code \"enable[s] certain debtors to repay all or a percentage of their debts according to a court-approved plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Flygare v.

Accordingly, in the Tenth Circuit, the good faith inquiry now has a narrower focus: \"[a] bankruptcy court must consider 'factors such as whether the debtor has stated his debts and expenses accurately; whether he has made any fraudulent misrepresentation to mislead the bankruptcy court; or whether he has unfairly manipulated the Bankruptcy Code.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6543922,1754098\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/827/1222/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Cranmer\n   </em>\n   is instructive.
