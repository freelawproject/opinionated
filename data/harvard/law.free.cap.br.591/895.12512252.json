Kimball, Judge, United States Bankruptcy Court\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Robert C. Furr, as trustee (the \"Trustee\" or \"Plaintiff\") in the substantively consolidated chapter 7 cases of Rollaguard Security, LLC (\"Rollaguard\"), Shamrock Jewelers, Inc. (\"Shamrock Jewelers\"), and Shamrock Jewelers Loan &amp; Guarantee, LLC, commenced these three adversary proceedings by complaints filed on December 29, 2016. The Trustee brought substantially identical claims against TD Bank, N.A. (\"TD Bank\") (Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK), PNC Bank, N.A. (\"PNC Bank\") (Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. d/b/a Chase Bank (\"JPMC Bank\") (Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK) (collectively, the \"Defendants\"). The Defendants moved to dismiss and, after full briefing, the Court granted those motions and entered judgments in favor of the Defendants. Thereafter,\n   the Trustee sought reconsideration of the dismissal order and, in the alternative, permission to file amended complaints. The Court denied the Trustee's request for reconsideration of the Court's legal rulings made in granting the motions to dismiss. The Court also ruled, consistent with prevailing law in this circuit, that because judgments had been entered in favor of the Defendants the Trustee must first obtain relief from the judgments under the applicable rules of civil procedure and only then would the Court consider the Trustee's request to amend the complaints. After a hearing to consider the Trustee's request to amend the complaints, the Court denied that request. The Trustee appealed the Court's orders dismissing the adversary proceedings, the judgments, and the orders denying the Trustee's motion to reconsider and for permission to file amended complaints. On appeal, the District Court ruled that the more lenient standard of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7015 applied even though this Court had entered judgments in favor of the Defendants, and remanded the cases to this Court to consider the Trustee's request to file amended complaints under that standard. As discussed more fully below, after a careful review of the Trustee's proposed amended complaints, the Court rules that the proposed amendments would be futile and thus denies the Trustee's request to file amended complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ORIGINAL COMPLAINTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Each of the original complaints in these adversary proceedings alleged substantially the same facts and presented the same five requests for relief. In counts I and II of the original complaints, the Trustee sued the Defendants to avoid alleged fraudulent transfers made by Rollaguard and Shamrock Jewelers (together, the \"Debtors\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the Defendants under the actual and constructive fraud provisions of sections\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   548(a)(1)(A)-(B) and under the actual and constructive fraud provisions of section 544 incorporating Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 726.105(1)(a)-(b), and to recover the alleged fraudulent transfers from the Defendants pursuant to section 550. In counts III, IV, and V of the original complaints, the Trustee sought money damages for the Defendants' alleged aiding and abetting of conversions and for their alleged negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTIONS TO DISMISS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to the original complaints, each of the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss [ECF No. 26, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF No. 26, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF No. 21, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK]. In the motions to dismiss, the Defendants raised substantially similar arguments in opposition to the original complaints and adopted each other's arguments. The Court permitted the parties to brief the motions to dismiss in full [ECF Nos. 38 and 39, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF Nos. 42 and 43, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF Nos. 30 and 31, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 27, 2017, the Court entered a consolidated order dismissing with prejudice\n   all three adversary proceedings [ECF No. 43, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF No. 50, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF No. 33, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK] (the \"Dismissal Order\"). The Court dismissed counts I and II on several grounds. First, the Court ruled that the original complaints did not describe any \"transfers\" that could be avoided as fraudulent transfers under either section 548 or section 544 incorporating Florida law. Second, the Court ruled that the Defendants are not \"transferees\" from whom the Trustee may recover under section 550(a)(1). Third, the Court ruled that the original complaints did not contain sufficient allegations to plausibly support the conclusion that the Debtors deposited their own funds into their own unrestricted bank accounts with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, as required by the relevant statutes, and so the Trustee's actual fraud claims in counts I and II must be dismissed. Fourth, the Court ruled that the Debtors obtained reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the bank deposits, and so the Trustee's constructive fraud claims in counts I and II must be dismissed. Fifth, the Court ruled that the Trustee's claims in counts I and II based on section 544, incorporating Florida law, must be dismissed as the Trustee failed to identify by name at least one triggering creditor for each such claim. The Court ruled that the claims relating to Shamrock Jewelers Loan &amp; Guarantee, LLC in counts IV and V must be dismissed as a result of the application of the\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   defense, as that defense was apparent on the face of the original complaints. The Court ruled that counts III and IV of the original complaints must be dismissed as the Trustee failed to allege sufficient facts to show that any of the Defendants had actual knowledge of the alleged conversion by the Debtors' principal or that any of the Defendants rendered substantial assistance to the Debtors' principal, two independent reasons for dismissal of those claims. The Court ruled that the claims in count V based in negligence must be dismissed as the Trustee failed to plead a duty of care on the part of the Defendants. Because the Trustee did not seek permission to amend the original complaints, consistent with prevailing law in this circuit the Court dismissed the original complaints with prejudice. The Court then entered judgments in favor of the Defendants [ECF No. 45, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF No. 52, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF No. 35, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND/OR TO AMEND COMPLAINTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Trustee then filed an omnibus motion seeking reconsideration of the Dismissal Order and the judgments under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), 60(b)(6), and 15(a)(2), made applicable here by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9023, 9024, and 7015, respectively, and/or permission to file an amended complaint in each adversary proceeding [ECF No. 50, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF No. 57, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF No. 40, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK]. The Trustee asked the Court to reconsider several legal issues addressed in the Dismissal Order. The Trustee argued that the bank deposits alleged in the original complaints were \"transfers\" avoidable as fraudulent transfers, that it was not proper for the Court to address the \"conduit defense\" at the motion to dismiss stage and so the Court should not have ruled that none of the Defendants are \"transferees\" subject to judgment under relevant law, and that the original complaints contained sufficient allegations to overcome the other shortcomings relied on by the Court in dismissing the original\n   complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the alternative, the Trustee sought leave to file amended complaints against each of the Defendants. The Trustee stated that he received discovery from the Defendants after the motions to dismiss were fully briefed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee alleged that the recently received documents contained new evidence, not available prior to the filing of the original complaints, which supported certain of the Trustee's original claims and new claims for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. The Trustee sought permission to file amended complaints, in the forms attached to the Trustee's omnibus motion, that the Trustee stated incorporated the new evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    RULINGS ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION/AMENDMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court entered two orders in connection with the Trustee's omnibus motion for reconsideration and/or for permission to filed amended complaints. In the first order, the Court denied the Trustee's request for the Court to reconsider its legal rulings in dismissing these adversary proceedings [ECF No. 51, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755; ECF No. 58, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756; ECF No. 41, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757]. In that first order the Court also ruled that, because the Court had entered judgments in favor of the Defendants, in order to obtain permission to file the proposed amended complaints the Trustee must first obtain relief from judgment under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9023 (incorporating Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 ) or Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9024 (incorporating Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 ), and only then would the Trustee have the benefit of the more lenient standard under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7015 (incorporating Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 ). The Court set a hearing to permit the Trustee to show the Court how it could satisfy these requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 7, 2017, the Court held a hearing on the Trustee's request for permission to amend the complaints. At the end of that hearing, after an extensive and detailed review of the alleged new evidence and the proposed amended complaints, the Court made a ruling on the record. That oral ruling was incorporated into a written order, which is the second order addressing the Trustee's motion for reconsideration and/or permission to file amended complaints [ECF No. 69, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF No. 76, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF No. 58, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK]. Among other things, the Court ruled that the Trustee had not satisfied the standards of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9023 or 9024 because, first, the Trustee had obtained the so-called new evidence before the Court granted the motions to dismiss and had\n   failed to act on it in a timely manner, second, even if that timing was ignored the Trustee had not been diligent in obtaining the so-called new evidence and, third, nothing in the so-called new evidence would cause the Court to change its rulings in the original Dismissal Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is useful to draw attention to this last point - that nothing in the discovery materials that the Trustee pointed to as the catalyst for its proposed amended complaints would cause the Court to change any of its rulings in the Dismissal Order. The proposed amended complaints include changes to nearly every page of the original complaints. While the Trustee has moved some text around, and added color to the allegations in the form of more negative sounding phrasing and semantic flourishes, there are few actually new factual allegations in the proposed amended complaints. Indeed, from the way the proposed amended complaints were revised as compared to the original complaints, it appears that the text was modified in part to make it seem that there was significant actually new material. Only through a painstaking review of the redlined proposed amended complaints, highlighter in hand, was the Court able to identify the truly new factual allegations. In the end, the few new factual allegations are simply more of the same kinds of allegations that the Court found insufficient in the Dismissal Order, coupled with conclusory statements that do not necessarily follow from the concrete factual allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Not surprisingly then, in the November 7, 2017 oral ruling the Court specifically stated with regard to the claims presented in counts I through V-\"Even if Rule 15 applied at this stage of the litigation, and it does not because the newly discovered evidence argument fails, the proposed amendments would be futile.\" [Page 202, Line 25 - Page 203, Line 3 in ECF No. 83, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF No. 91, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF No. 73, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK]. In its ruling on appeal, the District Court interpreted this sentence as applying only to the negligence claims presented in count V. It appears that the District Court's conclusion resulted from an unfortunate inclusion of the quoted sentence in a paragraph of the transcript addressing only count V. But this Court intended the quoted statement to apply to all of proposed amended counts I though V. Indeed, a review of the Court's oral ruling will reveal that the Court addressed each of counts I through V prior to that statement, indicating that the proposed amendments did not resolve the Court's concerns in the Dismissal Order. The Court went on to consider the new counts VI and VII of the proposed amended complaints, ruling that those claims suffered from the same shortcomings as the similar counts III and IV and so the amendments to include counts VI and VII would be futile. Thus, the Court has already ruled that the proposed amended complaints would be futile as to nearly all of the claims presented. The only claims not explicitly included in the Court's futility analysis at the hearing on November 7, 2017 were the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claims arising from satisfaction of overdrafts. At that time, the Court denied the Trustee's proposed amendments incorporating those claims based solely on the Trustee's failure to satisfy the requirements of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9023 or 9024.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    APPEAL AND DISTRICT COURT RULING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Trustee appealed the Court's consolidated Dismissal Order, the judgments entered in favor of the Defendants, and the two orders denying the Trustee's motion to reconsider and denying the Trustee's request for permission to file amended\n   complaints [ECF No. 71, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF No. 78, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF No. 60, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal, the District Court ruled that this Court had applied an incorrect standard in denying the Trustee's request for permission to file amended complaints [ECF No. 90, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF No. 98, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF No. 80, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK]. Specifically, the District Court ruled that the standard under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7015 (incorporating Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 ) applies to a request to amend a complaint even after judgment is entered. The District Court remanded the matter to this Court and directed this Court to consider the Trustee's request for permission to file amended complaints under the standard set out by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Foman v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/\">\n    371 U.S. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/\">\n    9 L.Ed.2d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1962).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court did not rule on the other issues raised in the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS ON REMAND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Trustee's request for permission to file amended complaints is well presented in the motions originally filed by the Trustee, in which the Trustee argues the same standard required by the District Court on remand, among other arguments [ECF No. 50, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF No. 57, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF No. 40, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK]. The Defendants recently filed notices stating that they do not intend to attempt to appeal the District Court's order remanding this matter and, while they would be willing to file additional briefs if requested by this Court, stating that they believe the record is sufficient for the Court to rule on the Trustee's request for permission to file amended complaints [ECF No. 92, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01755-EPK; ECF No. 100, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01756-EPK; and ECF No. 82, Adv. Proc. No. 16-01757-EPK]. The Court agrees and does not find it necessary to require additional briefing. The Court has carefully reviewed the Trustee's motion and the proposed amended complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Anthony T. Simpson was the Managing Member of Rollaguard and David Tabony was the Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Rollaguard. Prior to the filing of this chapter 7 case, Mr. Simpson was removed as managing member and resigned all management responsibilities with respect to Rollaguard. Rollaguard was then controlled by a group of independent investors. Mr. Tabony caused Rollaguard to file the chapter 7 petition commencing this case on December 30, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Simpson was also the President of Shamrock Jewelers and his spouse, Debra Simpson, was the Vice President of Shamrock Jewelers. Mr. Simpson was the sole member of Shamrock Jewelers Loan &amp; Guarantee, LLC. Shamrock Jewelers and Shamrock Jewelers Loan &amp; Guarantee, LLC are sometimes referred to together as the \"Shamrock Entities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rollaguard represented itself as a manufacturer of traceable security cases used to transport valuable items, such as jewelry and sensitive documents. Rollaguard, under the control of Mr. Simpson, sought\n   investors and raised substantial capital in order to finance the manufacture, marketing, and sale of security cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, at the time Rollaguard filed its chapter 7 petition, Rollaguard was not engaged in a viable business venture. Indeed, it appears Rollaguard never manufactured a single security case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Shamrock Jewelers operated a jewelry store in Florida from approximately 1965 to 2015. Shamrock Jewelers also claimed to operate a pawn brokerage business. Mr. Simpson created Shamrock Jewelers Loan &amp; Guarantee, LLC to help facilitate the pawn brokerage business. The pawn brokerage business contemplated a series of pawn-loan transactions where the Shamrock Entities would provide short-term loans to customers in exchange for jewelry. The Shamrock Entities, under the control of Mr. Simpson, raised capital from investors in order to finance the purported pawn brokerage business. However, the Shamrock Entities did not in fact engage in any pawn brokerage. In addition, capital investments raised by Mr. Simpson on behalf of Rollaguard were routinely used by the Shamrock Entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Simpson manipulated Rollaguard and the Shamrock Entities to defraud investors and obtain funds for himself. Prior to filing these adversary proceedings against the Defendants, the Trustee obtained, among other relief, a final default judgment of $2,208,407.60 against Mr. Simpson and his spouse for pre-petition transfers from Rollaguard. ECF No. 70, Adv. Proc. No. 15-01311-EPK. It appears that Mr. Tabony and Ms. Simpson were each without knowledge of any wrongdoing by Mr. Simpson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Debtors maintained four bank accounts at TD Bank from December 2010 through November 2013, three bank accounts at PNC Bank from December 2010 through December 2014, and three bank accounts at JPMC Bank from July 2014 through March 2015. During the four-year period before the commencement of this chapter 7 case, the Debtors deposited monies into and withdrew monies from the various bank accounts maintained at TD Bank, PNC Bank, and JPMC Bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sometimes the Debtors' withdrawals resulted in those accounts becoming overdrawn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors also freely transferred monies between the various accounts maintained at TD Bank, PNC Bank, and JPMC Bank, but always within the respective banking institution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Each of the subject bank accounts was a typical demand deposit account. There is nothing in the original complaints or the proposed amended complaints that would lead the Court to conclude that the Debtors ever gave up complete autonomy over the various accounts. Indeed, the Trustee makes it clear that the Debtors in fact exercised unfettered discretion with the various accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring funds, and making payments from the accounts, whenever, in whatever amounts, and however they liked. When this bankruptcy case was filed the Debtors' accounts at the Defendants either had a very small balance or were slightly overdrawn. On the date each Debtor became subject to this case, the Debtors had, in effect, no funds on deposit at TD Bank, PNC Bank, or JPMC Bank. The Debtors had abandoned their banking relationships with TD Bank more than a year prior to the filing of this case and with PNC Bank at the time of the filing of the petition. Shamrock Jewelers' use of accounts at JPMC Bank continued through March 2015, about six months prior to its substantive consolidation with Rollaguard in September 2015. ECF No. 126, Case No. 14-38071-EPK. In other words, the Debtors had used the various accounts for several years and then left them empty, in each case before the relevant Debtor became part of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Counts I and II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As in the original complaints, in counts I and II of the proposed amended complaints the Trustee argues that the Debtors' regular deposits to the various bank accounts maintained at TD Bank, PNC Bank, and JPMC Bank constitute actual fraudulent transfers avoidable under section 548 or under section 544 incorporating Florida law. In other words, the Trustee argues that each time one of the Debtors deposited funds into its own unrestricted accounts at TD Bank, PNC Bank, or JPMC Bank, that deposit constituted a fraudulent transfer to the relevant Defendant that the Trustee may avoid under applicable law. The Trustee seeks a judgment avoiding each such transfer and a money judgment against each of the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In counts I and II of the proposed amended complaints, the Trustee describes a new category of claims arising from the Debtors' repayment or satisfaction of overdrafts in their accounts with the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee alleges that the Debtors from time to time overdrew their accounts at the Defendants. The Trustee refers to these overdrafts as \"Overdraft Loans.\" The Trustee alleges that the overdrafts were repaid by future deposits or by dishonored transactions and that each of these constitutes an avoidable fraudulent transfer. To some extent, as discussed below, the fraudulent transfer claims relating to satisfaction of overdrafts are legally distinct from the fraudulent transfer claims arising solely from a Debtor's deposit into its own unrestricted bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To prove his fraudulent transfer claims, the Trustee must show that there\n   was a fraudulent transfer under section 548 or under section 544 incorporating Florida Statutes \u00a7 726.105(1)(a).

Section 550(b) provides an important distinction between initial and subsequent transferees. Only a subsequent transferee may take advantage of the value and good faith defense provided in that section. Nearly all of the reported decisions involving fraudulent transfers of money involve payments made by check, wire transfer, or other electronic transfer from a debtor's bank account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Obviously, in each such case the debtor's bank account balance resulted from deposits of various kinds. In some cases, the deposit into a debtor's account is followed almost immediately by the debtor transferring funds to another. If the Trustee's view here was correct, then in nearly every case where a debtor made a fraudulent transfer by check drawn on or wire transfer from a bank, the bank would have had to previously receive the funds in question, making the bank the initial transferee, and the recipient of the check or wire transfer would be a subsequent transferee, with the potential benefit of the good faith and for value defense. Yet all of the case law points to the payee of the check or wire transfer as the initial transferee under section 550(a)(1). Indeed, the Court was unable to find a decision in this circuit where the payee on a check or wire transfer was not treated as the initial transferee of the funds. This is because in this context the case law is uniform in the assumption that funds held by a debtor in a demand deposit account are the debtor's funds, a direct asset of the debtor for purposes of fraudulent transfer analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The legislative history of section 101(54), which defines \"transfer,\" states that the term includes \"[a] deposit in a bank account or similar account.\" S. Rep. No. 95-989, at 27 (1987) (the \"Senate Report\"). Taken out of context, this statement seems to support the conclusion that every deposit into every bank account is a \"transfer.\" But the Senate Report \"did not ... distinguish between different types of deposits; it merely articulated the general principle that 'transfer' is meant to encompass an array of transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Whitley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277329,12272693\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/205/\">\n    848 F.3d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Senate Report merely provides support for the breadth of the concept of transfer, to include deposits into bank accounts when that act is otherwise within the scope of the term, meaning when it involves disposing of or parting with an interest in property. When a debtor deposits funds into the account of another, or into an account where the debtor's interests are legally transcribed, for example, such a deposit may be a transfer.

One might argue that the deposits in this case were made by Mr. Simpson to allow him to perpetuate his fraudulent scheme and so were not \"regular.\" Yet it is apparent from these decisions that the term \"regular\" refers to typical banking transactions between a bank and its customer and not to the business of the customer itself.

In this case, the Trustee had ample reason to challenge the Defendants' good faith. As discussed below, the Trustee claims that the Defendants aided and abetted Mr. Simpson's wrongful acts. The Trustee had the incentive to paint as bleak a picture as possible of the Defendants' knowledge and actions. Before the Trustee filed his motion seeking permission to file amended complaints, the Trustee had the benefit of this Court's Dismissal Order which stated these same things. And so, with new text in the proposed amended complaints, the Trustee explicitly attempts to negate the Defendant's good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   While the Trustee included some additional relevant language in the proposed amended complaints compared to the Trustee's original complaints, the Trustee's overall presentation on this issue remains the same. The Trustee alleges that there were circumstances that should\n   have lead the Defendants to investigate the Debtors and, had they done so, the Defendants would have discovered Mr. Simpson's illegal scheme. In effect, the Trustee argues that the Defendants were on inquiry notice of Mr. Simpson's fraud and thus did not receive the deposits in good faith. However, as the Eleventh Circuit has repeatedly confirmed, under Florida law the Defendants had no duty to investigate transactions involving the Debtors' own demand deposit accounts.\n   <em>\n    Perlman v.

If this Court were to rule that anything less than actual notice of Mr. Simpson's fraudulent scheme is sufficient to negate the good faith of the Defendants, this would be tantamount to requiring them to have investigated their depository clients, a burden inconsistent with applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   When the fraudulent transfer defendant is a banking institution that conducts routine banking services and the transfer in question is a deposit into the debtor's own demand deposit account, lack of good faith may only be proven by showing that the defendant had actual knowledge that the debtor was acting in an illegal manner. In the proposed amended complaints, among other similar allegations, the Trustee alleges that the Defendants knew that Rollaguard was a startup company, the Defendants knew that Rollaguard was obtaining all of its revenue from investors, the Defendants knew that Mr. Simpson controlled both Rollaguard and Shamrock Jewelers and that these were separate entities, and the Defendants allowed Mr. Simpson to transfer funds among the accounts at each Defendant at will. Elsewhere in the proposed amended complaints,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Trustee alleges that Mr. Simpson caused the Debtors to violate various banking laws and regulations and that the Defendants knew or should have known this. But even if all of the allegations in the proposed amended complaints are proven, the Court would not be convinced that any of the Defendants actually knew that Mr. Simpson was operating a fraudulent scheme through the Debtors. Mr. Simpson initiated a large number of transactions in the Debtors' accounts involving large sums of money. Mr. Simpson caused the Debtors to routinely overdraw their accounts and to have insufficient funds to cover payments. Mr. Simpson transferred funds, after they were deposited in the accounts, to a variety of entities\n   including between the Debtors and to himself, in the end leaving the accounts empty or overdrawn. Mr. Simpson caused the Debtors to structure transactions likely in an effort to avoid reporting requirements. Some of the Defendants knew that Mr. Simpson had written checks on the Debtors' accounts and asked the payees not to deposit them as the Debtors did not have sufficient funds. Some of these things may have violated applicable banking laws and regulations. Certain of the Defendants found it appropriate to monitor the Debtors' transactions. It is not surprising that the Defendants maintained documents recording the Debtors' insufficient funds transactions, overdrafts and the like, sent the Debtors numerous notices regarding these events, and even met with Mr. Simpson on occasion to question these practices without learning more. Mr. Simpson was a difficult client and caused headaches for the Defendants. Some of the Defendants may have considered terminating their banking relationship with the Debtors but did not do so. But these allegations, if proven, do not mean that any of the Defendants actually knew that Mr. Simpson was defrauding others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In each proposed amended complaint, the Trustee added a few allegations tailored to the specific Defendant that the Trustee suggests indicate actual knowledge on the part of the relevant Defendant. In paragraphs 36 and 47(g) of the proposed amended complaint against PNC Bank, the Trustee alleges that PNC Bank had actual knowledge that Mr. Simpson was defrauding investors because a bank manager learned that Mr. Simpson had \"produced fraudulent letters purporting to confirm available bank balances\" and an investor sought confirmation of the bank balances from PNC Bank. Yet there is no specific information in these paragraphs from which one could ascertain the materiality of the bank balance discrepancy. It is quite a jump in logic to go from the fact that Mr. Simpson provided bank balances to an investor that proved to be inaccurate to the conclusion that Mr. Simpson is involved in a fraud. Similarly, in paragraph 47(e) of that same proposed amended complaint, the Trustee alleges that PNC Bank had learned that Mr. Simpson had provided \"one false wire confirmation number ... in order to hinder, delay, or defraud\" a creditor. All we know from this allegation is that Mr. Simpson gave a wire confirmation number to someone that was not correct. There is nothing in that paragraph or elsewhere in the proposed amended complaint that would lead anyone to conclude that providing an incorrect wire transfer confirmation number was indicative of fraud. In paragraph 47(f) of that same proposed amended complaint, the Trustee alleges that PNC Bank knew Mr. Simpson \"was pledging funds to third parties ... that were not available on deposit\" and that a bank officer stated that he or she was \" 'very comfortable' with this arrangement.\" In support of the Trustee's request to file the proposed amended complaints, the Trustee filed all of the discovery that the Trustee argued supported the amendments to the complaints and the Court reviewed those documents in preparation for the hearing on November 7, 2017. Among the documents the Trustee obtained from PNC Bank is an internal memo dated February 6, 2014. That memo reads as follows: \"Comment: client indicated a wire was on its way for $15,000. As of 12:20, I am still waiting on a trace number to confirm the incoming wire. As the business banker, I am very comfortable with the owner and the business. I recommend paying this item.\" The text of paragraph 47(f) of the proposed amended complaint would lead one to conclude that a banker at PNC Bank had expressed he was \"very comfortable\" with an ongoing practice of\n   Mr. Simpson causing the Debtors to initiate payments for which they did not have sufficient funds. But a review of the memo behind this allegation indicates that the banker was stating his personal comfort with regard to Mr. Simpson and his business and, based on that view, recommending payment of a particular item. Contrary to the Trustee's suggestion, the actual underlying document supports the conclusion that PNC Bank did not in fact have actual knowledge that Mr. Simpson was involved in a fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraphs 33 and 46(h) of the proposed amended complaint against Chase Bank, the Trustee alleges that Chase Bank had actual knowledge that investor funds were flowing into and out of Debtor accounts and that the funds were being used for \"non-business purposes, including to fund Simpson's personal expenses.\" In paragraph 37 of the proposed amended complaint against TD Bank, the Trustee alleges that the bank permitted \"the withdrawal for improper purposes of hundreds of thousands of dollars of funds that TD Bank knew at the time belonged to Rollaguard investors. TD Bank sanctioned and enabled this conduct despite the fact that it had already determined that Simpson was using his relationship with TD Bank for fraudulent purposes.\" These are conclusory statements. There are no specific allegations to support them. It is necessary in cases such as this to support such statements with allegations to support the conclusion that the defendant had relevant knowledge of the debtor's business enterprise and then provide actual examples of how funds were used, to support the contention that they were used for purposes inconsistent with the debtor's business enterprise. The proposed amended complaints provide none of this. These new allegations do not change the Court's view that the proposed amended complaints fail to provide adequate, plausible allegations to support lack of good faith on behalf of any of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although the conduit defense is an equitable doctrine developed over decades, it is only relatively recently that the Eleventh Circuit explicitly ruled that the conduit defense involves an affirmative good faith requirement, in a case involving a stark instance of bad faith as the defendant was in fact conspiring with the debtor to defraud a particular creditor.\n   <em>\n    In re Harwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076253,3787431\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/1312/\">\n    628 F.3d at 1323-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since that decision, there has been scant case law addressing the nature of the good faith required to support the conduit defense. In light of the Eleventh Circuit's consistent rulings on the scope of duties of depository banks in this context, cited above, a depository bank should not be held to a standard less than actual knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Yet even if the Defendants here were held to an inquiry notice standard, the proposed amended complaints would not be sufficient. The Court must look behind the Trustee's bald statements that the Defendants knew Mr. Simpson was committing fraud, converting investor funds to his own ends, and breaching his fiduciary duties to the Debtors, to the underlying factual allegations from which the Trustee asks the Court to make those conclusions. There must be a nexus between those underlying factual allegations and the Debtors' fraudulent purpose such that the Defendants would reasonably be expected to connect what they know with the conclusion that the Debtors were acting in a\n   wrongful manner. But the Trustee's allegations in this case amount to a game of six degrees of separation. Mr. Simpson caused the Debtors to enter into many transactions, involving funds flowing into and out of their accounts with the Defendants. Mr. Simpson regularly caused the Debtors to overdraw their accounts and to issue payments for which there were insufficient funds. Mr. Simpson corralled funds from several accounts to make certain payments. Mr. Simpson sometimes made multiple payments in smaller amounts possibly in an effort to avoid reporting requirements. In short, Mr. Simpson was a troublesome client for the Defendants. The activity in the Debtors' accounts required the Defendants to monitor those accounts more closely and to send the Debtors numerous official notices. The Defendants met with Mr. Simpson in an attempt to stem the number of transactions that required extra involvement from the bank. The Trustee paints these facts with dramatic language, but the foregoing summary is an objective overview of the facts presented in the proposed amended complaints. From these allegations, the Trustee asks the Court to conclude that the Defendants should have known that Mr. Simpson was a fraudster who was taking money for his own benefit. Yet there is nothing in the proposed amended complaints that would even suggest that the Defendants knew anything about the actual activities of the Debtors, their agreements with parties from whom they received payment, or their relative corporate relationships. The Trustee baldly alleges only that the Defendants knew that Rollaguard received its income from investments, that the Defendants knew that the Debtors were separate corporate entities, and that the Defendants knew that the Debtors shuffled funds amongst themselves apparently to avoid reporting requirements. From this, the Trustee argues that the Defendants should have investigated further and, if they had done so, would have discovered Mr. Simpson's fraud, shut down the Debtors' accounts, and saved the Debtors' creditors from harm. Based on the actual allegations in the proposed amended complaints, this would be a huge leap. Would the Defendants have been better off if they terminated their relationships with the Debtors and sent the Debtors elsewhere? It certainly looks like that was the case as Mr. Simpson's banking practices were obviously a distraction and, in spite of the Trustee's blanket allegations otherwise, it seems unlikely the benefit the Defendants received in overdraft fees and the like was worth the time and effort. But, based on the actual allegations in the proposed amended complaints, were the Defendants under any duty to question Mr. Simpson's motives or good faith with regard to anyone other than the Defendants themselves? Even if the concept of inquiry notice applies to these Defendants, and to do so would violate established law with regard to the duties of depository banks, the answer is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Taking as proven all of the allegations in the proposed amended complaints, the Defendants acted in good faith in receiving the Debtors' deposits into their own bank accounts. The accounts in question were routine demand deposit accounts. The Debtors maintained complete autonomy over those accounts. The Defendants initiated all transactions at the request of the person with authority to direct them. In light of these facts, other than in connection with claims relating to satisfaction of overdrafts, none of the Defendants are \"transferees\" from whom the Trustee may seek judgment under section 550. Those claims presented in counts I and II of the amended complaints based on the Debtors' deposits into their own unrestricted bank\n   accounts (excluding claims relating to satisfaction of overdrafts) have no basis in law and the proposed amendments to those portions of counts I and II would be futile for this additional and separate reason. This is the same legal ruling made by the Court in the Dismissal Order and nothing in the proposed amended complaints would cause the Court to change that ruling. The Court notes that this ruling, by itself, also eliminates the vast majority of the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   To be clear, those portions of counts I and II of the amended complaints expressing claims related to satisfaction of overdrafts, as discussed in more detail below, do not present the same concerns with regard to the \"transfer\" and \"transferee\" requirements of applicable law. When a bank permits a customer to overdraw its account, the bank is making a loan to the customer. When the bank customer satisfies that overdraft by making a deposit to the account, the customer is repaying credit made available by the bank. The satisfaction of an actual bank overdraft is a potentially avoidable transfer. In that instance, the bank is a transferee under applicable law as it is receiving the repayment for the bank's own account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   But all of the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claims in counts I and II of the proposed amended complaints, including both those arising solely from the Debtors' deposits into their own unrestricted bank accounts as well as those arising from satisfaction of overdrafts, suffer from a fatal shortcoming. In order to prove these claims, the Trustee must show that the alleged transfers were made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. The proposed amended complaints do not contain sufficient allegations to plausibly support the conclusion that the Debtors deposited their own funds into their own unrestricted bank accounts or satisfied their own overdrafts with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, as required by the relevant statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud is difficult to prove, courts look to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the allegedly fraudulent transfer, and this often involves analyzing the traditional badges of fraud.\n   <em>\n    Dev.

The commonly listed badges of fraud include: (1) the transfer was to an insider; (2) the debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer; (3) the transfer was not disclosed or was concealed; (4) before the transfer was made the debtor had been sued or threatened with suit; (5) the transfer was of substantially all of the debtor's assets; (6) the debtor absconded; (7) the debtor removed or concealed assets; (8) the value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred; (9) the debtor was\n   insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made; (10) the transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred; and (11) the debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienor who transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11709698,1560943\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/154/1262/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    In re XYZ Options, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11709698,1560943\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/154/1262/\">\n    154 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1271-72 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the traditional badges of fraud are not the sole indicators of actual fraudulent intent. The traditional badges of fraud represent examples of indicators of actual fraudulent intent, culled from decades of case law. They are intended to be guideposts-as opposed to ineluctable factors-in a court's analysis of the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a transfer was made with actual fraudulent intent. That the proposed amended complaints here do not rely exclusively on the traditional badges of fraud is not fatal. Instead, the Court must look to the factual allegations in the proposed amended complaints to determine whether, if proven, they would support a finding of actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Before the Court engages in a review of the allegations in the proposed amended complaints intended to support a finding of actual intent to defraud, it is useful to consider what needs to be proven in this regard. In prosecuting a fraudulent transfer claim based on actual intent, it is typically not sufficient to show that the debtor intended to defraud someone and the debtor also made a transfer. Just because a debtor is involved in a fraudulent scheme does not mean that every transfer made by that debtor is made with fraudulent intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to prosecute a claim based on actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor, the plaintiff must show that the alleged fraudulent intent is related to the transfers sought to be avoided.\n   <em>\n    Bakst v.

The proposed amended complaints must include allegations of fact which, if proven, show that the Debtors had fraudulent intent in taking those specific actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Trustee alleges that Mr. Simpson regularly caused Rollaguard to transfer money to the Shamrock Entities, thereby placing such funds out of the reach of Rollaguard's creditors and using such funds for Mr. Simpson's personal benefit. But these and similar allegations focus on what happened to the funds after they were in Rollaguard's accounts, not on Rollaguard's deposits into those accounts or Rollaguard's satisfaction of overdrafts in those accounts, the alleged transfers at issue here. That Rollaguard, acting through Mr. Simpson, had fraudulent intent in transferring funds out of its bank accounts maintained at the Defendants is not probative on the issue of whether Rollaguard had fraudulent intent when it deposited funds into its own bank accounts or satisfied overdrafts in those accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Trustee alleges that the Debtors removed property from the reach of their creditors by depositing monies in their own bank accounts and by satisfying their own overdrafts. Let us focus on the actual transfers alleged in this case. The transfers at issue in the proposed amended complaints do not involve any Debtor depositing its funds into an account owned by another Debtor or satisfying the overdrafts of another Debtor. The \"transfers\" in question are each Debtor's deposits into its own bank accounts and each Debtor's satisfaction of its own overdrafts. These activities, by themselves, did not remove funds from the reach of any Debtor's creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors transferred and otherwise used the funds after they had been deposited, but those later transfers are not at issue in the fraudulent transfer claims here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Trustee alleges that Mr. Simpson was causing the Debtors to engage in various fraudulent or deceptive schemes at the time of the deposits and satisfaction of overdrafts that the Trustee is attempting to avoid in these cases. The Trustee states that it was necessary for Mr. Simpson and the Debtors to have bank accounts in order to effectuate Mr. Simpson's fraudulent scheme, and so the Trustee alleges that each time the Debtors deposited funds into their own bank accounts or satisfied their own overdrafts those acts were imbued with the bad intent of Mr. Simpson and the Debtors. But this argument goes too far. Nearly every fraudulent scheme, from complex Ponzi schemes to the most straightforward bait and switch, involves the use of a bank account, a brokerage account, or some other financial accommodation. To suggest that a fraudster's mere use of a bank or financial institution as an intermediary to accomplish the fraud means that each transaction with the intermediary is also tainted with fraudulent intent is to make the bank or other financial intermediary a target for the debtor's creditors, even where the bank or other\n   financial intermediary has no knowledge of the fraud. The more well-reasoned case law does not support this leap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perkins v. Lehman Bros. (In re Int'l Mgmt. Assoc.'s, LLC)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185293\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/563/393/#p414\">\n    563 B.R. 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414-19 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2017). That the Debtors, through Mr. Simpson, were obtaining investments they never intended to repay, and moving funds among themselves and for the benefit of Mr. Simpson, does not mean that when they put their own funds in their own bank accounts, or satisfied their own overdrafts, that those actions were taken with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. In other words, there is no connection between the alleged transfers at issue here and the Debtors' collective intent, acting through Mr. Simpson, to fraudulently obtain investments they did not intend to return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Trustee alleges that the Debtors were not paying their debts as they became due. This allegation is sometimes helpful to support the conclusion that a failing debtor made a transfer with the intent to place the asset out of view of the debtor's creditor body generally. In this case, the allegation lends nothing to the question of whether the Debtors' deposits into their own unrestricted bank accounts or satisfaction of their own overdrafts were done with fraudulent intent. As discussed above, those acts had no material impact on the Debtors' ability to pay creditors and are not in themselves stained with bad intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The proposed amended complaints do not contain sufficient allegations that, if proven, would plausibly support the conclusion that the Debtors deposited their own funds into their own unrestricted bank accounts or satisfied their own overdrafts with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, as required by the relevant statutes. None of the Trustee's claims set out in counts I and II of the proposed amended complaints state claims under applicable law and thus the proposed amendments would be futile. With regard to most of the Trustee's actual fraud claims, excluding only those relating to satisfaction of overdrafts, this is the same ruling the Court made in its original Dismissal Order. Here, the Court extends that ruling to those portions of counts I and II relating to satisfaction of overdrafts. Nothing in the proposed amended complaints would cause the Court to change that ruling. The Court notes that this ruling eliminates all the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In summary, the proposed amendments to counts I and II would be futile for the following reasons. With regard to those claims based on the Debtors' deposits into their own unrestricted bank accounts and which deposits are not alleged to constitute satisfaction of overdrafts in the relevant account (a) the deposits are not transfers subject to avoidance under applicable law, and (b) the Defendants are not transferees of such deposits from whom the Trustee may recover under applicable law. Each of these reasons is by itself sufficient to deny amendment with regard to such claims. With regard to all claims presented in counts I and II, including those arising from the satisfaction of overdrafts as well as those arising solely from the Debtors' deposits into their own unrestricted bank accounts, the proposed amended complaints lack specific allegations to support the Trustee's claims that the alleged transfers were made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. This is a separate reason to deny amendment to counts I and II with regard to claims arising from deposits, and is also a reason to deny amendment to counts I and II with regard to claims arising from satisfaction of overdrafts. None of the claims stated in counts I and II of the proposed amended complaints meet the standard for amendment\n   under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7015 as set out in\n   <em>\n    Foman v. Davis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    Counts III, IV, VI and VII\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As in the original complaints, in counts III and IV of the proposed amended complaints the Trustee argues that the Defendants had actual and/or constructive knowledge of Mr. Simpson's suspicious activity, that they rendered substantial assistance to Mr. Simpson by violating federal banking regulations and banking norms, and that the Defendants are therefore liable for aiding and abetting Mr. Simpson's conversions of investor funds. The Trustee seeks a money judgment against each of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Counts VI and VII in the proposed amended complaints are new. In counts VI and VII, the Trustee argues that the Defendants had actual and/or constructive knowledge of Mr. Simpson's breach of his fiduciary duties to the Debtors, that they rendered substantial assistance to Mr. Simpson by allowing the Debtors' bank accounts to remain open and by permitting Mr. Simpson to cause the Debtors to make allegedly atypical transactions in those accounts and otherwise by providing Mr. Simpson an \"unregulated platform\" to effectuate his schemes, and that the Defendants are therefore liable for aiding and abetting Mr. Simpson's breach of fiduciary duties to the Debtors. The Trustee seeks a money judgment against each of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In support of the claims in counts III, IV, VI and VII, the Trustee maintains that the Defendants disregarded federal banking regulations thereby allowing Mr. Simpson to use the Debtors' bank accounts to take funds for himself at the expense of the Debtors' creditors. For example, the Trustee alleges that, during the respective banking relationships, the Defendants failed to respond properly when Mr. Simpson purchased cashier checks where the \"remitter\" was a different person or entity from the owner of the bank account. The Trustee alleges that some of the Defendants failed to respond properly to Mr. Simpson's purchasing of cashier checks using monies from multiple bank accounts, or withdrawing monies from one bank account and consecutively depositing those monies in another account, in order to purchase cashier checks. The Trustee maintains that, under these circumstances, the Defendants improvidently sold cashier checks to Mr. Simpson at the expense of the Debtors' creditors, because the Defendants should have known that the recipients would be misled as to the source of the payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this vein, the Trustee also points to the fact that the Defendants permitted Mr. Simpson to overdraw the Debtors' bank accounts repeatedly during the four-year period prior to the commencement of this chapter 7 case. In addition to these common allegations, the Trustee makes a handful of allegations specific to the separate Defendants, which the Court has addressed above in connection with the analysis of the conduit defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Trustee argues that these facts, accompanied by the magnitude and number of the deposits and withdrawals, put the Defendants on actual and/or constructive notice (a) that Mr. Simpson was converting monies from the Debtors' bank accounts for an improper purpose or for his own personal use and (b) that Mr. Simpson was breaching his fiduciary duties to the Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Under Florida law, to state a claim for aiding and abetting, a plaintiff must allege: \"(1) an underlying violation on the part of the primary wrongdoer; (2) knowledge of the underlying violation by the alleged aider and abetter; and (3) the rendering of substantial assistance in committing the wrongdoing by the alleged aider and abettor.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4212726\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/455/904/#p907\">\n    455 F.

There is nothing in the proposed amended complaint that would lead the Court to believe that any of the Defendants affirmatively assisted or concealed Mr. Simpson's wrongful acts. The Trustee's claims are based on alleged failures to act by the Defendants. In this case, the Trustee is the stand-in for the Debtors, so the Trustee must show that the Defendants had a duty to the Debtors that they failed to satisfy. The Trustee has not plead sufficient facts to show that any of the Defendants owed any duty to the Debtors, fiduciary or otherwise, other than the duty to complete banking transactions as directed by the Debtors' authorized agent, which duty they faithfully complied with. As discussed below in connection with count V, the Defendants' duties arising under the banking regulations and customary banking practices pointed to by the Trustee are not duties for the benefit of the Debtors. Nor do the Trustee's allegations support the conclusion that any of the Defendants breached any duty whatsoever relevant to this case. \"Red flags\" and mere suspicions are insufficient to trigger any obligation by the Defendants to investigate.\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4212726\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/455/904/#p907\">\n    455 F.

Such \"red flags\" or suspicions are not sufficient to elevate the Defendants' alleged inactions into the realm of \"substantial assistance.\" Since the proposed amended complaints do not plead sufficient facts to plausibly support the inference that any of the Defendants rendered substantial assistance to Mr. Simpson's conversions or breach of fiduciary duties, the proposed amendments to counts III, IV, VI and VII would be futile. This is substantially the same ruling the Court made in the Dismissal Order with regard to the claims presented in counts III and IV of the original complaints and nothing in the proposed amended complaints would cause the Court to change its ruling. While the Trustee has added some additional language in the proposed amended complaints, the allegations are simply more of the types that the Court found wanting in the Dismissal Order. To the extent there are new, specific allegations aimed at individual Defendants, these are conclusory in nature and are not supported by concrete allegations, as discussed more fully in the Court's analysis of the conduit defense. The Trustee relies on\n   all of these same allegations to support the substantial assistance element of its claims in new counts VI and VII and so the same analysis applies to those new claims. This ruling alone is sufficient to deny amendment to counts III, IV, VI and VII. None of the claims stated in counts III, IV, VI and VII of the proposed amended complaints meet the standard for amendment under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7015 as set out in\n   <em>\n    Foman v.

However, the transfer must be specifically in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme and not some unrelated transaction.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202182881\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The facts of the present case do not present a Ponzi scheme or even a Ponzi-like scheme involving rotating investment and investor repayment. Mr. Simpson is alleged to have committed a straightforward fraud in bilking investors, taking their funds and not paying anyone back.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    One might argue that the satisfaction of an overdraft could result in reduction of funds available to pay other creditors. Yet in this case, in the end, the accounts in question were left empty or slightly overdrawn. The net effect of all of the overdrafts was for the benefit of the Debtors, as they enjoyed repeated short term credit from the Defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    In light of the substantive consolidation of the Debtors and Shamrock Jewelers, done at the Trustee's request, it is hard to see how creditors were harmed by not knowing the ultimate source of payments they received. In order to obtain substantive consolidation, among other things, the Trustee argued convincingly that the financial affairs of the Debtors and Shamrock Jewelers were hopelessly intertwined. The Court notes that in substantively consolidating the Debtors and Shamrock Jewelers in this case, the Court did not preserve inter-company claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 126, Case No. 14-38071-EPK. Thus, for all purposes in this bankruptcy case, the assets and liabilities of the Debtors and Shamrock Jewelers are combined as if they were a single entity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    As addressed in footnote 14,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12614368,12614370,12614357,12614364,12614366,12614367\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/199/207/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , it is unclear whether these individualized allegations were intended by the Trustee to support the aiding and abetting claims as most of them were presented in the factual allegations explicitly relating to the conduit defense. Again, for purposes of this order, the Court assumes that all of the allegations in the introductory paragraphs of the proposed amended complaints are intended to support each count of the proposed amended complaints.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
