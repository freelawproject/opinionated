(\"Agrokor\") and eight debtor affiliates filed these Chapter 15 cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They are a small part of a larger group of 77 companies headquartered in the Republic of Croatia that are the subject of an extraordinary administration proceeding in a Croatian court under a new Croatian law applicable to systemically important business entities or groups. The foreign representative appointed by the Croatian court (the \"Foreign Representative\" or \"Extraordinary Administrator\") asks this Court to recognize the Croatian proceeding as a foreign main proceeding, to recognize him as the foreign representative and to recognize and enforce the restructuring plan reached in the Croatian proceeding (the \"Settlement Agreement\") within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The proceeding in Croatia (the \"Croatian Proceeding\") was filed under Croatia's \"Act on the Extraordinary Administration Proceedings in Companies of Systemic Importance of the Republic of Croatia\" (the \"EA Law\"). The statute's purpose is the \"protection of sustainability of operations of the companies of systemic importance for the Republic of Croatia which with its operations individually or together with its controlled or affiliated companies affect the entire economic, social, and financial stability of the Republic of Croatia.\" The\n   law was adopted on April 7, 2017, shortly before Agrokor and its debtor affiliates commenced the proceeding in the Croatian court. The new law will be available to all companies that are determined to be systemically important to the Republic of Croatia; it is not a specialized law only applicable to Agrokor. That said, Agrokor and its debtor affiliates' (the \"Agrokor Group\") financial distress and the resulting threat of systemic impact upon the Croatian economy was, no doubt, the impetus for the creation of the new law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   One of the more controversial aspects of the EA Law is that its provisions for reorganization and adjustment of debts apply to enterprise groups of companies that have a principal place of business in Croatia and exist under Croatian law, though they may operate both in and outside of Croatia. In this case, while 77 companies of the group are based in Croatia, they are part of a larger group of approximately 155 companies that operate outside of Croatia as well. How to deal with the cross-border insolvency of enterprise groups raises some of the most important issues in evolving cross-border insolvency law and practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Agrokor Group was, and remains, the largest private company by revenue in Croatia. It was insolvent and qualified by amount of debt and number of employees for eligibility to file under the EA Law. Once a company qualifies for an extraordinary administration proceeding, the Croatian statute includes provisions for the negotiation, acceptance by creditors and approval by the Croatian court of a settlement agreement-essentially a plan of reorganization that adjusts the debt and ownership interests of distressed companies. In accordance with the law's provisions, the Settlement Agreement was successfully negotiated, approved by the requisite vote of creditors and then approved by the Commercial Court of Zagreb in Croatia. Final approval of the Settlement Agreement is pending in the High Commercial Court, where 92 appeals were lodged against the ruling confirming the Settlement Agreement. According to counsel to the Foreign Representative's\n   <em>\n    Brief in Further Support\n   </em>\n   , the decisions of the High Commercial Court are not expected before the end of November 2018. (\"Brief in Further Support,\" ECF Doc. # 24 \u00b6 45.) The Foreign Representative asks that, in addition to recognizing him as the \"foreign representative\" within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code and recognizing the Croatian Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code, this Court should also recognize and enforce the Settlement Agreement within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The requests to recognize the Foreign Representative as the \"foreign representative,\" and the Croatian Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding, present relatively straightforward questions of the application of Chapter 15; both requests were approved by this Court in an Order entered on September 21, 2018. (ECF Doc. # 30.) That Order reserved decision on the request to recognize and enforce the Settlement Agreement, as it raised more challenging issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Recognition and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States require this Court to determine whether it may and should enforce provisions of the Settlement Agreement that modify English law governed debt. While the Croatian\n   Proceeding of Agrokor has been recognized as a foreign main proceeding in the High Court of England and Wales, that court has not so far been asked to recognize and enforce the Settlement Agreement. English case law may not permit a court outside of England and Wales (such as the Croatian court that approved the Settlement Agreement) to approve a discharge or modification of English law governed debt so that recognition and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement by that court might not be granted. For the reasons explained below, however, the Court resolves this challenging issue, recognizing and enforcing the Settlement Agreement, including the provisions modifying the English law governed debt, within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case presents challenging issues with very practical consequences. The Foreign Debtors (with their COMI in Croatia) presently have over \u20ac1,660 million of debt governed by English law (English Law Governed Loans, defined below) and over \u20ac925 million of debt governed by New York law (New York Law Governed Notes, defined below); thus, the majority (about 64%) of the debt to be restructured under the Settlement Agreement is governed by English law. Can it really be that a court in Croatia that properly has jurisdiction over the Foreign Debtors' insolvency proceeding cannot oversee and approve the Foreign Debtors' reorganization, and the resolution of all claims against the Foreign Debtors, under a national insolvency law and court procedures that satisfy widely recognized standards of fairness and due process? More directly to the point, should a U.S. Bankruptcy Court decline to extend comity to the decision of the court in Croatia to recognize and enforce within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States the Settlement Agreement that was approved by the required vote of creditors and by the court in Croatia in a proceeding that satisfied due process standards? Of course, such a decision by this Court recognizing and enforcing the Settlement Agreement would not mean that the Settlement Agreement would be recognized and enforced in other countries. So, the Foreign Debtors might well be wise either to seek recognition and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement in the courts of England and Wales, or to commence an insolvency proceeding or scheme of arrangement in England, if either of those things can be done, even if it requires costly and duplicative proceedings in England.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The difficulties here arise because the courts in England and Wales still apply the so-called \"\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   \" rule, based on an 1890 decision of the Court of Appeal in\n   <em>\n    Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons v. La Societe Industrielle et Commerciale des Metaux\n   </em>\n   (1890) 25 QBD 399 (hereinafter, \"\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   \"). While\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   is discussed further below, the essence of the decision is that where a debtor, in that case domiciled in France, made a contract governed by English law and to be performed in England, was declared a bankrupt and its debts discharged under foreign law in a foreign proceeding (there, French law in a French proceeding), the plaintiff was not bound by the discharge and could maintain an action on\n   the contract and recover damages in an English court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 406. So, then, can Agrokor's creditors holding English law governed debt (or, at least, those creditors who did not approve of the Settlement Agreement or did not submit to the jurisdiction of the court in Croatia) bring an action in the courts of England to recover damages on the old English law governed debt? And, even if the creditors can do so in the courts in England, should that prevent this Court from recognizing and enforcing the Settlement Agreement and barring any efforts by creditors to enforce the original debt obligations within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States? While not determinative of the outcome, it should not be lost on anyone that this Court, based on comity principles, has recognized and enforced an English court decision modifying New York law debt in an English scheme of arrangement proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Avanti Commc'n Grp. PLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421368\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/603/\">\n    582 B.R. 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Whether the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule as written still applies more than 120 years after the decision was rendered remains an important issue in cross-border insolvency cases, particularly because of the substantial changes that have taken place across the globe in insolvency laws and recognition and enforcement of decisions of other courts. Courts in England and Wales, and elsewhere, still grapple with the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule and the issue is currently on appeal in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. Whatever the outcome of that decision, the matter remains to be decided by this Court whether to recognize and enforce the Settlement Agreement approved by the court in Croatia within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In deciding whether to recognize and enforce the Settlement Agreement, the Court will also discuss the outcomes in recognition proceedings the Foreign Debtors filed in other jurisdictions. Those proceedings resulted in a patchwork of decisions, recognizing the Croatian Proceeding in cross-border cases in England and Switzerland and denying recognition in cross-border cases in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. As already stated, this Court has already entered an order recognizing the Croatian Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding. The Court will discuss the rationale of the courts that have either recognized or refused to recognize the Croatian Proceeding. But recognition of the Croatian Proceeding as a\n   foreign main proceeding in this Court is determined by the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and not by the decisions of the other courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Additionally, the Settlement Agreement releases and discharges written guarantees by non-debtor affiliates of both the English law and New York law debt. In appropriate circumstances in Chapter 15 cases, this Court has recognized and enforced such releases. The Court concludes here that those provisions in the Settlement Agreement should be recognized and enforced in these Chapter 15 cases with respect to the nine Foreign Debtors that filed these Chapter 15 cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based upon the analysis that follows, the Court believes that recognition and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement within the United States with respect to the nine Foreign Debtors is an appropriate exercise of comity and application of U.S. law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Agrokor Group\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Agrokor is the parent company of more than 155 direct and indirect subsidiaries, including not fully owned subsidiaries. (\"Settlement Agreement,\" ECF Doc. # 4 Exhibit C \u00a7 3.1.2.) It is a joint stock company under the laws of the Republic of Croatia and has registered share capital amounting to HRK 180.1 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.1.1.) The shares are divided into 360,246 regular registered shares (which are designated AGKR-R-A), each of which hold a nominal value of HRK 500.00 per share. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to the\n   <em>\n    Verified Petition for (I) Recognition of Foreign Main Proceedings, (II) Recognition of Foreign Representative, and (III) Related Relief Under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   </em>\n   (\"Verified Petition,\" ECF Doc. # 4), Agrokor and its subsidiaries that have at least 25% of their shares held by Agrokor are subject to the Croatian Proceeding and are referred to as the EA Group, as set forth in article 5, paragraph 2 of the EA Law, described below. There are currently 77 Agrokor Group entities that are parties in the Croatian Proceeding, although as already indicated, only nine of those companies filed the Chapter 15 petitions in these cases. (Verified Petition at 1.) Approximately 80 direct and indirect affiliates of Agrokor that are part of the Agrokor Group are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   based in Croatia and are not parties to the extraordinary administration proceeding in Croatia. Those companies predominately operate in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Business of the Agrokor Group\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Agrokor Group has been in operation since 1989 and, today, is one of the largest companies in Croatia. (\"Declaration of Foreign Representative,\" ECF Doc. # 5 \u00b6 4.) The Agrokor Group's primary businesses include Croatia's largest supermarket chain (Konzum d.d.), producer of mineral and spring water (Jamnica d.d.), and producer and distributor of ice cream and frozen foods (Ledo d.d.). In addition, the Agrokor Group contains businesses related to food, agriculture and other sectors. (Declaration of Foreign Representative \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In April 2017, at the start of the Croatian Proceeding, Agrokor employed more than 60,000 people across Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its annual revenue was approximately \u20ac6.5 billion, which represents approximately 15 percent of the gross domestic product of Croatia. Suppliers and other businesses that are dependent on the Agrokor Group's operations represent a significant further proportion of Croatia's gross domestic product. (Declaration of Foreign Representative \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Agrokor is structured as a holding company and has historically overseen M &amp; A transactions on behalf of the Agrokor Group. It also sought to provide group-wide: (1) financial reporting, (2) management of capital markets financing and (3) facilitation of operational synergies following M &amp; A transactions. Agrokor's main assets from a macroeconomic perspective are shareholdings in and loans to its operating subsidiaries. Additionally, these subsidiaries pay management fees to cover the costs of central management. (Settlement Agreement \u00a7 3.4.) In more concrete terms, Agrokor owns the following key assets, allowing it to perform the above operations, collectively forming the Agrokor Group: (1) shares in its subsidiaries and minority shareholdings in certain other entities; (2) loans, deposits and other receivables due to the debtor; and (3) certain directly owned real estate (including buildings, tools, plants and machinery). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Capital Structure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In late 2016, Agrokor undertook a substantial refinancing of its existing unsecured debt. (Declaration of Foreign Representative \u00b6 6.) Lenders were granted springing maturity clauses in new and amended facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The terms of these new and amended facilities were structured such that each facility would mature early if Agrokor failed to refinance a PIK loan issued by its non-debtor parent company, Adria Group Holding BV (the \"PIK Loan\") by March 8, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The PIK Loan was, in turn, secured by a pledge granted by Adria Group Holding BV of all shares it held in Agrokor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As part of this refinancing, Agrokor also sought a syndicated facility (the \"F2 Club Loan\") to refinance its existing bonds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) The F2 Club Loan was entered and the syndication process began in September 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, the syndication process failed approximately half a year later, in January 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Agrokor began to experience liquidity strains because of, among other things, concerns arising from the failure of the F2 Club Loan syndication, the impact of the PIK Loan springing maturity clauses and the information provided in Agrokor's accounting records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In response to these liquidity concerns, Agrokor sought new financing and ultimately entered the \u20ac100 million loan with Sberbank (\"Sberbank Loan\") in early 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) The Sberbank Loan proved insufficient to avoid an insolvency proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, on April 7, 2017, Agrokor filed for the commencement of the Croatian Proceeding under the EA Law. The Croatian Proceeding was commenced by order of the Commercial Court of Zagreb (the \"Croatian Court\") on April 10, 2017, supplemented on April 21, 2017, July 5, 2017 and July 13, 2017 (the \"Commencement Order\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The valuation of the assets of the Agrokor Group took a substantial blow after the commencement of the Croatian Proceeding. Agrokor announced on April 27, 2017 that there were potential irregularities in its 2016 financial statements which would result in a delay of the publication of its financials. Following this announcement, in May of 2017, PricewaterhouseCoopers\n   (\"PWC\") was appointed as auditor of the Agrokor Group's Croatia-based companies. In accordance with audit requirements, PwC undertook an audit of twenty-seven of the Agrokor Group's companies in the Republic of Croatia, three companies in Serbia and three companies in Bosnia-Herzegovina. (Settlement Agreement \u00a7 3.7.) The consolidated changes in equity in the period from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 resulted in a total equity reduction of approximately \u20ac2.9 billion. Overall, this meant that liabilities exceeded total assets by HRK 14.5 billion (\u20ac1.9 billion) for that period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On December 31, 2017, liabilities exceeded total assets by HRK 23.3 billion, a reduction of approximately HRK 9 billion from the preceding year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The financial results for 2017, published by the Extraordinary Administrator on May 14, 2018, showed that liabilities exceeded assets for that period as well. This financial statement described a consolidation of 105 companies over which the Foreign Debtors exercised control, 52 of which are in the Republic of Croatia (the consolidated group as described in the 2017 Annual Report, \"Consolidated Group\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    1. U.S. Debt\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As of the opening of the EA Proceeding, the Settlement Agreement described the total amount of third-party financial liabilities of Agrokor and some of its subsidiaries at HRK 31.5 billion. One large chunk of this debt is comprised of unsecured notes governed by New York law. According to the Settlement Agreement, the Agrokor Group issued the following unsecured notes (the \"New York Law Governed Notes\" or \"Notes\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) EUR 325 million 9.125% New York law governed senior notes due to mature in 2020 and USD 300 million 8.875% New York law governed senior notes due to mature in 2020 issued by the Debtor pursuant to an indenture dated as of 10 October 2012; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (2) EUR 300 million 9.875% New York law governed senior notes due to mature in 2019 issued by the Debtor pursuant to an indenture dated as of 25 April 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Settlement Agreement \u00a7 3.5.1.1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Brief in Further Support, ECF Doc. # 24 \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    2. English Debt\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Agrokor Group has substantial additional liabilities governed by English law. The Settlement Agreement lists the following unsecured bank debt obligations (the \"English Law Governed Loans\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) EUR 600 million English law governed loan facility agreement dated 14th March 2014, as amended from time to time, between, among others, Agrokor and Sberbank of Russia and Sberbank Europe AG;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) EUR 50 million English law governed loan facility agreement dated 16th July 2015, as amended from time to time, between, among others, Agrokor and Sberbank Europe AG;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (3) EUR 350 million English law governed loan facility agreement dated 28th April 2016, as amended from time to time, between, among others, Agrokor and Sberbank of Russia;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (4) EUR 100 million English law governed term loan facility agreement dated 21st February 2017, as amended from time to time, between, among others, Agrokor and Sberbank of Russia (the \"EUR 100m Sberbank Loan\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (5) EUR 100 million English law governed loan facility agreement dated 14th September 2016, as amended from time to time, between, among others, Agrokor and a group of lenders;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (6) EUR 100 million English law governed syndicated loan facility agreement\n   dated 14th September 2016, as amended from time to time, between, among others, Agrokor and a group of lenders (the F2 Club Loan); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (7) EUR 360 million English law governed loan facility agreement dated 21st June 2014, and as amended by way of an amendment agreement dated 28th October 2016, between, among others, Agrokor and VTB Bank (Austria) AG.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (Settlement Agreement \u00a7 3.5.1.2\n   <em>\n    ; see also\n   </em>\n   Brief in Further Support \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    3. Third Party Releases\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There are two forms of third-party releases contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. The Verified Petition of the Foreign Debtors argues that this Court should enforce the Settlement Agreement and the third-party releases contemplated therein. The Verified Petition provides, in relevant part: \"The Settlement Agreement contains the Trustee Release and the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Guarantor Release. The Trustee Release Parties and the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Guarantors are not debtors in the Croatian Proceeding. As explained below, this Court may nevertheless adhere to principles of comity and enforce the Trustee Release and the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Guarantor Release.\" (Verified Petition \u00b6 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The English Law Governed Loans and New York Law Governed Notes both benefit from guarantees granted by the following entities: Agrokor Trgovina d.o.o.; Ledo d.d.; Jamnica d.d.; Konzum d.d.; PIK-Vinkovci d.d.; Zvijezda d.d.; Belje d.d.; Vupik d.d.; Ledo d.o.o. Citluk; Sarajevski kiseljak d.d.; and Konzum d.o.o. Sarajevo. (Verified Petition \u00b6 20.) Of the guarantors, the following are Foreign Debtors: Agrokor Trgovina d.o.o.; Ledo d.d.; Jamnica d.d.; Konzum d.d.; PIK- Vinkovci d.d.; Zvijezda d.d.; Belje d.d.; and Vupik d.d. The remaining entities-namely Ledo d.o.o. Citluk; Sarajevski kiseljak d.d.; and Konzum d.o.o. Sarajevo-are the \"Bosnian-Herzegovinian Guarantors,\" as described in the Verified Petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Verified Petition \u00b6 63.) These three entities are not Foreign Debtors in these Chapter 15 cases and nothing in this Opinion determines the rights of these entities or of their creditors. The Bosnian-Herzegovinian Guarantors are affiliates of Agrokor. (Annex 2 to the Settlement Agreement) (not available on ECF.) The Bosnian-Herzegovinian Guarantor Release is provided for in section 29.8 of the Settlement Agreement, which is titled \"Releases.\" (Settlement Agreement \u00a7 29.8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The final sentence of section 29.8.1 of the Settlement Agreement, which deals\n   with releases, contains a carve out. It clarifies that directors, officers and members of management or supervisory boards of any member of the Agrokor Group are not released from liability arising from their conduct. The section states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [N]othing in this Cl. 29.8.1 shall operate or be construed to release any person who was a director and/or officer (or member of the management board or supervisory board) of any member of the Agrokor Group prior to the commencement of the EA Proceedings from any liability arising from his or her conduct in such capacity prior to that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (Settlement Agreement \u00a7 29.8.1.) Two of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Guarantors-Ledo d.o.o. Citluk and Sarajevski kiseljak d.d.-are affiliates of the Foreign Debtors and listed as voting \"FOR\" the Settlement Agreement. (\"Croatian Court Order Approving the Settlement Agreement,\" ECF Doc. # 4 Exhibit B at 302-07.) Both are listed as creditors in voting class B.

Of the total number of creditors entitled to vote, 78.52% of non-insiders by claim amount voted in favor of the plan-this is comfortably above the requisite two-thirds of all voting creditors by claim amount necessary to confirm the plan without including the votes of affiliates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Section 18.3.2 of the Settlement Agreement discusses the trustee release of BNY Mellon.

Recognition of the Croatian Proceeding in Other Jurisdictions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Though the EA Law aims to centralize a debtor's claims in a single court, several jurisdictions have refused to recognize the Croatian Proceeding under their own laws. According to the\n   <em>\n    Memo on Foreign Recognition Hearings\n   </em>\n   (\"Memo on Foreign Hearings,\" ECF Doc. # 21) at least some of the Agrokor Group sought recognition of the Croatian Proceeding in six jurisdictions in addition to the United States. Of these foreign recognition requests, only Switzerland has made a final decision to recognize the commencement of the Croatian Proceeding and to give effect to the Extraordinary Administrator to represent debtors and to deal with their assets in Switzerland under the Swiss International Private Law Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The High Court of England and Wales also agreed to recognize the Croatian Proceeding of Agrokor, but an appeal of that decision is pending. Appeals of decisions\n   <em>\n    rejecting\n   </em>\n   recognition of the Croatian Proceeding are pending in\n   Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-122.) A summary of the foreign recognition proceedings relating to the Croatian Proceeding follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   These decisions have no direct impact upon the decision to recognize and enforce the Croatian Proceeding and Settlement Agreement in the U.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    1. Slovenia\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia (\"Slovenian Court\") decided the issue on March 14, 2018. (ECF Doc. # 21 at 13.) The Slovenian Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Since the recognition of a foreign court decision means recognition of its legal effects on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia, only a decision (procedure) which corresponds to the fundamental legal principles of procedures due to insolvency under ZFPPIPP may be recognized. A recognition of a foreign extraordinary administration procedure, that does not ensure an equal treatment of creditors, would adversely affect the public interest of the Republic of Slovenia, which in domestic insolvency procedures determines (and safeguards) the common (basic) principle of equal treatment of creditors, whereas in insolvency procedures with an international element (on its territory) recognizes only financial restructuring procedures or liquidation procedures of the debtor for the joint account of all creditors (which corresponds to the principle of equal treatment of creditors).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Slovenian Court proceeded to explain that the EA Law (and therefore the Croatian Proceeding) should not be recognized, primarily because it does not comply with Slovenia's insolvency rule that creditors of equal standing should be provided equal treatment. The Slovenian Court states, \"it does not even provide the basic rights the creditors would have under the Slovenian insolvency legislation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) Additionally, the Slovenian Court argues that the extraordinary administration procedure envisioned by the EA Law is subordinated to the interests of Croatia, since the Croatian government selects the extraordinary administrator to conduct the debtor's business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While not entirely clear, it appears that the Slovenian Court was concerned that the EA Law serves the purpose of protecting the Croatian economy by providing a new form of relief on a somewhat\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   basis as needed for Agrokor and its subsidiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Slovenian Court also notes that other countries rejected the recognition of the Croatian extraordinary administration procedure and argued that since several of these countries had laws arising out of the former Yugoslavian Compulsory Composition, Bankruptcy and Liquidation Act (SPPSL), that in a broader public policy context of the region, recognition would not be \"justified and proportional.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) Four days after the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia rejected the application for recognition of the Croatian Proceeding, the Extraordinary Administrator appealed that decision to the Constitutional Court of Slovenia; that appeal remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    2. Serbia\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Commercial Appellate Court for the Republic of Serbia confirmed rejection of the Croatian Proceeding on November 13, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.) The Serbian court found that under article 174, paragraph 2 of its\n   Law on Bankruptcy, the Croatian extraordinary administration procedure could not be found to be a \"foreign proceeding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.) The court provides several grounds for this conclusion. One issue the Serbian court notes is that the EA Law is not a general law that governs all insolvency in Croatia, but rather is a\n   <em>\n    sui generis\n   </em>\n   regulation adopted to protect companies of systemic importance to the Republic of Croatia. The court found it problematic that the level of protection determined under the EA Law is determined by the interest of the Republic of Croatia as opposed to the interests of creditors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court states, \"the aim of this regulation ... is not the aim of the collective settlement of creditors, but the protection of the interests of the state, the creator of such a regulation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.) On December 20, 2017, the Croatian Extraordinary Administrator filed an appeal to the Constitutional Court of Serbia; that appeal remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    3. Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Article 205, Paragraph 1, item 3 of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\"FB &amp; H\") Bankruptcy Law states that to recognize a foreign decision on bankruptcy proceedings or proceedings similar to bankruptcy, such decision must not contravene the legal order of the Federation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.) The court explains that the basic purpose of bankruptcy proceedings should be the collective settlement of creditors and that it does not believe that the EA Law was passed with creditors in mind. The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The protection of economic, social and financial stability of the Republic of Croatia cannot jeopardize the FB &amp; H legal order, and this opinion of the first instance court, contrary to the appeal, is not different from the international case law, according to which protection and maintenance of economic, social and financial stability of one country in the proceedings of recognition of a foreign ruling, in a situation where the compulsory regulations are opposed - which is the case here- cannot jeopardize the legal order of another country where the decision is to be recognized, as otherwise the principle of equality would be breached.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.) The Extraordinary Administrator filed an appeal at the Constitutional Court on March 16, 2018; that appeal remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    4. Montenegro\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Montenegro court held that extraordinary administration procedures under the EA Law did not meet the requirements of the Insolvency Act of Montenegro. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [T]he court finds that the extraordinary administration proceeding is not a foreign proceeding in terms of Article 178 paragraph 2 of the Insolvency Act, since it is not a proceeding aimed at the collective settlement of creditors, but at protecting and maintaining economic, social and financial stability of the Republic of Croatia, that is, the sustainability of business operations of certain companies that are of systemic importance for the Republic of Croatia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109.) In other words, because the EA Law seemed primarily concerned with the protection of the interest of the Republic of Croatia rather than the creditors of a certain debtor, the proceeding did not comply with the requirements for recognition in Montenegro. An appeal filed in the Commercial Court of Montenegro is pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    5. England and Wales\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The High Court of England and Wales found that the EA Law and Croatian Proceeding\n   sufficiently satisfied the requirements of a foreign main proceeding under the CBIR, England's adaptation of the Model Law, over the objections of respondent Sberbank. As with the above discussed foreign recognition decisions, it should be noted at the outset that the English decision was rendered before the Settlement Agreement was finalized or voted upon. The English decision was issued on September 11, 2017. Nearly a year later, creditors voted to approve the Settlement Agreement on July 4, 2018. The English decision specifically states that, \"recognition of the settlement agreement is not the real question here. That is something for the future. Such recognition will depend at that stage on other considerations, for example the submission by the creditors to the jurisdiction of the foreign proceeding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 97 \u00b6 127.) Therefore, the decision only grants recognition of a foreign main proceeding; it does not make any decisions with respect to the later approved Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   A transcript of the English hearing shows that several contentions were raised against recognition of the Croatian Proceeding under the Model Law and the CBIR. First, Sberbank's counsel argued that recognition of a \"foreign proceeding\" under the CBIR is limited to a single debtor and that recognition of the Croatian Proceeding would require recognizing a debtor grouped together with related, but separate entities, in one proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel argued this was problematic because it would allow (1) all the members of the group to participate in a restructuring without requiring each individual member to prove insolvency as a gateway issue and (2) in effect, by consolidating a group of entities, the combined procedure could block a creditor from asserting a distinct claim against a particular debtor. Counsel argued that the combined proceeding effectively created a set of third-party releases for affiliated or sub-companies-counsel for Sberbank gives the example that if someone has advanced finance on terms where they also have guarantees from companies B, C, D, E and F as well as principal debt from company A, consolidation into a single pool with one claim would eradicate the value of any guarantee. (\"English Recognition Hearing Transcript,\" ECF Doc. # 24 Exhibit B at 42.) It argued it was further problematic as applied to Agrokor, because unless Agrokor and its affiliates are grouped as one debtor, the threshold number of employees required under the EA Law is not met. (English Recognition Hearing Transcript at 40.) However, when referencing these arguments, Sberbank's attorney also goes through pains to remind the English court that U.S. courts have adopted the Model Law differently and that the English court is only bound by the CBIR and not U.S. precedent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47.) Recognition in England also apparently was sought for a single debtor, Agrokor, on behalf of the whole group. As already stated, Chapter 15 cases were filed in this Court on behalf of nine separate entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The High Court of England and Wales ultimately rejected Sberbank's arguments. The High Court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   The important point is simply this. There is nothing in the CBIR to prevent\n   a foreign proceeding being recognized, which in the foreign court involves a group of companies, but the recognition is sought in this country in relation only to a particular individual debtor. In my judgment, the respondent's objection here is without foundation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (ECF Doc. # 21 at 78 \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Additionally, the English court concluded that (1) the Croatian Extraordinary Administration Law is a law relating to insolvency for the purposes of CBIR, (2) it is a proceeding under the control or supervision of a court, (3) it is a collective proceeding, (4) it is a law for the purposes of reorganization or liquidation within the meaning of the CBIR and (5) it is not manifestly contrary to English public policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-98.) In reaching this final public policy conclusion, the court noted that the principal of\n   <em>\n    pari passu\n   </em>\n   can be overridden in appropriate cases under English law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98 \u00b6 131.) The High Court of England and Wales' decision is further discussed below in relation to the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule and the possible effects of that rule on future proceedings in England. The appeal is to be heard by the Court of Appeal, and the stay will remain in effect while the English proceedings are ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    6. Switzerland\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court of the Canton of Zug in Switzerland granted recognition of the Croatian Proceeding in a decision issued on February 2, 2018. (ECF Doc. # 21 at 113.) There has been no appeal of this decision; it is final and binding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    7. European Union\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   On July 4, 2018, the European Parliament added the Recast Insolvency Regulation (EU) 2015/848 to the European Union's Acquis Communautaire the Law on Extraordinary Administration Proceeding for Companies of Systemic Importance for the Republic of Croatia. (Recast Insolvency Regulation, \"EU Regulation,\" ECF Doc. # 21 Appendix D at 161-225.) The EU insolvency regulation was designed to regulate insolvencies. This adoption of the EA Law ostensibly gave the Croatian Proceeding automatic recognition as an insolvency proceeding, entitled to recognition across all European Union member states. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    A. EA Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   On April 7, 2017, Croatia published Official Gazette No. 31/17, the\n   <em>\n    Law on Extraordinary Administration Proceeding in Companies of Systemic Importance in the Republic of Croatia\n   </em>\n   . (\"Certified Translation from Croatian Language of the Law on Extraordinary Administration Proceeding in Companies of Systemic Importance for the Republic of Croatia,\" ECF Doc. # 4 Exhibit B at 46-59.) Part 1, article 1, chapter 1 of the EA Law explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   This Law is passed for the purpose of protection of sustainability of operations of the companies of systemic importance for the Republic of Croatia which with its operations individually or together with its controlled or affiliated companies affect the entire economic, social, and financial stability of the Republic of Croatia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.) The Croatian law was passed to try to prevent a wider economic fallout in Croatia and surrounding global markets through restructuring companies of systemic importance to Croatia. In effect, the new law is somewhat reminiscent of the efforts globally to deal with problems of \"too big to fail.\" The Croatian Law appears to be unique in dealing with systemically important\n   <em>\n    companies\n   </em>\n   as opposed to systemically important\n   <em>\n    financial institutions\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Article 21 of the EA Law provides that either a debtor of systemic importance or\n   such a debtor's creditors, with the debtor's permission, may file an extraordinary proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.) The petition to commence the proceeding is submitted to the Croatian Court, which must then inform the Croatian Government within the same day that a petition has been filed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51.) After a petition has been filed, the debtor is estopped from disposing of any assets until the petition is either approved or denied, except for those dispositions necessary for debtor to maintain its ordinary course of business operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Croatian Court issues the final order that commences the extraordinary proceeding, and upon the court's order commencing a proceeding, notice is posted in the relevant Croatian Court districts, on the public books or records of the debtor and on the Croatian Court's web pages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.) After the commencement of a proceeding under the EA Law, all relevant parties, further detailed below, have fifteen months (twelve months' time is allotted automatically, and the option of an additional three months' time is granted upon request approved by the Croatian Court) to craft a single settlement agreement to resolve all claims against the debtor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The EA Law lists two requirements for a debtor to be considered a company of systemic importance that may file an action under the EA Law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.) Article 4, paragraph 2 provides that in the calendar year preceding the filing of the petition, the debtor, alone or with its controlled or affiliated companies, must (1) employ more than 5,000 employees on average for the year and (2) have balance sheet liabilities of at least the equivalent of HRK 7,500,000,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In these calculations determining whether a debtor is of systemic importance to Croatia, article 5, paragraph 2 specifies that affiliated and controlled companies are companies in which the debtor holds at least a 25% ownership interest, have a principal place of business in The Republic of Croatia and exist and operate under Croatian law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47.)

Before 2005, former section 304 of the Bankruptcy Code provided the statutory framework for dealing with ancillary cases filed in the U.S. relating to foreign insolvency proceedings.

This is evidenced by the pervasiveness with which comity appears in chapter 15's provisions.

There is nothing exceptional in the Croatian Court's exercise of jurisdiction over the Croatian Foreign Debtors' assets and creditors' claims in the insolvency proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In section II.A., the Court has described the provisions of the EA Law in considerable detail. In substance and effect, the EA Law tracks closely to the structure of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and many other foreign insolvency laws. Creditors' rights to meaningful participation in insolvency proceedings is required and creditor approval of a settlement agreement is also required. As explained in section II.D., below, the record establishes that the EA Proceeding was procedurally fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   While enterprise group aspects of the EA Law are novel, these Chapter 15 cases dealing with nine entities that have their centers of main interest (\"COMI\") in Croatia do not push the boundaries of cross-border insolvency law.

A single court should resolve all claims to property of the debtor, which necessarily\n   requires that the court resolve all creditor claims that have been, or could have been, asserted, provided that the creditors have received the notice required by due process. Thus, in an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceeding, personal jurisdiction over all creditors is not required; the court determines the creditors' rights to receive distributions from all property of the debtor that is part of the estate. A creditor cannot ignore or avoid a Chapter 11 case and later sue to recover on its prepetition claim. Upon confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan, section 1141(d)(1)(A) discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of confirmation, whether or not the creditors filed a proof of claim or accepted the plan. A successful reorganization would not be possible if creditors could simply ignore the bankruptcy proceeding and then seek to recover on their prior claims. Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   classification of a bankruptcy proceeding is key-\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction gives the court the authority to administer all the debtor's assets and resolve the rights of all creditors to all the debtor's property, and these are crucial steps in a successful restructuring. There is no reason that these same principles should not apply when considering recognition of the Croatian Proceeding, with the same consequences for a confirmed settlement agreement-namely, the discharge and modification of prepetition claims like the effect of section 1141(d)(1)(A).

Nonetheless, the issue (of whether recognition of the entire Settlement Agreement is appropriate within the territorial U.S.) arises because of the English courts' enforcement of the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule, discussed below, which could lead an English court to conclude that certain aspects of the Settlement Agreement cannot be enforced in England against creditors holding English law governed debt. Such a refusal of the English court to enforce parts of the Settlement Agreement would most certainly cause the Settlement Agreement to fail considering the amount of prepetition debt governed by English law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   That would be unfortunate, indeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   While recognition of the foreign proceeding turns on the objective criteria under section 1517, \"relief [post-recognition] is largely discretionary and turns on subjective factors that embody principles of comity.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Master Fund, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3584956\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/389/325/#p333\">\n    389 B.R. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (citing \u00a7\u00a7 1507, 1521 and 1525).

However, the Court does not ultimately need to perform the broader analysis of comity with respect to every nation involved, because\n   the Court's decision to recognize and enforce the Settlement Agreement is effective within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.

The record also reflects that the substance and procedures set forth in the EA Law comport with broadly recognized principles for insolvency laws. Moreover, the creditor distributions approved in the Settlement Agreement closely follow the waterfall provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, as\n   discussed above, over two-thirds of non-insider creditors voted to approve the Settlement Agreement, avoiding the taint of the insider votes that prevented recognition and enforcement in the\n   <em>\n    Vitro\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Additionally, the standards for due process set forth in the Second Circuit's nonexclusive list of factors for procedural fairness in\n   <em>\n    Finanz AG Zurich\n   </em>\n   were satisfied by the Croatian Proceeding. As outlined in the EA Law, creditors have been grouped into five classes and participated in the drafting and approval of the Settlement Agreement, which provides for payout where creditors of the same class are treated equally, satisfying the first\n   <em>\n    Finanz\n   </em>\n   factor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Foreign Representative acts as a fiduciary and is overseen by the Croatian Court throughout this process, which is consistent with the second\n   <em>\n    Finanz\n   </em>\n   factor of procedural fairness. After the Settlement Agreement was approved by a majority of creditors and approved by the Croatian court on July 6, 2018, approximately 92 complaints were filed against confirmation, showing that creditors have the right to submit denied or contested claims for further adjudication, consistent with the third\n   <em>\n    Finanz\n   </em>\n   factor for procedural fairness. According to Agrokor's official website, the company responded to all 92 complaints in one submission to the Commercial Court on September 4, 2018. The issue is still pending before the Croatian Court; enforcement of the Settlement Agreement will not commence in Croatia until the Court issues its final order. Thus, creditors who opposed the Settlement Agreement have been able to seek further adjudication in the Croatian Court system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Satisfying the fourth\n   <em>\n    Finanz\n   </em>\n   factors, the EA Law required published notification to creditors on the Court's website. Satisfying the fifth\n   <em>\n    Finanz\n   </em>\n   factor, the EA Law provides for creditors meetings, which were held. Indeed, the Temporary Creditor's Council continues to meet and was informed of the complaints as well as Agrokor's responses to the complaints at the most recent meeting. Agrokor held its 22nd creditor meeting on September 13, 2018. Representatives of all five creditor groups attended the meeting, including Sberbank as a representative of the unsecured creditors, and Knighthead Capital Management, LLC as the representative of the bond holders' creditor group.\n   <em>\n    Finanz\n   </em>\n   factors seven and eight-regarding the creation of a centralized distribution and the creation of an automatic stay-are both provided for by the EA Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Finally, no objections to the recognition of the Settlement Agreement have been brought before this Court. All evidence before the Court demonstrates that creditors received due process and will be better off under the Settlement Agreement than they would be in a liquidation. The Foreign Representative affirms that the \"Croatian proceedings ... will allow the [Foreign] Debtors to restructure in the most efficient manner without jeopardizing creditors' rights.\" (ECF Doc. # 5 \u00b6 40.) The affirmation of a Croatian legal representative who practices complex commercial litigation in Croatia, provides that \"[p]ursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the creditors will receive a better outcome in respect of their claims than they would in a Croatian bankruptcy or liquidation process.\" (ECF Doc. # 6 \u00b6 9.) Thus, the essential contours of a foreign proceeding that should be granted comity in the U.S. are present. As such, the Settlement Agreement should be recognized in full within the territorial jurisdiction of the\n   United States, including the provisions modifying the English law governed debt and the New York law governed debt. Courts in other jurisdictions will make their own, independent decisions whether to recognize and enforce the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Gibbs Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Because Chapter 15's principal criterion for recognizing foreign proceedings and recognizing and enforcing a reorganization plan is a comity analysis, it is appropriate for this Court to consider the effects of a decision to extend comity to one nation if doing so could be seen as a refusal to extend comity to the laws of another-particularly where a majority of the debt to be modified is governed by the law of the latter nation. In these circumstances, a complete comity analysis requires at least consideration of, even if not ultimately lending deference to, English law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule remains the governing law in England despite its seeming incongruence with the principle of modified universalism espoused by the Model Law and a broad consensus of international insolvency practitioners and jurists.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Kannan Ramesh,\n   <em>\n    The Gibbs Principle: A Tether on the Feet of Good Forum Shopping\n   </em>\n   , 29 Sing. Acad.

The essence of modified universalism is that \"bankruptcy proceedings ... should be unitary and universal, recognized internationally and effective in respect of all the bankrupt's assets.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11567997,11568775\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/240/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The essence of the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule, on the other hand, is territorialism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   , Lord Esher questions, \"Why should the plaintiffs be bound by the law of a country to which they do not belong, and by which they have not contracted to be bound?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   25 QDB at 406. Throughout the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   opinion, Lord Esher characterizes the recognition of a foreign insolvency proceeding as an issue of contract law between a single debtor and creditor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11567997,11568775\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/240/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the contract was made in England and meant to be performed in England, Lord Esher reasoned that a breach of contract should be determined by the laws in England, not discharged by a French insolvency proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 404. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   characterizes the recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings as a contractual issue to be settled in the territory with the governing contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Despite the clear territorial slant of the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule, it was recently followed by the English High Court. In a 2018 decision, Justice Hildyard began his opinion by noting the tension between the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule and the principle of modified universalism in the CBIR.\n   <em>\n    Bakshiyeva v. Sberbank of Russia, et al.\n   </em>\n   [2018] EWHC 59 (Ch). The\n   <em>\n    Bakshiyeva\n   </em>\n   court was asked to recognize and enforce proceedings in Azerbaijan that sought to restructure Azerbaijan's largest bank. Bakshiyeva, the foreign representative for the Azerbaijan proceeding, sought a permanent stay imposed in England so that English creditors would have to participate in the centralized, Azerbaijan proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Two of the bank's creditors, who held English law governed debt instruments and had not participated in any way in the foreign proceeding, invoked the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule. Justice Hildyard agreed with the creditors, finding that the CBIR did not allow a foreign court to change or discharge the substantive rights of creditors conferred by English law. The decision reaffirmed the priority of the common law\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule over the more recently adopted CBIR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to governing English cross-border insolvency law for the past century,\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   has been influential and accepted in other Commonwealth countries including Canada and Australia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ian F.

Eurofinance SA\n   </em>\n   , a decision by the Supreme Court of England, was cited as providing the relevant exception to the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule-when a creditor submits to the jurisdiction of a foreign court, either by submitting its claims in the foreign insolvency proceeding or otherwise agreeing to be bound thereby, then the creditor will be bound in that proceeding and\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   will no longer apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rubin v. Eurofinance SA\n   </em>\n   (2012) UKSC 46 at \u00b6 157-67 (Eng.) (holding that creditors who filed proofs of debt and participated in a creditors' meeting, but did not file an appearance, had nonetheless submitted to the jurisdiction of an Australian court and were bound by that Australian proceeding). Agrokor's counsel asserted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   Here, the Gibbs Rule does not govern the English Law Governed Loans compromised by the Settlement Agreement because all holders of the Agrokor Group's English Law Governed Loans submitted their claims in full in the Croatian Proceedings and, as such, the holders submitted to the jurisdiction of the Croatian courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   (Brief in Further Support \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   While counsel argued that all holders of English Law Governed Loans submitted their claims in the EA Proceeding, no evidence was presented to support that contention, and the vote tally in the EA Proceeding shows that not all creditors voted on the Settlement Agreement. The appropriate time and place for the Foreign Debtors to raise their argument will be in any further proceedings in the English court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   While the English court has yet to decide whether to recognize and enforce the Settlement Agreement, the English court discussed\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   before holding that the Croatian Proceeding should be recognized as a foreign main proceeding in England, concluding that the proceeding did not manifestly violate English public policy. (English Decision \u00b6 131.) The court did not reach the issue of whether the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule applies and bars recognition and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement. The decision whether to recognize and enforce the Settlement Agreement is likely to implicate a more demanding analysis under\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The fact that England applies the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule and refuses to recognize a discharge or modification of English law debt approved by a court outside of England is not, in this Court's view, a basis for this Court to decline to recognize and enforce the Settlement Agreement within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. On this issue, the Court agrees with Justice Kannan Ramesh of the Supreme Court of Singapore in his opinion in\n   <em>\n    Pacific Andes Resources Development Ltd\n   </em>\n   , [2016] SGHC 210. Justice Ramesh explains that, in his view, the parties to a contractual relationship governed by the law of a jurisdiction adhering to the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule should be attributed with the expectation that their claims might be discharged in proceedings in a jurisdiction where the debtor has an established connection based on residence or ties of business.\n   <em>\n    Pacific Andes\n   </em>\n   , SGHC 210 at \u00b6 48. This view, of course, contrasts with\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   , where the court did not think that it was fair to attribute any expectation of or consent to the jurisdiction of French bankruptcy law to the English merchant who contracted with the French company that was domiciled in Paris. Justice Ramesh's view also differs from the more recent\n   <em>\n    Rubin\n   </em>\n   decision, in which Lord Collins declares it \"wholly unrealistic\" that \"a person who sells goods to a foreign company accepts the risk of the insolvency legislation of the place of incorporation\" without providing further explanation on the point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Rubin\n   </em>\n   UKSC 46 at \u00b6 116 (Eng.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pacific Andes\n   </em>\n   , Justice Ramesh discusses several academic criticisms of the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule's continued application in global bankruptcy proceedings. One of the lengthier excerpts is the criticism provided by Look Chan Ho, author of\n   <em>\n    Cross-Border Insolvency: Principles and Practice\n   </em>\n   (Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2016). Look Chan Ho criticizes the notion that insolvency proceedings should be characterized as contractual issues. As mentioned above, the original\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   opinion discussed the idea that parties to a contract should be able to choose the law that would govern their interactions, even in the potentially unexpected situation of a bankruptcy proceeding. The fact that the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule is premised on a predominately contractual analysis is reinforced by the\n   <em>\n    Rubin\n   </em>\n   exception to the rule, which says that if a party, who otherwise would not be bound to a foreign proceeding, nonetheless chooses to consent to the foreign forum's jurisdiction, the rule will no longer apply. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule centers around the idea of a party's contractual or consensual choice to be bound to a certain forum's rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   A theoretical and practical issue with applying such a contractual analysis in the context of insolvency proceedings, as Look Chan Ho and others argue, is that bankruptcy discharges by their very nature imply diverging from the terms of most of the debtor's prepetition contracts. The primary disputes in a bankruptcy are ordinarily not about the rights of a single creditor against the debtor; insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings in which the rights of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   creditors are determined for a slice of a pie that is not big enough to repay all creditors in full. A fundamental tenet of the U.S. bankruptcy system, also applied under the new Croatian law and most other modern insolvency laws, is that creditors of the same class are entitled to equality of distribution. Allowing creditors with claims governed by English law to recover a greater percentage\n   of their claims than creditors with claims governed, for example, by New York law, would violate the fundamental principle of equality of distribution. As already discussed, the Settlement Agreement provides for equality of distribution between the holders of the English law governed and New York law governed debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Additionally, as Look Chan Ho notes, framing the issue of which law should govern a creditor's rights in a bankruptcy as a solely contractual issue between two parties overlooks orthodox English classification of bankruptcy as an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule's contractual analysis seems to be based on the contractual parties'\n   <em>\n    expectations\n   </em>\n   ; but if parties' expectations created the rule, is it realistic for creditors to multinational corporations to expect that, in the context of an insolvency proceeding, their contractual bargain will ultimately prevail?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   As Justice Ramesh argues, a fundamental problem with the use of the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule in international insolvency cases is that it mischaracterizes the discharge of debt as a contractual issue, rather than as a bankruptcy or insolvency law issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kannan Ramesh,\n   <em>\n    The Gibbs Principle: A Tether on the Feet of Good Forum Shopping\n   </em>\n   , 29 Sing. Acad. L.J. at 49. A discharge of debts in an insolvency proceeding almost invariably involves some form of cram-down, or modification of creditors' prepetition claims, where a majority of creditors will outweigh a minority of dissenting creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As justice Ramesh explains, \"bankruptcy is undergirded by the philosophy that policy is given primacy\n   <em>\n    over contractual rights\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, the basic rationale espoused by Lord Esher in\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   -that parties consensual, contractual decisions should determine the choice of law of all future legal interactions-is inappropriate when applied in the context of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, which inherently involve a societal choice to allow collective proceedings to discharge previously existing contractual obligations. The Court agrees with Justice Ramesh that a creditor's autonomy is relevant in the context of an insolvency proceeding only to the extent that it does not impede the underlying public policy that governs a collective insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Professor Ian F. Fletcher, a distinguished professor in England, argues that\n   \"[t]he Gibbs doctrine belongs to an age of Anglocentric reasoning which should be consigned to history.\"\n   <em>\n    Insolvency in Private International Law\n   </em>\n   , OXFORD PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW SERIES 130 (Oxford University Press, 2d Ed, 2005). In addition to\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   ' failure to create a system that allows for the centralized, collective restructuring of debt, Fletcher finds the rule troubling because English law only narrowly recognizes the effects of foreign discharges in England but asserts that a discharge resulting from an English proceeding has a universal effect, irrespective of the governing law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129, 209-10 (describing the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule's effect on English law as \"a form of systemic schizophrenia when contemplating the effects of foreign insolvency proceedings on obligations to which the debtor was a party\"). England, of course, is free to continue to adhere to the\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   rule, but that does not mean that a U.S. bankruptcy court must follow the rule in deciding whether to recognize and enforce the decision of a court of another jurisdiction. U.S. Bankruptcy courts have long permitted foreign bankruptcy proceedings to bind U.S. creditors even where the debtor entered into a contract governed by New York law and agreed to a New York forum selection clause. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Altos Hornos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969032,8964958\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/418/\">\n    412 F.3d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court considered whether contracting parties choice of New York as the forum for all contract disputes was enough to override the preference of extending comity to foreign bankruptcy proceedings. Though the New York forum clause in that case provided a broad grant of exclusive authority to New York courts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that the Mexican court where the insolvency proceeding was pending should be the court to resolve the contract dispute that affected the resolution of the Mexican insolvency proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969032,8964958\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/418/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969032,8964958\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/418/\">\n    at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the court explained, \"\n   <em>\n    regardless of the parties' pre-litigation agreement\n   </em>\n   , once a party declares bankruptcy in a foreign state and a foreign court asserts jurisdiction over the distribution of assets, U.S. courts may defer to the foreign bankruptcy proceeding on international comity grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969032,8964958\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/418/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Canada Southern Railway Co. v.

As explained in this Opinion, the Court has concluded that it is appropriate for this Court to decide whether, in the exercise of comity, the Croatian court-approved Settlement Agreement-including provisions modifying English law debt-should be recognized and enforced\n    <em>\n     within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States\n    </em>\n    . Of course, if presented with the issue whether the Settlement Agreement should be recognized and enforced in England and Wales (and perhaps in other Commonwealth jurisdictions), the English court is obviously free to decide the issue as it believes appropriate. The Court has concluded that a U.S. court should not leave to another court (here the High Court in London) the decision whether U.S. comity principles entitle the Croatian court decision to recognition and enforcement. The Foreign Representative's counsel argued that a recognized exception to the\n    <em>\n     Gibbs\n    </em>\n    rule (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , that creditors holding English law debt filed claims or submitted to the jurisdiction of the Croatian court and are therefore bound by the Settlement Agreement) allows this Court to decide that the\n    <em>\n     Gibbs\n    </em>\n    rule does not apply. The Court believes that is an issue for the English court to decide if the issue is raised in a proceeding in England.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    Annex 2 to the Settlement Agreement lists the non-Croatian subsidiaries and affiliates of the Agrokor Group. 23 are located in Serbia, 18 are located in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 15 are located in Slovenia, 6 are in the U.S., 4 are in Montenegro, 3 are in Hungary, and 2 are located in both Macedonia and the Netherlands.
