[Record Document 1]. The Trustee, Todd S. Johns (\"Trustee\"), opposes the appeal and asks this Court to affirm the Bankruptcy Court's orders. [Record Document 9]. For the reasons assigned herein, the orders of the Bankruptcy\n   Court [Bankr. Documents 29 and 49]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   are hereby\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   , and this matter is\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this Memorandum Ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 31, 2016, Briggs filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. [Bankr. Document 1]. Briggs lives with her husband, and her income is above the median income for a two-person household in Louisiana. [Bankr. Document 29 at 3, 6]. Briggs's first plan proposed to pay $9,500 to her unsecured creditors. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19]. After Briggs resolved several objections to the Trustee's satisfaction, he submitted her plan to the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation. [Record Document 1-2 at 3]. Rather than approve the plan in light of the absence of objections, the Bankruptcy Court set a confirmation hearing. [Bankr. Document 18]. The Bankruptcy Court then denied confirmation on the basis of its\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   objection to Briggs's calculation of her disposable income. [Bankr. Document 29]. When calculating her disposable income on Form 122C-2, Briggs deducted $913.00 for mortgage or rent expenses. [Bankr. Document 1 at 56]. This amount is the IRS Local Standard for rent for a two-person household in Bossier Parish, Louisiana. [Bankr. Document 29 at 15]. Reasoning that Briggs could not deduct a rental expense that she did not incur, the Bankruptcy Court held that she was entitled to deduct $438.20 only-the actual amount of her monthly mortgage payments. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To comply with the Bankruptcy Court's ruling, Briggs filed an amended plan that limited her mortgage deduction to the value of her mortgage payments, thereby increasing the amount that she would pay her unsecured creditors. [Bankr. Documents 37 at 2 and 43]. She then objected to confirmation of this plan. [Bankr. Document 46]. The Bankruptcy Court overruled the objection and confirmed the plan. [Bankr. Document 49]. This appeal followed.

Thus, a bankruptcy court's discretionary decisions are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard, findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and legal conclusions are reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    In re ASARCO, L.R.C.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    ASARCO v.

The Supreme Court has noted that the purpose of the disposable income calculation is to \"help ensure that debtors who\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   pay creditors\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   pay them.\"\n   <em>\n    Ransom v. FIA Card Servs., N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5979953,12439772\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/61/\">\n    562 U.S. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5979953,3784650,12439772\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/716/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5979953,12439772\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/61/\">\n    178 L.Ed.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 109-31, pt. 1, at 2 (2005) ). On the basis of this policy and a bankruptcy court's independent duty to assure itself of debtors' good faith, the Bankruptcy Court concluded not only that it could refuse to confirm a plan relying on an incorrect disposable income calculation, but that it must do so. [Bankr. Document 29 at 23-24]. The Bankruptcy Court gave three reasons for reaching this result. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-28]. First, the Bankruptcy Court held that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), stands for the proposition that a bankruptcy court has an \"independent duty to review all budgets and Chapter 13 plans.\" [Bankr. Document 29 at 24]. Second, because confirmed plans bind both debtors and creditors, the Bankruptcy Court asserted that it had a duty to correct errors before confirmation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25]. Relatedly, the Bankruptcy Court pointed out that when it disagrees with the Trustee over the interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"Code\"), there is no practical means to resolve this dispute other than\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   objections, particularly in light of the tendency of Chapter 13 creditors in this district to limit their involvement to filing proofs of claim. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27]. The result is to make trustees the \"final arbiter[s]\" of Chapter 13 plans-a result that in the Bankruptcy Court's view is undesirable because the current trustee in the Western District of Louisiana is relatively inexperienced as a trustee. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Finally, the Bankruptcy Court rejected a limited view of its power that would relegate it to being \"simply a confirmation order signing machine.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Briggs raises four claims of error on appeal, two of which relate to a threshold issue of the Bankruptcy Court's inherent authority. [Record Document 8 at 3]. First, Briggs asks this Court to review whether\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   authorized the Bankruptcy Court's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   objection to her disposable income calculation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Second, she asks this Court to determine whether the Code prevents anyone other than a Chapter 13 trustee and unsecured creditors from objecting to a debtor's disposable income calculation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Briggs believes both questions should be answered in the negative. Specifically, she contends that the portion of\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   on which the Bankruptcy Court relied is dicta and, in any event, applies only to a particular subset of Code provisions-those that are \"self-executing.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-25]. Because the provisions related to the disposable income calculation are not self-executing, she argues that a bankruptcy court cannot independently object to plans that improperly calculate a debtor's disposable income. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27]. She then disputes the Bankruptcy Court's characterization of its objection as an exercise of its authority to police debtors' good faith because \"[g]ood faith is not an economic test\" and because the Bankruptcy Court did not make the findings required to reject a plan for a lack of good faith. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28]. Briggs's remaining two issues concern the correctness of her preferred disposable income calculation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his brief, the Trustee argues that the Bankruptcy Court's reading of\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   is correct and points to several pre-\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   cases that he interprets as holding that a bankruptcy court has independent authority to object to any provision of a proposed Chapter 13 plan. [Record Document 10 at 22-23]. In particular, he argues that despite the presence of the \"self-executing\" modifier in\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , the holding of that case applies to every requirement that the Code imposes on a debtor's plan. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24]. Briggs's reply brief distinguishes the cases cited by the Trustee by pointing out that none of them expressly hold that the disposable income calculation is subject to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   objections. [Record Document 13 at 9-10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER 13\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This Court's analysis begins with the language of the Code.

However, because the bankruptcy court's failure to make this finding did not deprive it of jurisdiction to discharge the student loan interest and because United's actual notice of the proceedings complied\n   with due process, the Court held that Rule 60(b)(4) did not authorize relief from the discharge order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 271-72,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In Part III of\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , the Court stated that the \"Code makes plain that bankruptcy courts have the authority-indeed, the obligation-to direct a debtor to conform his plan to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 277,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While some authorities contend that the whole of Part III is dicta,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Keith Lundin,\n   <em>\n    Sewer Sponte II: The Dark Side of\n   </em>\n   Espinosa, Lundin on Chapter 13, https://www.lundinonchapter13.com/ (last visited Sept. 4, 2018), this Court believes that Part III still provides useful guidance. Under\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , when a student loan debtor fails to seek a determination of undue hardship, bankruptcy courts may (indeed, must) object-even if no creditor does.\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at 276-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   leaves uncertain is the extent to which a bankruptcy court must object\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   to provisions of the Code other than those concerning student loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court repeatedly described the requirement of an undue hardship determination as \"self-executing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 274-76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A self-executing provision of the Code is one that a bankruptcy court must enforce even if no creditor objects.\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at 274-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the context of student loan debt, a debtor must \"affirmatively secure[ ] a hardship determination\" in order to obtain a discharge of student loans.\n   <em>\n    Tenn.

Norton, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Law Practice\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 57:52). Thus, the characteristic of the Code's self-executing provisions is that they require a debtor to invoke a proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Clarke(Clarke v. Paige)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499046\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/266/301/#p306\">\n    266 B.R. 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 306 (Bankr. E.D.

Thus, this Court holds that\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   requires a bankruptcy court to object\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   to terms in proposed Chapter 13 plans that violate self-executing provisions of the Code. In the absence of guidance from a higher court to the contrary, this Court further holds that objections on the basis of non-self-executing provisions must be made by a party that the Code authorizes to object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This reading of\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   reflects the language of the Code. Under the Code, only a debtor may propose a Chapter 13 plan.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201321\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This suggests an initial limitation on the Court's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lundin,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the broad reading of\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   favored by the Bankruptcy Court would rapidly become unworkable. Under\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , a bankruptcy court has an unfailing \"obligation\" to correct certain defects in proposed Chapter 13 plans.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The logical consequence, then, of the Bankruptcy Court's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   is to impose on bankruptcy judges a duty to ferret out\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   defect in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   proposed plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lundin,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Such a far-reaching obligation would effectively deprive Chapter\n   13 trustees of any role other than collecting and distributing estates' assets. Trustees have a duty to enforce the equitable division of a debtor's estate, and Congress has made it clear that a \"[C]hapter 13 trustee 'is no mere disbursing agent.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Maddox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121707,1527613\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/15/1347/\">\n    15 F.3d 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1355 (5th Cir. 1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-989, at 139 ). The Bankruptcy Court's interpretation of its authority under\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   thus usurps a function Congress has allotted to the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Therefore, the Court holds that the Bankruptcy Court's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   as authorizing\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   objections to any provision of a proposed Chapter 13 plan is erroneous. However, because this Court also holds that\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   requires bankruptcy courts to object\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   to plan provisions that violate self-executing requirements of the Code, the Bankruptcy Court's ultimate conclusion may be affirmed if the disposable income calculation provision at issue is self-executing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    SELF-EXECUTING AND NON-SELF-EXECUTING PROVISIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To determine whether \u00a7 1325(b)(1) is self-executing, the Court begins by comparing its language to that of \u00a7 523(a)(8). Under \u00a7 523(a)(8), \"[a] discharge ... does not discharge an individual debtor from any [student loan] debt ... unless excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor's dependents.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In contrast, under \u00a7 1325(b)(1), \"[i]f the trustee or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim objects to the confirmation of the plan, then the court may not approve the plan unless ... the plan provides that all of the debtor's projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period ... will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1325(b)(1). Both provisions contain a requirement that a specific determination be made before the bankruptcy court can take a specified action (either discharging student loan debt or confirming a Chapter 13 plan). These requirements are captured in the form of clauses introduced by the word \"unless,\" which the Supreme Court has suggested gives rise to self-executing nature of \u00a7 523(a)(8).\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   274 n.11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, \u00a7 1325(b)(1) contains a subordinate clause that has no counterpart in \u00a7 523(a)(8) and that assigns a specific role to the trustee and unsecured creditors. The presence of this additional clause assigning a role to persons other than the debtor and the bankruptcy court distinguishes the two provisions. In the absence of any additional indication that \u00a7 1325(b)(1) requires a debtor to initiate a proceeding, this Court holds that \u00a7 1325(b)(1) is not self-executing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Persuasive authority supports this conclusion. Prior\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , to courts consistently held that objections under \u00a7 1325(b) may not be raised\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   ; rather, they must be raised by the persons authorized to do so in the Code: trustees and unsecured creditors.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6101371\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/68/205/#p209\">\n    68 B.R. 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209-10 (Bankr.

As discussed above, \u00a7 1325(b)(1) is not self-executing, and so \u00a7 1325(a)(1) does not provide a mechanism for a bankruptcy court to review a debtor's disposable income calculation\n   <em>\n    sua sponte.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    DUTY TO ENSURE DEBTOR'S GOOD FAITH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court offered an additional rationale for its ability to object\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   : the requirement under \u00a7 1325(a)(3) that a plan be proposed in good faith.

However, the Bankruptcy Court appears to treat Briggs's allegedly improper disposable income calculation as a per se indication of a lack of good faith.

The Bankruptcy Court erred in not considering the extent to which Briggs's proposed plan reflected her ability to pay in light of the surrounding circumstances. Therefore, the appropriate course of action is to remand this matter to allow the Bankruptcy Court to properly determine whether Briggs proposed her plan in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This Court reaches no conclusion on the substantive question of whether Briggs properly calculated her disposable income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Some authority suggests that even a \"strict mechanical application of the Means Test does not necessarily satisfy [d]ebtors' burden of demonstrating good faith in the proposal of their plans, including whether they are devoting sufficient income to their plan.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Edmunds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3821488\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/350/636/#p648\">\n    350 B.R. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648 (Bankr.

If Briggs can, in fact, pay her unsecured creditors more than her original proposed plan required her to pay, the Bankruptcy Court may properly consider this factor but only in light of the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court incorrectly concluded that it could object to Briggs's plan\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   on the basis that she improperly calculated her disposable income. Because the Bankruptcy Court lacked the authority to deny confirmation on this basis when neither the Trustee nor an unsecured creditor objected, it is irrelevant for present purposes whether Briggs's calculation was correct or incorrect. While the Bankruptcy Court can evaluate Briggs's good faith,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , it may only deny confirmation on that basis if it applies the correct legal standard and makes the necessary factual findings, which it did not do in this case.
