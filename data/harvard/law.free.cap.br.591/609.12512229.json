HARNER, U.S BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This adversary proceeding involves a failed business relationship. Robert Siegal and Lawrence Everett formed a business entity known as Farm Fresh Direct by A Cut Above, LLC (\"Farm Fresh\" and collectively with Mr. Everett, the \"Defendants\"). At some point subsequent to the filing of Mr. Siegal's chapter 13 case, the Defendants sought to sever their business relationship with Mr. Siegal by, among other things, attempting to buy out Mr. Siegal's membership interest in, and terminating his employment with, Farm Fresh. The Defendants assert that the Farm Fresh Operating Agreement and applicable state law authorized these and other actions. Mr. Siegal counters that the Defendants' conduct violated sections 362 and\n   525 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525. Indeed, the parties' dispute raises issues at the intersection of federal bankruptcy law and state entity law, and the important public policies underlying each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A party's nonbankruptcy law rights, including those under state law, generally are respected to the greatest extent possible in a bankruptcy case. Where a party's state law rights conflict with a provision or policy underlying the Code, courts are guided by the provisions of the Code, the Bankruptcy and Supremacy Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, and relevant case law. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has instructed that \"[p]roperty interests are created and defined by state law.\n   <em>\n    Unless some federal interest requires a different result\n   </em>\n   , there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Butner v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179364\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/48/#p55\">\n    440 U.S. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179364\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/48/#p55\">\n    99 S.Ct. 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179364\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/48/#p55\">\n    59 L.Ed.2d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) (emphasis added). As such, the statement that a party's conduct was permissible under state law may, but does not necessarily, end the inquiry. The consequences of that statement depend on the particular facts and circumstances of the case at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As further explained below, many of the Defendants' actions appear grounded in the terms of the Farm Fresh Operating Agreement and applicable state law. The Defendants cannot, however, use the Operating Agreement as a shield with respect to conduct that otherwise would violate the automatic stay of section 362 of the Code-one of the hallmark protections provided to debtors under the Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Rather, the Court must analyze the alleged conduct and its consequences under the Code. The Court does, however, agree with the Defendants that certain of the alleged conduct implicates the automatic stay only if Mr. Siegal is a member of Farm Fresh and that membership interest is protected by the Code. Although the Court does not, by this Memorandum Opinion, determine the validity or extent of Mr. Siegal's membership interest in Farm Fresh, the Court rejects the Defendants' position that Mr. Siegal's failure to contribute $100.00 to the entity forecloses any argument that Mr. Siegal is a member. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant the Defendants' motions for summary judgment solely with respect to the Defendants' response to Mr. Siegal's demand to inspect records and the Defendants' alleged use of Mr. Siegal's proprietary information without compensation. The Court will deny the Defendants' summary judgment motions on all other claims and will likewise deny Mr. Siegal's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 17, 2017, Mr. Siegal filed a petition for relief under chapter 13 of the Code. Prior to the petition date, Mr. Siegal and Mr. Everett entered into a business venture to operate Farm Fresh, a home food delivery business. The general terms of that business venture are set forth in the Farm Fresh Operating Agreement, dated December 23, 2016 (the \"Operating Agreement\"). Under the Operating Agreement, Mr. Siegal and Mr. Everett were to become 50-50 members of Farm Fresh. In addition, in anticipation of forming Farm\n   Fresh, Mr. Siegal and Mr. Everett executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated October 3, 2016, with respect to certain proprietary information of Mr. Siegal (the \"Non-Disclosure Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the petition date, Mr. Everett and Farm Fresh attempted to buy out Mr. Siegal's membership interest in Farm Fresh for $100.00, by delivering a Buyout Notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Siegal and Mr. Everett also entered into an Employment Agreement, dated May 5, 2017 (the \"Employment Agreement\"). The Employment Agreement contemplated Mr. Siegal's continued employment as an at-will employee, but introduced a covenant not to compete into the employment relationship. The Defendants terminated Mr. Siegal's employment on June 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties have filed a variety of pleadings against one another in both this adversary proceeding and the main chapter 13 case. For example, the Defendants have objected to Mr. Siegal's proposed chapter 13 plan, and that objection and plan confirmation remain pending. The Defendants also filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint in this adversary proceeding [ECF 94] and a motion to dismiss Mr. Siegal's chapter 13 case [ECF 63 in Case No. 17-15088]. The Court held separate hearings on each motion to dismiss on April 10, 2018, and July 10, 2018, respectively. The Court analyzed the motion to dismiss in this adversary proceeding as a motion for judgment on the pleadings and entered an Order granting in part, and denying in part, that motion (the \"Rule 12(c) Order\"). ECF 119. The Court also entered an Order denying the motion to dismiss Mr. Siegal's chapter 13 case without prejudice. ECF 78, Case No. 17-15088.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The matters now before the Court involve four separate motions for partial summary judgment-three filed by the Defendants and one filed by Mr. Siegal (collectively, the \"Dispositive Motions\"). ECF 78, 87, 115, 127. The parties have opposed each other's motions and filed supplemental briefing in support of their respective positions. The Court held hearings on the Dispositive Motions on June 5, 2018 (the \"June Hearing\") and July 19, 2018. The matters are now fully briefed and ripe for resolution. Notably, in addition to the pending Dispositive Motions, Mr. Siegal previously filed a motion for partial summary judgment in this adversary proceeding, which Judge Rice granted by an Order entered on December 4, 2017 (the \"December Stay Order\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court considers only the aspects of the evidence and the parties' respective Declarations that otherwise would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Amended Complaint includes multiple claims against the Defendants situated within two Counts. Count I is titled \"Rectifying the Unauthorized, Postpetition\n   Transfer of Estate Property\" and asserts that the Defendants' postpetition conduct violated both sections 362 and 525 of the Code. Am. Compl. at 7-8, ECF 42. That Count seeks enforcement of sections 362 and 525 of the Code and requests appropriate damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205146018\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Count II is titled \"Declaratory Relief to Remedy Defendants' Wrongful Conduct\" and alleges, among other things, that \"the Defendants forced [Mr. Siegal] under duress to sign the Employment Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. That Count requests a declaratory judgment that the Employment Agreement is unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By the Dispositive Motions, the Defendants seek summary judgment on the following aspects of Count I: (i) Mr. Siegal is not a member of Farm Fresh because he did not contribute the $100.00 consideration required by the Operating Agreement; (ii) the Defendants' request that Mr. Siegal pay the costs associated with his records inspection request did not violate the automatic stay; (iii) the Defendants' threats to withhold Mr. Siegal's pay did not occur or violate the automatic stay; (iv) the Defendants' use, if any, of Mr. Siegal's proprietary information without compensation did not violate the automatic stay; (v) Mr. Everett is not subject to liability for any violations of the automatic stay because of an exculpation clause in the Operating Agreement; and (vi) Farm Fresh's termination of Mr. Siegal did not violate section 525(b) of the Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF 78, 87, 115. Mr. Siegal's Dispositive Motion is more a defense to the Defendants' position regarding the status of Mr. Siegal's membership interest in Farm Fresh than a request for affirmative relief. ECF 127. Regardless, the Court will dispose of that motion by this Memorandum Opinion in that the issue concerning whether Mr. Siegal is a member of Farm Fresh will be resolved only after an evidentiary trial before the Court. The Dispositive Motions do not address Count II of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mr. Siegal's Member Status\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Siegal and Mr. Everett both acknowledge that they intended to become 50-50 members in the limited liability company (\"LLC\") known as Farm Fresh. Non-Disclosure Agreement at 1; Everett Declaration at \u00b6 20, ECF 123; Siegal Declaration at \u00b6 25, ECF 133.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record suggests that the two men treated each other as members at all times prior to December 2017, when the Defendants apparently first discovered that Mr. Siegal did not contribute $100.00 to Farm Fresh.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Answer and Counterclaim at \u00b6 9, ECF 7 (admitting that \"Debtor and Defendant Everett each became fifty percent (50%) members of Farm Fresh LLC\"); Defendants' Response in Opposition to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 1, ECF 19 (stating that Farm Fresh does not dispute that Debtor retains a 50% ownership interest in Farm Fresh); Email of Nov. 8, 2017, Monopolis Declaration, Ex. E, ECF 125 (requesting confirmation that, as is required for members of Farm Fresh, \"Mr. Siegal will reimburse Farm Fresh for all costs and expenses incurred by Farm Fresh in connection\n   with his inspection and copying of Farm Fresh's books and records as set forth in Section 8.1.2 of the Operating Agreement in accordance with \u00a7 4A-406(c) of the LLC Act\"); and the Defendants' Answers to the Amended Complaint, ECF 49, 50 (filed on January 10, 2018, and denying that Mr. Siegal and Mr. Everett were ever partners and each stating that they lack sufficient knowledge or information to admit or deny that Mr. Siegal and Mr. Everett each became fifty percent members of Farm Fresh). The Defendants argue that such payment is a condition precedent to receiving a membership interest in the LLC. Since December 2017, the Defendants have consistently argued that Mr. Siegal never became a member of Farm Fresh and that, accordingly, his claims against the Defendants are without merit under the Operating Agreement and applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court has reviewed the Operating Agreement in its entirety. The Operating Agreement appears to require a contribution of $100.00 by each Mr. Siegal and Mr. Everett.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Operating Agreement, Ex. A. The Operating Agreement also, however, acknowledges satisfaction of that condition precedent. Specifically, it provides that \"[t]he parties hereto acknowledge and agree that each Member contributed or caused to be contributed to the Company the respective initial Capital Contributions set forth on\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit A\n   </strong>\n   attached hereto by transferring to the Company the assets set forth on\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit A-1\n   </strong>\n   attached hereto.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 3.1.1. Exhibit A to the Operating Agreement, in turn, lists each Mr. Siegal and Mr. Everett and indicates $100.00 in their respective capital accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The language of section 3.1.1 of the Operating Agreement arguably is ambiguous. It does not clearly articulate the capital contribution as a condition precedent to membership. It likewise does not indicate within its four corners whether the $100.00 contribution was intended as a nominal recitation of consideration, whether the parties intended to be bound upon the acknowledgement of payment in section 3.1.1 upon executing the agreement, or whether the contribution could be satisfied through $100.00 in value rather than cash. Regardless, the parties' conduct both prior to, and after, the execution of the Operating Agreement suggests that section 3.1.1 was viewed, at least initially, by the parties as a technical requirement of nominal consideration that both deemed satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To counter the parties' conduct, the Defendants' rely heavily on judicial admissions by Mr. Siegal in his Answer [ECF 72] to the counterclaims filed by the Defendants against him in January 2018 [ECF 49, 50]. In that Answer, Mr. Siegal admitted the following two allegations in the Defendants' Cross-Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   5. On or about December 23, 2016, the Debtor and Everett entered into an agreement (the \"Operating Agreement\") pursuant to which each would, upon payment of an initial $100 contribution, become a 50% member of Farm Fresh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   6. The Debtor never paid the required, initial $100 contribution and thus never became a member of Farm Fresh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Siegal subsequently filed an Amended Answer [ECF 89] and Motion to file Amended Answer out of time [ECF 91], which the Court considered on the pleadings, after discussing the matter with the parties during a telephonic status hearing on March 7, 2018. ECF 117. The Court granted Mr. Siegal's Motion to File Amended Answer by an Order entered on March 9, 2018. ECF 100. As that Order explained, the Court based its ruling on Civil Rule 15(a) and a finding that the filing of the Amended Answer would not cause any prejudice or surprise to the\n   Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id. See also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Siegal's Amended Answer clarified his responses to the allegations in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Defendants' Counter-Complaint. The Amended Answer reads, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   5. Debtor admits the allegations in paragraph 5 of the Counterclaim as to the payment of $100,\n   <em>\n    and in further answering states that the absence of the $100 payment does not invalidate the Debtor's ownership interest in Farm Fresh\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   6. Debtor admits the allegations in paragraph 6 of the Counterclaim as to the payment of $100, and denies the conclusion that the Debtor never became a member of Farm Fresh,\n   <em>\n    and in further answering states that the absence of the $100 payment does not invalidate the Debtor's ownership interest in Farm Fresh\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Amended Answer, at 1 (emphasis added). Based on the Amended Answer, Mr. Siegal is bound by the admission that the Operating Agreement required a contribution of $100.00 by each party seeking to be a member of Farm Fresh.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lucas v.

It \"provides the debtor with a 'breathing spell' from the harassing actions of creditors, and it protects the interests of all creditors by preventing 'dismemberment' of the debtor's assets before the debtor can formulate a repayment plan or, in liquidation cases, the court can oversee equitable distribution of the debtor's assets.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Schwartz-Tallard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350504,4346732\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1095/\">\n    803 F.3d 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1100 (9th Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Pinkney\n   </em>\n   , No. 00-52385-C13W,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20433151\">\n    2002 WL 433151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Bankr.

Although Maryland, like many states, encourages freedom of contract in the business entity context, courts have refused to enforce contractual provisions that thwart important federal law policies.

Thus, there is no genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Based on this record, section 8.1.2 of the Operating Agreement, as drafted or as implemented, did not violate the automatic stay; neither did the Defendants' conduct under that provision. Notably, this is not to say that a party's conduct under such a provision could never violate the automatic stay or that such a provision could not be drafted in a way that was invalid. But here, the Defendants asserted their rights under the agreement in a way that neither stripped the estate of an interest nor attempted to control the interest. Bankruptcy law generally does not enlarge a debtor's state law rights, and allowing debtors to use the Code to avoid reasonable obligations under contracts they seek to enforce would distort this general principle.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Giordano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741842\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/446/744/#p749\">\n    446 B.R. 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 749 (Bankr.

Threat to Withhold Pay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Subsequent to Mr. Siegal's bankruptcy filing, the parties' relationship appears to have deteriorated. As noted above, Farm Fresh attempted to buy out Mr. Siegal's membership interest. In addition, Mr. Siegal alleges that the Defendants threatened to withhold his pay to force him to sign the Employment Agreement and ultimately terminated his employment with Farm Fresh. The Defendants deny these allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Specifically, the Defendants argue that Mr. Everett never withheld or threatened to withhold Mr. Siegal's pay if he did not sign the Employment Agreement, and therefore no violation of the automatic stay could have occurred on that basis. Mr. Siegal disputes this position and asserts that the Defendants made threats to withhold his pay on at least two occasions-once by email and once during a meeting with Mr. Everett. The email cited by Mr. Siegal is dated May 2, 2017, and states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   In consultation with corporate legal counsel and relevant state and federal authorities, we are required to have the attached employment contract and IRS form W-4.

The Defendants respond to Mr. Siegal's argument by, among other thing, emphasizing that Mr. Siegal's pay was not\n   <em>\n    earned\n   </em>\n   until his customers accepted and paid for the underlying orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, according to the Defendants, no stay violation occurred because of this payment policy and the fact that the Defendants never actually withheld Mr. Siegal's pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Defendants' argument overlooks a key aspect of Mr. Siegal's position. Mr. Siegal posits that the\n   <em>\n    threat\n   </em>\n   to withhold his pay was a violation of the automatic stay because that action was designed to exercise control over, or remove, property of the estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Courts generally find threats to take action sufficient\n   to constitute violations of the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Robinson\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-12932-SSM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20832857\">\n    2011 WL 832857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Bankr.

Mar. 3, 2011) (\"The range of prohibited conduct is expansive, ranging from informal conduct like sending letters or making phone calls to formal conduct such as initiating judicial proceedings.... Indeed, merely sending bills for prepetition debts, even without threats to sue, has been held to be a violation of the automatic stay....\") (internal citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fact that Mr. Siegal executed the Employment Agreement and that the Defendants never actually withheld his pay does nothing to mitigate the alleged stay violation in the first instance. To the contrary, the fact that the alleged threat produced the desired result might support a finding that the automatic stay was violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Regardless, the record shows a genuine issue of material fact. The statements in the Siegal Declaration concerning the May 2017 email and Mr. Siegal's meeting with Mr. Everett likely would be admissible at trial under, for example, Evidence Rules 801(d) and 803(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statements in the Everett Declarations likely would garner the same treatment. The dispute may require the Court to assess the credibility of the witnesses and weigh this testimony with the other admissible evidence. Given this state of affairs, summary judgment is not warranted and the Court will deny the Dispositive Motions as they relate to the threat to withhold pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Use of Mr. Siegal's Proprietary Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Defendants also contest Mr. Siegal's assertion that the Defendants' continued use of his proprietary information, if any, without compensation constitutes a violation of the automatic stay. The Court has reviewed the Non-Disclosure\n   Agreement and the Operating Agreement. The Court was not able to identify any provision in those documents requiring the Defendants to compensate Mr. Siegal for the use of his proprietary information in the ordinary course of business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, the Defendants' right to use the proprietary information does not appear limited to, or restricted by, Mr. Siegal's ongoing employment with Farm Fresh.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the Non-Disclosure Agreement grants Mr. Everett the limited right to use the proprietary information in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Non-Disclosure Agreement \u00a7 VIII. To the extent that the Defendants have a right under the parties' agreements and applicable nonbankruptcy law to use the proprietary information in the ordinary course of business, their continued use of that information cannot constitute a violation of the automatic stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Siegal offered no admissible evidence that the Non-Disclosure Agreement provided otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In his Declaration, Mr. Siegal points to certain provisions in the Non-Disclosure Agreement that preserve his rights and remedies against Mr. Everett for misuse of the proprietary information under, or contravention of, the Non-Disclosure Agreement. Siegal Declaration \u00b6\u00b6 23, 24. The Non-Disclosure Agreement also allows Mr. Siegal to request the return of written proprietary information and verification that Mr. Everett no longer is using that information. Non-Disclosure Agreement \u00a7 V. Mr. Siegal did not, however, offer any evidence of misuse, or a request for return, of the proprietary information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court thus concludes that no genuine issue of material fact exists concerning the Defendants' continued use of Mr. Siegal's proprietary information and the alleged stay violation. The Court will grant that aspect of the Defendants' Dispositive Motions. That said, the Court is not opining in any way regarding the extent or value of Mr. Siegal's proprietary information, whether any such value is integrated into the overall value of Farm Fresh, or whether Mr. Siegal is entitled to a distribution of any such value or the return of any such proprietary information under the terms of the Operating Agreement or the Non-Disclosure Agreement. Such valuation and distribution issues are not before the Court in the context of the Dispositive Motions. Moreover, this Memorandum Opinion does not address any claim by Mr. Siegal that Mr. Everett breached the Non-Disclosure Agreement. The Amended Complaint does not assert a breach of contract or other claim that would implicate such issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Mr. Everett's Personal Liability for Alleged Stay Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Regardless of whether violations of the automatic stay occurred, Mr. Everett argues that he cannot be personally liable for those violations because he was acting in his capacity as General Manager of Farm Fresh and is exculpated under the terms of the Operating Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Siegal responds that the exculpation provision cannot protect an individual from violations of the automatic stay and that, even if applicable, Mr. Everett's actions were not authorized by the Operating Agreement. The latter assertion would place Mr. Everett's actions outside of the scope of the exculpation provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Section 5.5.1 of the Operating Agreement provides\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The General Manager shall not be liable, responsible, or accountable, in damages or otherwise, to any Member or to the Company for any act performed by the General Manager within the scope of the authority conferred on the General Manager by this Agreement, except for fraud, gross negligence, or an intentional breach of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Operating Agreement, \u00a7 5.5.1.

The Court views the matter somewhat differently. In particular, the Court finds that the first exception cited by the Maryland Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Rosen\n   </em>\n   -the exception for extreme forms of negligence-might apply in this case, to the extent that Mr. Everett is found to have violated the automatic stay. The Maryland Court of Appeals has explained this first exception as follows, \"a party will not be permitted to excuse its liability for intentional harms or for the more extreme forms of negligence, i.e., reckless, wanton, or gross.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolf v. Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1991892\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/335/525/\">\n    335 Md. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1991892\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/335/525/\">\n    644 A.2d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (1994). A violation of the automatic stay certainly can constitute intentional, reckless, wanton, or grossly negligent conduct. Indeed, some courts characterize a violation of the automatic stay as an intentional tort.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6116014\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/177/907/#p911\">\n    177 B.R. 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 911 (9th Cir.

June Hearing Tr. 40-42. The Defendants presumably took this position because section 362(k) of the Code speaks to remedies for \"willful\" violations of the automatic stay, which courts have defined as existing where a party knows about the bankruptcy case and acts deliberately.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k).\n   <em>\n    See also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Seaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195147\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/462/582/#p592\">\n    462 B.R. 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 592 (Bankr.

The Court is not aware of any authority that precludes intentional, reckless, wanton, or grossly negligent conduct from also constituting\n   willful conduct for purposes of section 362(k). Moreover, the Court observes that the definition of willful itself for purposes of section 362(k) may, standing alone, constitute intentional, reckless, wanton, or grossly negligent conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that a violation of the automatic stay may fall within one of the three exceptions to the enforcement of exculpation clauses recognized by Maryland courts. Because genuine issues of material facts exist regarding certain of the alleged violations of the automatic stay, resolution of the issue on summary judgment is not appropriate. The Court will deny the aspects of the Defendants' Dispositive Motions that relate to Mr. Everett's personal liability for alleged violations of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

The Court will have to assess and weigh this testimony with that of Mr. Everett and any other evidence produced by the Defendants in support of their reasons for terminating Mr. Siegal.
