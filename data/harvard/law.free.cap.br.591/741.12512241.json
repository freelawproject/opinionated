PDMM is a Minnesota corporation, founded in July 1994.It is a franchisee of Green Mill Restaurants, LLC, and operates a Green Mill restaurant located at 340 South Lake Avenue, Duluth, MN 55802.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   3. Douglas E. Smith lives in Duluth and is a Minnesota resident. He is the debtor in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   4. The debtor is one of the four shareholders of PDMM and the general manager of PDMM's restaurant. He was also president of PDMM until September 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   5. The shareholders of PDMM and their percentage of ownership are:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   a. Kassebaum - 34%\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   b. Smith - 19%\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   c.

The parties refer to Russell Smith II as \"Smith Sr.\" and Russell Smith III as \"Smith Jr.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   7. Smith Sr.'s wife, Karen Smith is the corporate secretary of PDMM.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   8. The debtor organized Rivdogg, LLC, doing business as Avenue C, on January 15, 2015, to operate a restaurant of the same name in Cloquet, Minnesota. Avenue C opened in January of 2017 and closed in November of 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   9. The debtor originally owned 100% of Avenue C. He currently owns 70 percent of Avenue C. The other owners are Dave Rislov (20%) and Zack Wehr (10%).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   10. When the debtor formed Avenue C, it did not have its own bank account and its money was deposited into PDMM's account. Because of this, Avenue C's employees were paid out of PDMM's account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   11. The debtor occasionally borrowed money from PDMM by writing checks and using the company credit card. Though he intended to pay all of the money he borrowed, the debtor did not pay all of it back. He repaid $107,351.62 to PDMM. PDMM's credit card was available for the use for PDMM restaurant's management team.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   12. PDMM purchased a truck for $110,000 that the debtor and other employees used for work including delivery and other work-related business. The other company car was too big to be used for deliveries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   13. The debtor often obtained advances on his payrolls and dividends.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   14. As a manager of the Green Mill restaurant, the debtor's day-to-day duties included giving bonuses to employees and management. He used a method of calculating bonuses based on a policy at a restaurant he previously worked for. He used 10% of profits to distribute to employees and management based on their ranking in a ratio of 4:3:2:1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   15. On September 14, 2016, at a special meeting of the board of directors of PDMM, the debtor made a motion to retroactively approve a 2014 loan from PDMM to the debtor for $23,000 with interest at 5%. Three shareholders voted for the motion while Kassebaum voted against it and the motion was approved. The debtor testified that he presented the loan for the board's approval \"to help clean up\" some of the transactions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   16. Because of his mental condition that affected his memory, Smith Sr. was not able to recall much of what happened during the relevant times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   17. Kassebaum testified that he expected the debtor to inform him and the other shareholders of all of the personal loans and charges made on PDMM's account. He stated that he did not believe the debtor was hiding those charges but that he placed the record of the transactions in places the shareholders could not find.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   18. In the spring of 2016, Kassebaum and Smith Sr. agreed that an audit of PDMM's operations, including accounting records, should be conducted and agreed that PDMM would pay the cost of the audit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   19. Kassebaum and Smith Sr. retained a forensic accountant, Frances M. McCloskey, to conduct the audit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   20. McCloskey conducted the audit and issued a preliminary report on May 27, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   21. McCloskey gathered documents and interviewed individuals to prepare her analysis. She did not speak with the debtor because he was not present at the restaurant when she was conducting the interviews.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   22. McCloskey testified that in her professional opinion, the documents gathered are not easy to discern and transactions and payments were difficult to track. She opined that most of the checks written to the debtor and the credit card charges were outside of the ordinary course of business. She has also found evidence that the debtor had paid back to PDMM some of the payments made to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   23.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The plaintiff commenced a lawsuit against the debtor, Smith Sr. and Smith Jr. on July 1, 2016, in St. Louis County, MN, district court, File No. 69-DU-CV-16-2229. The plaintiff subsequently amended his complaint to add Avenue C as a defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   24. The debtor filed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on November 28, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   25.

A silence regarding material fact can also constitute a false representation as an omission.\n   <em>\n    In re Moen\n   </em>\n   , 823 F.2d at 791.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the debtor committed fraud by representing to PDMM that he did not receive bonuses. The plaintiff also alleges that the debtor committed fraud by intentionally failing to disclose (1) the payments paid to him by PDMM, (2) the personal loan he caused PDMM to incur to purchase a vehicle, (3) causing PDMM to pay expenses of Avenue C, and (5) the payroll and dividend advances that he was not entitled to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the bonuses were employee benefits and required the approval of the board of directors in accordance to the bylaws. The plaintiff does not cite to a specific provision of the bylaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The debtor admitted that he paid himself and other managers bonuses. However, he disputes that bonus required the board's approval. He stated that he exercised his managerial duties in implementing a bonus system similar to one at a previous restaurant he managed and payed bonuses to himself and other employees. The debtor cited to section 4 of Article V, titled \"Officers\" of the bylaws to argued that bonuses are not employee benefits. The provision provides in pertinent part that \"the salaries of all officers and agents shall be as fixed by the Board of Directors.\" However, the bylaws say nothing about restaurant employees' compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First of all, nothing in the record indicates that the debtor was aware of this provision. Second, this provision of the bylaws is not applicable to payment of bonuses to employees. The beginning of Article V, Section 1, states that officers include chairman of the board, a president, a secretary and a treasurer. This provision of the bylaws relates specifically to officers of the board of directors of PDMM and salaries of these officers. The debtor was paying a bonus to himself and other employees of the restaurant in his capacity as a manager of the restaurant and not as an officer of the PDMM's board of directors. Therefore, this section of bylaws is inapplicable to the bonus payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Additionally, any lack of authorization for payment of the bonuses would not constitute misrepresentation. The debtor did not conceal the payment of the bonuses. The bonus payments are documented in the financial records as early as 2008. The debtor told PDMM about the charges by informing the bookkeeper. Without any evidence of the debtor influencing the bookkeeper, what she did with the record is not his fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Next, the plaintiff argues fraud by omissions for not disclosing payments made to the debtor, personal loans to purchase a vehicle, expenses paid for Avenue C and payroll and dividend advances paid to him. The plaintiff does not allege that the debtor directly stated that he did not receive the payments to himself and to Avenue C or caused PDMM to pay for a vehicle. The plaintiff only argues that the debtor's failure to inform him of these facts and also concealing of these payments in complex financial statements making it difficult to find, constituted misrepresentation by silence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   However, the evidence does not show that the debtor failed to inform or concealed evidence of these transactions. In fact, all of the payments were in written records, including written checks and credit card statements. McCloskey testified\n   that she could trace and actually traced most of the payments from the company documents and business records. She testified that it was difficult to understand the payment because of the poor practices of the bookkeeper and the labeling methods used but she was able to find most of the transactions. Any difficulty tracing the transactions was due to the bookkeeper's decision, not to the debtor's attempt to hide the transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As to the derivative claim, the debtor did not make misrepresentations to PDMM because he told the company about all the payments through the bookkeeper. He disclosed payments to the bookkeeper. The plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to prove that the debtor made misrepresentation by his silence or took part in concealing records of the payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The debtor's knowledge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In order to assess the debtor's knowledge of the falsity of the representation, the court must consider the knowledge and experience of the debtor.\n   <em>\n    In re Moen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11535118\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/238/785/#p790\">\n    238 B.R. at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At least according to the plaintiff's evidence, the debtor has been borrowing money from the company since 2008. The evidence does not show that the debtor knew that he was not entitled to bonuses as an employee of the restaurant without the approval of the board. He believed he paid the bonuses as part of his managerial duty and not as his role as the officer of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The debtor did not know he was making false representation about the money he borrowed because he admitted he borrowed the money and he intended to pay it back. In fact, he had paid some of that money back. The debtor did not omit disclosure of information with fraudulent intent. He gave information of the payments to the bookkeeper and she made record of it. The debtor testified that he bought the car to be used by him and the other employees for delivery because the other company car was too big to be used for delivery. The evidence and testimony do not show by the preponderance of the evidence that the debtor knew he was making false representation nor did he knew his failure to disclose the payments to the plaintiff was misrepresentation. The plaintiff did not meet his burden of proof on this element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The debtor made the representation deliberately and intentionally with the intent and purpose to deceive the creditor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the debtor intended for the plaintiff to rely on his misrepresentation to prevent the disclosure of the payments with the specific purpose of inducing the plaintiff to not act to investigate and prevent the debtor from his conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As stated earlier, there is no evidence that the debtor knew he was making a false representation. There is also no evidence that the debtor intended the plaintiff to rely on the misrepresentation to prevent him from investigating or taking actions against the debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The plaintiff asserts that the debtor falsified the books and records of the company to conceal his conducts. There is no evidence to show that the debtor falsified the books and records of the company. The bookkeeper documented almost all of the transactions with notations and labeling made solely by her. While McCloskey had difficulties discerning the labeling of the transaction used by the bookkeeper, there is no evidence that the debtor mislabeled or influenced the bookkeeper to mislabel the transaction to make it difficult for plaintiff to investigate or take actions.

Kassebaum, a medical doctor, testified that he was put on notice of the financial issues when he received notices of a tax liability as a shareholder of PDMM. He stated that the debtor did not tell him that he was not making those payments.

A simple inspection of the company's books and bank account statements would have shown charges made to the company accounts for the benefit of the debtor.

The plaintiff alleges that by relying on the debtor's misrepresentation he purchased stocks.
