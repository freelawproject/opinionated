Movants filed a Motion for Relief from Stay (\"Motion\") [Doc. # 22] and Debtor filed an Amended Response to Creditor's Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. # 32]. At the August 24th hearing, both Debtor and Movants presented arguments in support of their respective positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A), (K) and (O) and venue is proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

[Doc. 22, pp. 1-2]. Debtor does not dispute this allegation. [Doc. 32, p. 1] The Motion states that a certificate of judgment was filed in Allen County, Ohio on March 13,\n   2017, at JD 2017 page 0147. [Doc. 22, pp. 2 &amp; 8] Again, Debtor admits that Movants \"did file a Certificate of Judgment (CJ) on March 13, 2017 in Allen County as alleged in the motion.\" [Doc. 32, p. 1]. The Motion alleges that the outstanding balance on the judgment is $511,789.60. [Doc. # 22, p. 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It is Movants' position that they have a valid judgment lien that attaches to all property of the Debtor located in Allen County. Debtor owns two pieces of real estate in Allen County, the first parcel on Lennox Avenue, and a second parcel on Helen Avenue. [Doc. # 32, pp. 2-3]. Both properties are located in Lima, Ohio. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Debtor asserts that the Lennox property was titled to Debtor and a third party, Robert A. Mulchay, Jr., based upon Debtor loaning money to Mulchay for a down payment on the property. [Doc. # 32, p.3]. Debtor claims that the last payment has been made by Mulchay to Debtor, and that Debtor no longer has an interest in the property, although her name remains on the deed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Helen Avenue property is being sold on land contract, although that information was not included in Debtor's original Schedules. [Doc. ## 32, p. 2-3, &amp; 32-1]. Debtor asserts that $32,000 of the $35,000 owed on the land contract has been paid. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The response to the Motion for Relief from Stay argues that: \"Before any action can be taken against this property [the land contract vendee] is entitled to notice and the opportunity to defend his claim.\" [Doc. 32, p. 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtor has not claimed an exemption in either parcel of real estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For the following reasons, the Motion for Relief from Stay will be Granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the Hearing, the parties appeared to be in general agreement that if the judgment lien in issue were valid, then the judgment lien creditor (Movants) would be entitled to relief from stay under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A), as the lien would exceed the combined values of both properties, meaning that the Debtor \"does not have any equity in such property\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under Section 2329.02 of the Ohio Revised Code :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Any judgment or decree rendered by any court of general jurisdiction, including district courts of the United States, within this state shall be a lien upon lands and tenements of each judgment debtor within any county of this state from the time there is filed in the office of the clerk of the court of common pleas of such county a certificate of such judgment, setting forth the court in which the same was rendered, the title and number of the action, the names of the judgment creditors and judgment debtors, the amount of the judgment and costs, the rate of interest, if the judgment provides for interest, and the date from which such interest accrues, the date of rendition of the judgment, and the volume and page of the journal entry thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is Debtor's position that the certificate of judgment filed in Allen County does not create a lien because it does not comply with all of the requirements of O.R.C. \u00a7 2329.02. Movants assert that the certificate of judgment is essentially the same as the ones the court sees every week, and that it created a valid lien under Ohio law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Property interests, including security interests and liens, are created and defined by state law.\n   <em>\n    Nobelman v.

Debtor states that the certificate of judgment \"fails to state the amount of the court costs, the rate of interest, or the date from which interest will accrue. Instead the CJ\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   says 'PLUS COURT COSTS', 'PLUS INTEREST AT THE STATUTORY RATE', and 'FROM DATE OF JUDGMENT' \". [Doc. # 32, p. 2]. Debtor argues that because the certificate of judgment is facially non-compliant with the requirements of \u00a7 2329.02, \"no\n   lien upon the lands exists at this time\". [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Debtor is correct that the amount of court costs is not stated in the certificate of judgment, and determining the amount awarded would require looking at the court records. While the interest rate is not specifically stated in the certificate of judgment, the \"statutory rate\" can change\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and is readily ascertainable because it is set by public statute. The statement that interest runs from the \"date of judgment\" makes \"the date from which such interest accrues\" clear from just a review of the certificate of judgment itself because it states: \"Judgment was rendered in said case on 03/09/2017 and entered in Journal Number CV Page 1521\". Accordingly, if strict compliance with \u00a7 2329.02 were required, the failure to state the amount of court costs would be the strongest basis for finding that the certificate of judgment did not create a valid lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While there is not a great deal of Ohio law on this issue, the existing case law favors the Movants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    National City Bank v.

In\n   <em>\n    Hower Corp. v.

This court holds that this same statement applies to the amount of court costs which is readily available from the records of the case referencing the certificate of judgment. Plaintiff's original certificate of judgment serves to notify the public of a lien against defendant's property located in Franklin County, Ohio. Once the public is placed on general notice of the lien, if more information is needed, it can be located readily in the appropriate court records. We find that the original certificate of judgment constitutes a valid and enforceable lien under Ohio law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    National City Bank v.

As previously noted, Ohio's judgment rate of interest can be \"located readily\". The judgment rate is set by statute, and the same interest rate (calculated by the Tax Commissioner) is used for many purposes in Ohio.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , O.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343.03 ; 5703.47. Further, the \"date from which such interest accrues\" is readily apparent from the face of the certificate of judgment, which states that interest runs from the date of judgment, and states - albeit in a different location on the single page certificate of judgment - the date the judgment was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For all of the reasons stated above, the court finds that the Ohio Supreme Court, if presented with these issues, would hold that the certificate of judgment in this case created a valid judgment lien on all real estate located in Allen County and titled in Debtor's name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, it does not appear that service on the two non-debtor parties who have an interest in the real estate is necessary for this court to rule on the Motion for Relief from Stay in this case. Where there is no \"co-debtor stay\", the protections of the automatic stay do not extend to non-debtor co-defendants.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Saleh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803352\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/427/415/#p420\">\n    427 B.R. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420 (Bankr.
