No. 1. On June 11, 2009, the Chapter 7 trustee assigned to Plaintiff's case filed a report indicating that there was no property available for distribution to creditors, and no claims bar date was ever established.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The deadline for filing a complaint objecting to Plaintiff's discharge or for a determination of the dischargeability of a particular debt was June 12, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 2; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4004, 4007. The Court entered a discharge order and closed the bankruptcy estate on June 17, 2009 (the \"Discharge Order\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 16, Complaint, Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 14, 2011, Plaintiff filed an emergency motion for sanctions and violation of the discharge injunction in Plaintiff's bankruptcy case (the \"Emergency Sanctions Motion\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Number 09-65367-LRC, Dkt. No. 21. In the Emergency Sanctions Motion, Plaintiff asserted that, on June 29, 2010, Kim Anderson (\"Anderson\") had filed a civil action in the Superior Court of Fulton County (\"Superior Court\") against Plaintiff, seeking damages related to the prepetition sale of real property. Plaintiff sought a determination from this Court that the debt asserted by Anderson in the state court suit had been discharged. On August 17, 2011, this Court abstained from granting the relief requested in the Emergency Sanctions Motion on\n   the basis that: (1) the Superior Court had concurrent jurisdiction to determine whether the debt at issue was discharged; and (2) a suit was already pending before the Superior Court in which such a determination could be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, Plaintiff moved the Superior Court to enforce the discharge injunction by finding that the debt was discharged. The Superior Court denied Plaintiff's motion, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]o the extent that it can be established that Plaintiff's breach of warranty claim rests upon false pretenses, false representations, or fraud, such a claim would be excepted from discharge. Indeed, at this time, and without addressing the merits of Plaintiff's breach of warranty claim, it appears that the breach of warranty claim is excepted from the discharge. Therefore, the instant motion is DENIED. However, based upon further development of the record, the Court may revisit this issue at a later date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Complaint Exh. C. Anderson voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice before the Superior Court could revisit the issue. Complaint, \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2013, Network Commercial Services Incorporated (\"Network\"), as assignee of Stewart Title Guaranty Company (\"Stewart Title\"), as subrogee Anderson, filed a complaint against Plaintiff in the State Court of Fulton County (the \"Network Action\").

Attorney Richard M. Howe of Howe Law Firm, P.C. signed and filed the complaint in the Network Action. SUMF \u00b6 1; Response to SUMF \u00b6 1. The Network Action asserted that the debt owed arose from a false swearing and misrepresentations by Plaintiff in his \"Sellers Affidavit\" and \"Warranty Deed\" in connection with his sale of real property to Anderson. SUMF \u00b6 1; Response to SUMF \u00b6 1. Network sought damages of $191,000 plus $102,344.60 in interest and $44,000.01 in attorney's fees. SUMF \u00b6 1; Response to SUMF \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his amended answer, filed on November 27, 2014, Plaintiff moved for dismissal and for summary judgment on the basis of \"the existence of the chapter 7 discharge.\" SUMF \u00b6 5; Response to SUMF \u00b6 5. Plaintiff also filed a motion to dismiss the Network Action on December 11, 2013, on the basis that Network lacked standing to bring the claims. SUMF \u00b6 6; Response to SUMF \u00b6 6. In January 2015, the Network Action was dismissed without prejudice for failure to prosecute. SUMF \u00b6 8; Response to SUMF \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the dismissal of the Network Action, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Network and Defendant in the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Case No. 15-cv-00827-SCJ) (the \"Federal Action\"). SUMF, \u00b6 9; Response to SUMF, \u00b6 9. In the Federal Action, Plaintiff sued Defendant for violations of the FDCPA and alleged the existence of a Chapter 7\n   bankruptcy discharge. SUMF, \u00b6 9; Response to SUMF, \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 3, 2015, Defendant refiled in the State Court of Fulton County a complaint against Plaintiff on Network's behalf that was \"closely similar\" to the complaint previously dismissed for failure to prosecute (the \"Second Network Action\"). SUMF, \u00b6 10; Response to SUMF, \u00b6 10. Defendant voluntarily dismissed the Second Network Action in November 2015, prior to a scheduled trial. SUMF, \u00b6 11; Response to SUMF, \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In April 2015, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen his bankruptcy case for the purpose of filing suit against Network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Number 09-65367-LRC, Dkt.

No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court takes judicial notice of the fact that Plaintiff's Schedule F did not list a debt owed to Anderson, Stewart Title, or Network and that Plaintiff's attached creditors' list did not include the names and addresses of Anderson, Stewart Title, Network, or HLF.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Number 09-65367-LRC, Dkt. No. 1. The Court takes further judicial notice of the fact that the Notice of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Case, Meeting of Creditors, &amp; Deadlines mailed to scheduled creditors in Plaintiff's bankruptcy case was not mailed to Anderson, Stewart Title, Network, or HLF.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt.

Defendant's SUMF, \u00b6 II. Plaintiff objects to the Court's consideration of these additional facts as being supported only by \"inadmissible hearsay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court finds the following additional facts to be relevant to this matter and that Defendant has properly relied upon the affidavits of Kim Anderson and Felicia E.

Affidavit of Felicia E. Saintil-Deltis, \u00b6 2. The security deed for the HELOC was never cancelled or marked paid in the land records of Cobb County, Georgia. Id. \u00b6 9. After August 30, 2005, Plaintiff continued to borrow on the HELOC and ultimately defaulted under the terms of the HELCO and failed to make payments, leaving, as of March 16, 2010, an unpaid principal balance of $296,226.37.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13.

According to Network's complaint filed in the\n   Network Action, the debt arose due to Plaintiff's false swearing and misrepresentations in his \"Sellers Affidavit\" and \"Warranty Deed\" in connection with his sale of real property to Anderson and a payment to Anderson by Network's assignor, Stewart Title.

Plaintiff argues that Network did not receive the right to sue Plaintiff when it took the assignment of Stewart Title's subrogation claim because Stewart Title, and therefore Network, would have been required to sue Plaintiff in Anderson's name, rather than in its own name. Even assuming that is the law, the fact that Network did not do so when it filed the State Court Action does not establish that Network had no right to do so. Plaintiff appears to have conceded that Stewart Title assigned whatever debt it had against Plaintiff to Network. For purposes of the discharge injunction violation before this Court, the only relevant question is whether that debt, whatever it was and to whomever it was owed, was subject to the discharge injunction. To make that determination, the Court need not determine that Network successfully collected the debt or speculate whether it would have renewed its efforts. Rather, the Court need only determine that any debt that Defendant attempted to collect was a prepetition debt that was not of the kind listed in \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), or (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In that regard, Plaintiff asserts that the debt Defendant attempted to collect is a prepetition debt because Anderson's claim for breach of warranty of title arose when Plaintiff executed the warranty deed. Defendant asserts that no claim arose until such time as Plaintiff borrowed additional\n   money on the HELOC and Plaintiff's lender notified Anderson that it was going to foreclose on the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In a Chapter 7 case, only debts that arose prior to the date of the order for relief-the date of the commencement of the bankruptcy case-are discharged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ; \u00a7 301(b). \"Debt\" is defined in \u00a7 101(12) as \"liability on a claim,\" and \"claim\" is defined in \u00a7 101(5) as \"right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured; or (B) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.

The undisputed facts show that Plaintiff filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case and did not schedule or otherwise list a debt to Anderson; that the deadline for filing a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a particular debt in Plaintiff's case was June 12, 2009; and that prior to June 2010, Anderson had no notice of knowledge of Plaintiff's bankruptcy filing. In opposition to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, Defendant has pointed to evidence to raise questions of fact as to whether Plaintiff borrowed money on a HELOC, knowing the resulting debt would be secured by property he had sold to Anderson and failed to make payments on the debt, causing it to go into default. None of the facts stated in Plaintiff's statement of undisputed facts rebut the possibility that Plaintiff incurred a debt \"for willful and malicious injury\" to Anderson or her property. This determination requires a highly factual analysis, and factual disputes exist on matters including, but not limited to, Plaintiff's intent when continuing to borrow funds on the HELOC and his understanding of the impact of his continued use of the HELOC on the Property.
