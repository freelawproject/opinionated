Colin Kreuziger appeared on behalf of Plaintiff and William Skolnik appeared on behalf of Defendant. This Court has jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) &amp; 1334, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7001, and Local Rule 1070-1. This is a core proceeding within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(J) &amp; (O).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this adversary proceeding, the issue is whether the discharge should be revoked for Defendant's making false oaths by failing to disclose two luxury watches in his petition and at his Section 341 meeting\n   of creditors. For the reasons stated below, the discharge is not revoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The U.S. Trustee, Plaintiff James Snyder, brought this action after learning about two Ulysse Nardin luxury watches, worth approximately $30,000, from a creditor who had seen two YouTube videos in which Defendant referred to one of the watches as \"his.\" Defendant told a suspicious story about the sale of the watches to a mysterious owner and the owner's failure to collect the watches--that Andrew Billison bought the watches in 2007 and 2009 from Defendant's company, dropped off the watches for repair in 2013, and never picked them up. Mr. Billison allegedly lived on an oil rig in Russia and had only returned to the United States twice since 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There was a question about whether Mr. Billison really existed as the addresses on the sales receipts were not valid addresses, he was unable to produce picture identification, and his phone number appeared to be registered to a different person. Now, there is no doubt that he is a real person and that he was the person who appeared at the deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The story that Mr. Billison lived on an oil rig in Russia and did not return to retrieve two luxury watches after four years is not believable. However, after listening to the testimony of the witnesses and reviewing the evidence, the Court is persuaded that it was not the Defendant who made up the story-it was Mr. Billison. He was avoiding arrest. Whether Defendant believed Mr. Billison's Russia story (which the Court doubts) is immaterial as independent witnesses and documentation show that a sale of the watches had taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For purposes of revocation of the discharge, therefore, the Court determines that the U.S. Trustee has failed to meet his burden of proving that Defendant owned the watches and thus, should have disclosed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court finds in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Plaintiff, James L. Snyder, is the United States Trustee for Region 12. Plaintiff has standing to commence this adversary proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20586\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20787\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Defendant, Craig Jeffrey Zaligson, is a resident of the State of Minnesota and the debtor in this bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    WITNESSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The following witnesses provided testimony at the trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Craig Jeffrey Zaligson - Mr. Zaligson is the Defendant and the debtor in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. He testified about the sale of the two Ulysse Nardin watches to Mr. Billison and the story Mr. Billison had told him about his work and travel to Russia. There were inconsistencies in Mr. Zaligson's testimony regarding the sale to Mr. Billison. However, Mr. Zaligson's testimony that he did not disclose the two watches in his Chapter 7 petition, schedules, or statement of financial affairs based on the advice of his Chapter 7 bankruptcy attorney was consistent and credible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Stephanie Klemz - Ms. Klemz, a child support officer for Hennepin County, testified about the child support obligations owing by Mr. Billison, his criminal history, and outstanding arrest warrants. She was credible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Bruce Crawford - Mr. Crawford, a Minnesota licensed attorney, represented Mr. Billison when he was deposed\n   by Plaintiff. Mr. Crawford was a credible witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Zanetta Diaz - Ms. Diaz is employed by Defendant's company. She credibly testified that she had called Mr. Billison on several occasions about retrieving the watches, although she did not reach him. She also testified about her handwritten notes on the back of the repair receipts made when attempting to contact Mr. Billison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Michael Strom - Mr. Strom is an attorney and customer of Defendant's businesses. He testified that he was familiar with one of the watches at issue in this case. Prior to the bankruptcy, he inquired about the price of one of the watches at issue. Mr. Strom testified that Defendant told him the watch was not for sale as the owner was out of the country and had not picked it up. He was a credible witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Karen Billison - Ms. Billison is Andrew Billison's mother and she was a credible witness. Ms. Billison testified that her son has lived in Minneapolis since he graduated from high school and that she last saw him on May 28, 2018, the night before trial. She also testified that she did not know where he was currently employed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Gail Pesis - Ms. Pesis has been Defendant's significant other for thirty-two years. Ms. Pesis testified that she was present when Mr. Billison purchased one of the watches at issue in this case. Ms. Pesis is not disinterested as she has been supporting Defendant since he lost his home in foreclosure and has an incentive to keep Defendant debt-free.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Matthew D. Swanson - Mr. Swanson is a Minnesota attorney representing Randall Seaver, the Chapter 7 Trustee in Defendant's bankruptcy case. He was a credible witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Andrew Billison - He did not appear at trial. His deposition was received into evidence. He was not credible as his statements were directly contradicted by his mother, who was credible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The following facts were either stipulated to by the parties or found by the Court after trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Case and Background Information\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1.

After the Rule 2004 examination, Defendant provided Mr. Swanson with two reprinted receipts purporting to be evidence of Mr. Billison's purchases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The receipts indicate that one watch was purchased on November 23, 2007, and the other watch was purchased on June 5, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The addresses listed on the receipts\n   do not contain valid mailing addresses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant testified that the addresses on the receipts were given to him by Mr. Billison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   25.

The original receipts were produced to Mr. Kreuziger on December 7, 2017 and bore the name Midwest Diamond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, Defendant testified that the computer operating system and software system used by his business had changed since Mr. Billison purchased the watches.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   The receipt copies provided to Mr. Swanson had been reprinted on new forms using the correct sale information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds Defendant's explanation credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   27. At trial, Defendant introduced the sales and use tax documentation for both sales.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   The documentary evidence shows Defendant's remittance of the sales and use tax for the transactions to the State of Minnesota.

On September 11, 2017, Mr. Swanson sent a text message requesting Mr. Billison's mailing address to the telephone number from which he received the call from Mr. Billison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Billison responded to the text on October 20, 2017, stating that he was not in the country in September but that he was in \"NYC,\" and wanted \"his watches back.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   32.

An omission in a debtor's bankruptcy petition and schedules is considered a false statement for purposes of Section 727(a)(4)(A).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Petersen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272536\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/636/#p644\">\n    564 B.R. at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendant omitted the two Ulysse Nardin watches from his Original Schedules, Amended Schedules, Statement of Financial Affairs, and failed to mention the watches at the meeting of creditors. As discussed above, Defendant was not required to disclose property of Midwest Diamond, even though Defendant was its sole owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Crabtree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925050\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/554/174/#p192\">\n    554 B.R. at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant did list his 100% ownership interest in Midwest Diamond on both the Original Schedules and Amended Schedules. If the watches were Defendant's property, his omission of the watches would have constituted a false oath. As discussed in greater detail below, however, Plaintiff failed to show that the watches were Defendant's property and, as a result, failed to show that Defendant's omissions were false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the story surrounding Mr. Billison is not believable and that Defendant is the true owner of the watches. The main evidence in favor of Plaintiff's position is the YouTube videos. Defendant clearly stated that one of the watches was \"his\" in the first YouTube video, posted pre-petition on May 12, 2016. He refers to the watch as \"my watch\" on two separate occasions. Defendant had no reason to claim the watch as his own in the video. Defendant also changed the watch bracelet on the watch post-petition, as was evidenced in the second YouTube video posted on March 6, 2017. There is no testimony or evidence as to who owned that bracelet and it was not disclosed on the schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the receipts submitted by Defendant following the Rule 2004 examination were suspicious, as the receipts bore the name \"Timescape USA, LLC.\" TimeScape is an entity that did not exist until June 17, 2016, long after the time of the purported sales. In addition, the receipt for the 2007 purchase lists an invalid mailing address for Mr. Billison and the 2009 receipt lists an address for Mr. Billison that does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendant explained that the inclusion of \"Timescape USA LLC\" on the receipts initially given to Mr. Swanson was due to the receipt copies having been re-printed on current invoice forms. Defendant testified, and the Court found credible, that the computer operating system and software system used by his business had changed from the time Mr. Billison purportedly purchased the watches to the time the receipts were re-printed and provided to Mr. Swanson. His testimony is corroborated by original receipts produced at trial that contained the correct name and address for Midwest Diamond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Defendant also testified that the addresses on the receipts were given to him by Mr. Billison. There was no testimony or other evidence to refute this.\n   <footnotemark>\n    116\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Finally, Defendant testified that calling the watch his in the YouTube video was a poor choice of words and that any use of the watches in the videos were for marketing and demonstration purposes only. Defendant does not frequently wear watches owned by customers and generally only does so when he is attempting to sell watches on consignment. There were times he wore one of the watches at issue, even though it belonged to Mr. Billison. The Court does not find the YouTube video persuasive evidence that Defendant owned the watches, especially with the evidence that will be discussed below. The comments were not material to the marketing purposes of the video and appeared to be puffery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff that the story about Mr. Billson's dropping off the valuable watches and the reason for not retrieving them-living on an oil rig in Russia-is not believable. There are conflicting facts as to Mr. Billison's whereabouts during the entirety of the time in question. But who created the story-Defendant or Mr. Billison?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Mr. Billison had a greater incentive than Defendant to create the Russia story and not return for his property. Mr. Billison has been avoiding making payments on a large child support obligation and has been avoiding arrest. Mr. Billison has refused to provide photographic identification, failed to comply with orders of this Court and other courts on a routine basis, and claims to live in the Caspian Sea working on an oil rig. Further, Mr. Billison made no attempts to retrieve the watches until after\n   Mr. Seaver and Plaintiff took the position that they belong to Defendant. There is simply no reason why Mr. Billison failed to retrieve the watches before then, unless he wanted them to be kept hidden and he wanted to keep himself hidden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court gives significant weight to the testimony provided by Ms. Billison that her son has resided in the Minneapolis area since graduating high school. She testified that she hand-delivered Mr. Swanson's July 11, 2017 letter to Mr. Billison in downtown Minneapolis. She saw him on May 28, 2018, the night before trial in order to take a picture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As to the whether the watches were sold to Mr. Billison, there is significant corroborating evidence that the sales occurred. Defendant submitted unrefuted documentary evidence in the form of confirmation statements from the Minnesota Department of Revenue that two watches were sold by Midwest Diamond on the dates and prices stated on the original receipts. Midwest had charged, collected, and remitted the appropriate sales tax to the State of Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   There is additional support for Defendant's position that he did not own the watches from Mr. Strom and Ms. Diaz's testimony. Mr. Strom, an unbiased witness in this adversary proceeding, testified that when he brought in a watch for repair in December of 2014, he asked Defendant the price of one of the watches at issue. Mr. Strom testified that Defendant told him that it was a client's watch and was not for sale. Defendant told Mr. Strom that the client had not picked the watch up and was out of the country. This conversation took place long before the filing of the bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Ms. Diaz began working for Defendant at TimeScape in 2013. She testified that she made numerous attempts to contact Mr. Billison by phone over several months about the watches in 2013. Ms. Diaz contemporaneously made handwritten notes on the back of the watch repair receipts. One of the notes says \"in Russia,\" which Ms. Diaz testified she wrote because she was told by Defendant that Mr. Billison was in Russia. Eventually, the telephone number for Mr. Billison that Ms. Diaz had been calling was disconnected. This occurred several years before the bankruptcy filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Thus, based on the evidence, the Court determines that the watches were sold to Mr. Billison. Plaintiff has failed to carry his burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the watches were Defendant's property and, as a result, has failed to show Defendant made a false statement under oath.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Knowledge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   As to the third element, a debtor \"acts knowingly if he or she acts deliberately and consciously.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925050\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/554/174/#p192\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 650 (citing\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

Defendant maintains that because the watches were sold by Midwest Diamond to Mr. Billison and were being held for Mr. Billison by Midwest Diamond, he did not disclose the watches at issue in his Chapter 7 petition, Original Schedules, Statement of Financial Affairs, and Amended Schedules based on the advice of his Chapter 7 bankruptcy attorney, Mr. Huffman. Defendant asserts that he did not recklessly disregard the truth because the watches were not his property to disclose. The Court agrees with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Plaintiff failed to prove that the watches were Defendant's property.
