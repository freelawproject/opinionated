FROM PROVIDING ANY BANKRUPTCY ASSISTANCE SERVICES OR ACTING AS A DEBT RELIEF AGENCY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Catherine Peek McEwen, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   THIS CASE came on for hearing on September 26, 2018, at 3:30 p.m., on the United States Trustee's Expedited Motion Seeking Relief Relating to the Florida Supreme Court's Suspension of Attorney Mark Philip Stopa, and Seeking Additional Relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the motion, the U.S. Trustee alleges that Stopa and his law firm should be immediately suspended because Stopa became ineligible to practice law in the State of Florida;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   stopped providing bankruptcy assistance services to his chapter 13 clients; failed to notify this Court, the trustees, opposing parties, or his bankruptcy clients that he was ineligible to practice; and has subsequently filed a petition for disciplinary revocation with the Florida Supreme Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, this Court concludes that it is appropriate to indefinitely suspend Stopa and his law firm, Stopa Law Firm, P.A., n/k/a Stay In My Home, P.A., from the practice of law in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As background, Stopa was admitted to The Florida Bar on April 23, 2002.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Afterwards, Stopa was admitted to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida and admitted to practice before this Court. Since being admitted to this Court, Stopa has appeared in 104 bankruptcy cases and one adversary proceeding. Of those cases, as of the date of the hearing, 14 were pending,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   with two chapter 13 cases still unconfirmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Suspension Order will address only the 12 pending chapter 13 cases. This is because the agreed upon services associated in the chapter 7 case would generally have been completed upon the entry of the debtors' discharge, and the foreclosure defense services Stopa provided the debtor-in-possession in the chapter 11 case are best addressed in that specific case under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20327\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 331.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the 12 pending chapter 13 cases, the debtors constitute assisted persons,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Stopa's law firm constitutes a debt relief agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July 2018, while 16 of his bankruptcy cases were still open, the Florida\n   Supreme Court, acting on an emergency petition for suspension filed by The Florida State Bar, entered an emergency order suspending Stopa from the practice of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Stopa failed to attend a mortgage mediation in a pending chapter 13 case and failed to notify any party to that mediation of his suspension.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because he was suspended from the practice of law in Florida, Stopa became ineligible to practice in this Court. Bankruptcy Local Rule 2090-1(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires that \"an attorney who wishes to appear or be heard as counsel for another ... must first be admitted to practice in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida pursuant to Rule 2.01.\" District Court Local Rule 2.01, in turn, requires attorneys admitted to practice in the Middle District of Florida to be members of good standing with The Florida Bar. Upon being suspended, Stopa is required to notify the Clerk of this Court of such disciplinary action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, the Florida Supreme Court ordered Stopa to provide notice of his suspension to all of his clients, opposing counsel, and courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Stopa failed to notify his bankruptcy clients, opposing counsel, trustees, or this Court that he was ineligible to practice law in Florida. Stopa's suspension from The Florida Bar is grounds alone to suspend Stopa from appearing before this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The U.S. Trustee is seeking additional relief from the debt relief agency, Stopa Law Firm, P.A., n/k/a Stay In My Home, P.A. With the suspension of Stopa to provide legal services to his clients in bankruptcy, the debt relief agency, Stopa Law Firm, P.A., n/k/a Stay In My Home, P.A., has failed to comply with the restrictions and material requirements codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20526\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 526(a)(3). Due to that, the contracts for bankruptcy assistance services are void and unenforceable by anyone other than the client-assisted person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the contracts are void and unenforceable by the debt relief agency, it would constitute unjust enrichment were the debt relief agency to retain funds paid to it by the assisted person. Alternatively, because the debt relief agency negligently or intentionally failed to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 526(a)(1) or 526(a)(3) with respect to a bankruptcy case, the debt relief agency would be liable for the refund of all fees, costs, expenses, and actual damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   And finally, these 14 pending bankruptcy cases demonstrate a clear and consistent pattern\n   or practice of violating \u00a7 526.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon a review of this Court's records as a whole, this Court is satisfied that the U.S. Trustee has met his burden of proof and persuasion and is satisfied that an order suspending Stopa and prohibiting the debt relief agency from providing any further bankruptcy assistance services or acting as a debt relief agency. Accordingly, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1.
