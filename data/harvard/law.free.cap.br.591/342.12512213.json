The Reulands' complaint seeks: (1) a determination that certain taxes owed to the IRS were discharged through their chapter 13 bankruptcy case; (2) a permanent injunction against the IRS from collecting such taxes; and (3) attorney's fees and costs. The IRS's motion requests that the complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the tax debt at issue is not dischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and 523(a)(1)(B)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court will dismiss the complaint with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Internal Operating Procedure 15(a) of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

(Adversary No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20A.%2000021\">\n    18 A 00021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Docket No. 13 at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) On April 26, 2012, about three weeks after filing those returns, the Reulands filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, along with the required plan, statements, and schedules. (Bankr. Dkt. 1 &amp; 2.) Their schedules listed $89,776 in tax debt owed to the IRS. (Bankr. Dkt. 1 at 17.) The plan proposed to pay that entire amount over five years. (Bankr. Dkt. 2 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Early in the case, the IRS filed a proof of claim which it amended several times to reflect the recently filed returns as they were processed. (Adv. Dkt. 11 at 2-3.) The IRS's proof of claim, as finally amended, asserted that the Reulands owed tax debt totaling $128,885.44 as of the date of the bankruptcy petition, $73,290.44 in priority debt for 2009 through 2012 and $55,595 in general unsecured debt for 2002 through 2008. (Claim No. 1-4 at 3.) The Reulands did not object to the IRS's proof of claim. Instead, they amended their plan to pay 100% of the IRS's priority claim and approximately 13% of the total general unsecured claims. (Bankr. Dkt. 30 at 3, \u00b6\u00b6 6 &amp; 8.) The Court confirmed the amended plan on November 2, 2012, and the IRS did not object to or appeal its confirmation. (Bankr. Dkt. 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plan provided for the treatment of all general unsecured claims, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    General unsecured claims (GUCs).\n   </em>\n   All allowed nonpriority unsecured claims, not specially classified, including unsecured deficiency claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), shall be paid, pro rata, ... to the extent possible from the payments set out in Section D, but not less than\n   <em>\n    13\n   </em>\n   % of their allowed amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Bankr.

After they had finished making all of the required payments, the Court entered a discharge order which explained the breadth of a chapter 13 discharge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Dkt. 68 at 1.) The order informed the Reulands, in pertinent part, that\n   \"[s]ome debts are not discharged[.] Examples of debts that are not discharged are ... debts for certain types of taxes specified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(C), 523(a)(1)(B), [and] 523(a)(1)(C) to the extent not paid in full under the plan[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon completion of the plan, the IRS had received $73,290.44 in payment of its priority claim and $3,424.50 in payment of its general unsecured claim, leaving a substantial portion of the general unsecured claim unpaid. (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 3.) Within two months after the Court entered the discharge order and the Clerk of Court closed the case, the Reulands began to receive collection notices from the IRS for the unpaid balance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As of April 12, 2018, the IRS asserts that the Reulands still owe principal and interest totaling $68,574.07 for 2002 through 2008, and interest totaling $1,533.43 for 2009 and 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Adv. Dkt. 11 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 8, 2018, the Reulands filed an adversary complaint seeking a determination that the unpaid tax debt had been discharged through their chapter 13 bankruptcy case. (Adv. Dkt. 1.) In response, the IRS filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (made applicable to adversary proceedings by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012(b) ), alleging that the Reulands' complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted both because the unpaid tax debt is not dischargeable pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1328(a)(2) and 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) and because the plan did not provide for its discharge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Dkt. 10 &amp; 11.) The Court has reviewed the relevant statutory provisions, applicable case law, and arguments of the parties and is now ready to rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STATUTORY PROVISIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relevant to the Court's decision are \u00a7\u00a7 1328(a)(2) and 523(a). Together, those sections establish several types of debt that are excepted from a chapter 13 discharge. Section 1328(a)(2) provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (a) [A]s soon as practicable after completion by the debtor of all payments under the plan, ... the court shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under section 502 of this title, except any debt-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (2) of the kind specified in section 507(a)(8)(C) or in paragraph (1)(B), (1)(C), (2), (3), (4), (5), (8), or (9) of section 523(a) [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).

Rather than applying the standards that guide a court's decision as to whether to void an order, the Court here must apply the rules that govern dismissal of a complaint. Specifically, the Court must determine whether the Reulands\n   have a legal basis for their argument that the plan in their case provided for discharge of the tax debt at issue. If the answer is no, then the IRS's failure to object to or appeal plan confirmation was inconsequential and the complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Lack of Specific Language in the Reulands' Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In support of their argument that the IRS's failure to object to or appeal confirmation of the plan resulted in discharge of the tax debt at issue, the Reulands cite only to\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Great Lakes Higher Educ.

In both of those cases, the debtors' plans contained specific language that provided for the discharge of otherwise nondischargeable student loan debt. In\n   <em>\n    Pardee\n   </em>\n   , the debtor's plan stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Great Lakes Education shall be paid through the Plan and Great Lakes Higher Education shall receive the total amount of $26,235.00 for its claim and\n   <em>\n    any remaining unpaid amounts, if any, including any claims for interest, shall be discharged by the Plan.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Pardee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11565842,11552939\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/1083/\">\n    193 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1086 n.5 (emphasis added). Similarly, the debtor's plan in\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   proposed \"to repay only the principal on [the student loan] debt, stating that the remainder-the accrued interest-would be discharged once Espinosa repaid the principal.\"\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   When the Reulands were challenged to point out a similar provision in their own plan, they stated that \"[t]he Chapter 13 plan ... clearly showed the treatment of the General Unsecured taxes.\" (Adv. Dkt. 13 at 7.) The Reulands did not cite to any specific plan language. After a thorough inspection of their plan, the Court concludes that the Reulands must be referring to Paragraph 8 of Section E, which provides for the treatment of all general unsecured claims. In relevant part, Paragraph 8 states, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    General unsecured claims (GUCs).\n   </em>\n   All allowed nonpriority unsecured claims, not specially classified, including unsecured deficiency claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), shall be paid, pro rata, ... to the extent possible from the payments set out in Section D, but not less than\n   <em>\n    13\n   </em>\n   % of their allowed amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (Bankr. Dkt. 30 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The only provision in the Reulands' plan that affects the IRS's \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) tax debt is the boilerplate paragraph set forth above. Nothing in that paragraph suggests that the \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) tax debt remaining unpaid upon completion of the plan would be discharged. In stark contrast to the debtors' plans in\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pardee\n   </em>\n   , the Reulands' plan is silent as to the dischargeability of the debt at issue. Apparently predicting that the lack of specific language might defeat their argument, the Reulands filed a memorandum in opposition to the IRS's reply, which stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The Supreme Court allowed Espinosa's non-dischargeable debt to be discharged not because [of] Espinosa's [specific] plan G language; the\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   Court granted a discharge because the creditor failed to exercise its rights by not filing an objection to the Chapter 13 plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Yes, the taxes in\n   <em>\n    Reuland\n   </em>\n   were non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Yes, the taxes in\n   <em>\n    Reuland\n   </em>\n   were lacking specific plan language.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The remedy for these obvious defects is for the United States to have\n   <em>\n    timely\n   </em>\n   filed an objection to the plan, and this issue would have been resolved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   In keeping with the precedent established in\n   <em>\n    Pardee\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , [the]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Reulands, through their attorney, encourage this Honorable Court to find in favor of the Reulands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   (Adv.

Neither case reached that conclusion. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pardee\n   </em>\n   held that if a plan contains specific language discharging an otherwise nondischargeable student loan debt and the creditor fails to object to confirmation, then the confirmation order is not void.

Further, the\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   court focused heavily on the statutory distinction made in Footnote 10 of\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   With this footnote, the Supreme Court eliminated\n   <em>\n    Espinosa's\n   </em>\n   precedential value for the discharge of nondischargeable debts that do not have statutory exceptions to discharge-including \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B) tax debts. The [tax debt] at issue here is nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii).

The appellate panel focused on the fact that, \"unlike\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , the confirmed plan in [Monahan's] case did not provide for the discharge of the priority tax claim upon completion of the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201303\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/497/642/#p652\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201303\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/497/642/#p652\">\n    at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That distinction, the panel held, went to the heart of\n   <em>\n    Espinosa's\n   </em>\n   instruction that \" '[d]ue process requires notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201303\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/497/642/#p652\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201303\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/497/642/#p652\">\n    at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and citations omitted) ). The absence of a specific, express plan provision thus deprived the creditor of \"clear, open, and unambiguous notice of any intent to discharge\" the otherwise nondischargeable tax debt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Espinosa's\n   </em>\n   holding and the cases applying it only when a plan contains specific discharge language are directly applicable to the Reulands' case. As both\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Monahan\n   </em>\n   rightly observed,\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   specifically held that a confirmed plan is not void if it purports to discharge an otherwise nondischargeable debt, but only insofar as the plan contains a specific provision to that effect. Without any specific language in the Reulands' plan impairing the rights of the IRS, it is unreasonable to expect that the IRS would object to the plan-especially in light of the fact that\n   nearly all plans contain a similar provision about general unsecured claims. The boilerplate provision about the percentage at which general unsecured claims will be paid through the plan cannot be construed to discharge otherwise nondischargeable debt. Absent express, specific language that provides for the discharge of such debt, the Court will not interpret a plan to do so after the fact. The IRS is indisputably bound by the terms of the Reulands' plan, but it cannot be bound by a provision that does not exist. The unambiguous statutory provisions at issue and the applicable case law compel the Court to conclude that the Reulands' unpaid tax debt was not discharged through their chapter 13 bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although not outcome-determinative here, it is worth noting that the language of the discharge order (which is identical to the language in the national form discharge order) aligns with the Court's decision. The discharge order explained to the Reulands that some debts were not discharged-specifically, debts for certain types of taxes specified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), to the extent not paid in full under the plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Dkt. 68 at 1);\n   <em>\n    Chapter 13 Discharge\n   </em>\n   , United States Courts (Dec. 1, 2015), www.uscourts.gov/file/18684/download.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   While the result reached here is undoubtedly frustrating for the Reulands, their case provides a prime example of how the Bankruptcy Code treats debts owed for late-filed tax returns. As discussed above, the priority and discharge provisions aim to balance the interests of the public in collecting taxes, general creditors from losing out to excessive tax debt, and debtors in achieving a fresh start.\n   <em>\n    Savaria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142078\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/317/395/#p397\">\n    317 B.R. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, those interests are balanced by the full payment of priority tax debt; the partial payment of the tax debt for late-filed returns, with the unpaid portion being excepted from discharge; and the partial payment of the other general unsecured debt, with the unpaid portion being discharged. The result here demonstrates that the \"statutory scheme concerning nondischargeability of tax debts reflects an emphasis on timely filing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Copeland v. Fink (In re Copeland)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071298,4227820\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/811/\">\n    742 F.3d 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 814 (8th Cir. 2014). Indeed, prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code, the Supreme Court recognized that the statutory exception to discharge for some tax debts \"is not a compassionate section for debtors. Rather, it demonstrates congressional judgment that certain problems-e.g., those of financing government-override the value of giving the debtor a wholly fresh start.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruning v.

The Reulands' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pardee\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because the plan in this case did not contain any provision addressing the dischargeability of the tax debt at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Turning to the remainder of the complaint, the Court finds that the IRS did not violate the \u00a7 524(a)(2) discharge injunction because that injunction prohibits the collection of only those debts that were discharged.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182327,6050703\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/1073/\">\n    647 F.3d at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the discharge injunction does not apply to nondischargeable debts). Similarly, the Reulands' are not entitled to a permanent injunction because the IRS is permitted to collect debts that were not discharged.

The complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because, even accepting all well-pled facts as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the Reulands, there is no legal basis for any of the relief requested.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    to 1532.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    All references to the adversary docket (\"Adv.
