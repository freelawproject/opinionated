(\"Sotera\") under the California Uniform Trade Secret Act (\"CUTSA\"). For the reasons discussed below, the Court AFFIRMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 10, 2013, Masimo filed a lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court against Sotera for, among other causes of action, trade secret misappropriation under CUTSA. (ER 77). Masimo alleged that two of its former employees, James Welch and David Hunt, took trade secrets from Masimo and that Sotera then used those trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On September 30, 2016, before the state court trial had commenced, Sotera filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. (ER 78). As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Masimo filed a formal proof of claim asserting at least $15,500,000 in damages, which was in part, based on misappropriation of trade secrets. (ER 84). Sotera filed an objection to the claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 14, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court announced its determinations on Masimo's claim and Sotera's objection through an oral ruling. (ER 2533). On July 18, 2017, to supplement the oral ruling, the Bankruptcy Court issued a 117 page memorandum of decision that included post-trial findings of fact and conclusions of law. (ER 75). The Bankruptcy Court overruled Sotera's objection, in part, but otherwise sustained Sotera's objection to Masimo's claim, finding that Masimo was entitled to a claim of $558,000. (ER 191). The Bankruptcy Court awarded Masimo $240,000 for Sotera's misappropriation of Masimo's pricing trade secrets, $300,000 for David Hunt's misappropriation of Masimo's customer trade secrets\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and $18,000 to recover direct costs for Masimo's forensic investigation of Sotera's acts. (ER 186, 189-90). The Bankruptcy Court also granted Masimo's request for injunctive relief, requiring Sotera to remove and destroy Masimo's technical trade secret documents from its computers and barring use of those trade secrets. (ER 129, 191).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Masimo has appealed the Bankruptcy Court's order, arguing that: (1) the Bankruptcy Court legally erred in its analysis of CUTSA's requirements for trade secret misappropriation, (2) the Bankruptcy Court made clearly erroneous findings of fact that certain information was either not a trade secret or not used by Sotera, and (3) the Bankruptcy Court failed to address Masimo's request for royalties for Sotera's\n   supposedly adjudged misappropriation of thousands of Masimo documents.

The Court agrees with the Bankruptcy Court and does not find that it legally erred in relying on\n   <em>\n    Syngenta\n   </em>\n   , which in turn relied on\n   <em>\n    American Paper\n   </em>\n   , in interpreting the definition of \"trade secret\" under CUTSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, even assuming that the Bankruptcy Court legally erred in stating that \"readily ascertainable information cannot be a trade secret,\" this error was not material to the Bankruptcy Court's analysis and therefore, would not be sufficient grounds for reversal. \"[T]he assertion that a matter is readily ascertainable by proper means remains available as a defense to a claim of misappropriation.\"\n   <em>\n    DVD Copy Control Ass'n, Inc. v. Bunner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"18716\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/31/864/#p899\">\n    31 Cal. 4th 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 899,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2069\">\n    4 Cal.Rptr.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20P.3d%201\">\n    75 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). Therefore, regardless of whether it was at the trade secret definition stage or the misappropriation stage, the Bankruptcy Court's affirmative finding that information was \"readily ascertainable\" would have prevented a finding of a CUTSA violation. Assuming that \"readily ascertainable\" can only be a defense to misappropriation, the Bankruptcy Court would only have committed reversible legal error if it had misallocated the burden of proof between the parties, specifically, if it found that information was not a trade secret because Masimo failed to demonstrate that the information was not readily ascertainable. Masimo points to only one instance of this occurring. (Appellant Brief at 34). In discussing whether Sotera used Masimo trade secrets to target a particular customer, the Bankruptcy Court stated that \"Masimo failed to establish that the information was not readily ascertainable.\" (ER 173 \u00b6 422). However, this was not material to the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion that there was no misappropriation because Sotera independently derived the idea to target a particular customer, without using Masimo's information. Further, this one instance is unrelated to any of the four alleged trade secrets at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court finds that the Bankruptcy Court did not commit legal error in its analysis of \"readily ascertainable.\" To the extent that there was an error, it did not manifest in a manner sufficient to create grounds for reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Bankruptcy Court's Determination Of What Constituted \"Use\" Of A Trade Secret\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For its second issue on appeal, Masimo argues that the Bankruptcy Court legally erred in its analysis of \"use\" under CUTSA. Specifically, Masimo contends that the Bankruptcy Court erred in (1) not including \"passive consideration of data\" in its definition of \"use,\" and (2) allowing a finding of \"independent derivation\" to defeat a finding of \"use.\" (Appellant Brief at 36, 38). The Court reviews this under a de novo standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, the Bankruptcy Court never stated that \"passive consideration of data\" cannot be \"use\" under CUTSA. The Bankruptcy Court did not explicitly define the term, nor did it need to, as CUTSA \"does not define the term 'use' \" and \"the meaning of the term may vary depending on the context.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Syngenta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051314\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/138/1135/#p1172\">\n    138 Cal.

The Bankruptcy Court's Findings That Information Was Either Not A Trade Secret Or Not Used By Sotera\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For its third issue on appeal, Masimo argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred in its factual findings that the following information either was not a trade secret or not used by Sotera: (1) \"custom alarm analytics\" (2) \"four breaths per minute\" (3) \"5 GHz\" and (4) \"installation forms.\" The Court addresses each in turn, under a clear error standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Custom Alarm Analytics\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The first alleged trade secret at issue is \"custom alarm analytics,\" which is the marketing strategy of applying a particular methodological analysis to an individual hospital's data in order to convince that hospital to adopt a program of new alarm thresholds and delays. (ER 156-57). The Bankruptcy Court found that \"custom alarm analytics\" was not a trade secret and that Sotera did not improperly misappropriate the concept. (ER 164).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, the Bankruptcy Court rejected the categorization of \"custom alarm analytics\" as a \"technical product trade secret.\" (ER 156). The particular methodological analysis that Masimo used to analyze hospital data was retrospective analysis. (ER 159). Masimo applied retrospective analysis to data aggregated from multiple hospitals and published the results in the industry journal\n   <em>\n    Horizons.\n   </em>\n   (ER 157). In finding that the process of gathering hospital data and applying retrospective analysis was not a trade secret, the Bankruptcy Court credited the testimony of Masimo's expert witness, Bilal Muhsin, who admitted that\n   the\n   <em>\n    Horizons\n   </em>\n   article \"explain[ed] the 'how' sufficiently for replication.\" (ER 161). Further, the Bankruptcy Court found that Sotera, through its engineer Scottie McCombie, created its own algorithm to conduct retrospective analysis. (ER 160). The Bankruptcy Court found McCombie's testimony to be \"highly credible\" and corroborated by testimony from James Welch. (ER 161). Masimo does not appear to dispute that the technical elements of \"custom alarm analytics\" are not trade secrets. Instead, Masimo focuses on \"custom alarm analytics\" as a sales technique.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court, in addressing \"custom alarm analytics\" as a sales technique, required Masimo to \"show that applying the analytical method to a single hospital's data, rather than an aggregation of data from multiple hospitals, and then presenting the results to that hospital [was] a trade secret.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20279\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Bankruptcy Court's rejection of \"custom alarm analytics\" as a trade secret was not due to a per se rule that sales techniques could not be trade secrets, but rather because \"Masimo did not meet its burden\" to demonstrate that this particular sales technique was a trade secret.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20279\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Bankruptcy Court highlighted the deficiency of the testimony from Muhsin, Masimo's expert witness, explaining that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Mr. Muhsin did not fare well on cross examination. In particular, he steadfastly but with obvious discomfort, held to the opinion that analyzing data from a single site in a particular manner is a protected trade secret while analyzing data from multiple sites, in the same manner, something Masimo allowed to be discussed in a paper produced by Mr. Welch, was not a trade secret. He admitted that analyzing and presenting data from five hospitals was not a secret; nor from three; nor from two. But just one was. There was no follow up on this testimony on redirect, and the Court, frankly, found the testimony nonsensical. The mere statement that something is a trade secret falls far short of what the Court needs to find that Masimo has met its burden of proof on this point. (ER 161-62).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court agrees. Because Muhsin's testimony conceded that the sales technique of using a particular mode of analysis on data from two or more hospitals was not a trade secret, it was not clearly erroneous for the Bankruptcy Court to be unpersuaded by Masimo's attempt to make a meaningful distinction between using the same mode of analysis on data from only one hospital. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ER 1065-69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Further, the Bankruptcy Court made an affirmative finding that \"Sotera did not improperly misappropriate the concept because it was readily ascertainable.\" (ER 164-65). The Bankruptcy Court explained that the testimony of Masimo's Joe Kiani, Paul Jansen, and Bilal Muhsin demonstrated that individual hospitals have a perception that they have unique issues or circumstances, and therefore, customized analytics would have been the only way to effectively persuade them to change their alarm management systems. (ER 163-64). In support of its \"readily ascertainable\" finding, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that \"anyone selling to these hospitals would be told the same thing.\" (ER 164).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition, to the extent that Masimo argues that the Bankruptcy Court legally erred in including a \"readily ascertainable\" factor into the definition of trade secret, that error did not effect the analysis of \"customized alarm analytics.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bankruptcy\n   Court treated \"readily ascertainable\" as a defense to misappropriation, and did not put any burden on Masimo to prove that \"customized alarm analytics\" was not readily ascertainable to establish it as a trade secret.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DVD Copy Control Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"18716\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/31/864/#p899\">\n    31 Cal. 4th at 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2069\">\n    4 Cal.Rptr.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20P.3d%201\">\n    75 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the assertion that a matter is readily ascertainable by proper means remains available as a defense to a claim of misappropriation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court's finding that \"custom alarm analytics\" was not a trade secret and not misappropriated by Sotera was \"plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    470 U.S. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 574,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(ER 138). While the Bankruptcy Court articulated skepticism that \"four breaths per minute\" qualified as a trade secret, it never made such an affirmative finding. (ER 139). Instead, the Bankruptcy Court found that, regardless of the trade secret status of \"four breaths per minute,\" there was no misappropriation because Sotera independently determined to use four breaths per minute as the lower limit in its alarm management strategy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540568\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/878/1137/#p1139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court found the evidence of Sotera's independent derivation of \"four breaths per minute\" both \"compelling\" and \"overwhelming.\" (ER 140-41).

The Bankruptcy Court found Walbrink's conclusion to be suspect because he compared Masimo's forms, which were designed to solicit information from hospitals before installation, to forms that Sotera used during and after installation of their system. (ER 153). The Bankruptcy Court found Walbrink's testimony to be an \"apples versus elephants analysis\" that relied on a \"comparison [that was] meaningless in terms of hospital questionnaire form development.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540568\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/878/1137/#p1139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When the Bankruptcy Court identified Sotera questionnaires that were a more appropriate comparison to Masimo's forms, it found mere \"cosmetic changes\" between the versions before and after Hunt's email.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540568\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/878/1137/#p1139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Masimo argues that the Bankruptcy Court legally erred in its finding that Sotera did not \"use\" Masimo's \"installation forms\" because nothing more than \"passive consideration\" is required to establish \"use\" under CUTSA. (Appellant Brief at 57). As previously discussed, Masimo's allegation of legal error is without merit and relies on an assertion of a rule derived from an overbroad reading of\n   <em>\n    Syngenta\n   </em>\n   that is divorced from its essential factual context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Syngenta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051314\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/138/1135/#p1172\">\n    138 Cal.

Masimo's Request For Royalties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For its final issue on appeal, Masimo argues that the Bankruptcy Court failed to address Masimo's request for a royalty for Sotera's supposed misappropriation of thousands of Masimo documents. Masimo requests a remand in order for the Bankruptcy Court to consider Masimo's request and decide whether royalties are appropriate. (Appellant Brief at 58). However, Masimo's argument is premised on a misreading of the Bankruptcy Court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"[I]f neither damages nor unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation are provable, the court may order payment of a reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time the use could have been prohibited.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203426.3\">\n    Cal.

A consideration of a royalty award is only triggered upon a finding of misappropriation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court found that Welch copied more than 4,500 Masimo files and that Hunt copied approximately 2,500 Masimo files. (ER 115, 118). With respect\n   to Welch, the Bankruptcy Court determined that when he \"transferred Masimo files to his Sotera computer and when he opened any of them Sotera acquired Masimo trade secrets and, therefore, misappropriated Masimo trade secrets within the meaning of the CUTSA.\" (ER 116). With respect to Hunt, the Bankruptcy Court determined that when he \"transferred Masimo files to a Sotera computer or flash drive and when he opened any of them Sotera acquired Masimo trade secrets and, therefore, misappropriated Masimo trade secrets within the meaning of the CUTSA.\" (ER 119). The Bankruptcy Court's misappropriation finding did not apply to all of the thousands of Masimo files copied, rather, it applied only to the files opened by Welch and Hunt. The Bankruptcy Court noted that \"the universe of opened documents [was] small.\" (ER 116). The Bankruptcy Court acknowledged that there was no dispute that Welch opened 5 Masimo documents and that Hunt opened 6 Masimo documents. (ER 115-16, 118-19). In total, the Bankruptcy Court awarded damages of $540,000 for Sotera's misappropriation of Masimo's pricing and customer trade secrets. (ER 186, 189).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Because the Bankruptcy Court found no misappropriation for the remaining thousands of Masimo documents copied but not accessed or opened, the Bankruptcy Court did not err by not considering a royalty award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Equitable Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   While the Court addresses the merits of Masimo's appeal, Sotera argues that the Court should dismiss the appeal under the doctrine of equitable mootness because the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Sotera's reorganization plan on May 12, 2017 (ER 4279 (\"Confirmation Order\") ) and Masimo did not object to certain provisions of the Confirmation Order and did not appeal the Confirmation Order. (ECF 37 at 57-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"Equitable mootness is a prudential doctrine by which a court elects not to reach the merits of a bankruptcy appeal. An appeal is equitably moot if the case presents transactions that are so complex or difficult to unwind that debtors, creditors, and third parties are entitled to rely on the final bankruptcy court order.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Transwest Resort Properties, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345707,6055043\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/1161/\">\n    801 F.3d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1167 (9th Cir. 2015) (internal citation and quotations omitted). To determine whether an appeal is equitably moot, courts look at: (1) \"whether a stay was sought, for absent that a party has not fully pursued its rights\", (2) \"if a stay was sought and not gained, ... whether substantial consummation of the plan has occurred\", (3) \"the effect a remedy may have on third parties not before the court\", and (4) \"whether the bankruptcy court can fashion effective and equitable relief without completely knocking the props out from under the plan and thereby creating an uncontrollable situation for the bankruptcy court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Thorpe Insulation Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731128,3871661\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/869/\">\n    677 F.3d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 881 (9th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As to the first factor, Masimo filed an emergency motion for a stay pending possible appeal of the confirmation order, which the Bankruptcy Court denied. (SER 292). As to the second factor, substantial consummation has occurred as the effective date of Sotera's reorganization plan was May 22, 2017. (SER 285). As to the third factor, Sotera makes no mention of the effect a remedy may have on third parties not before the Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 37 at 60). As to the fourth factor, the Bankruptcy Court originally awarded Masimo a claim of $558,000. (ER 191). However, Sotera's reorganization plan permits Masimo's relief to draw from the $3,325,000 set aside for the Class 6 Pool. (SER 1311). Accordingly, upon remand,\n   the Bankruptcy Court would be able to award more than the original amount of $558,000 without serious disruption to the plan. Therefore, the Court can fashion \"effective and equitable relief without completely knocking the props out from under the plan and thereby creating an uncontrollable situation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Thorpe Insulation Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731128,3871661\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/869/\">\n    677 F.3d at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because the factors do not weigh in favor of applying equitable mootness, the Court declines to dismiss Masimo's appeal on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court AFFIRMS the order of the Bankruptcy Court.
