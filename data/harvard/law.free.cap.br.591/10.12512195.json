Under Section 362(d)(1), \"cause\" may be established for the purpose of allowing litigation to go forward in another forum.

Of these twelve considerations, GLAS maintains that only Factors 1, 2, 7, 10, 11 and 12 are relevant and support its request for relief from stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   362 Motion at 9:1-16 &amp; n.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   EBH generally opposes allowing GLAS to sue for breach of the PIK Loan Agreement \"in another permissible forum\" if it means commencing another lawsuit outside of the State of Nevada.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EBH Opposition at 18:26 to 19:5. It argues that the Sonnax/Curtis Factors are applicable to a request to continue\n   <em>\n    existing litigation\n   </em>\n   against a debtor in a non-bankruptcy forum and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to a request to initiate\n   <em>\n    new litigation\n   </em>\n   against a debtor in a non-bankruptcy forum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6557319\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/40/795/#p799\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 13:11 to 14:8. Moreover, even if the Sonnax/Curtis Factors are applicable, EBH maintains that GLAS has failed to demonstrate that its selected factors establish cause for relief from stay in this proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6557319\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/40/795/#p799\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 14:9 to 17:7 &amp; n.40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Before considering the parties' specific arguments, it is useful to consider why the parties are where they are, and, moreover, exactly where they are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Why and the Where.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Under the PIK Loan Agreement, any of the participants has authority to pursue collection of the entire obligation independent of the administrative agent and independent of any other participants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PIK Loan Agreement, \u00a7 2.4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because of this broad authorization, the administrative agent under the PIK Loan Agreement was and is left in the unenviable position of herding kittens: it had and has no control over the direction taken by the loan participants, including commencement of the Golden Tree Action prior to the maturity date of the PIK Loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the loan\n   participants apparently have little or no control over the direction taken by the administrative agent inasmuch as the PIK Loan Agreement also gives the administrative agent independent authority to pursue collection in its own name in the event of a maturity default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PIK Loan Annex, \u00a7 4.08. Rather than requiring a unified approach to the collection of the PIK Loan, the PIK Loan Agreement has affirmatively permitted a chaotic arrangement where any loan participant can commence a collection proceeding in any competent court in any number of jurisdictions. This fine mess permitted by the PIK Loan Agreement certainly suggests that bringing all of the various claims into a single bankruptcy proceeding would be advantageous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the borrower under the PIK Loan Agreement has not voluntarily sought to do so and this court previously concluded that this involuntary proceeding commenced by the administrative agent should be stayed pending the outcome of the various civil actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To make matters worse, although the parties to the PIK Loan Agreement agreed that New York law would apply,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PIK Loan Agreement, \u00a7 30, they never agreed that all disputes would be resolved only by a New York court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PIK Loan Agreement, \u00a7 31.1(a) (the company and lenders submit themselves \"to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, the courts of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York...\"); PIK Loan Agreement, \u00a7 31.1(b) (to the extent allowed by law, any party to the PIK Loan Agreement also may take \"proceedings in any other court\" and \"concurrent proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.\"). As a result, the contractual latitude given to all of the participants in deciding whether to pursue collection activities for the PIK Loan was not restricted by longitude: the participants could pursue such actions anywhere they could find a court of competent jurisdiction. So the participants holding the vast majority of the interests in the PIK Loan exercised their authority under the PIK Loan Agreement to pursue their claims in Nevada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As it currently stands, the Golden Tree Action brought by twenty-eight participants in the PIK Loan against EBH and\n   other parties is pending before the Nevada State Court. Additionally, the counterclaim brought by EBH against thirty participants in the PIK Loan is pending before the Nevada State Court. As it currently stands, the EBH Action brought by EBH against thirteen participants in the PIK Loan is pending before the Nevada State Court. As it currently stands, there is an appeal pending before the Nevada Supreme Court, which previously resolved other appeals from interlocutory rulings in the Golden Tree Action and the EBH Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As it currently stands, the above-captioned involuntary Chapter 11 case brought by GLAS, joined by six petitioners that also are named parties in the Golden Tree Action and the EBH Action, is pending before this Nevada bankruptcy court. There also was a prior appeal of this court's Dismissal Order taken by GLAS to the BAP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As it currently stands, the EBH-GLAS Action brought by EBH against GLAS in the Nevada State Court is pending before the United States District Court for the District of Nevada (\"Nevada Federal Court\") as a result of the removal petition filed by GLAS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   So this is where the parties are: two civil actions pending before the Nevada State Court, an appeal arising from those actions pending before the Nevada Supreme Court, a third civil action pending in the Nevada Federal Court, and one involuntary Chapter 11 case pending in the Nevada bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Consideration of the Sonnax/Curtis Factors.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   GLAS maintains that only six of the twelve Sonnax/Curtis Factors are relevant and all support a finding of cause for relief from stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   362 Motion at 9:5-17. EBH disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Partial or Complete Resolution of the Issues.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Commencement of another federal civil action in the New York Federal Court begs the question of why GLAS should be permitted to pursue a second federal civil action on the other side of the country, the fourth civil action overall, when it already has authority under the PIK Loan Agreement to bring the same breach of contract claim in Nevada. Under Civil Rule 13, an answer to a complaint must state any counterclaim against the opposing party that (a) arises out of the transaction that is the subject of the opposing party's claim, and (b) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED.R.CIV.P. 13(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pochiro v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1754023\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/827/1246/#p1249\">\n    827 F.2d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1249 (9th Cir. 1987) (claims that were not asserted as compulsory counterclaims in prior state court action dismissed in subsequent federal action). This compulsory counterclaim requirement has two exceptions: when the counterclaim already is the subject of another pending action, or, where personal jurisdiction over the counterclaimant has not been established.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED.R.CIV.P. 13(a)(2) (A and B). In the EBH-GLAS Action, both the declaratory relief claim of EBH, as well any breach of contract claim of GLAS, would arise out of the PIK Loan\n   Agreement and would not require the addition of another party. GLAS has asserted repeatedly that it is not a party to the pending State Court Actions and it already has appeared in the State of Nevada as a petitioner in the instant Chapter 11 proceeding. Thus, it appears that Civil Rule 13 obligates GLAS to assert against EBH any breach of contract claim in the EBH-GLAS Action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hydranautics v.

This situation, however, appears to be entirely the making of GLAS and the Petitioning Creditors, who have opted not to voluntarily dismiss the involuntary case apparently out of concern for any damages that EBH would seek under Section 303(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   This factor is more neutral than supportive of relief from stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Prejudice to the Interests of Other Creditors.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Commencement of another civil action in the New York Federal Court would be for the benefit only of the minority of loan\n   participants constituting the Non-Party Lenders, apparently including Susquehanna Ltd. Meanwhile, the Golden Tree Parties and other loan participants named in the State Court Actions are subject to the determinations made by the Nevada State Court. Additionally, all of the participants in the PIK Loan, including the Non-Party Lenders and the Golden Tree Parties, are impacted by the determinations sought from the Nevada Federal Court in the EBH-GLAS Action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A final judgment entered by the Nevada State Court, the Nevada Federal Court, or the New York Federal Court may be in favor of the PIK Lenders or EBH. So far, the Golden Tree Group does not have a record of success in the State Court Actions. If GLAS achieves similar success in another civil action New York Federal Court, the prejudice to the Golden Tree Group could be substantial. Given the record before this bankruptcy court, it is difficult to assess the degree, if any, of legal prejudice to the interests of other creditors, i.e., the Golden Tree Group, which would arise if relief from stay is granted. As the burden of persuasion rests with GLAS as the moving party, the court concludes that this factor is neutral at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Interests of Judicial Economy, and Expeditious and Economical Resolution.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Commencement of another civil action in the New York Federal Court adds to the number of civil proceedings filed in federal court, lengthens the process of resolving issues between the parties, and, absent some uncharacteristic pro bono arrangement, would cost more money rather than save money. This factor weighs heavily against the instant request for relief from stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Readiness for Trial.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Commencement of another civil action in the New York Federal Court certainly would require the filing and service of a new complaint, as well as the opportunity to file a response. Even GLAS concedes that there likely would be an early skirmish over the application of the first filed rule. Additionally, even if GLAS convinces the New York Federal Court not to apply the first filed rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   discussion at note 23,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , nothing prevents EBH from requesting the Nevada Federal Court to enjoin GLAS from further proceeding in the subsequent New York action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    Butte Min.

The false equivalency of this argument, however, simply supports EBH's contention that relief from stay under the Sonnax/Curtis Factors is intended to apply to existing litigation rather than the commencement of new litigation. Moreover, because GLAS does not even suggest that it is remotely ready to go to trial of its breach of contract claim, it not only militates against relief from stay under the Sonnax/Curtis Factors, but suggests that \"a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount\" of the Non-Party Lenders\n   claims does exist under Section 303(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   That GLAS also makes no suggestion that its breach of contract claim is capable of resolution by summary judgment casts additional doubt on its current request for relief.

Assertion of its breach of contract claim in the EBH-GLAS Action minimizes any impact whatsoever from the presence of the automatic stay. Moreover, to the degree that GLAS rejects any suggestions of \"forum shopping,\"\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   EBH Opposition at 2:7-12 with GLAS Reply at 6:2 to 7:12, a solution of that suggestion is found in the PIK Loan Agreement itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As previously discussed at 17-18,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the parties to the PIK Loan Agreement agreed that New York law would apply in the event of a dispute. The parties also agreed to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of state and federal courts in New York to resolve such disputes. They also agreed that jurisdiction in New York would be \"non exclusive\" rather than exclusive. But the parties to the PIK Loan Agreement did not stop there. They also agreed that \"a Party,\" which by definition includes any party to the PIK Loan Agreement, may pursue proceedings \"in any other court\" as well as \"concurrent proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.\" So it\n   appears that while the parties to the PIK Loan Agreement accepted the idea of New York courts resolving any disputes, the parties did not insist upon it, and also affirmatively agreed to allow actions to be filed in any other court\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   even if there are concurrent proceedings in other jurisdictions. In other words, parties to the PIK Loan Agreement apparently are permitted to \"shop\" for any court that will assert jurisdiction over the dispute, as long as New York law is applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   There is no dispute that the GoldenTree Group chose the Nevada State Court to commence legal proceedings against EBH to enforce the PIK Loan Agreement, rather than suing in New York or any other place in the world.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the Golden Tree Group had sued EBH in a court in New York, the language of Section 31.1(a) would have barred EBH from objecting to venue or asserting the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   . But the GoldenTree Group made its permitted choice under the PIK Loan Agreement and, consistent with the choice of law provision, is relying on New York law before the Nevada State Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dismissal Decision at 7 n.19 and 11 n.31. Similarly, GLAS has asked this bankruptcy court to apply the laws of states other than Nevada to reject EBH's theory that the Petitioning Creditors' claims are subject to dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dismissal Decision at 6 n.15. Not surprisingly, GLAS has not suggested that the assigned Nevada federal judge is less qualified or less capable than a New York federal judge of interpreting and applying New York law to a breach of contract claim. Under these circumstances, the impact of the automatic stay on GLAS is minimal: it can fully assert its breach of contract claim in the existing EBH-GLAS Action, or possibly by intervening in the State Court Actions, with no change in the applicable law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The balance of harms is equitable in nature. In both its written and oral argument, GLAS has painted itself as the victim of the bankruptcy process and has accused EBH of using the automatic stay as a strategic \"sword\" to rebuff collection efforts rather than a protective \"shield\" to foster reorganization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   362 Motion at\n   8:7-22 and 11:8-19; GLAS Reply at 2:10-12, 5:23-25, 6:4-10, and 6:27 to 7:2. GLAS maintains that its request to commence an additional civil action in New York:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   ...is premised on the unique circumstances of this case. It is uncommon for an involuntary case to sit in a state of suspension for over thirteen (13) months without a resolution of the petitioning creditors' claims (and which suspension will undoubtedly continue for many months), and it is uncommon for the debtor to be preemptively suing creditors in state court in an effort to continue the state of suspension that is preventing that resolution.\n   <em>\n    Finally, it is certainly unusual that a debtor who never wanted the benefits of chapter 11 (like the automatic stay) and was forced into chapter 11 involuntarily would now use that automatic stay in an effort to play 'first filed' games with creditors.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   GLAS Reply at 9:10-17 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The \"unique circumstances\" of this proceeding previously was noted by this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dismissal Decision at 26:16 to 27:1 &amp; n. 69. The unique circumstances are the reason why this involuntary proceeding has been suspended. That a borrower with the controlling interest in the world's largest producer of lead would contest an involuntary bankruptcy petition brought by its lenders is not shocking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   That an involuntary petition would be filed while six of the seven petitioning creditors are embroiled in a lawsuit they initiated, in which the validity and amount of their claims are contested by the borrower, is shocking. That an alleged debtor in such circumstances would commence an additional action against the seventh petitioning creditor, in the same forum chosen by the other six petitioning creditors, is not shocking. That the seventh petitioning creditor, whose mere bankruptcy petition resulted in the automatic stay,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   discussion at note 14,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , would blame its predicament on the alleged debtor, is even more shocking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The admittedly unique circumstances undercut the persuasiveness of the various cases cited by GLAS. In its opposition, EBH sufficiently distinguished most of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EBH Opposition at 11:4 to 12:17. At the hearing, however, GLAS argued that three specific cases cited in its written argument,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   362 Motion at 9 n.9 and 11:8-19 and GLAS Reply at 10:6-11,\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   were not addressed by EBH and are most like the situation before this court. GLAS is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   All of the cases on which GLAS relies were\n   <em>\n    voluntary\n   </em>\n   Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings commenced by an operating entity in which a creditor sought relief from stay for cause under Section 362(d)(1). In\n   <em>\n    Burger Boys\n   </em>\n   , the Chapter 11 debtor commenced an adversary proceeding for damages against its landlord even though the debtor had counterclaimed for damages in the landlord's pre-bankruptcy eviction action. The bankruptcy court concluded that it did not have core jurisdiction to grant complete relief on all of the claims in the adversary proceeding and therefore abstained. Because it abstained, the court then concluded that cause for relief from\n   stay existed inasmuch as complete relief could be granted in the pre-bankruptcy eviction action. On appeal, the district court affirmed. In\n   <em>\n    Frigitemp\n   </em>\n   , the bankruptcy trustee for the Chapter 11 debtor commenced \"six different proceedings in four different places\" against a creditor that had commenced pre-bankruptcy actions arising from the same transaction. 8 B.R. at 289. The bankruptcy court granted relief from stay so that the parties could proceed with the creditor's pre-bankruptcy federal civil action for legal and equitable relief, including the debtor's counterclaim for breach of contract. On appeal, the district court affirmed. In\n   <em>\n    Abeinsa\n   </em>\n   , the Chapter 11 debtor was the subject of an arbitration proceeding commenced in Oregon under a construction contract. The debtor's international parent company was the subject of a cross-border proceeding under Chapter 15. The debtor's sureties on a performance bond, guaranteed by the parent company, also were the subject of federal litigation commenced by the parent in Oregon. Both the construction contract and the guaranty provided for exclusive jurisdiction in Oregon. The Delaware bankruptcy court granted relief from stay so that the creditor could proceed with either the commercial arbitration or the federal civil litigation, or both, in Oregon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In short, the cases emphasized by GLAS are not like the current situation at all. Moreover, this involuntary proceeding does not reflect a strategy by EBH to use the automatic stay as a shield or a sword. In response to the Golden Tree Action, EBH could have commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding, but apparently chose not to do so. If that had been EBH's strategy, the Petitioning Creditors could have sought dismissal under Section 1112(b)(1),\n   <em>\n    see, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    Marsch v.
