Although we disagree with the department\u2019s underlying premise, we conclude that, under the facts established by the trial court, there was no basis for that court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand the case with direction to dismiss the motion for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The record reveals the following facts, as found by the trial court or otherwise undisputed, and procedural history. The respondent parents (parents) adopted Matthew and an unrelated girl, both of whom eventually manifested serious mental health issues that the parents had difficulty managing, necessitating intervention by the department starting when Matthew was fourteen years old. After substantiating allegations of physical abuse against Matthew, the department loosely moni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>tored him and made some effort to support the family, but concentrated its efforts toward assisting Matthew\u2019s sister.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Matthew\u2019s parents kept the department informed about his behavioral problems and repeatedly requested help and advice from the department. Matthew\u2019s parents also sought to have him voluntarily admitted to the department\u2019s care, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-ll,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but the department never moved to seek commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>In March, 2007, Matthew set a fire that damaged his family\u2019s residence, and in June, 2007, he set a fire at the condominium complex where his family temporarily was residing while their house was being repaired. Matthew was arrested and charged in connection with both fires. After his arrest for the second fire, his parents did not post bond, and Matthew was placed at the Manson Youth Institution (Manson) under the care of the department of correction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">On February 28, 2008, approximately one month before his eighteenth birthday and while he still was at Manson, Matthew, through his attorney, filed a petition in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeking to have himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>adjudicated as an uncared-for youth. In connection with the petition, Matthew alleged that his home could not \u201cprovide the specialized care which the physical, mental or emotional condition of the child/youth requires,\u201d and sought an order of commitment to the department\u2019s care. Although Matthew\u2019s parents appeared in support of the petition, the trial court, <em>Olear, J., </em>deferred adjudication of the matter until April 2,2008, in order to obtain a social study from the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">At the April 2 hearing, the department challenged the petition, contending, inter alia, that, because Matthew\u2019s commitment would expire in three days, as a matter of law, upon his eighteenth birthday, it was not possible to identify and place Matthew in an appropriate placement prior to the expiration of the commitment. The department further contended that Matthew\u2019s parents could seek voluntary services from the department of mental health and addiction services (department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>mental health). At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court, <em>Baldwin, J., </em>adjudicated Matthew uncared for, committed him to the care of the department until further order of the court and ordered the department to facilitate his eventual transfer to the department of mental health.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">On May 14, 2008, after he had turned eighteen, Matthew, through his attorney, filed in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters: (1) a motion for continuation of court jurisdiction; and (2) a motion for emergency relief seeking an injunction barring the department from transferring Matthew to the department of mental health and an order compelling the department to comply with its obligations to provide him with an adequately supported placement. On May 19, 2008, the trial court granted the motion for emergency relief insofar as it enjoined the department from acting to change or alter the status quo until after the hearing that it had scheduled for May 28, 2008, and until further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">At the May 28 hearing, Matthew\u2019s attorney claimed that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-3,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Matthew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>had a statutory right to an appropriate placement. She contended that the department of mental health neither could provide such a placement, because Matthew needed a twenty-four hour placement with a training component to address his fire starting compulsions, nor would accept him without his first having obtained the benefits of that intervention. She further claimed that the department was obligated to provide services to Matthew pursuant to a memorandum of agreement between the department and the department of mental health, which provided, inter alia, that \u201c[the department] will serve youth in its care (committed or voluntary) until age [twenty-one], provided that the client was in [the department\u2019s] care on his/her [eighteenth] birthday, remains in school or in a work training program, and is willing to accept [the department] services voluntarily.\u201d Finally, Matthew\u2019s attorney claimed that the department\u2019s failure to provide care violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq., and the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The department\u2019s position was that the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters had been divested of subject matter jurisdiction to grant equitable relief once Matthew had turned eighteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In its September 5, 2008 memorandum of decision, the trial court rejected the department\u2019s jurisdictional argument, citing the fact that, <em>prior </em>to Matthew\u2019s eighteenth birthday, the court had entered its order directing the department to maintain the commitment until the provision of proper care was in place. With respect to the merits of the motions, the trial court issued the following order: \u201cTo clarify and implement the orders entered by this court on April 2, 2008, the court hereby orders [the department] to promptly secure an appropriate placement for [Matthew] designed to provide [twenty-four] hour supervisory care to [him] with the objective of complying with its obligation to meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>requirements of its memorandum of agreement regarding client transfers to [the department of mental health] for continuing appropriate care and services to be provided by that agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">On September 25,2008, the department filed a motion to open and set aside the September 5 order in light of Matthew\u2019s anticipated placement, pursuant to pending proceedings in the criminal court, at Abraxas Youth Services (Abraxas), a secure treatment facility located in Pennsylvania that is dedicated to the treatment of fire starting behaviors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court granted the motion in part, vacating that part of its September 5 order that had required the department promptly to secure an appropriate placement for Matthew. The court left in place, however, that part of its order directing the department to meet the requirements of its memorandum of agreement with the department of mental health.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">On October 14, 2008, in the criminal proceedings relating to the arson charges, which were pending in the criminal court, Matthew entered into a plea agreement under which he received a suspended sentence and was conditionally discharged as a youthful offender. As a condition of his release, the criminal court, <em>Alexander, J., </em>ordered Matthew to enter into treatment at Abraxas. Accordingly, Matthew was released from Manson directly into the custody of Abraxas.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">On March 13, 2009, Matthew\u2019s attorney filed in the trial court the motion for services that is the subject of the present appeal, seeking an order compelling the department to provide Matthew with a twenty-four hour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>placement and to discontinue any efforts to transfer him to the custody of the department of mental health. In effect, that motion sought to have the department pay for Matthew\u2019s treatment at Abraxas and to obligate the department to provide an appropriate placement upon his release from that facility. The department objected to the motion, claiming that the court had lost jurisdiction on the date of Matthew\u2019s eighteenth birthday. It further claimed that the department provides only <em>voluntary </em>services pursuant to \u00a7 17a-ll to persons after they attain the age of eighteen and that it has no obligation to provide Matthew with such services because he has a felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In its May 21, 2009 decision granting the motion for services, the trial court chronicled in detail Matthew\u2019s troubled history, his parents\u2019 efforts to obtain assistance from the department, the department\u2019s failure to provide Matthew with appropriate services and the previous court orders vesting the department with certain responsibilities toward Matthew. In light of these facts, the court determined that it was appropriate to order the following relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, the department would have a continuing obligation to monitor and support Matthew while he attended the program at Abraxas. Second, although the department would have no obligation to provide services from the department of mental health to Matthew during his residence at Abraxas, if Matthew successfully completed that treatment, the department would have a continuing obligation thereafter to provide necessary services, which might require the department of mental health\u2019s participation consistent with the agreement between the two agencies. Matthew would remain under the department\u2019s care, if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>so chose, until the age of twenty-one, unless the department concluded that Matthew would not benefit from its continuing support and care. Third, the department was obligated to pay the expenses incurred in Matthew\u2019s treatment, beginning with his treatment at Abraxas and until he no longer was in the department\u2019s care, subject to any right of recoupment that the department might have from him or his parents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As authority for ordering such relief, the trial court cited General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-10 (a), 17a-ll (g) and 17a-15 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The department\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s order granting the motion for services followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On appeal, the department contends that: (1) because the jurisdiction of the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters is limited to adjudicating matters involving a child or youth, the trial court was divested of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>once Matthew turned eighteen; (2) neither \u00a7 17a-ll, on which the trial court relied, nor \u00a7 46b-129 (j), on which the trial court did not rely<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but which sets forth the procedures that follow commitment of a child or youth to the department\u2019s care, provides a jurisdictional basis and authority under the facts of this case to order the department to pay for services;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (3) sovereign immunity barred the court from ordering the department to pay monetary damages; and (4) various defects in the underlying proceedings violated the department\u2019s right to fundamental fairness. With respect to the department\u2019s jurisdictional arguments, Matthew and the respondent father contend that the department is not entitled to review of these claims because they are either untimely or moot. They further claim that, because Matthew was committed to the department\u2019s care before he was eighteen years old, the trial court properly exercised continuing jurisdiction. We conclude that, although Matthew\u2019s age was not a per se bar to the trial court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, in light of the facts presented to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>court, neither \u00a7 17a-ll nor \u00a7 46b-129 provided a basis for jurisdiction over the motion for services.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Before turning to the department\u2019s jurisdictional claims, we dispose of the threshold issue raised by Matthew and his father as to whether the department is entitled to review of these claims. They contend that, although the department casts its appeal as arising from the May 21, 2009 order granting the motion for services, the department actually is challenging the April 2, 2008 order committing Matthew to the care of the department. Matthew and his father therefore contend that this appeal is untimely.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> They further contend that, because this court cannot afford the department the relief it seeks, which they characterize as seeking to void the department\u2019s obligation to Matthew once he was committed to its care, the appeal is moot. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">It is clear that the department has not challenged the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to enter the original order of commitment. As we previously have noted, the court\u2019s April, 2008 order committed Matthew to the care of the department and, in essence, ordered the department to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>facilitate a referral to the department of mental health. Indeed, the trial court stated that it expected the department\u2019s role \u201cwill be short-lived.\u201d Although the court\u2019s September 5, 2008 memorandum of decision in response to Matthew\u2019s motion for continuing jurisdiction and for emergency relief had ordered the department \u201cto promptly secure an appropriate placement for [Matthew] designed to provide [twenty-four] hour supervisory care to [him],\u201d that portion of the decision thereafter was vacated by the court on September 25, 2008. Accordingly, the only standing obligation imposed on the department was to facilitate Matthew\u2019s transfer to the department of mental health \u201cfor continuing appropriate care and services to be provided by <em>that </em>agency.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">On appeal, the department challenges whether the trial court had jurisdiction to impose an obligation on the department to provide <em>and pay for </em>Matthew\u2019s placement from the age of eighteen until the age of twenty-one, including the treatment at Abraxas. That obligation was fixed only after the court\u2019s May 21, 2009 order on the motion for services. Therefore, the department\u2019s appeal is not untimely. For similar reasons, the appeal also is not moot, as a decision in the department\u2019s favor would reheve it of that obligation. See <em>In re Jorden R., </em>293 Conn. 539, 556, 979 A.2d 469 (2009) (\u201c[i]n determining mootness, the dispositive question is whether a successful appeal would benefit the plaintiff or defendant in any way\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">We therefore turn to whether the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction in the present case. The department makes two interrelated claims: (1) that the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters was divested of jurisdiction once Matthew turned eighteen because \u201cjuvenile matters\u201d only include matters pertaining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>individuals under the age of eighteen; and (2) that neither \u00a7 17a-ll nor \u00a7 46b-129 provided the court with a statutory basis for jurisdiction to order the department to provide services to persons beyond the age of eighteen. We conclude that, although the jurisdiction of the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters does not necessarily cease when a youth committed to the department turns eighteen, in the present case, the trial court did not have jurisdiction because Matthew neither alleged nor established the requirements of either statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Before turning to the merits of this appeal, we note the settled principles that guide our review. \u201c[A] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, [and therefore] our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>291 Conn. 307, 314, 968 A.2d 396 (2009). Moreover, our analysis of the court\u2019s jurisdiction in the current case requires us to examine the scope and effect of several statutory schemes. In making such determinations, we are guided by fundamental principles of statutory construction. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Testa </em>v. <em>Geressy, </em>286 Conn. 291, 308, 943 A.2d 1075 (2008) (\u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>sented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 314-15. \u201cAlthough related, the court\u2019s authority to act pursuant to a statute is different from its subject matter jurisdiction. The power of the court to hear and determine, which is implicit in jurisdiction, is not to be confused with the way in which that power must be exercised in order to comply with the terms of the statute. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Mars, </em>138 Conn. 593, 601, 87 A.2d 388 (1952).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 728, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999). Moreover, \u201c[although it is a critical prerequisite to any court\u2019s involvement in a case, we repeatedly have held that, when \u2018a decision as to whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is required, every presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged.\u2019 <em>Demar v. Open Space &amp; Conservation Commission, </em>211 Conn. 416, 425, 559 A.2d 1103 (1989); see also <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>246 Conn. 514, 533, 717 A.2d 1161 (1998) (noting \u2018the long recognized presumption in favor of appellate jurisdiction\u2019).\u201d <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02, </em>293 Conn. 247, 254, 977 A.2d 166 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We first turn to the department\u2019s claim that the trial court was divested of jurisdiction when Matthew turned eighteen because, at that point in time, the case ceased to be a \u201cjuvenile matter.\u201d In essence, the department relies on the provision defining juvenile matters; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121 (a);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as setting the limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>of the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Specifically, the department emphasizes that this provision addresses proceedings relating to the care and custody of a \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cyouth,\u201d who by definition are under the age of eighteen. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (1) and (2). We disagree with the department that this delineation is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Resolution of this claim largely is explained by an examination of the history of the statutory scheme that governs the operation of the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters. Although at one time, the Juvenile Court was a separate and independent court, \u201c[i]n 1978, the General Assembly enacted General Statutes \u00a7 51-164s, which merged the Juvenile Court and the Superior Court in order to maximize the efficiency of scarce judicial resources. Under \u00a7 51-164s, \u2018[t]he [S]uperior [C]ourt shall be the sole court of original jurisdiction for <em>all causes of action, </em>except such actions over which the courts of probate have original jurisdiction, as provided by statute. All jurisdiction heretofore conferred upon and exercised by the [C]ourt of [C]ommon [P]leas and the [J]uvenile [C]ourt prior to July 1, 1978 shall be transferred to the [S]uperior [C]ourt on July 1, 1978.\u2019 By this enactment, the legislature vested in the Superior Court the jurisdiction that had until then resided in the Juvenile Court. All juvenile matters now come under the administrative umbrella of the family division of the Superior Court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>206 Conn. 323, 328, 537 A.2d 483 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>263 Conn. 1, 4 n.9, 818 A.2d 1 (2003) (\u201cThis state has a unified court system. Thus, all criminal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>civil matters, including juvenile matters, fall within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Superior Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">As a result of this merger, \u201cwe have concluded that the issue of juvenile \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 is not a question of subject matter jurisdiction, but rather more a question of venue.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel C., </em>245 Conn. 93, 108 n.17, 715 A.2d 652 (1998); accord <em>State v. Kelley, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 329 (\u201c[r]ather than implicating subject matter jurisdiction, issues relating to transfers between the juvenile and the regular criminal docket involve considerations that are analogous to those of the law of venue\u201d). \u201cWhile jurisdiction is the power and authority of the court to act, venue is the place where the power to adjudicate is to be exercised, that is, the place where the suit may or should be heard. The requirements of jurisdiction are grounded in the state\u2019s inherent judicial power, while the requirements of venue are grounded in convenience to litigants. Venue does not involve a jurisdictional question but rather a procedural one, and thus is a matter that goes to process rather than substantive rights.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>282 Conn. 791, 814, 925 A.2d 292 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Although this court has recognized these broad principles, it has not applied them to the precise question before us in the present case, namely, the limits of the jurisdiction of the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters after a youth committed to the department\u2019s care has turned eighteen. In reliance on the aforementioned principles, however, the Appellate Court has answered that question in favor of jurisdiction in a case raising a similar issue. In <em>In re Shonna K., 77 </em>Conn. App. 246, 255, 822 A.2d 1009 (2003), that court rejected the commissioner of children and families\u2019 contention that the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters lacked jurisdiction to enforce an agreement to provide an appropriate placement to a youth committed to the department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>care, executed between that youth and the department before she had turned eighteen, after that youth had turned eighteen. The Appellate Court explained: \u201c[T]he language [of \u00a7 51-146s] . . . expressly confers to the Superior Court all jurisdiction that previously had been held by the Juvenile Court. Furthermore, [General Statutes] \u00a7 51-164t, which authorizes the Superior Court to be separated into divisions, in part to maximize efficiency and to provide the highest standard of justice, makes no mention of splitting jurisdiction among the various divisions. The chief court administrator is authorized to assign to each division as many judges as deemed advisable in the best interest of court business. ... In those statutes, there is no indication that the legislature intended that the Juvenile Matters session would have a separate and distinct jurisdiction from that of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\u201cOur review of the legislative history of \u00a7 51-164s similarly reveals that the goal of the legislature was \u2018to combine the trial jurisdiction which is now spread between the Superior Court, the Court of Common Pleas and the Juvenile Court into one [c]ourt . . . the Superior Court.\u2019 19 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7,1976 Sess., p. 2862, remarks of Representative James T. Healey. This combination would result in the \u2018more effective utilization of available manpower.\u2019 Id., p. 2863. \u2018Although the bill provides for divisions, it in no way inhibits or limits the jurisdictional power of each of the [j]udges, and, therefore, if he ran out of one particular grouping of business, he could then shift gears into another group.\u2019 19 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1976 Sess., p. 3259, remarks of Representative Healey. Senator David H. Neiditz summarized the legislation by stating: \u2018[T]he thrust of this bill, the reason for this bill, is to provide for the unification, simplification, flexibility and effective responsible control of the administration of the court of the [s]tate of Connecticut. . . . The main defect of the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>system is the waste of judicial personnel .... This waste is caused by ill-defined jurisdictional lines causing duplication of efforts. Piecemeal handling of single controversies simultaneously in different courts compounds the problem.\u2019 19 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1976 Sess., p. 2652, remarks of Senator Neiditz. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\u201cWe conclude, on the basis of our review of the case law, applicable statutes and legislative history, that subject matter jurisdiction over juvenile cases in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters ... is not separate and distinct from the general subject matter jurisdiction of the Superior Court. . . . Instead, the question of whether the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters was the proper forum was one of venue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 332.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>In re Shonna K, </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 254-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Although the department attempts to distinguish <em>In re Shonna K. </em>from the present case by virtue of the fact that there was an underlying agreement that had provided the basis for jurisdiction over the case, we disagree that this factual distinction bears on the question of whether, <em>as long as there is some proper jurisdictional basis for the subject matter of the action, </em>the mere age of the party seeking relief divests the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters of jurisdiction. We find the Appellate Court\u2019s thorough reasoning in <em>In re Shonna K </em>rejecting such a proposition to be persuasive. Therefore, on the basis of the examination of the text and legislative history of the relevant statutory scheme by both this court in <em>Kelley </em>and the Appellate Court in <em>In re Shonna K, </em>we conclude that the trial court did not lose jurisdiction merely because Matthew had turned eighteen. Although, as an administrative matter, the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters ordinarily does not entertain matters concerning persons beyond the age of eighteen; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 328-29; these precedents indicate that it enjoys the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>breadth of <em>jurisdiction </em>as <em>any </em>session of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Having concluded that the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters is not divested of jurisdiction merely because the party seeking relief has turned eighteen, we must nonetheless determine whether the trial court had a proper statutory<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> basis on which to exercise jurisdiction to issue the contested order in the present case. The department contends that the statutory basis on which the trial court claimed to exercise jurisdiction, \u00a7 17a-ll (g), was not proper because that section simply vests the commissioner of children and families (commissioner) with <em>discretion </em>to provide <em>voluntary </em>services. It further contends that, although \u00a7 46b-129 (j) addresses circumstances under which the department may provide services to persons age eighteen to twenty-one who were committed to its care prior to their eighteenth birthday, that provision simply acknowledges the department\u2019s authority and not the court\u2019s jurisdiction. We agree with the department\u2019s first contention, but disagree with its claim, as a general matter, regarding \u00a7 46b-129 (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the <em>type of controversy </em>presented by the action before it.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bayer </em>v. <em>Showmotion, Inc., </em>292 Conn. 381, 386, 973 A.2d 1229 (2009); see also <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 4, 675 A.2d 845 (1996) (\u201cJurisdiction of the subject-matter is the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>[of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. . . . A court has subject matter jurisdiction if it has the authority to adjudicate a particular type of legal controversy.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). Similarly, this court has long recognized that the Superior Court \u201chas jurisdiction of all matters expressly committed to it and all others cognizable by any law court of which the exclusive jurisdiction is not given to some other court. The fact that no other court has exclusive jurisdiction in any matter is sufficient to give the Superior Court jurisdiction over that matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Joshua S., </em>260 Conn. 182, 215, 796 A.2d 1141 (2002); see General Statutes \u00a7 51-164s (\u201c[t]he Superior Court shall be the sole court of original jurisdiction for all causes of action, except such actions over which the courts of probate have original jurisdiction, as provided by statute\u201d). Accordingly, whether a division of the Superior Court, such as the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters, can exercise jurisdiction depends upon whether there exists a valid and cognizable cause of action, or matter, over which jurisdiction has not been vested in some other court.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We therefore turn to the relevant statutory framework. Pursuant to \u00a7 17a-10 (a), \u201c[a]ny child committed to the department by the Superior Court shall be deemed to be within the custody of the commissioner until such commitment has been terminated.\u201d Section 46b-121 (b) (1) provides the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters with, inter alia, the \u201cauthority to make and enforce such orders ... as the court deems necessary or appropriate to secure the welfare, protection, proper care and suitable support of a child or youth subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction or otherwise committed to or in the custody of the [commissioner], ...\u201d These provisions indicate that the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters retains jurisdiction over any individual it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>committed to the department as long as that commitment is in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Sections 17a-ll and 46b-129 provide two different statutory avenues by which a child or youth may come within the care or commitment of the department and thereafter may obtain services after the age of eighteen. See <em>In re Darien S., </em>82 Conn. App. 169, 176, 842 A.2d 1177 (\u201cthe legislature has implemented a permanency planning process for all children in its custody, including those who are admitted voluntarily; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-11 [d] . . . [or] adjudicated as neglected or dependent; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 [k]\u201d), cert. denied, 269 Conn. 904, 852 A.2d 733 (2004). Section 17a-ll provides for voluntary services and vests the commissioner with discretion to admit to the department on a voluntary basis any child or youth who can benefit from the department\u2019s services. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-ll (a). This statute further provides that \u201cany person already under the care and supervision of the [commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 17a-ll (a)] who has passed such person\u2019s eighteenth birthday but has not yet reached such person\u2019s twenty-first birthday may be permitted to remain voluntarily under the supervision of the commissioner, provided the commissioner, <em>in the commissioner\u2019s discretion, </em>determines that such person would benefit from further care and support from the [department].\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 17a-ll (g). Although the trial court cited to \u00a7 17a-ll as the basis for its jurisdiction to compel the department to pay for and provide services, Matthew and his father properly have conceded that this section is inapplicable in the present case because Matthew was never admitted to the department through the voluntary services program. Indeed, the department rejected such a request from Matthew\u2019s parents prior to Matthew\u2019s eighteenth birthday; see footnote 4 of this opinion; and Matthew\u2019s father concedes that they did not pursue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>administrative remedy available by statute upon such a denial. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-ll (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Instead, Matthew was committed to the department as an uncared-for youth pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129. We therefore focus our inquiry on whether that statute provided a basis for the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction in this case. That section provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon finding and adjudging that any child or youth is uncared-for, neglected or dependent, the court may commit such child or youth to the [commissioner]. Such commitment shall remain in effect <em>until further order of the court </em>. . . . <em>The commissioner shall be the guardian of such child or youth for the duration of the commitment, provided </em>the child or youth has not reached the age of eighteen years or, <em>in the case of a child or youth in full-time attendance in a secondary school, a technical school, a college or a state-accredited job training program, provided such child or youth has not reached the age of twenty-one years, by consent of such youth </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 a).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The language of \u00a7 46b-129 (j), especially the use of the terms commitment and guardianship, referring both to youths younger than eighteen and individuals older than eighteen who meet the other statutory requirements, strongly indicates that a youth\u2019s commitment to the department may continue beyond the age of eighteen. Our review of the legislative histoiy of \u00a7 46b-129 (j) further supports this interpretation. The language concerning committed youths beyond the age of eighteen was added in 1973 in order to correct an unintended effect of the majority age bill passed the previous year. 16 H.R. Proc., Pt. 14, 1973 Sess., p. 7124, remarks of Representative Joseph S. Coatsworth. That bill, which had lowered the age of majority from twenty-one to eighteen, also had removed \u201cthe provision in the statutes which allow[ed] for orphans and wards of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>state and other dependent children in Connecticut . . . to at least finish high school or if they were in college, continue in college until the age of twenty-one.\u201d Id. The legislature therefore passed the bill and amended \u00a7 46b-129 (j) to allow individuals between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one who are enrolled in one of the specified educational or vocational institutions to continue to receive support from the state. Id., p. 7152; see Public Acts 1973, No. 73-625, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The department contends that despite the language of \u00a7 46b-129 (j), the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters is divested of jurisdiction when a committed youth turns eighteen because at that time he or she becomes an adult, and the department\u2019s guardianship therefore ends. The department also makes a related claim that, although \u00a7 46b-129 (j) mandates the provision of services to persons beyond the age of eighteen who qualify under the statute, it merely is a grant of <em>authority </em>to the <em>department </em>to provide such services and does not confer <em>jurisdiction </em>on the court to compel the department to provide such services. In support of these claims, the department suggests that the proper means for enforcing the department\u2019s financial obligation is to challenge the department\u2019s actions in an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">As we previously have stated, the language of \u00a7 46b-129 (j) contradicts the department\u2019s first contention, and it has pointed to nothing in the text of that statute that supports its second claim. Moreover, as to the first claim, it is true that, once a youth becomes an adult, he or she must consent to continued commitment to the department. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (j). This does not, however, alter the department\u2019s <em>obligation </em>to individuals beyond the age of eighteen who elect to remain in its custody. Regarding the second claim, the department fails to explain why, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that its relationship to a youth who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>turns eighteen is limited to providing financial assistance, such an obligation would not provide a jurisdictional basis in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters. Unlike \u00a7 17a-ll, which explicitly provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner denying voluntary services may appeal such decision through an administrative hearing held pursuant to chapter 54\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-ll (f); nothing in \u00a7 46b-129 requires persons aggrieved under that section to exhaust administrative remedies. Accordingly, in light of the well established presumption in favor of subject matter jur isdiction; <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02, </em>supra, 293 Conn. 254; we conclude, that, under the conditions set forth pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (j), the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters may exercise jurisdiction after a committed youth has turned eighteen.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">This conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry, because we must determine whether \u00a7 46b-129 (j) provided a basis for jurisdiction in the present case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>section applies to individuals beyond the age of eighteen only when they have been committed to the department\u2019s care prior to the age of eighteen <em>and, </em>once attaining the age of eighteen, are enrolled full-time in secondary school, technical school, college or a state-accredited job training program. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (j). With respect to that issue, Matthew has made an assertion in his brief to this court that he was a full-time special education student who continued taking classes prior to, during and following his release from incarceration, and therefore was qualified to receive assistance under \u00a7 46b-129 (j). Significantly, however, he neither alleged nor offered evidence to the trial court of that fact generally or of the specific jurisdictional fact that he was enrolled in any one of the institutions specified under the statute. It is well established that unsupported representations of counsel do not constitute evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>205 Conn. 578, 585, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987). Indeed, Matthew\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument that the trial court had made no finding of facts concerning Matthew\u2019s enrollment in any such institution. We therefore conclude that Matthew failed to establish the factual predicate required for jurisdiction under \u00a7 46b-129 (j), and, accordingly, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the matter. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sunrise Herbal Remedies, Inc., </em>296 Conn. 556, 576, 2 A.3d 843 (2010) (concluding that trial court had jurisdiction over matter because state met statutory requirements for cause of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The decision is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the petitioner\u2019s motion for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In this opinion NORCOTT, VERTEFEUILLE and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\"> The department appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\"> The department contends that the trial court improperly relied on unsworn statements by Matthew\u2019s attorney as the basis for its factual findings that the department had failed to adequately assess and respond to Matthew\u2019s needs.

Accordingly, we need not address the department\u2019s claim that, because this statute allows financial recovery against the department, it is essentially a statute in derogation of sovereign immunity and thus must be construed narrowly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> Although we conclude that the trial court lacked <em>jurisdiction </em>over Matthew\u2019s petition, we acknowledge that there exists a line of cases that suggests that the question before us should be framed as whether the trial court had the <em>authority </em>to decide this case. See, e.g., <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 728; <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 545, 590 A.2d 914 (1991). The discrepancy between those cases and the cases we follow, holding that the question is jurisdictional; see, e.g., <em>Bayer </em>v. <em>Showmotion, </em>Inc., supra, 292 Conn. 386; <em>Figueroa v.C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 4; is troubling. Nonetheless, the present case is not the proper occasion to reconcile this discrepancy because neither party primarily frames its claims as implicating the <em>authority </em>of the Superior Court. Moreover, the peculiar procedural posture of the present case, particularly the fact that neither Matthew nor his father initially framed the underlying cause of action as arising under \u00a7 46b-129 (j), convinces us that our analysis is best focused on the jurisdictional inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\"> Matthew also claims that the department was bound to provide him with services by virtue of its memorandum of agreement with the department of mental health. Matthew does not, however, provide any reasoning or support for this assertion, or any explanation for how it would impact our analysis of the jurisdictional question. We therefore decline to review it. See, e.g., <em>Woodrow Wilson of Middletown, LLC </em>v. <em>Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, </em>294 Conn. 639, 643 n.4, 986 A.2d 271 (2010) (\u201c[T]he plaintiff does little more than provide this conclusory assertion with regard to this claim.

J., with whom PALMER, J., joins,</author>\n<p id=\"A7W\">concurring. The majority concludes that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the claim of the petitioner, Matthew F., that he was entitled to an order compelling the department of children and families (department), to provide him with services because he was over the age of eighteen and had failed to allege that he was \u201cin full-time attendance in a secondary school, a technical school, a college or a state-accredited job training program\u201d as required by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (j).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>would conclude that the petitioner\u2019s failure to make such an allegation was not a subject matter jurisdictional defect, but went to the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court on the ground that the petitioner had failed to establish an essential element of \u00a7 46b-129.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">This court previously has recognized \u201cthe recurrent difficulty of distinguishing between two kinds of challenges to a tribunal's exercise of its statutory authority. On the one hand, a challenge may allege that a tribunal\u2019s action exceeds its statutory authority. Such a challenge raises a jurisdictional claim. On the other hand, a challenge may allege that a tribunal\u2019s action misconstrues its statutory authority. Such a challenge raises a claim of statutory construction that is not jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Cantoni </em>v. <em>Xerox Corp., </em>251 Conn. 153, 162, 740 A.2d 796 (1999). Thus, \u201c[although related, the court\u2019s authority to act pursuant to a statute is different from its subject matter jurisdiction. The power of the court to hear and determine, which is implicit in jurisdiction, is not to be confused with the way in which that power must be exercised in order to comply with the terms of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 728, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">As this court suggested in <em>Cantoni, </em>the distinction between challenges to the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and challenges to the exercise of its statutory authority is not always clear. As a result, this court\u2019s cases addressing the distinction have not always been consistent. In <em>Amodio, </em>for example, the parties had entered into a child support agreement that precluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>modification unless the defendant earned more than $900 per week. Id., 727. The agreement was approved as an order of the trial court. Id., 726. When the defendant sought a modification order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a), the trial court granted the modification even though the defendant\u2019s weekly income did not exceed $900. Id. On appeal, the Appellate Court determined, sua sponte, that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to modify the support order because the dissolution decree foreclosed such a modification. Id., 727. On appeal, this court concluded that \u201c[a] court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it. . . . Once it is determined that a tribunal has authority or competence to decide the class of cases to which the action belongs, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is resolved in favor of entertaining the action.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 728. This court noted that \u00a7 46b-86 (a) confers jurisdiction on the trial court to modify support orders \u201c[u]nless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 730; but concluded that, because support orders can be modified despite such preclusion provisions when they are ambiguous or do not adequately protect the parties, the trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction to modify the order. Id., 730-31. This court further concluded that \u201c[s]eparate and distinct from the question of whether a court has jurisdictional power to hear and determine a support matter ... is the question of whether a trial court <em>properly </em>applies \u00a7 46b-86 (a), that is, properly exercises its statutory authority to act.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 730. This court remanded the case to the Appellate Court for consideration of that issue. Id., 732; see <em>also New England Retail Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Maturo, </em>102 Conn. App. 476, 482, 925 A.2d 1151 (under statute prohibiting commencement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>action against estate unless legal claim has been rejected by estate, claim that estate had not rejected legal claim did not implicate court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction but was question of statutory authority), cert. denied, 284 Conn. 912, 931 A.2d 932 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, 177 </em>Conn. 47, 49, 411 A.2d 25 (1979), this court reached a different result. The issue in that case was whether \u201cthe Superior Court has the authority to make and enforce support orders pertaining to children over the age of eighteen.\u201d Id. The court concluded that, because the statutes relating to support orders applied only to minor children, and because the legislature had lowered the age of majority from twenty-one years of age to eighteen years of age, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter such orders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 52-53. In <em>Kennedy, </em>the court did not discuss the distinction between the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and its statutory authority. In a later case, however, Justice Peters, who was on the panel that decided <em>Kennedy, </em>stated that she was \u201cnot persuaded that we should invariably characterize as an absence of subject matter jurisdiction every failure of a trial court to observe every statutory limitation on its authority to act; but it is clear that in this instance I am bound by our holding to the contrary\u201d in <em>Kennedy. Broaca </em>v. <em>Broaca, </em>181 Conn. 463, 471, 435 A.2d 1016 (1980) <em>(Peters, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">This court\u2019s cases addressing the distinction between motions to dismiss and motions to strike are also instructive on the distinction between claims implicating the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and claims impheating the proper exercise of its authority. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>In <em>Gurliacci </em>v. Mayer, 218 Conn. 531, 541-42, 590 A.2d 914 (1991), this court considered whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim that she had been injured as the result of a fellow employee\u2019s negligence. The named defendant in that case argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action because, under the fellow employee immunity rule of General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 7-465 and the Workers Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., the workers\u2019 compensation commission has exclusive jurisdiction over intraworkplace claims unless they fall into one of two statutory exceptions. Id., 543-44. Because the plaintiff had not alleged either exception in her complaint, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which the trial court denied. Id., 541-42. On appeal, this court noted that it previously had held that \u201cif a pleading ... on its face is legally insufficient, although facts may indeed exist which, if properly pleaded, would establish a cause of action upon which relief could be granted, a motion to strike is required.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 544. In contrast, \u201c[a] motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. This court concluded that \u201cthe fact that the plaintiffs complaint failed to allege facts that would have removed it from the operation of the fellow employee immunity rule merely reflects that the complaint failed to state a legally sufficient cause of action.\u201d Id. Accordingly, this court concluded that the complaint properly was subject to a motion to strike, not a motion to dismiss. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">This court reasoned in <em>Gurliacci </em>that \u201c[interpreting the [statutory] language . . . [setting forth the excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tions to the fellow employee immunity rule] as subject matter jurisdictional, taken to its logical conclusion, would require a trial court, after trial, to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction a complaint that at the outset properly alleged an exception to the fellow employee immunity rule\u201d if the fact finder ultimately concluded that neither exception applied. Id. \u201cThus, the court would be compelled to conclude that it had no subject matter jurisdiction over the case that it had tried solely because the plaintiff failed to establish an essential element of his cause of action.\u201d Id., 545. This court declined \u201cto adopt such a bizarre inteipretation of [the statute].\u201d Id.; see also <em>Egri </em>v. <em>Foisie, </em>83 Conn. App. 243, 246-51, 848 A.2d 1266 (trial court improperly granted motion to dismiss complaint under doctrine of sovereign immunity when plaintiff failed to allege negligent operation of state owned and insured motor vehicle as required by statute waiving sovereign immunity; because plaintiff could potentially state claim under statute, motion to strike was proper procedural vehicle for challenging legal sufficiency of complaint), cert. denied, 271 Conn. 931, 859 A.2d 930 (2004).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">This court reached a different conclusion in <em>Amore </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>228 Conn. 358, 362, 636 A.2d 786 (1994), in which the plaintiffs sought to recover from the defendant, the commissioner of transportation (commissioner), for injuries that one of the plaintiffs had sustained in a fall on a driveway on the campus of the University of Connecticut. The plaintiffs alleged that their claims came within a statutory exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity for injuries that are caused by the commissioner\u2019s negligence in carrying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>out his legal duty to maintain a road. Id., 363-64. The commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in which he argued that the claim did not fall within the exception because he did not have the legal duty to maintain the roads on the university campus. Id., 362. In support of his motion, he submitted two supporting affidavits. Id., 362-63. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. Id., 363. On appeal, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment. Id. On appeal to this court, this court concluded that \u201c[t]he factual underpinnings of the allegations in the affidavits were sufficient to defeat any presumption of truth in the . . . assertion of a legal obligation on the part of the commissioner to maintain the driveway.\u201d Id., 368. It further concluded that, because the plaintiffs had not disputed the facts contained in the affidavit, the trial court lacked jurisdiction and had properly dismissed the complaint. Id., 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">This court in <em>Amove </em>distinguished <em>Guvliacci, </em>on the ground that the motion to dismiss in that case had not been \u201caccompanied by supporting affidavits that demonstrated by uncontroverted facts that the plaintiff could not as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.\u201d Id., 367 n.8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In his dissenting opinion in <em>Amove, </em>Justice Berdon disagreed with the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Guvliacci </em>was distinguishable and stated that \u201c[t]he question here is not whether the commissioner had the responsibility to maintain the drive that would make him liable for defects, but whether the trial court has the power to hear and determine an action brought against him pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 13a-144. And, of course, the answer is yes.\u201d Id., 373. Justice Berdon argued that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>because the failure to allege that the commissioner had a legal duty to maintain the road at issue merely affected the legal sufficiency of the complaint, the validity of the complaint should have been tested by way of a motion to strike. Id., 372-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">As I have indicated, there does not seem to be any consistent general principle underlying these cases. For the following reasons, I believe that, to the extent that these cases are inconstant, the better rule is set forth in <em>Gurliacci. </em>First, the holding of <em>Gurliacci </em>that the failure to allege an essential fact does not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction is consistent with the rule that \u201cevery presumption is to be indulged in favor of jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 543; see also <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 728 (\u201cA court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it. . . . Once it is determined that a tribunal has authority or competence to decide the class of cases to which the action belongs, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is resolved in favor of entertaining the action.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Carten </em>v. <em>Carten, </em>153 Conn. 603, 612-13, 219 A.2d 711 (1966) (\u201cThe Superior Court is a court of general jurisdiction. It has jurisdiction of all matters expressly committed to it and of all other matters cognizable by any law court of which the exclusive jurisdiction is not given to some other court. The fact that no other court has exclusive jurisdiction in any matter is sufficient to give the Superior Court jurisdiction of that matter. . . . [T]he general rule of jurisdiction ... is that nothing shall be intended to be out of the jurisdiction of a Superior Court but that which specially appears to be so; and on the contrary nothing shall be intended to be within the jurisdiction of an inferior court but that which is expressly so alleged. . . . [N]o court is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>be ousted of its jurisdiction by implication.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\"><em>Gurliacci </em>is also consistent with \u201cthe judicial policy preference to bring about a trial on the merits of a dispute whenever possible and to secure for the litigant his day in court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pietraroia </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities, </em>254 Conn. 60, 74, 756 A.2d 845 (2000). If the failure to allege an essential fact is treated as subject matter jurisdictional, potentially meritorious claims will be subject to dismissal without affording the plaintiff the opportunity to amend the complaint to correct the defect. <em>See Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>Alves, </em>262 Conn. 480, 501, 815 A.2d 1188 (2003) (\u201cthe primary difference between the granting of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the granting of a motion to strike is that only in the latter case does the plaintiff have the opportunity to amend its complaint\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Additionally, as this court observed in <em>Gurliacci, </em>if the failure to allege an essential fact under a particular statute deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction, then the failure to prove that fact at trial also must deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction, requiring the court to dismiss the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 544-45. This would be a bizarre result. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Accordingly, I believe that, if a claim is within \u201cthe class of cases to which the action belongs\u201d; <em>Amodio </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Amodio, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 728; the failure to allege an essential fact under a particular statute goes to the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not to the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I would therefore conclude that, in the present case, because the petitioner raised the <em>type </em>of claim contemplated by \u00a7 46b-129, his failure to allege that he attended an educational facility as required by the statute did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction, but went to the merits of his claim.
