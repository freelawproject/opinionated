Pratt &amp; Whitney appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board), which vacated the commissioner\u2019s finding and award of benefits. The plaintiff then appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the board\u2019s decision. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>112 Conn. App. 492, 511, 963 A.2d 1027 (2009). We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly determine that the bar to workers\u2019 compensation coverage found within ... \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applied to preclude coverage for the plaintiffs injury?\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>291 Conn. 906, 967 A.2d 1220 (2009). We conclude that certification was improvidently granted and that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cThe plaintiff . . . was taking a walk on the Pratt &amp; Whitney grounds dining her one-half hour unpaid lunch break on July 8, 2005, when she fell and sustained an injury to her right shoulder. . . . The plaintiff testified before the commissioner that she walked daily for the purpose of improving her health; she is a borderline diabetic and her physician recommended that she exercise. She also testified that her walking is purely voluntary, that she does not associate with any other Pratt &amp; Whitney employees during her walk, that when she walks she chums her arms up and down to get her heart rate higher and that she makes a concentrated effort to elevate her heart rate by walking at a rapid pace. She does not have to ask permission of her supervisor or anyone else at Pratt &amp; Whitney to take a lunchtime walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff reported her injury to a supervisor and immediately sought medical attention at work. She was sent to the emergency room at Middlesex Hospital and a few days later visited her physician. She eventually learned that she had a tom tendon in her shoulder, and she received physical therapy for her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff presented evidence at the hearing before the commissioner that she was totally incapacitated from July 9 through August 20,2005. In his September 26,2006 finding and award, the commissioner found that [t]he health of Pratt &amp; Whitney workers was surely enhanced by any type of reasonable physical activity pursued on company grounds during unpaid breaks by its employees. The commissioner further found that the plaintiffs walking on company grounds during her lunch break was . . . incidental to her employment, and, therefore, her right shoulder injury is found to be a compensable event, and also was not barred from compensation under the social-recreational exception to the act. Pratt &amp; Whitney filed a petition for review</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u201cOn October 23, 2007, the board issued its opinion and vacated the commissioner\u2019s finding and award, concluding that the plaintiffs injury was not compensable. The board rejected the commissioner\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs injury was incidental to her employment and found no mutual benefit to both parties from the plaintiffs activities. The board further found that the commissioner\u2019s finding that [t]he health of Pratt &amp; Whitney workers was surely enhanced by any type of reasonable physical activity was unsupported by any probative evidence on the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 112 Conn. App. 494-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In affirming the decision of the board, the Appellate Court determined that the major purpose of the plaintiffs activity was recreational and, therefore, held that the social-recreational exception of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i) applied to preclude coverage for the plaintiffs injury. Id., 504-509.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">This certified appeal followed. The plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s affirmance of the board\u2019s decision was improper because the act of walking for health reasons, alone during a lunch break, was neither social nor recreational and does not fall within the scope of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i). After examining the entire record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-9\">AIG Claims Service, Inc., the workers\u2019 compensation insurer for Pratt &amp; Whitney, also was named as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) provides in relevant part,: \u201c \u2018Personal injury\u2019 or \u2018injury\u2019 shall not be construed to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">\u201c(i) An injury to an employee that results from the employee\u2019s voluntary participation in any activity the major purpose of which is social or recreational, including, but not limited to, athletic events, parties and picnics, whether or not the employer pays some or all of the cost of such activity</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
