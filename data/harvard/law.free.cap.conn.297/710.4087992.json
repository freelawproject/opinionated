The plaintiff is an independent insurance intermediary that provides a variety of insurance and reinsurance products and services to corporations, public entities, institutions, trade professionals, associations and individual clients. On December 19, 2005, as part of an investigation of possible antitrust violations in the insurance industry, the defendant, pursuant to the authority of \u00a7 35-42 (a) and (e) (2), respectively, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>issued a subpoena duces tecum and interrogatories to the plaintiff. According to the plaintiff, the defendant requested materials and information that contained trade secrets and other valuable commercial and financial information.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 35-42 (c), documents furnished to the defendant under \u00a7 35-42 (a) \u201cshall not be available to the public . . . .\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 35-42 (e) (2), interrogatory responses \u201cshall not be available for public disclosure.\u201d Section 35-42 (g) directs, however, that \u201c[t]he Attorney General shall cooperate with officials of the federal government and the several states, including but not limited to the sharing and disclosure of information and evidence obtained under the purview of this chapter.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In the course of the parties\u2019 discussions regarding the plaintiffs compliance with the subpoena, it became apparent that they disagreed in their interpretation of the foregoing provisions. The parties had agreed that the plaintiff would produce responsive material in stages, and, on June 2, 2006, the plaintiff produced the first stage, comprising some 12,000 documents. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>after, the parties attempted to reach an agreement regarding confidentiality, but ultimately were unsuccessful. Instead of producing the second stage of material, which was due on August 31, 2006, the plaintiff, on August 29,2006, filed an action for declaratory relief, requesting that the trial court determine the scope of the confidentiality protection afforded by \u00a7 35-42.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Two days later, the defendant, pursuant to \u00a7 35-42 (f), filed with the trial court an application for an order requiring the plaintiff to comply with the interrogatories and subpoena duces tecum. On October 12,2006, the trial court granted the parties\u2019 joint motion to consolidate the two matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">On October 30, 2006, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration from the trial court endorsing the plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 35-42.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff sought a judgment declaring that the defendant could not disclose any documents or information received pursuant to \u00a7 35-42 \u201cto any person outside the [defendant\u2019s] office except to the extent such documents and information are (1) actually entered into evidence on the public record in a court proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>after notice and opportunity for the [plaintiff] to be heard regarding whether such disclosure may be made; or (2) provided to an official of another state or the federal government . . . where such official will maintain the same degree of confidentiality provided by \u00a7 35-42 (c) and (e) . . . .\u201d The plaintiff claimed further that \u00a7 35-42 did not permit the defendant to disclose subpoenaed information and documents to third parties during interviews or depositions he conducted to advance his antitrust investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In opposing the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, the defendant argued that he could use and share subpoenaed information to the extent necessary to advance his investigation and to prepare cases for prosecution, which could require sharing documents with persons outside of his office. Also, according to the defendant, the plaintiffs claimed right to notice and an opportunity to be heard before its documents could be used in a court proceeding to which it was not a party would be too burdensome. Finally, the defendant argued, there was no language in \u00a7 35-42 indicating that a confidentiality requirement should be imposed on sharing information with officials of other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In a May 1, 2007 memorandum of decision, the trial court denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court first interpreted the phrases \u201cshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>not be available to the public\u201d and \u201cshall not be available for public disclosure,\u201d as used in \u00a7 35-42 (c) and (e) (2), respectively, in order to decide whether \u00a7 35-42 prohibits the disclosure of information to any person outside of the defendant\u2019s office. The court concluded that the legislature, by using those phrases, likely intended to establish an exception to the general rule contained in the Freedom of Information Act, General Statutes \u00a7 1-200 et seq., that documents received or retained by a public agency are public records available to the public for inspection and copying.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> According to the trial court, because the statute did not use the words \u201canyone\u201d or \u201cany person,\u201d it could not be read to preclude a limited disclosure to outside individuals when such disclosure is necessary to advance the purpose of the statute, namely, the investigation of potential antitrust violations and preparation for court proceedings. This limited disclosure, the court explained, would not violate the statutory proscription against disclosure to the \u201cpublic,\u201d because that term contemplates the community at large as a group and does not necessarily apply to each of its individual members. The trial court concluded, therefore, that subsections (c) and (e) (2) of \u00a7 35-42 do not create an absolute bar to the disclosure of subpoenaed material and information during an investigation by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The trial court further rejected the plaintiffs assertion that it is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard in the event that any information obtained pursuant to \u00a7 35-42 is offered during court proceedings to which it is not a party. Finally, the trial court con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>eluded that \u00a7 35-42 does not require officials of other jurisdictions who receive such information pursuant to subsection (g) to conform to the public nondisclosure provisions of subsections (c) and (e) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the denial of its motion for summary judgment. We dismissed that appeal for lack of a final judgment. See <em>Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>288 Conn. 646, 650, 954 A.2d 816 (2008). Thereafter, the defendant moved for summary judgment on the plaintiffs complaint and reclaimed the application for an order of compliance for a decision by the trial court; see footnote 11 of this opinion; and the plaintiff filed a second motion for summary judgment on its complaint. On February 24, 2009, the trial court, as to the plaintiffs complaint, denied the plaintiffs second motion for summary judgment, granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant, adopting as its reasoning the previous memorandum of decision on the plaintiffs first motion for summary judgment. The trial court also granted the defendant\u2019s reclaimed application for an order of compliance, reasoning that it involved the same issue of statutory interpretation that had been resolved in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The plaintiff claims first that the trial court improperly construed the proscriptions in \u00a7 35-42 (c) and (e) (2) against \u201cdisclos[ing]\u201d subpoenaed material and information to the \u201cpublic\u201d to refer only to disclosure to the general public via the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act that require access to public records, thus permitting disclosure to specific members of the public, including actual and potential competitors and clients of a subpoena target, if that disclosure furthers an antitrust investigation. According to the plaintiff, the confidentiality protection of \u00a7 35-42 applies even after subpoenaed documents are filed in an enforcement action, thereby requiring that the owner of the docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>ments be given notice and an opportunity to be heard when the defendant intends to use the documents in court so that the owner can seek a court order protecting them from disclosure. Finally, the plaintiff argues, because the confidentiality requirements of \u00a7 35-42 remain in place even when documents are shared with other governmental officials, the defendant must obtain agreement from such officials to adhere to those requirements before sharing any subpoenaed documents or information with them. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">We begin with the applicable standard of review. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant [a party\u2019s] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southwick at Milford Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>523 Wheelers Farm Road, Milford, LLC, </em>294 Conn. 311, 318, 984 A.2d 676 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The plaintiffs claim also presents a question of statutory interpretation, such that the trial court\u2019s conclusions are legal ones subject to plenary review. <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>295 Conn. 94, 99, 989 A.2d 1027 (2010). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case .... When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case .... In seeking to determine that meaning . . . [General Statutes] \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter .... We recognize that terms in a statute are to be assigned their ordinary meaning, unless context dictates otherwise . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 99-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">We begin by considering the text of \u00a7 35-42. As to each type of subpoenaed material or information, the statute prohibits disclosure to the \u201cpublic.\u201d Because the word \u201cpublic\u201d is not statutorily defined, the trial court looked to various dictionary definitions stating that \u201cpublic\u201d means \u201c[t]he community or the people as a whole\u201d; \u201c[a] group of people sharing a common interest\u201d; American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (3d Ed. 1992); or \u201c[t]he whole body politic, or the aggregate of the citizens of a state, nation, or municipality. The inhabitants of a state, county, or community. In one sense, everybody, and accordingly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>body of the people at large; the community at large . . . the people. In another sense the word does not mean all the people, nor most of the people, nor very many of the people of a place, but so many of them as contradistinguishes them from a few . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1991). Although the trial court correctly concluded from the foregoing definitions that the term \u201cpublic\u201d generally contemplates a group of people collectively, rather than as individuals, we believe that that distinction, read within the context of the remainder of \u00a7 35-42, only creates an ambiguity. In particular, if subpoenaed material and information cannot be shared with society at large, but nevertheless may be shared with any or all of its individual members, the statutory bar against disclosure essentially becomes meaningless and unworkable. Accordingly, we must look further to construe the legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Consideration of the additional protections afforded by \u00a7 35-42, and of other statutes with similar focus, lends support to the notion that the legislature, although it granted broad investigatory powers to the defendant to pursue antitrust violators, also intended to afford counterbalancing protections to investigatory targets in recognition of the potential sensitivity of internal business information and the fact that the defendant\u2019s investigation need not be founded on any specified level of suspicion and, ultimately, might result in no allegations of wrongdoing. See footnote 4 of this opinion. First, \u00a7 35-42 (c), aside from requiring that subpoenaed documents not be available for public disclosure, also requires that such documents be \u201cheld in the custody of the [defendant] or his designee,\u201d a phrase that connotes a duty of safekeeping. Moreover, \u00a7 35-42 (c) requires that subpoenaed documents \u201cbe returned to the person [providing them] at the termination of the [defendant\u2019s] investigation or final determination of any action or proceeding commenced thereunder\u201d in appar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>ent recognition that the documents are the personal property of the investigatory target. Additionally, the legislature\u2019s appreciation for the value of trade secrets to their owners and the need for their protection is evidenced by its passage of the Connecticut Uniform Trade Secrets Act (trade secrets act), General Statutes \u00a7 35-50 et seq., which permits actions for both injunctive relief and damages, including punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees, for misappropriation of trade secrets.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 35-52, 35-53 and 35-54. Notably, the trade secrets act defines \u201cmisappropriation\u201d as including \u201cdisclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who ... at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was . . . <em>acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 35-51 (b) (2) (B) (ii). The trade secrets act provides further that the \u201c[p]erson[s]\u201d who may be hable for misappropriation include \u201cgovemment[s] . . . [and] governmental subdivision^] or agencies] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 35-51 (c). Presumably, the legislature was aware of the provisions of \u00a7 35-42 when it enacted the trade secrets act in 1983. Public Acts 1983, No. 83-344. The legislature\u2019s attachment of such severe penalties to the unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets by government agencies having a duty to limit their use would be whohy inconsistent with a simultaneous intent that \u00a7 35-42 permits such disclosure in the attorney general\u2019s discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>tion. See <em>Envirotest Systems Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor </em>Vehicles, 293 Conn. 382, 398, 978 A.2d 49 (2009) (legislature \u201cis presumed to have acted with knowledge of existing statutes and with an intent to create one consistent body of law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">We disagree with the trial court\u2019s reasoning that the prohibitions in \u00a735-42 against \u201cpublic\u201d disclosure merely were meant to create an exception to the general laws requiring open access to public records, because \u201cthe word \u2018public\u2019 is a key term used in our Freedom of Information Act.\u201d According to the trial court, if the legislature had intended the provisions to mean otherwise, it would have used phraseology barring disclosure of subpoenaed material or information to \u201c \u2018any person,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018anyone,\u2019 \u201d as it did in various other statutes intended to impose strict confidentiality requirements. The trial court\u2019s conclusion, however, is contradicted by the language of the Freedom of Information Act itself, which provides that \u201ceveiy person\u201d\u2014 and not \u201cthe public\u201d \u2014 shall have the right to inspect and copy public records. General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (a). In any event, as the trial court recognized in ruling on a motion for articulation filed by the plaintiff, \u00a7 35-42, which was enacted in 1971; see Public Acts 1971, No. 608; predates the Freedom of Information Act, which was not in existence until 1975. See Public Acts 1975, No. 75-342. Consequently, the legislature, when crafting \u00a7 35-42, could not have been referencing the Freedom of Information Act by using the word \u201cpublic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The public records statute that preceded the Freedom of Information Act, and which was in effect when \u00a7 35-42 was enacted, similarly did not refer to the beneficiary of its disclosure requirements as \u201cthe public,\u201d but stated instead that <em>\u201cevery resident </em>of the state shall have the right to inspect or copy such [public] records . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Sup. 1969) \u00a7 1-19. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Moreover, the predecessor statute expressly exempted from the definition of public records \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from the public\u201d; General Statutes (Sup. 1969) \u00a7 1-19; which would have rendered a restatement of the exemption for such items in \u00a7 35-42 entirely superfluous. We cannot countenance a reading of a statute that would render it superfluous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., </em>286 Conn. 454, 471, 944 A.2d 315 (2008). Finally, our research reveals that, when the legislature wishes to create an exception to public records requirements, it does so clearly by explicitly referencing the statute generally authorizing access,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and not by alluding to it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>with ambiguous \u201ckey term[s].\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Although the legislative history of \u00a7 35-42 does not address the particular issue at hand, the circumstances surrounding the subsequent amendments to the statute, or the lack thereof, shed further light on the legislature\u2019s intent regarding the nondisclosure provisions. The antitrust act intentionally was patterned after federal antitrust law. <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>260 Conn. 59, 72, 793 A.2d 1048 (2002); <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 15, 664 A.2d 719 (1995). Section 35-42, when it originally passed in 1971, was \u201cmodeled, with some changes, after the federal Antitrust Civil Process Act of 1962, set forth in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311 [through] 1314 (1970).\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>v. <em>Killian, </em>30 Conn. Sup. 87, 91, 301 A.2d 562 (1973).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The federal statute, at that time, had strict nondisclosure provisions, requiring documentary material produced in response to an investigative demand to be held by a designated \u201cantitrust document custodian,\u201d and providing that \u201cno material so produced shall be available for examination, without the consent of the person who produced such material, by any individual other than a duly authorized officer, member, or employee of the Department of Justice.\u201d Antitrust Civil Process Act, Pub. L. No. 87-664, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 4 (c), 76 Stat. 548, 550 (1962). The federal statute thereafter was amended to create an exception permitting disclosure of material in connection with the taking of oral testimony, \u201c[notwithstanding\u201d the foregoing nondisclosure requirement. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313 (c) (2) (2006). Section 35-42, however, was not amended to mirror its federal counterpart. We glean from this circumstance that our legislature intended that materials submitted in a Connecticut antitrust investigation <em>should not </em>be available for such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In addition, \u00a7 35-42, when it was originally enacted, did not include subsection (e) (2), allowing the defendant to demand responses to written interrogatories, or subsection (g), authorizing the defendant to share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>information with other government officials. See Public Acts 1971, No. 608; see also footnote 2 of this opinion. Thus, under the original wording, the defendant was authorized only to subpoena documents, which \u201cshall not be available to the public\u201d; Public Acts 1971, No. 608, \u00a7 19 (c), now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 35-42 (c); and to compel oral testimony, with the transcripts thereof not to \u201cbe available for public disclosure . . . .\u201d Public Acts 1971, No. 608, \u00a7 19 (e), now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 35-42 (e) (1). Shortly after the enactment of \u00a7 35-42, a trial court had the opportunity to interpret the meaning of the phrase \u201cshall not be available to the public,\u201d as used in subsection (c). In <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Killian, </em>supra, 30 Conn. Sup. 90-91, 96, the plaintiff brought an action to quash a subpoena issued by the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 35-42 (c), arguing, inter alia, that the defendant intended to use the subpoenaed material improperly by disclosing it to other states\u2019 attorneys general. The trial court agreed that such a use was not permitted by \u00a7 35-42, concluding that \u201c[u]nder our statute, while the matter is in the civil investigative stage, no one is entitled to examine the documents or records except the attorney general and his designee. Insofar as the phrase \u2018shall not be available to the public\u2019 requires interpretation, it includes everyone other than the attorney general and his designee. None of the information obtained by this subpoena is available for export to any other person during the civil investigative stage.\u201d Id., 96. The trial court issued an order in accordance with this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The legislature responded to the trial court\u2019s decision in <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>by amending \u00a7 35-42 to add subsection (g), thereby permitting the defendant to share information and evidence gathered in antitrust investigations with officials in other states and the federal government. Public Acts 1973, No. 73-668, \u00a7 4. At the same time, the legislature added subsection (e) (2) to \u00a7 35-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>42, authorizing the defendant to demand responses to interrogatories, subject to the same confidentiality caveat that already existed in subsection (c) and which the trial court had interpreted in <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>namely, that the responses not be disclosed to the public. Public Acts 1973, No. 73-668, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that these amendments strongly evidence the legislature\u2019s agreement with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 35-42 in <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>If, as the defendant insists, the prohibition against disclosure was merely an exception to the general laws governing access to public records, the legislature simply would have reworded the existing subsections (c) and (e) (1) of \u00a7 35-42, and phrased the new subsection (e) (2), to say so clearly and to refute the holding of <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>Instead, the legislature retained, and reused, the language that it was aware had been interpreted broadly, and added only one exception to the court\u2019s general holding that all disclosure of subpoenaed materials was barred, to anyone outside the attorney general\u2019s office.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commission, </em>752 F.2d 116, 120 (5th Cir. 1985) (concluding that legislature\u2019s general bar of public access to information obtained in investigations pursuant to Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18a [h], coupled with exception allowing disclosure to Congress and congressional committees, was \u201cevidence that the statute\u2019s prohibition of disclosure was otherwise meant to be universal\u201d); <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commission, </em>771 F.2d 32, 38 (2d Cir. 1985) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>It is well settled that \u201c[t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or [nonaction] will have upon any one of them ... as well as the interpretation which the courts have placed upon one of its legislative enactments and of the effect that its own nonaction, thereafter may have.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>273 Conn. 786, 812, 873 A.2d 965 (2005). In short, the legislature\u2019s failure to act following a court\u2019s interpretation of a statute suggests strongly that the legislature agrees with that interpretation. Id. We conclude that, to the extent the legislature declined to alter the holding of <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>when it passed responsive legislation, it agreed with that holding. Accordingly, we construe \u00a7 35-42 as barring disclosure of material and information gathered in an antitrust investigation pursuant to \u00a7 35-42 to all persons outside of the attorney general\u2019s office,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> with the exception of officials of other states and the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">On the basis of our interpretation of \u00a7 35-42, we agree with the plaintiffs contention that the defendant may not disclose the materials and information obtained from the plaintiff to persons outside of the defendant\u2019s office in connection with taking oral testimony in pursuance of an antitrust investigation. We also agree that the defendant, if he chooses to share such materials and information with other government officials pursuant to \u00a7 35-42 (g), first must obtain agreement from those officials that they will abide by the same confidentiality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>restrictions to which the defendant is subject. Finally, if the defendant decides to institute an antitrust action and needs to file investigatory materials in conjunction with the action, he should do so in accordance with the lodging procedures set forth in Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 7-4B<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and 7-4C.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>As to the bar against sharing subpoenaed documents with third parties, who potentially may be direct competitors of the owner of the documents, we disagree with the defendant that such a restriction will cripple his ability to investigate possible antitrust violations. As the plaintiff points out, nongovernmental parties routinely are able to bring actions pursuant to the private enforcement provisions of the antitrust act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 35-33 and 35-34; without having the ability to conduct any pretrial discovery whatsoever. Additionally, although federal officials are authorized by the Antitrust Civil Process Act to use subpoenaed materials in third party depositions; see 15U.S.C. \u00a7 1313 (c) (2); it does not appear that such use is a vital investigatory tool.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Finally, we strongly reject the defendant\u2019s contention that \u201cthere can be little actual prejudice in disclosing subpoenaed materials to competitors as necessary to pursue an antitrust investigation [because] [a]ny competitor to whom disclosure is made will very likely already have some knowledge of the document as a result of [its] participation in the contract or conspiracy being investigated.\u201d It bears emphasizing that, when the defendant is conducting discovery pursuant to \u00a7 35-42, investigatory targets have not been, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>some cases may never be, charged with any wrongdoing. Accordingly, it is wholly inappropriate to presume their guilt to justify further expansion of the defendant\u2019s already considerable statutorily granted investigatory powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In regard to sharing information with officials of other jurisdictions, it is clear that the legislature, by enacting \u00a7 35-42 (g), intended that the defendant should have and exercise this power. Nevertheless, reading subsection (g) in conjunction with subsections (c) and (e) of \u00a7 35-42, it is also clear that that power necessarily is conditional, so as to not render impotent the confidentiality provisions of the latter two subsections. When construing a statute, we read it \u201cas a whole ... so as to reconcile all parts as far as possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co., </em>221 Conn. 149, 157, 602 A.2d 988 (1992). If officials of other jurisdictions were free to use and disclose material and information obtained under \u00a7 35-42 in ways that the defendant may not, the bars against disclosure in subsections (c) and (e) would be rendered meaningless. Again, the defendant\u2019s insistence that it would be unduly burdensome to impose conditions regarding disclosure on other officials is belied by the fact that many other states have similar prerequisites for interjurisdictional sharing of documents and information acquired in prelitigation antitrust investigations. See, e.g., Cal. Govt. Code \u00a7 11181 (g) (Deering Sup. 2009) (department head may divulge information obtained in antitrust investigation to other government officials \u201cif the Attorney General, prosecuting attorney, or agency to which the information or evidence is divulged agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the information received to the extent required by [California\u2019s statutes governing antitrust investigations]\u201d); Mass. Ann. Laws c. 93, \u00a7 8 (LexisNexis 2005) (allowing disclosure to other officials provided \u201cthat prior to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>such disclosure the attorney general shall obtain a written agreement from such officials to abide by the restrictions of [the Massachusetts statute governing investigative demands] and any orders entered [thereunder]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Finally, as to filing in court proceedings subpoenaed material and information that was obtained during an investigation conducted prior to the institution of an action, we disagree with the defendant that continued adherence to the nondisclosure requirements of \u00a7 35-42 will lead inevitably to a \u201csecret antitrust docket.\u201d When such materials are filed or entered into evidence in connection with a court proceeding, the confidentiality protection afforded by the statute must be balanced against the countervailing presumption that documents submitted to a court in furtherance of its adjudicatory function shall be available to the public. See <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>292 Conn. 1, 34-35, 46, 970 A.2d 656, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp. </em>v. <em>New York Times Co., </em>558 U.S. 991, 130 S. Ct. 500, 175 L. Ed. 2d 348 (2009); see also Practice Book \u00a7 11-20A (a). Accordingly, when the defendant intends to file materials obtained pursuant to \u00a7 35-42, or to include the substance of such materials within a pleading,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> he should utilize the lodging procedures set forth in Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 7-4B and 7-4C. Specifically, to comply with the confidentiality mandates set forth in \u00a7 35-42, he should lodge the materials with the trial court. The party from whom the material was obtained then will have an opportunity to file a motion, accompanied by an appropriate memorandum of law, seeking to file the materials under seal or to limit their disclosure.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The trial court must then determine, in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 11-20A (c),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> whether the materials contain any trade secrets or other sensitive information, and whether the need to maintain their confidentiality overrides the public\u2019s interest in viewing them.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 35 (presumption of public access to court documents may be outweighed by countervailing considerations).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff and to deny the defendant\u2019s application for an order of compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\"> Brown and Brown, Inc., appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and this court transferred the appeal to itself pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 35-42 provides: \u201c(a) Whenever the Attorney General, his deputy, or any assistant attorney general designated by the Attorney General, has reason to believe that any person has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, he may, prior to instituting any action or proceeding against such person, issue in writing and cause to be served upon any person, by subpoena duces tecum, a demand requiring such person to submit to him documentary material relevant to the scope of the alleged violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">\u201c(b) Such demand shall (1) state the nature of the alleged violation, and (2) describe the class or classes of documentary material to be reproduced thereunder with such definiteness and certainty as to be accurately identified, and (3) prescribe a date which would allow a reasonable time to assemble such documents for compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">\u201c(c) All documents furnished to the Attorney General, his deputy, or any assistant attorney general designated by the Attorney General, shall be held in the custody of the Attorney General, or his designee, shall not be available to the public, and shall be returned to the person at the termination of the attorney general\u2019s investigation or final determination of any action or proceeding commenced thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">\u201c(d) No such demand shall require the submission of any documentary material, the contents of which would be privileged, or precluded from disclosure if demanded in a grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">\u201c(e) The Attorney General, his deputy, or any assistant attorney general designated by the Attorney General, may during the course of an investigation of any violations of the provisions of this chapter by any person (1) issue in writing and cause to be served upon any person, by subpoena, a demand that such person appear before him and give testimony as to any matters relevant to the scope of the alleged violations.

Although Brown and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Brown, Inc., is the plaintiff only in the first matter for declaratory and injunctive relief, and is the defendant in the second matter brought by the attorney general to enforce compliance with a subpoena; see General Statutes \u00a7 35-42 (f) (1); for convenience we refer to Brown and Brown, Inc., as the plaintiff and to the attorney general as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b737-11\"> On May 6,2009, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, Inc., the Insurance Association of Connecticut, the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the American Insurance Association and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, collectively, filed an application to appear as amicus curiae and requested permission to file a brief in this matter and to participate in oral argument. Additionally, on May 11, 2009, the New England Legal Foundation filed an application to appear as amicus curiae and requested permission to file a brief. On June 3, 2009, this court granted both applications, but ordered that no oral argument would be permitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b737-12\"> The plaintiff also claims that the trial court, as to the \u00a7 35-42 (f) (1) enforcement proceedings, improperly ordered the plaintiff to comply unconditionally with the defendant\u2019s subpoena and, additionally, improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to delete or expunge an answer and special defenses filed by the plaintiff, because those proceedings are civil actions to which the rules of practice apply. In light of our resolution of the plaintiff\u2019s first claim, we need not discuss the second claim in any detail. In short, because the trial court\u2019s order of compliance was premised on its misinterpretation of the confidentiality provisions of \u00a7 35-42, it necessarily was improper and must be reversed. In light of our resolution of the plaintiffs second claim, we need not reach its third claim, because resolution of that claim in the plaintiffs favor would afford it no practical relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> Counsel for the plaintiff attested, in an affidavit submitted to the trial court, that the defendant had requested production of, inter alia, \u201cdetailed internal financial records, customer lists, business strategies, internal negotiation strategies, and internal self-evaluations of its business activities and procedures.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\"> Section 35-42 (e) (1), which authorizes the defendant to subpoena oral testimony, similarly provides that transcripts of such testimony \u201cshall not be available for public disclosure . . . .\u201d Moreover, \u00a7 35-42 recently was amended by Public Acts 2009, No. 09-68, to address the subject of documentary material or other information <em>voluntarily </em>furnished to the defendant in connection with an antitrust investigation. The amendment uses language identical to the existing provisions covering material or information gained by subpoena and, therefore, it appears that the legislature intends to afford all of the different categories of material and information the same level of confidentiality. Specifically, pursuant to subsection (c) (2) of the amended statute, voluntarily produced material or information, as well as the identity of its provider, \u201cshall be held in the custody of the Attorney General, or the Attorney General\u2019s designee, and <em>shall not be available to the public.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)

The complaint also included counts, pleaded in the alternative, seeking: a writ of mandamus requiring the defendant to protect the confidentiality of the responsive material and information by not disclosing it in violation of \u00a7 35^42; an order quashing the subpoena or modifying it to provide safeguards to prevent the disclosure of the plaintiff\u2019s trade secrets and other confidential information; and a protective order preventing the defendant from disclosing those trade secrets and other confidential information. The trial court viewed each count of the plaintiffs complaint as raising the same legal issue, namely, the proper construction of \u00a7 35-42. Because we agree with that characterization, we need not consider separately the claims raised by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\"> The trial court held the defendant\u2019s application for an order of compliance in abeyance pending the resolution of the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\"> As an initial matter, the trial court rejected the plaintiffs claim that the defendant was precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from arguing that the meaning of \u00a7 3542 differed from the interpretation of the statute reached in <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Killian, </em>30 Conn. Sup. 87, 301 A.2d 562 (1973), because his office was a party to that action and did not challenge the court\u2019s holding by way of appeal. According to the trial court, the statutory interpretation in <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>was dicta and, therefore, the meaning of \u00a7 3542 was not necessarily determined for purposes of preclusion. The trial court noted additionally that the holding of <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>was overruled legislatively by the amendment of \u00a7 3542. See Public Acts 1973, No. 73-668. Although we agree with the trial court that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply to bar the defendant from relitigating the meaning of \u00a7 35-42, we do so on different reasoning. Specifically, we recently held that, for important policy reasons, nonmutual collateral estoppel cannot be employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>offensively against a government entity as it may in an action between private parties.

III, pp. III-68 through III-69. Additionally, the assistant attorney general in the present case acknowledged, when he attempted to negotiate with the plaintiff the terms to govern its compliance with the defendant\u2019s subpoena, that disclosure of subpoenaed material when deposing third party witnesses is necessary only \u201c[i]n very rare instances . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b757-6\"> Although the defendant has expressed concern over an interpretation of \u00a7 35-42 that would constrain his ability to reference subpoenaed materials in a complaint, we question whether that concern is warranted. Connecticut employs fact pleading, which requires that a \u201cpleading shall contain a plain and concise statement of the material facts on which the pleader relies, but not of the evidence by which they are to be proved . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 10-1. In accordance with this provision, \u201c[a]ttorneys in Connecticut are not required, at the time a pleading is filed, to substantiate the allegations contained therein with evidentiary support.\u201d <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>103 Conn.

To the contrary, inclusion of evidence in a complaint is a violation of our rules of practice. <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>Alves, </em>286 Conn. 264, 277 n.13, 943 A.2d 420 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b758-5\"> If the materials are obtained from a nonparty, the nonparty must be given notice that the materials have been lodged with the court so that it has an opportunity to intervene and contest their disclosure to the extent that it believes is warranted.

The judicial authority shall first consider reasonable alternatives to any such order and any such order shall be no broader than necessary to protect such overriding interest.

In such circumstances, requiring lodging of the records in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth in Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 7-4B and 7-4C will ensure that the records remain confidential until the court can enter an order pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-20A (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
