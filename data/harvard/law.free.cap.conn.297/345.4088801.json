The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) failed to apply the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in determining whether to terminate the plaintiffs alimony obligation, and (2) interpreted the term \u201ccohabitation,\u201d as used in the parties\u2019 separation agreement, as requiring proof of a romantic or sexual relationship between the defendant and the unrelated female with whom he resides. We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural background. The parties were married on November 8, 1975. On January 24, 2002, the plaintiff filed an action for the dissolution of the marriage on the ground that the marriage had broken down irretrievably with no hope of reconciliation. On October 23, 2002, the trial court rendered judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage. The judgment incorporated by reference a separation agreement that the parties had entered into on the same date. The agreement provided in relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>part that the plaintiff shall pay the defendant alimony in the amount of $125 per week and that \u201c[s]aid alimony shall terminate upon . . . the [defendant\u2019s] cohabitation with [an] unrelated female.\u201d The agreement further provided that \u201c[t]his alimony shall be non-modifiable as to term and amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In 2007, the plaintiff began to suspect that the defendant was residing with an unrelated female, and, on August 17, 2007, she hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance of the defendant to determine his current place of residence and whether anyone was residing with him at that residence. In September, 2007, the private investigator informed the plaintiff that the defendant was residing with Katie Crovo at 49 Iron Works Road in the town of Clinton. On the basis of this information, the plaintiff stopped paying alimony to the defendant in October, 2007, and, on February 14, 2008, the plaintiff filed a motion to terminate alimony. The defendant subsequently filed a motion for contempt on the ground that the plaintiff was in violation of the court\u2019s October 23, 2002 judgment for failure to pay alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">On June 13, 2008, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the parties\u2019 motions, at which the parties testified as to their respective understandings of the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d as used in the separation agreement. The plaintiff testified that she understood the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d to mean \u201cliving with and sharing expenses with\u201d another person. In her view, a romantic or sexual relationship is not required to satisfy the definition of \u201ccohabitation.\u201d In contrast, the defendant testified that he understood the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d to mean living together in a manner akin to husband and wife, such that a romantic or sexual relationship is required. In addition, the parties offered conflicting testimony regarding whether the meaning of the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d was discussed as a group between the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>and their attorneys when they executed the separation agreement. The defendant testified that such a discussion occurred and that the attorneys explained that the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d had a standard legal meaning that includes a romantic or sexual component. The plaintiff testified, however, that there was no discussion regarding the meaning of the term \u201ccohabitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The defendant also testified as to his living arrangements. Specifically, he admitted that, since November, 2006, he had been sharing a residence with Crovo, a female to whom he is not related. He further testified that he and Crovo each pay 50 percent of the rent and utilities for the residence. The defendant denied, however, that he ever had been in a romantic or sexual relationship with Crovo. To the contrary, the defendant testified that his relationship with Crovo, who is twenty-five years younger than him, is merely that of \u201ccoworkers who happen to live together.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, he testified that Crovo is romantically involved with another person, and that he and Crovo rarely socialize together. Finally, the defendant testified that the house in which he and Crovo reside has three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and that he and Crovo occupy different bedrooms and use different bathrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">On October 16, 2008, the trial court held oral argument on the parties\u2019 motions. The plaintiff argued that the Appellate Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Krichko </em>v. <em>Krichko, </em>108 Conn. App. 644, 948 A.2d 1092, cert. granted, 289 Conn. 913, 957 A.2d 877 (2008) (appeal withdrawn May 19, 2009), was \u201cexactly on point\u201d in that the plaintiff in <em>Krichko, </em>\u201cas in this case,\u201d was \u201cnot relying [on] the provisions of [\u00a7] 46b-86\u201d but, rather, based his motion to terminate alimony \u201csolely [on] language in [his] separation agreement that is very, very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>similar to the language in the Remillards\u2019 agreement.\u201d The plaintiff further agreed with the court that the meaning of the term \u201ccohabitation,\u201d as used in the parties\u2019 separation agreement, was a \u201cfactual issue,\u201d but added that <em>Krichko and Mihalyak </em>v. <em>Mihalyak, </em>30 Conn. App. 516, 620 A.2d 1327 (1993), nonetheless were instructive with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The trial court found that the term \u201ccohabitation,\u201d as used in the parties\u2019 separation agreement, \u201cwould require [the defendant] to be living with another adult female in circumstances akin to marriage, or at least in a romantic [or] sexual relationship,\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s living arrangements did not rise to that level. Accordingly, the trial court denied the plaintiffs motion to terminate alimony. The court further remarked that, in both <em>Krichko </em>and <em>Mihalyak, </em>the party receiving alimony was in a romantic relationship with the unrelated adult with whom she resided; thus, those cases did not present the issue of whether the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d <em>required </em>a sexual or romantic component. With regard to the defendant\u2019s motion for contempt, the court determined that the plaintiff was not in wilful contempt of the court\u2019s October 23, 2002 judgment because the court found that the plaintiff reasonably believed that her alimony obligation had ended under the terms of the separation agreement. Accordingly, the corut denied the motion for contempt. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The plaintiffs first claim is that the trial corut improperly failed to apply the statutory criteria set forth in \u00a7 46b-86 (b) in ruling on the plaintiffs motion to terminate alimony. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that our decision in <em>DeMaria </em>v. <em>DeMaria, </em>247 Conn. 715, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>724 A.2d 1088 (1999), is controlling and requires the trial court to consider the mandates and limitations of \u00a7 46b-86 (b) in terminating or modifying alimony, even when the language of the judgment of dissolution employs only the term \u201ccohabitation,\u201d without reference to any statute. The defendant responds that the plaintiff waived her claim regarding the application of \u00a7 46b-86 (b) to the present dispute because the plaintiff failed to satisfy the notice requirements set forth in \u00a7 46b-86 (b) and failed to invoke the statute as a basis for the termination of the defendant\u2019s alimony. We decline to reach the merits of this claim because the plaintiff failed to raise it in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u201cIt is well established that an appellate court is under no obligation to consider a claim that is not distinctly raised at the trial level. . . . [B]ecause our review is limited to matters in the record, we [also] will not address issues not decided by the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Karl &amp; Gelb, P.C., </em>252 Conn. 153, 170-71, 745 A.2d 178 (2000); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (\u201c[t]he court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial\u201d). \u201cThe requirement that [a] claim be raised distinctly means that it must be so stated as to bring to the attention of the court the <em>precise </em>matter on which its decision is being asked.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Colon, </em>82 Conn. App. 658, 659, 847 A.2d 315, cert. denied, 269 Conn. 915, 852 A.2d 745 (2004); accord <em>Sgueglia </em>v. <em>Milne Construction Co., </em>212 Conn. 427, 432 n.5, 562 A.2d 505 (1989); see also <em>McKiernan </em>v. <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 164, 166, 438 A.2d 865 (1981) (issue \u201cbriefly suggested\u201d in trial court is not distinctly raised). \u201cThe reason for the rule is obvious: to permit a party to raise a claim on appeal that has not been raised at trial \u2014 after it is too late for the trial court ... to address the claim \u2014 would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>encourage trial by ambuscade, which is unfair to both the trial court and the opposing party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dalzell, </em>282 Conn. 709, 720, 924 A.2d 809 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In the present case, a review of the transcripts from the June 13, 2008 evidentiary hearing and the October 16, 2008 oral argument on the motions reveal that the plaintiff not only failed to raise a claim under \u00a7 46b-86 (b) but also repeatedly advised and agreed with the trial court that that statute was not at issue. First, the plaintiff failed to invoke \u00a7 46b-86 (b) in her written motion to terminate alimony. That motion provides: \u201cPursuant to the <em>[j]udgment of [the trial] court </em>dated October 23, 2002, the [defendant's alimony terminates upon his cohabitation with an unrelated female. The [defendant is currently cohabitating and, therefore, the [p]laintiff moves to have his alimony terminated.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Notably, the plaintiffs motion fails to mention \u00a7 46b-86 (b) or otherwise apprise the court or the defendant that the plaintiff seeks relief under that statute. We previously have stated that \u201c\u00a7 46b-86 (b) is a separate and independent statutory basis for the modification of alimony and <em>is a claim [that] must be raised in a written motion </em>by the party seeking to modify the award of periodic alimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>191 Conn. 468, 478, 464 A.2d 837 (1983). In addition, Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 (a) provides in relevant part that, \u201c[w]hen any claim made in a . . . pleading is grounded on a statute, the statute shall be specifically identified by its number.\u201d The plaintiff has failed to comply with these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Moreover, during the evidentiary hearing and oral argument, the plaintiff repeatedly advised the trial court and agreed with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that her claim was being brought pursuant to the parties\u2019 separa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>tion agreement and not \u00a7 46b-86 (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clearly then, there can be no question that the plaintiff did not raise a claim pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 (b) before the trial court. Accordingly, we decline to reach the merits of her claim on appeal. \u201cTo reach a contrary conclusion would result in an ambush of the trial court by permitting the [plaintiff] to raise a claim on appeal that . . . her counsel expressly had abandoned in the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holness, </em>289 Conn. 535, 543, 958 A.2d 754 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The plaintiffs second claim is that the trial court improperly interpreted the term \u201ccohabitation,\u201d as used in the parties\u2019 separation agreement, as requiring proof of a romantic or sexual relationship.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>tends that our decision in <em>DeMaria </em>\u201cclearly eschewed the more narrow, traditional view of \u2018cohabitation\u2019 . . . as \u2018a dwelling together of man and woman in the same place in the manner of a husband and wife.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff further argues that \u201cthe burden of proving, even by circumstantial evidence, that a man and a woman, unrelated to each other, who reside under the same roof, are mere roommates or romantic partners, can be virtually insurmountable without an invasion of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The defendant responds that the trial court properly interpreted the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d as requiring proof of a romantic or sexual relationship. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the separation agreement\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ccohabitation <em>with [an] unrelated female\u201d-, </em>(emphasis added); evidences that the parties intended for the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d to encompass a romantic or sexual element; otherwise, it would have been unnecessary to describe the gender or relationship of the cohabitant. The defendant further argues that both parties were represented by counsel during the dissolution proceedings and had the opportunity to use or make reference to the broader language contained in \u00a7 46b-86 (b), i.e., \u201cliving with another person,\u201d but, instead, agreed to use the narrower language contained in the agreement. We conclude that the trial court properly construed the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d as used in the parties\u2019 separation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We begin our analysis of this claim by setting forth the applicable standard of review and principles of law. It is well established that a separation agreement, incorporated by reference into a judgment of dissolution, \u201cis to be regarded and construed as a contract.\u201d <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>250 Conn. 226, 235, 737 A.2d 383 (1999). Accordingly, our review of a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a separation agreement \u201cis guided by the general principles governing the construction of contracts.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cA contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. If a contract is unambiguous within its four comers, \u201cthe determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cWhen the language of a contract is ambiguous, [however] the determination of the parties\u2019 intent is a question of fact, and the trial court\u2019s interpretation is subject to reversal on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Honulik </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>293 Conn. 698, 711, 980 A.2d 880 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Accordingly, to determine our standard of review, we first must ascertain whether the term \u201ccohabitation,\u201d as used in the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, is ambiguous. This is a question of law over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Isham </em>v. <em>Isham, </em>292 Conn. 170, 181, 972 A.2d 228 (2009). \u201cContract language is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning . . . concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In contrast, an agreement is ambiguous when its language \u201cis reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation.\u201d Id. Nevertheless, \u201cthe mere fact that the parties advance different interpretations of the language in question does not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In the present case, the parties\u2019 separation agreement does not define the term \u201ccohabitation.\u201d Consequently, whether such a term is ambiguous turns on whether it has varying definitions in common parlance. See <em>Honulik </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>supra, 293 Conn. 710 (contractual language must be interpreted according to \u201cits common, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>natural, and ordinary meaning and usage\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). This court previously has observed that the word \u201ccohabitation\u201d is \u201cnot inflexible nor is it one of strict or narrow meaning.\u201d <em>DeMaria </em>v. <em>DeMaria, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 720. Although this court previously has defined cohabitation to be \u201ca dwelling together of man and woman in the same place in the manner of husband and wife\u201d; <em>Wolk </em>v. <em>Wolk, </em>191 Conn. 328, 332, 464 A.2d 780 (1983); and such definition echoes the definition of \u201ccohabitation\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary; see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we also are aware that Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary not only defines cohabitation in a similar manner but also contains a broader definition of \u201ccohabit,\u201d that is, \u201cto live together . . . .\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the term \u201ccohabitation,\u201d as used in the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation and, thus, is ambiguous. It follows, therefore, that we must apply the clearly erroneous standard of review to the trial court\u2019s determination of the meaning of the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d in the present case, which is a question of fact. See, e.g., <em>Honulik </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>supra, 711. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ravetto </em>v. <em>Triton Thalassic Technologies, Inc., </em>285 Conn. 716, 727, 941 A.2d 309 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In the present case, there is ample evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>term \u201ccohabitation\u201d as requiring a sexual or romantic relationship. At the evidentiary hearing, the defendant testified under oath that, when he entered into the separation agreement, it was his understanding that the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d meant living together in a manner akin to husband and wife. He further testified that, prior to the execution of the agreement, the parties and their respective counsel had had a discussion regarding the meaning of the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d and that counsel had explained that the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d had a standard legal meaning that includes a romantic or sexual component. Although the plaintiff offered conflicting testimony at that hearing, the court, as the trier of fact and thus the sole arbiter of credibility, was \u201cfree to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony offered by either party. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DiVito </em>v. <em>DiVito, </em>77 Conn. App. 124, 138, 822 A.2d 294, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 921, 828 A.2d 617 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Finally, we note that the trial court, in addition to relying on the testimonial evidence, also determined that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d was supported by other language in the separation agreement. Specifically, the court found that the agreement\u2019s use of the modifying phrase, \u201cwith [an] unrelated female,\u201d evidences that the parties intended for the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d to require a romantic or sexual relationship. Indeed, under the agreement, the defendant could cohabitate with a related female and the condition for terminating alimony would not be triggered. Accordingly, because the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d is supported by the evidence, and we are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Ravetto </em>v. <em>Triton Thalassic Technologies, Inc., </em>supra, 285 Conn. 727; we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A0a\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\"> The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b) provides: \u201cIn an action for divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment brought by a husband or wife, in which a final judgment has been entered providing for the payment of periodic alimony by one party to the other, the Superior Court may, in its discretion and upon notice and hearing, modify such judgment and suspend, reduce or terminate the payment of periodic alimony upon a showing that the party receiving the periodic alimony is living with another person under circumstances which the court finds should result in the modification, suspension, reduction or termination of alimony because the living arrangements cause such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\"> At the time of the hearing, the defendant and Crovo were both employed at the same supermarket.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> The defendant has not appealed from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for contempt.

We\u2019re just dealing with whether or not there\u2019s been cohabitation such that the alimony would terminate, is that correct?\u201d The plaintiffs counsel responded affirmatively to both questions. These exchanges are significant because \u00a7 46b-86 (b) requires a showing that the party receiving alimony \u201cis living with another person under circumstances which . . . alter the financial needs of that party.\u201d Thus, the response by the plaintiffs counsel that financial affidavits were unnecessary demonstrates that the plaintiff was not pursuing her claim for termination of alimony under \u00a7 46b-86 (b). Similarly, the failure of the plaintiff or the plaintiffs counsel, at the conclusion of the hearing, to respond when the trial court stated that it was its view that \u201cit doesn\u2019t look like we dealt with the statute here,\u201d further indicates that the plaintiff was not pursuing a statutory claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Various exchanges between the trial court and the plaintiffs counsel during oral argument on the motions also confirm that the plaintiff was not seeking relief pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 (b). Specifically, the court stated, \u201cI\u2019m not dealing with the statute,\u201d and the plaintiffs counsel responded, \u201c[r]ight.\u201d Furthermore, the plaintiffs counsel expressly argued that the Appellate Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Krichko </em>was \u201cexactly on point\u201d in that the plaintiff in <em>Krichko, \u201cas in this case,\" </em>was <em>\u201cnot relying [on] the provisions of </em>[#] <em>46b-86\u201d </em>but, rather, based his motion to terminate alimony <em>\u201csolely [on] language in [his] separation agreement that is very, very similar to the language in the Remillards\u2019 agreement.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\"> We note that the parties did not litigate whether the term \u201ccohabitation,\u201d as used in the parties\u2019 separation agreement, required proof of a change in the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b378-5\"> The sixth edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201ccohabitation\u201d as \u201c[t]o live together as husband and wife.
