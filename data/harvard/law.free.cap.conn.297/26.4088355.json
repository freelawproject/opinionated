Stuart and Jonathan Stuart, appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which upheld the trial court\u2019s application of the clear and convincing standard of proof to the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory theft claim against the named defendant, Kenneth J. Stuart, Jr.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>112 Conn. App. 160, 176, 962 A.2d 842 (2009). In their appeal, the plaintiffs assert that the proper standard of proof to be applied to statutory theft claims under \u00a7 52-564 is the preponderance of the evidence standard. We agree with the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>and, accordingly, reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The following relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cThe plaintiffs and [the defendant], are the only children and heirs of Kenneth J. Stuart, Sr. (Stuart, Sr.). In 1991, Stuart, Sr., executed an estate plan including the establishment and funding of a trust and the execution of a will that, upon his death, would have distributed his assets equally among his three sons. Stuart, Sr., had been the art director of Curtis Publishing Company, the publisher of The Saturday Evening Post, and, subsequently, the art director of . . . Reader\u2019s Digest. He had collected many antiques and [amassed] a significant art collection, including several famous works by Norman Rockwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u201cIn July, 1992, Stuart, Sr., was admitted to Norwalk Hospital. At that time, he was unable to give a medical history, and the hospital records indicated that he was suffering from a deteriorating mental condition. His physical and mental health progressively worsened until his death in February, 1993. Less than four months before his death, a series of transactions took place that materially altered the estate plan. On November 4, 1992, Stuart, Sr., and [the defendant] executed documents that formed Stuart &amp; Sons, L.P. They were the only general partners; the plaintiffs had no interest in the partnership and were not aware that it had been created. Stuart, Sr., by bill of sale, conveyed most of his personal property to the partnership. [The defendant], as trustee, through various transactions, transferred properties located in Wilton at Ridgefield Road, the former residence of Stuart, Sr., and at Hurlbutt Street, a new acquisition by the trust, to the partnership. As a consequence of those transactions, almost all of the assets of Stuart, Sr., were owned by the partnership, and the trust had few or no assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cSometime in August, 1993, after the death of Stuart, Sr., [the defendant] told the plaintiffs about the creation and funding of Stuart &amp; Sons, L.P. The partnership leased the Ridgefield Road and Hurlbutt Street properties and collected the rents. It acquired two additional properties in Wilton and, in 1993, formed a limited liability company to own a furniture store in Wilton known as Eldred Wheeler of Wilton, LLC . . . which later became known as Talbot House. In 1995, [the defendant] hired [Deborah] Christman to manage the furniture business. In June, 2000, they married. At about that time, Talbot House closed its business, and [the defendant] and Christman opened a new business, Christman Stuart Interiors, LLC, in Ridgefield. A portion of the inventory of Talbot House was transferred to Christman Stuart Interiors, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u201cFrom 1991 to 2003, thousands of transactions were undertaken by [the defendant], as trustee, executor and general partner of Stuart &amp; Sons, L.P. Most of the transactions occurred as part of the operations of the partnership, including its sale of the Hurlbutt Street property to [the defendant], and Christman for $900,000 in April, 2001.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During that twelve year period, [the defendant] commingled funds and assets of the trust and the partnership and his own assets to such an extent as to hinder any proper accounting. His failure to keep adequate records and his use of the trust assets for his benefit further complicated any accurate accounting of his fiduciary obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u201cThe plaintiffs commenced the present action in 1994. In their operative nine count complaint filed March 10, 2003, the plaintiffs alleged that [the defendant] exercised undue influence over Stuart, Sr., when real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>was purchased with trust assets and when Stuart &amp; Sons, L.P., was created and funded, and that Stuart, Sr., lacked the mental capacity to understand those transactions. They additionally alleged that [the defendant] breached his fiduciaiy duties as trustee, executor and general partner by mismanaging assets, failing to maintain records and self-dealing. The plaintiffs further claimed that the transfer by [the defendant] of the Hurl-butt Street property to Christman was a fraudulent conveyance, that the actions of [the defendant] constituted statutory theft pursuant to ... \u00a7 52-564 and that [the defendant], Christman and Christman Stuart Interiors, LLC, had been unjustly enriched by the misappropriation of the assets of the trust and estate. In their prayer for relief, the plaintiffs requested that the court impose a constructive trust on the assets of Stuart &amp; Sons, L.P., set aside the conveyance of the Hurlbutt Street property, award accounting fees and award money damages, including treble damages [pursuant to \u00a7 52-564] and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u201cDuring a twenty-five day trial, the court heard testimony from several witnesses and admitted twelve boxes of exhibits. Following trial, the parties submitted extensive . . . briefs summarizing their respective positions. On June 28,2004, the court issued its seventy-eight page memorandum of decision in which it painstakingly evaluated the evidence with respect to each of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and set forth the applicable remedies. The court made the following findings and conclusions with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims: (1) Stuart, Sr., was not mentally competent to execute the partnership documents and the other instruments that transferred his assets into Stuart &amp; Sons, L.P., in November, 1992; (2) the creation of the partnership and the resulting transfer of assets was the result of undue influence by [the defendant] over Stuart, Sr.; (3) [the defendant] owed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>capacities as trustee, executor and general partner of Stuart &amp; Sons, L.P., the limited partnership that acquired almost all of the assets of Stuart, Sr.; (4) [the defendant] breached his fiduciary duties through the commingling of funds and assets, by failing to maintain adequate records of his stewardship and by using trust assets for his benefit; (5) [the defendant] proved by clear and convincing evidence that certain expenditures were business related and were not improper personal expenditures; (6) the transfer of the Hurlbutt Street property to [the defendant] and Christman for the consideration of $900,000 did not constitute improper self-dealing; (7) the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof on their fraudulent conveyance claim; (8) the plaintiffs were required to prove their statutory theft claim by clear and convincing evidence; and (9) Christman Stuart Interiors, LLC, was unjustly enriched in the amount of $118,671, and was entitled to a setoff of $68,621.48.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u201cOn the basis of those findings and conclusions, the court set forth the following remedies: (1) the creation of Stuart &amp; Sons, L.P., was declared null and void; (2) all assets and liabilities of the partnership were to be transferred to the estate of Stuart, Sr., and a constructive trust was established over an undivided two-thirds of the assets and liabilities until the transfer was completed; (3) damages for the breach of fiduciary duties by [the defendant] totaled $1,062,332.25, and he was to pay that amount to the estate of Stuart, Sr.; (4) the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for [the] fraudulent transfer of the Hurl-butt Street property was dismissed; (5) with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory theft claim, [the trial court determined that $248,226.25 of the damages previously awarded for the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of fiduciary claims qualified for trebling under \u00a7 52-564 and, accordingly] an additional award of $496,452.50 . . . was to be paid to the estate of Stuart, Sr.;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (6) Christman Stuart Interi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ors, LLC, was unjustly enriched in the amount of $50,049.52, payable to the estate of Stuart, Sr.; (7) an award of attorney\u2019s fees was made, but the amount was to be determined at a subsequent hearing; (8) prejudgment interest in the amount of $636,743.63, calculated at a rate of 7.5 percent [per annum], was awarded to the estate of Stuart, Sr., for the breach of fiduciary duty claims; and (9) an award of $180,000, for accounting fees, incurred to prove the breach of fiduciary duty claims, was to be paid to the estate of Stuart, Sr. Accordingly, the [trial] court rendered judgment for money damages against [the defendant] in the amount of $2,375,528.38, and against Christman Stuart Interiors, LLC, in the amount of $60,539.19, to be paid to the estate of Stuart, Sr.\u201d Id., 165-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In addition, in recognition of the fact that the issue of the proper standard of proof to be applied to statutory theft claims was then pending before this court in <em>Howard v. MacDonald, </em>270 Conn. 111, 851 A.2d 1142 (2004),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the trial court determined what additional damages would be subject to trebling if the preponderance of the evidence standard were applied to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The trial court concluded that, \u201cunder the lesser standard, the amount of $490,755 in nonexistent credit [that the defendant] had applied to pay for his share of the Hurlbutt Street [property] . . . would qualify as damages to be trebled.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Thereafter, the defendant appealed and the plaintiffs cross appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In their cross appeal, the plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, that the trial court awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>them insufficient damages because it improperly had required them to prove their statutory theft claim under \u00a7 52-564 by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>supra, 112 Conn. App. 173. The plaintiffs argued that the proper standard of proof for claims asserted under that statute is the preponderance of the evidence standard. Id. The Appellate Court disagreed, concluding that its decision in <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Lindy, </em>8 Conn. App. 96, 105, 511 A.2d 1022 (1986), which held that the clear and convincing evidence standard applied to claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-564, never had been overruled. <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>supra, 175-76. Accordingly, the Appellate Court upheld the trial court\u2019s application of that standard in the present case; id., 176; and affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Id., 190. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The plaintiffs claim that the proper standard of proof for statutory theft claims is the preponderance of the evidence standard. In support of their claim, the plaintiffs claim that, although \u00a7 52-564 does not specify what standard of proof is to be applied, when the legislature has not imposed a different standard of proof by statute, courts are to construe the applicable standard of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>to be the general civil standard, that is, the preponderance of the evidence standard. In addition, the plaintiffs argue that certain dictum in our decision in <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>221 Conn. 674, 682-83, 607 A.2d 370 (1992), clearly indicates that the Appellate Court\u2019s holding in <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Lindy, </em>supra, 8 Conn. App. 96, is unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The defendant responds that the Appellate Court properly upheld the trial court\u2019s application of the clear and convincing evidence standard to the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory theft claim. First, the defendant argues <em>that Schaffer </em>never has been overruled and that the weight of Connecticut authority has applied the clear and convincing standard of proof. Specifically, the defendant argues that, after our decision in <em>Freeman, </em>numerous Superior and Appellate Court cases have followed the holding in <em>Schaffer </em>and that the legislature has acquiesced in that holding because it has taken no steps to modify the statute since <em>Schaffer </em>was decided in 1986. In addition, the defendant claims that this court has \u201cpermitted\u201d the Appellate Court and the Superior Court to apply the clear and convincing standard of proof to claims under \u00a7 52-564 in declining to decide the issue of the applicable standard of proof in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 111. Second, the defendant claims that there are significant public policy reasons that support the application of the clear and convincing standard of proof. In particular, the defendant claims that \u00a7 52-564, which provides for an award of treble damages, is akin to \u201ca punitive sanction,\u201d and \u201cpunitive sanctions historically have fallen under the purview of the state in enforcing its criminal laws.\u201d Moreover, the defendant claims that the heightened standard of proof is appropriate in light of the \u201cserious consequences\u201d and \u201charsh or far-reaching effects\u201d that an adverse finding would have on defendants. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Finally, the defendant argues that other juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>dictions that have addressed similar issues have applied the clear and convincing standard of proof. We agree with the plaintiffs and respond to each of the defendant\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The issue of what standard of proof is applicable to statutory theft claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-564 initially presents a question of statutory interpretation, over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>291 Conn. 556, 566, 969 A.2d 698 (2009); see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Muellner, </em>283 Conn. 510, 536, 932 A.2d 382 (2007) (\u201c[w]henaparty contests the burden of proof applied by the trial court, the standard of review is de novo because the matter is a question of law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Firtel, </em>293 Conn. 515, 525, 978 A.2d 487 (2009). \u201cIn seeking to determine [the] meaning [of a statute], General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cWhen a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McWeeny </em>v. Hartford, 287 Conn. 56, 66, 946 A.2d 862 (2008). \u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>289 Conn. 769, 779, 961 A.2d 349 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statute. General Statutes \u00a7 52-564 provides: \u201cAny person who steals any property of another, or knowingly receives and conceals stolen property, shall pay the owner treble his damages.\u201d The statute is silent with respect to what standard of proof is to be applied. Although \u201c[statutory] silence does not . . . necessarily equate to ambiguity\u201d; <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 410, 419, 862 A.2d 292 (2004); in the present case, we conclude that this silence renders the statute ambiguous with respect to the applicable standard of proof because there is more than one plausible interpretation of its meaning. See, e.g., <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Gailno, </em>275 Conn. 290, 298-99, 880 A.2d 127 (2005) (statutory silence created ambiguity when more than one plausible meaning could be gleaned from text). Accordingly, we may consider the full panoply of available materials with which to interpret the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The legislative history of \u00a7 52-564 sheds no light on the legislature\u2019s intent regarding the applicable standard of proof. There is no written legislative history dating back to the 1800s, when this statute first was enacted, and the legislative history relating to the statute\u2019s later amendments likewise offers no insight into the legislature\u2019s intent with respect to this issue. We therefore turn to other existing legislation and common-law principles for interpretive guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">It is well established that \u201c[t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or <em>non-action </em>will have [on] any one of them.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 717, 674 A.2d 845 (1996). With regard to nonaction, \u201cthe general rule [is] that when a civil statute is silent as to the applicable standard of proof, the preponderance of the evidence standard governs factual determinations required by that statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 295-96, 641 A.2d 370 (1994). This rule applies equally to statutes that provide for multiple damages. See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>supra, 221 Conn. 683 (applying preponderance of evidence standard to claim for statutory punitive damages under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47a-43 and 47a-46 and stating that \u201c[a]bsent evidence of legislative intent to the contrary, we continue to presume that when a statutory private right of action includes multiple damages, the plaintiffs burden of proof is the same as that in other tort cases\u201d); see also <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>32 Conn. App. 133, 137-38, 628 A.2d 25 (1993) (applying preponderance of evidence standard to claim for punitive damages under Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g). Accordingly, when the legislature has intended to impose a different standard of proof in a civil statute, it has seen fit to include explicit language in the statute to effectuate that intent. The General Statutes are replete with such examples.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Clearly, then, the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ture knows how to impose a heightened standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>proof when it so intends. See, e.g., <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection </em>Commission, 284 Conn. 268, 299, 933 A.2d 256 (2007) (legislature knows how to convey its intent expressly). We therefore conclude that the absence of statutory language in \u00a7 52-564 regarding the applicable standard of proof evidences the legislature\u2019s intent that the preponderance of the evidence standard be applied. See <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Firtel, </em>supra, 293 Conn. 527 (\u201cwhen a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We are aware, however, of one notable exception to the general rule. The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 52-552a et seq., is silent with respect to the applicable standard of proof; nevertheless, Connecticut courts have applied the clear and convincing standard of proof to claims brought pursuant to the act. See, e.g., <em>Kaczynski </em>v. <em>Kaczynski, </em>294 Conn. 121, 125-26, 981 A.2d 1068 (2009); <em>Gaudio </em>v. <em>Gaudio, </em>23 Conn. App. 287, 307, 580 A.2d 1212 (predecessor to \u00a7 52-552a), cert. denied, 217 Conn. 803, 584 A.2d 471 (1990). Our case law, however, is not clear as to why the heightened standard is imposed. One possible explanation is that the original fraudulent conveyance statute was intended to be a codification of English common-law principles relating to the interpretation of \u201cthe statute of the 13th of Elizabeth, chap. 5\u201d; <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>8. Conn. 186, 189 (1830); and, at common law, fraud must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., <em>Kilduff </em>v. <em>Adams, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 314, 330, 593 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>A.2d 478 (1991). Similarly, the act presently provides that \u201cthe principles of law and equity, including . . . the law relating to . . . <em>fraud . . . </em>supplement the provisions of [the act].\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-552k.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In the present case, \u00a7 52-564 does not contain any language similar to that used by the legislature in \u00a7 52-552k, which supplements the act with principles of law and equity relating to fraud. Accordingly, we conclude that the statutes are distinguishable and should be interpreted differently. In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful that \u201c[statutory theft under ... \u00a7 52-564 is synonymous with larceny [as defined in] General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Hi-Ho Tower, Inc. </em>v. <em>Com-Tronics, Inc., </em>255 Conn. 20, 44, 761 A.2d 1268 (2000); and the definition of larceny includes various fraudulent methods of taking property from its owner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it is well established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>that \u201c[n]o higher standard of proof is required when a plaintiff seeks to prove criminal activity in a civil action . . . .\u201d <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>supra, 221 Conn. 682. In addition, a review of our case law on the development of the standard of proof in fraud actions compels us to question the soundness of those prior decisions, although we need not decide in the present case whether they should be overruled. Specifically, it appears that the standard of proof for fraud vacillated several times in the 1920s and 1930s between the preponderance of the evidence standard and the clear and convincing standard, with no explanation ever being given for the imposition of the higher standard of proof. See <em>Kilduff </em>v. <em>Adams, Inc., </em>supra, 219 Conn. 327-28 n.14 (surveying cases). Moreover, it does not appear that any of the typical explanations offered for the imposition of a higher standard of proof played a role in our decisions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id. Consequently, we are loath to extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the application of the clear and convincing standard of proof further, to claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-564. In the absence of a statutory mandate, the proper standard of proof, therefore, is the preponderance of the evidence standard. We therefore overrule the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Lindy, </em>supra, 8 Conn. App. 105, with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s arguments in support of his claim that the clear and convincing standard of proof should apply to statutory theft claims. The defendant first argues that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schaffer </em>never has been overruled and that the weight of Connecticut authority has applied the clear and convincing standard of proof. The defendant specifically argues that (1) although our decision in <em>Freeman </em>was critical of <em>Schaffer, </em>it did not overrule it, and, since <em>Freeman </em>was decided, numerous Superior and Appellate Court cases have followed the holding in <em>Schaffer, </em>(2) the legislature has acquiesced in the Appellate Court\u2019s holding in <em>Schaffer, </em>it having taken no steps to modify \u00a7 52-564 since <em>Schaffer </em>was decided in 1986, and (3) this court has \u201cpermitted\u201d the Appellate Court and the Superior Court to apply the clear and convincing standard of proof to claims under \u00a7 52-564 by declining to decide the issue of the applicable standard of proof in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 130. We are unpersuaded by these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>First, it is of no import that the Superior Court and the Appellate Court have continued to apply the holding in <em>Schaffer </em>after <em>Freeman </em>was decided. Although we explicitly stated in <em>Freeman </em>that we disagreed with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Schaffer, Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>supra, 221 Conn. 682-83; that statement was dictum and had no binding effect because <em>Freeman </em>and <em>Schaffer </em>concerned different statutes and the statement went beyond the issue involved in <em>Freeman. </em>See id., 675 (determining whether entitlement to statutory damages under \u00a7 47a-46 may be established by preponderance of evidence). See generally <em>Valeriano </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>209 Conn. 75, 91, 546 A.2d 1380 (1988) (\u201cdiscussion in a judicial opinion that goes beyond the facts involved in the issues is mere dictum and does not have the force of precedent\u201d). Accordingly, we would expect that the Superior Court would continue to apply the holding of <em>Schaffer, </em>as it must. See, e.g., <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>44 Conn. App. 439, 443, 689 A.2d 1150 (1997) (Appellate Court decisions are \u201ccontrolling precedent until overruled or qualified\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), aff'd, 244 Conn. 189, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998). Similarly, we would expect that the Appellate Court would continue to apply its holding in <em>Schaffer </em>unless it was asked to decide the same issue in a subsequent appeal and \u201ca clear showing [is made] that [the] established rule is incorrect and harmful . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>DiFano, </em>109 Conn. App. 679, 687, 952 A.2d 848 (\u201c[Appellate] [C]ourt\u2019s policy dictates that one panel should not, on its own, [overrule] the ruling of a previous panel. The [overruling] may be accomplished only if the appeal is heard en banc.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]), cert. denied, 289 Conn. 937, 958 A.2d 1246 (2008). In any event, it is manifest to our hierarchical judicial system that this court has the final say on matters of Connecticut law and that the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>and Superior Court are bound by our precedent. See, e.g., <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>237 Conn. 184, 195, 676 A.2d 831 (1996) (\u201c[i]t is axiomatic that a trial court is bound by Supreme Court precedent\u201d); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Plainville, </em>40 Conn. App. 179, 182, 669 A.2d 1241 (1996) (Appellate Court, as intermediate court, is prevented from \u201creexamining or reevaluating Supreme Court precedent\u201d), aff'd, 240 Conn. 105, 689 A.2d 1125 (1997); <em>Lash </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>36 Conn. App. 623, 624, 652 A.2d 526 (1995) (Appellate Court is \u201cbound by Supreme Court precedent\u201d), aff'd, 236 Conn. 318, 673 A.2d 84 (1996). Accordingly, it is inconsequential to our analysis whether the weight of Connecticut authority in lower court cases has applied the clear and convincing standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument concerning legislative acquiescence also is unavailing. We have recognized that \u201clegislative inaction [following our interpretation of a statute] is not necessarily legislative affirmation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>287 Conn. 509, 521, 949 A.2d 1092 (2008). Indeed, we frequently have stated that \u201clegislative inaction is not always the best of guides to legislative intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 522. Thus, we occasionally have overruled both civil and criminal cases involving the construction of statutes, \u201ceven when the legislature has had numerous occasions to reconsider [our] interpretation and has failed to do so.\u201d <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 662, 680 A.2d 242 (1996); see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 666-67, 888 A.2d 985 (overruling prior case law interpreting 1976 amendment to criminal statute of limitations applicable to felonies as applying prospectively only), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>274 Conn. 727, 733-34, 878 A.2d 1118 (2005) (overruling this court's prior interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 [a] [3]); <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Wash</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>ington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 538-39, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002) (overruling prior cases concerning exhaustion doctrine as applied to Connecticut Environmental Protection Act); <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>257 Conn. 587, 589, 778 A.2d 875 (2001) (overruling this court\u2019s prior interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 [a]); <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 201-202, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998) (overruling prior interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 37-9 [3] because that interpretation created irreconcilable conflict between civil and criminal provisions of usury law); <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 215, 682 A.2d 106 (1996) (concluding that our previous interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-228b was flawed); <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 662-63 (overruling prior interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-557f [3] as applied to municipalities).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In the present case, the argument in favor of legislative acquiescence is particularly weak because \u201cthe legislative acquiescence doctrine requires <em>actual acquiescence </em>on the part of the legislature. [Thus] [i]n most of our prior cases, we have employed the doctrine not simply because of legislative inaction, but because the legislature affirmatively amended the statute subsequent to a judicial or administrative interpretation, but chose not to amend the specific provision of the statute at issue.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Berkley </em>v. <em>Gavin, </em>253 Conn. 761, 776-77 n.11, 756 A.2d 248 (2000). \u201cIn other words, [legislative concurrence is particularly strong [when] the legislature makes unrelated amendments in the same statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 525. In the present case, we find it significant that \u00a7 52-564 has not been amended since 1963. Accordingly, there has been no actual acquiescence on the part of the legislature in reaction to the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schaffer, </em>which was published in 1986. We therefore conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>that the doctrine of legislative acquiescence has little persuasive value in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Finally, we are troubled by the defendant\u2019s argument that this court has \u201cpermitted\u201d the Appellate Court and the Superior Court to apply the clear and convincing standard of proof to claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-564 by declining to decide the issue of the applicable standard of proof in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 111. In <em>Howard, </em>we determined that it was not necessary to decide what standard of proof applied to statutory theft claims under \u00a7 52-564 because we concluded that, even under the heightened burden, the plaintiff in that case provided sufficient evidence of his claim. Id., 130. The defendant\u2019s argument suggests that, by <em>not deciding </em>the standard of proof issue in <em>MacDonald, </em>we implicitly gave our imprimatur to the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schaffer. </em>To be clear, we are more than capable of deciding an issue when we determine that it is necessary or appropriate to do so. Indeed, \u201csound principles of judicial restraint and judicial economy counsel [an appellate court] to resolve only those issues that are necessary to the proper determination of [an] appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>102 Conn. App. 105, 113 n.4, 925 A.2d 385 (2007), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 293 Conn. 406, 978 A.2d 64 (2009). Accordingly, our decision not to decide an issue should not be construed as our endorsement of the status quo. This is particularly true in this instance because our dictum in <em>Freeman </em>was, in fact, highly critical of <em>Schaffer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The defendant next claims that there are significant public policy reasons that support the application of the clear and convincing standard of proof. In particular, the defendant claims that \u00a7 52-564, which provides for an award of treble damages, is akin to a punitive sanction, and \u201cpunitive sanctions historically have fallen under the purview of the state in enforcing its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>criminal laws.\u201d In addition, the defendant claims that the heightened standard of proof is appropriate in light of the \u201cserious consequences\u201d and \u201charsh or far-reaching effects\u201d that an adverse finding would have on defendants. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Our case law has previously rejected both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u201cThis court long ago declared that [\u00a7 52-564] has never been regarded as a penal statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>A-G Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farm, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 200, 219, 579 A.2d 69 (1990), quoting <em>Plumb </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>74 Conn. 132, 135, 50 A. 1 (1901). \u201cPenal statutes, strictly and properly, are those imposing punishment for an offense against the [s]tate. ... [A] statute which gives no more than a right of action to the party injured to recover increased damages, is not a penal statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Plumb </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>supra, 134-35. Thus, \u201c[a]bsent evidence of legislative intent to the contrary, we continue to presume that when a statutory private right of action includes multiple damages, the plaintiffs burden of proof is the same as that in other tort cases\u201d; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>supra, 221 Conn. 683; that is, the preponderance of the evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">This court, likewise, has considered and rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that a heightened standard of proof is appropriate in light of the \u201cserious consequences\u201d and \u201charsh or far-reaching effects\u201d that an adverse finding would have on defendants. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) \u201cOur common law cases have . . . rejected the premise that the risk of stigmatization of the defendant automatically requires a higher standard of proof to be imposed [on] the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>supra, 221 Conn. 681. Since the 1800s, this court has held that, in civil cases, \u201cthe mere preponderance of evidence\u201d standard is applicable, \u201ceven though the result imputes [to the defendant] the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>of a felony.\u201d <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Husted, </em>52 Conn. 53, 56 (1884) (applying preponderance of evidence standard to civil claim for arson). Similarly, in <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>207 Conn. 48, 539 A.2d 995 (1988), a case in which a custody order was based on a finding that a parent had sexually abused his child; id., 51; we acknowledged the \u201csubstantial social stigma\u201d that ensues upon such a finding but concluded nonetheless \u201cthat a preponderance of the evidence standard adequately protects a parent from false accusations of sexual abuse, and that the ordinary civil standard of proof better serves the strong societal interest in protecting children from abusive parents.\u201d Id., 52. In the present case, the stigma imposed on the defendant is considerably less than that imposed on the parent in <em>Mallory </em>and no greater than that imposed on the defendant in <em>Mead. </em>Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument that a heightened standard of proof is appropriate in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The defendant finally claims that other jurisdictions that have addressed similar issues have applied the clear and convincing standard of proof. In support of this claim, the defendant first cites to an annotation from American Law Reports; annot., Standard of Proof as to Conduct Underlying Punitive Damages Awards\u2014 Modem Status, 58 A.L.R.4th 878, 888-89 (1987); and to various cases discussed therein,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for the proposition that the clear and convincing standard of proof applies to claims for punitive damages. We are unpersuaded by these authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">At the outset, we note that this American Law Reports annotation and the supplement thereto also contain discussion of numerous cases that agree with our conclusion that the preponderance of the evidence stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>dard of proof generally applies to claims for punitive damages. Id., 888; annot., 58 A.L.R.4th, supra, pp. 84-85 (Sup. 2009); see, e.g., <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Clayton Brokerage Co., </em>975 F.2d 539, 541 (8th Cir. 1992) (applying Missouri law), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 916, 113 S. Ct. 1272, 122 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1993); <em>American Funeral Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hubbs, </em>700 So. 2d 283, 286 (Miss. 1997); <em>United Nuclear Corp. </em>v. <em>Allendale Mutual Ins. Co., </em>103 N.M. 480, 484-85, 709 P.2d 649 (1985); <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Durrill, </em>714 S.W.2d 329, 347 (Tex. App. 1986). Moreover, we previously reviewed this exact American Law Reports annotation in connection with our decision in <em>Freeman </em>and concluded at that time that claims for multiple damages need only be proven by the preponderance of the evidence standard. In <em>Freeman, </em>we stated: \u201cA number of jurisdictions require clear and convincing evidence for the award of punitive damages. . . . Most of these jurisdictions, however, have adopted this standard by statute rather than by judicial decision . . . and most of these statutes reflect a legislative response to a well publicized, dramatic increase in the size and frequency of punitive damages awards. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u201cWhatever the validity of the concerns about boundless punitive damages may be elsewhere, the risk of unfair and excessive punitive damages awards is substantially limited in this state by routine constraints on the amount of punitive damages. The Connecticut courts have . . . consistently limited punitive or exemplary damage awards in Connecticut to costs in excess of taxable costs. . . . There are statutory exceptions to this rule, such as [General Statutes] \u00a7 47a-46 .... <em>The legislature has not, however, established any statutory linkage between a right to recover punitive damages and a higher standard of </em>proof.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>supra, 221 Conn. 679-80. Our conclusion and view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>authorities contained in the American Law Reports annotation have not changed since our decision in <em>Freeman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The defendant next calls our attention to Florida Stat. \u00a7 772.11 (2007), which provides a civil remedy for theft. The Florida statute is similar to \u00a7 52-564 but differs in one key respect. The Florida statute <em>explicitly provides </em>that a plaintiff must prove his claim by clear and convincing evidence,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> whereas \u00a7 52-564 is silent with respect to the applicable standard of proof. In our view, the Florida statute does not support the defendant\u2019s claim. We are well aware that there is variation among the jurisdictions with respect to the applicable standard of proof to claims for multiple damages. We conclude, however, with respect to the issue of statutory interpretation, that the Florida statute is further evidence of the fact that when a legislature intends to impose a higher standard of proof in a civil statute, it will include explicit language in the statute to effectuate that intent. In the present case, our legislature did not include such language in \u00a7 52-564. Accordingly, we apply the preponderance of the evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The defendant\u2019s last argument concerns the Texas Theft Liability Act. See Texas Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 134.001 et seq. (Vernon 2005). The Texas Theft Liability Act provides victims of a theft, as defined in various sections of the Texas Penal Code, with a civil action to recover actual damages, attorney\u2019s fees, costs and, \u201cin addition to actual damages, damages awarded by the trier of fact in a sum not to exceed $1000 . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 134.005 (a) (1) (Vernon 2005). The statute is silent with regard to the applicable burden of proof. Nevertheless, it has been interpreted to require mere proof by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>In re </em>Powers, 261 Fed. Appx. 719, 721 (5th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[u]nder Texas law . . . silence mitigates in favor of applying the same burden of proof as [in] any other civil action \u2014 the preponderance of the evidence standard\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>El Paso Refining, Inc. </em>v. <em>Scurlock Permian Corp., </em>77 S.W.3d 374, 381 (Tex. App. 2002, pet. denied) (\u201cthe clear and convincing standard is mandated only in circumstances [in which] clear statutory language permits its application\u201d). The defendant claims that the Texas Theft Liability Act differs significantly from \u00a7 52-564 because it contains a $1000 cap on damages that are permitted over and above the plaintiffs actual damages, whereas \u00a7 52-564 contains no such cap. The defendant argues that \u00a7 52-564, therefore, is analogous to a civil fine, which makes the imposition of a higher standard of proof appropriate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We already have rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 52-564 is penal in nature. In addition, our analysis is not altered by virtue of the fact that \u00a7 52-564 does not contain a cap on treble damages. We previously have held that the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof applies to other statutes that provide for multiple damages, even though they do not contain a cap. See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>supra, 221 Conn. 678 (preponderance standard is applicable to claims for statutory punitive damages pursuant to \u00a7 47a-46); <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 137-38 (preponderance standard is applicable to claims for punitive damages under \u00a7 42-110g).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed with respect to the issue of the burden of proof applicable to statutory theft claims under \u00a7 52-564 and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse in part the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-10\"> We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly affirm the trial court\u2019s application of the \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 standard of proof to claims brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-564?\u201d <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>290 Conn. 920, 966 A.2d 237 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-564 provides: \u201cAny person who steals any property of another, or knowingly receives and conceals stolen property, shall pay the owner treble his damages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b50-12\"> Kenneth' J.

Jur. 2d, Fraud and Deceit \u00a7 468, p. 646; 37 C.J.S., Fraud \u00a7 114, p. 431; (2) evidence of fraud must be sufficient to overcome the presumption that people are innocent of moral turpitude or crime; <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>207 Conn. 179, 183, 540 A.2d 693 (1988); [see also] <em>Apolito </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>3 Ariz. App. 232, 236, 413 P.2d 291, modified on other grounds, 3 Ariz. App. 358, 414 P.2d 442 (1966); 37 C.J.S., Fraud \u00a7 114, p. 430; (3) in equity cases, a higher burden of proof is imposed to justify the availability of broader remedies than those available in an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>at law for damages; <em>Batka </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>704 F.2d 684, 688 (3d Cir. 1983) (applying New Jersey law); C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. [1984]) \u00a7 340; and (4) a person found guilty of fraudulent conduct suffers a \u2018stigma of guilt\u2019 regardless of whether the underlying action was civil or criminal. <em>Riley Hill General Contractor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tandy [Corp.], </em>303 Or. 390, 407, 737 P.2d 595 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u201cA review of the case law on the development of the burden of proof in fraud actions sheds no light on which, if any, of these factors were determinative in this court\u2019s adoption of the \u2018clear, precise and unequivocal\u2019 standard. In <em>Basak </em>v. <em>Damutz, </em>105 Conn. 378, 382-83, 135 A. 453 (1926), we applied the \u2018clear, precise and unequivocal\u2019 standard to the plaintiffs claim that the defendant was equitably estopped from denying ownership of certain land on the ground that the defendant was party to a fraudulent conveyance. That standard was applied for the first time to an action at law for damages resulting from fraud in <em>Shaub </em>v. <em>Phillips, Inc., </em>117 Conn. 54, 58, 166 A. 671 (1933), citing <em>Basak </em>v. <em>Damutz, </em>supra, 382. <em>Shaub </em>implicitly overruled prior case law in which we had indicated that fraud need be proven only by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Daly Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Spallone, </em>114 Conn. 236, 240-43, 158 A. 237 (1932); see <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>55 Conn. 450, 454, 12 A. 99 (1887); cf. <em>Water Commissioners </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>82 Conn. 623, 640, 74 A. 938 (1910) (fraud must be proven by \u2018clear, strong, natural, and logical\u2019 evidence, but the fact that fraud is not to be presumed does not add to the plaintiffs burden of proof). The <em>Shaub </em>court, however, gave no explanation of why it was imposing the higher standard. <em>Shaub </em>v. <em>Phillips, Inc., </em>supra [58].</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u201cIt does not appear that any of the four reasons noted [previously] provide a clear explanation for our imposition of a higher burden of proof. We had recognized the latitude allowed in the admission of evidence of fraudulent conduct long before we imposed a higher burden of proof in fraud actions. See, e.g., <em>Robert </em>v. <em>Finberg, </em>85 Conn. 557, 562, 84 A. 366 (1912); <em>Hoxie </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>32 Conn. 21, 37 (1864). Similarly, our recognition of the role played by circumstantial evidence in proving fraud predates our decision in <em>Shaub </em>.... See, e.g., <em>Sallies </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>85 Conn. 77, 80-81, 81 A. 974 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u201cWe have also rejected the suggestion that proof of criminal activity in a civil action requires a more stringent quantum of proof. <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>supra, [207 Conn.] 183, citing <em>Mead v. Husted, </em>52 Conn. 53 (1884), and <em>Munson </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>30 Conn. 102 (1861). Similarly, we have stated that the fact that fraud is not to be presumed does not serve to increase the burden of proof otherwise applicable to a plaintiff in a fraud action. <em>O\u2019Dea v. Amodeo, </em>118 Conn. 58, 60, 170 A. 486 (1934); <em>Water Commissioners </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>supra [82 Conn. 640], Moreover, this rule was part of our law [whereas] the preponderance of the evidence standard was still the burden of proof in fraud actions. See <em>Morford </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>46 Conn. 380, 384-85 (1878); <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>39 Conn. 540, 557 (1873).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u201cThe third rationale for imposing a higher burden of proof for fraud was clearly not relevant in the development of our case law. Ever since the \u2018clear, precise and unequivocal standard\u2019 was first applied to an action at law for fraud in <em>Shaub </em>... we have required a higher burden in legal as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>well as equitable actions. See, e.g., <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>183 Conn. 51, 55, 438 A.2d 811 (1981); <em>DeLuca </em>v. <em>C. W. Blakeslee &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>174 Conn. 535, 546, 391 A.2d 170 (1978); <em>Creelman </em>v. <em>Rogowski, </em>152 Conn. 382, 384, 207 A.2d 272 (1965). Finally, although we have never discussed the stigma attached to aEegations of fraud, it is not clear whether this rationale is distinct from the previously noted presumption that one is innocent of criminal or morally base acts.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Kilduff </em>v. <em>Adams, Inc., </em>supra, 219 Conn. 327-29 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Less than one year after our decision in <em>Kilduff, </em>we formally rejected the premise that the risk of stigmatization of the defendant requires a higher standard of proof to be imposed on the plaintiff.

See <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>supra, 112 Conn. App. 175-76. The Appellate Court concluded that our holding in <em>Freeman </em>was not applicable because the multiple damages provision of \u00a7 52-564 contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>mandatory language that requires the court to award treble damages, whereas the comparable provision in \u00a7 47a-46 contains discretionary language. See id.

Although this single factor weighs in favor of a heightened standard of proof, we conclude that the countervailing factors that we previously discussed in interpreting \u00a7 52-564 weigh more heavily in support of the application of the preponderance of the evidence standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
