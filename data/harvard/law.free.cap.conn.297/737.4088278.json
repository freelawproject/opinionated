Specifically, we must determine whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the intervenor in the underlying neglect action, Stephanie E. (intervenor), did not have a right to call and cross-examine witnesses and otherwise to participate fully at the hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motion to revoke Shanaira\u2019s commitment. The intervenor contends that she was improperly denied that right both as a matter of procedural due process and under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (m),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> both of which, the intervenor maintains, require a full evidentiary hearing on any contested motion to revoke commitment. We agree with the intervenor\u2019s statutory claim<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, therefore, need not reach her constitutional claim. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Many of the relevant facts and procedural history, which are undisputed, are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cOn March 28,2006, the commissioner filed a neglect petition and motion for an order of temporary custody of Shanaira on the basis of allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>of medical and educational neglect, as well as domestic violence and drug abuse by the [respondent] father. The court granted the order. At that time, Shanaira had been residing with her father and his girlfriend, the intervenor. On April 3, 2006, the intervenor filed a motion to intervene, which was granted by the court <em>[A. Santos, J.] </em>on May 9, 2006. On July 6, 2006, the intervenor filed a motion to transfer guardianship of Shanaira to herself, and, on September 18, 2006, she filed a motion for visitation. The court consolidated the trial of these motions with the trial of the neglect petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\u201cAfter three days of trial, on October 17, 2006, the court <em>[Wollenberg, J.]</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>adjudicated Shanaira neglected. The court also denied the intervenor\u2019s motions for guardianship and visitation. On November 2, 2006, the court committed Shanaira to the custody of the commissioner. The court continued the matter to December 15, 2006. In doing so, the court expressed its intention to send Shanaira to Florida to live with the respondent mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">\u201cOn December 12, 2006, the commissioner filed a motion to revoke the commitment of Shanaira on the ground that reunification with the respondent mother, in Florida, was in the child\u2019s best interest. The motion to revoke was heard on December 15, 2006, and all parties were present. The commissioner submitted to the court a status report, a report from Shanaira\u2019s therapist and a report from the [respondent] mother\u2019s therapist. The intervenor opposed the motion to revoke and informed the court that she would be calling witnesses, including her [own] mother and Shanaira\u2019s aunt, who was also [Shanaira\u2019s] foster mother. [The intervenor explained that the testimony of those witnesses would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u2018show that there ha[d] been a terrible decline in [Shanaira\u2019s] behavior and her schoolwork,\u2019 and that this \u2018new evidence\u2019 of a \u2018significant deterioration\u2019 in Shanaira\u2019s well-being bore directly on the issue of whether revoking Shanaira\u2019s conunitment was in her best interest.] The attorney for [Shanaira] also indicated that she [planned on calling] one witness, [namely] Shanaira\u2019s schoolteacher. [The court ruled that the intervenor had no standing because, in the court\u2019s view, her only legally cognizable interest was her interest in becoming Shanaira\u2019s guardian, and the court already had decided that issue against the intervenor. Although] [t]he court allowed testimony from Shanaira\u2019s aunt<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and teacher [it essentially did not allow the intervenor to call or question those or any other witnesses,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>including the intervenor\u2019s mother, who never testified. Furthermore, the court itself examined the witnesses who did testify with little or no input or questioning from the parties]. On the basis of the reports submitted by the commissioner, the testimony and the statements of counsel, including that of the intervenor, the court found that revocation of the commitment was in Shanaira\u2019s best interest and granted sole custody of Shanaira to the respondent mother.\u201d <em>In re Shanaira C., </em>105 Conn. App. 713, 716-17, 940 A.2d 817 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The intervenor appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s judgment, claiming that, as a proper party to the action, her due process rights were violated because the court had failed to hold a full evidentiary hearing on the motion to revoke and because she had been precluded from calling and cross-examining witnesses and otherwise participating meaningfully in the hearing that was held. See id., 719. The intervenor also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>maintained that \u00a7 46b-129 (m), Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35a-14 (c),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and applicable case law also \u201cclearly\u201d anticipate that a hearing on a motion to revoke shall be a full, adversarial hearing and that the trial court improperly had denied her the right to such a hearing. Finally, the intervenor asserted that the trial court had abused its discretion in revoking Shanaira\u2019s commitment before making a finding, as \u00a7 46b-129 (m) requires, that cause for commitment no longer existed. See id., 722. The Appellate Court, with one judge dissenting, affirmed the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Before addressing the merits of the intervenor\u2019s appeal, however, the Appellate Court addressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>respondent mother\u2019s contention that the intervenor lacked standing to appeal the revocation of Shanaira\u2019s commitment because her standing had terminated when the trial court denied her motions for guardianship and visitation and committed Shanaira to the commissioner\u2019s custody. Id., 717. The Appellate Court rejected this contention; id., 719; concluding, first, that the intervenor properly had been granted intervenor status in the dispositional phase of the neglect proceeding under Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35a-4<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for the purpose of, inter alia, exercising her right to oppose the commissioner\u2019s motion to revoke Shanaira\u2019s commitment as against Shanaira\u2019s best interest. See id., 718. The Appellate Court then concluded that the intervenor also had appellate standing because the revocation was adverse to the intervenor\u2019s interest in the disposition of the neglect petition. Id., 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The Appellate Court next addressed the intervenor\u2019s contention that the trial court had violated her right to due process by failing to hold a full evidentiary hearing on the motion to revoke commitment at which the intervenor would have been entitled to present evidence and to challenge any evidence presented by an adverse party. Id., 719-22. The Appellate Court concluded that the intervenor had received \u201call [of] the process that she was due.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 722. In reaching its determination, the Appellate Court observed that \u201cthe intervenor participated in every aspect of the neglect proceedings, including the revocation hearing. Over the course of the five days of trial on the neglect petition, the intervenor filed motions, cross-examined witnesses, called witnesses on her behalf and made arguments to the court. On the date that the court considered revocation, however, the record reveals that the nature of the intervenor\u2019s interest in the case had changed because her previously filed motions for guardianship and visitation had been denied. Therefore, although she still had standing to participate in the continuing dispositional phase of the proceeding, her personal interest in the proceeding was diminished.\u201d Id., 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The Appellate Court did observe, however, that the intervenor had sought to adduce testimony from her mother and from Shanaira\u2019s foster mother at the revocation hearing, and that both of those prospective wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>nesses were prepared to testify about a significant deterioration in Shanaira\u2019s behavior since the last hearing. Id., 720-21. The Appellate Court further observed that, although the trial court had barred the intervenor from calling witnesses at the revocation hearing, the trial court nevertheless did examine Shanaira\u2019s foster mother and teacher, eliciting testimony relating to the same time period that the intervenor had intended to address through the testimony that she was barred from presenting. Id., 721. The Appellate Court also noted that the intervenor did not seek to question these witnesses further or otherwise indicate that she would have presented testimony different from that elicited by the court. Id. The Appellate Court stated: \u201cUnder these circumstances, it is not apparent that permitting the intervenor\u2019s mother to testify or allowing the intervenor to introduce testimony of Shanaira\u2019s foster mother . . . would have elicited any facts that were not already before the court. On this basis, and mindful of the diminished personal interest of the intervenor following the denial of her motions for guardianship and visitation, we do not find an erroneous deprivation of due process in [the trial court\u2019s denial of] her request to call her own witnesses.\u201d Id., 721-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The Appellate Court also rejected the intervenor\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion in revoking Shanaira\u2019s commitment because the court had failed to make a finding, under \u00a7 46b-129 (m), that cause for commitment no longer existed. Id., 722, 723. Although the Appellate Court noted that it was unable to determine from the record the trial court\u2019s \u201cspecific reasons for committing Shanaira to the custody of the commissioner,\u201d it was able to determine from the neglect petition \u201cthat the allegations of neglect concerned Shanaira\u2019s father, with whom Shanaira was living at the time the petition was filed.\u201d Id., 723. The Appellate Court further observed that, \u201c[i]n revoking the commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>ment of Shanaira to the commissioner, the [trial] court talked extensively about the ability of the respondent mother to care for her.\u201d Id. Thus, the Appellate Court concluded that, \u201c[although the [trial] court did not explicitly make a finding that the respondent mother\u2019s fitness to care for Shanaira meant that there was no longer a cause for commitment, this is clearly the import of the court\u2019s comments, particularly in light of the court\u2019s finding that it was in the best interest of Shanaira that the commitment be revoked and that sole custody be granted to the respondent mother. Thus, even on the basis of the sparse record provided by the intervenor . . . the court\u2019s conclusion was legally and factually supported.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Judge Borden agreed that the intervenor had standing; id., 724 <em>(Borden, J., </em>dissenting); but dissented from the majority opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id. Addressing the intervenor\u2019s statutory claim first,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Borden concluded, with respect to a revocation of commitment hearing con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>ducted pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (m), that \u201c[i]t is . . . unthinkable that a court would be permitted to determine that the cause for a prior commitment no longer exists and that the best interest of a child requires a different placement without an evidentiary hearing, at least when those sensitive facts are contested.\u201d Id., 732 (Borden, J., dissenting). Although Judge Borden acknowledged that \u00a7 46b-129 (m) does not explicitly require an evidentiary hearing, he concluded that the provision clearly implies one. Id. Judge Borden also referred to Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35a-14 (c), which, he observed, \u201cgoverns proceedings on motions to revoke commitment . . . and allocates the varying burdens of proof on the questions of whether the original cause for commitment still exists and what is in the best interest of the child.\u201d Id., 732-33 (Borden, J., dissenting). As Judge Borden stated, \u201c[i]t is obvious that allocations of burdens of proof imply an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Id., 733 (Borden, J., dissenting). With respect to the issue of whether that requirement had been satisfied in the present case, Judge Borden concluded that it had not. He explained: \u201cThe hearing provided by the court lacked the fundamental hallmarks of a proper evidentiary hearing, namely, the right to present witnesses and to examine the witnesses who did testify. The intervenor was not permitted to [produce] or question witnesses, including one witness, the intervenor\u2019s mother, who never testified. The intervenor was not permitted to question the witnesses who did testify. The court, with limited exceptions, conducted all of the examinations of those witnesses who were [produced], and the intervenor was not permitted even to ask followup questions. This simply was not a proper evidentiary hearing as our law knows it.\u201d Id. Finally, Judge Borden concluded that the intervenor\u2019s due process rights were violated by virtue of the trial court\u2019s failure to hold a full evidentiary hearing at which the intervenor could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>call and cross-examine witnesses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See id., 733-35 <em>(Bor</em>den, J., dissenting). On the basis of his statutory and constitutional analysis, Judge Borden concluded that the Appellate Court majority should have reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and ordered that a new dispositional hearing be held on the commissioner\u2019s motion to revoke Shanaira\u2019s commitment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id., 735 (Borden, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In the intervenor\u2019s appeal to this court following our granting of certification,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the intervenor renews the claims that she had raised in the Appellate Court. We agree with the intervenor that she is entitled to prevail on her statutory claim, and, consequently, we need not reach her constitutional claim. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">We first address the claim of the commissioner and the respondent mother that the intervenor lacked standing to participate in the hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motion to revoke Shanaira\u2019s commitment and that she lacks standing to bring this appeal. Specifically, the commissioner and the respondent mother assert that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>once the trial court denied the intervenor\u2019s motions for guardianship and visitation and committed Shanaira to the custody of the commissioner, the intervenor no longer had a sufficient interest in the case to satisfy the threshold standing requirement. According to the commissioner and the respondent mother, the intervenor, having been divested of her status as a party, had no right to participate in the revocation hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Under Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35a-4 (b),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the trial court may grant intervenor status in connection with a neglect petition upon a finding that \u201csuch intervention is in the best interest of the child or in the interests of justice.\u201d In the present case, the trial court, <em>A. Santos, J., </em>granted the intervenor\u2019s motion to intervene after concluding that her participation in the proceedings as a party was in Shanaira\u2019s best interest due to the exceptionally close relationship that the intervenor had maintained with Shanaira for at least the preceding two years. The evidence established, in particular, that Shanaira referred to the intervenor as \u201c[m]ommy,\u201d that the intervenor had cared for Shanaira over that two year period and that Shanaira had expressed a desire to five with the intervenor. That evidence fully supported the conclusion that Shanaira\u2019s best interest would be served by granting the intervenor party status in the neglect proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The Appellate Court succinctly explained why that intervention determination also pertained to the intervenor\u2019s right to participate in the litigation involving the motion to revoke Shanaira\u2019s commitment to the custody of the commissioner and in any appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>an adverse decision on that motion. \u201cPractice Book [2006] \u00a7 35a-4 permits intervention in the dispositional phase of the trial. Disposition in a neglect petition may take one of a number of forms, including return to parents, return to parents with a protective order, foster care placement, or the initiation of proceedings to terminate parental rights. . . . Whether to maintain or revoke the commitment is a dispositional question .... Practice Book [2006] \u00a7 35a-14 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">\u201c[In the present case], although the commitment of Shanaira to the custody of the commissioner was a disposition,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the [trial] court indicated that the commitment was temporary and continued the matter to December 15,2006, with the stated intention of transfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>ring custody of Shanaira to the respondent mother on that date. The intervenor objected to the revocation of the commitment and the transfer of custody to the respondent mother, contending that it was not in Shanaira\u2019s best interest. Because the revocation of commitment is a step in the dispositional phase of a neglect petition and, in this case, was a necessary step in facilitating the court\u2019s intended disposition, the intervenor was a proper party to that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\u201cAppellate standing is established if there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected. . . . Because the [trial] court\u2019s [revocation of] the commitment was adverse to the intervenor\u2019s interest in the disposition of the neglect petition, the intervenor has standing to bring this appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Shanaira C., </em>supra, 105 Conn. App. 717-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The commissioner and the respondent mother nevertheless contend that the trial court properly concluded that the intervenor no longer had standing to participate in the proceedings once her motions for transfer of guardianship and visitation had been denied. We disagree. The intervenor was not permitted to intervene merely for the purpose of litigating those motions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Rather, she was permitted to intervene because her participation in the case properly was deemed to be in Shanaira\u2019s best interest in light of the nature of the intervenor\u2019s relationship with Shanaira. Thus, although we agree with the statement of the Appellate Court in <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>60 Conn. App. 134, 152 n.15, 758 A.2d 916 (2000), that \u201c[a] court . . . has the authority to dismiss intervenors once their interest in the matter has expired,\u201d the denial of the intervenor\u2019s motions to transfer guardianship and for visitation had no effect on the intervenor\u2019s ability to speak to Shanaira\u2019s best interest with respect to the revocation of Shanaira\u2019s commitment to the custody of the commissioner and, ultimately, the transfer of custody to the respondent mother. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court had inadequate reason to strip the intervenor of her standing for purposes of the hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motion to revoke Shanaira\u2019s commitment. Because the trial court\u2019s disposition of the neglect petition was adverse to the intervenor\u2019s interest, she also has standing to appeal from the judgment of that court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">With respect to the merits of the intervenor\u2019s claim, she maintains, in essence, that we should reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court for the reasons set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>forth by Judge Borden in his dissenting opinion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We agree with the intervenor that she had a statutory right to an evidentiary hearing and that she was deprived of that right. Accordingly, we need not address the intervenor\u2019s constitutional claim.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>280 Conn. 36, 50, 905 A.2d 1079 (2006) (\u201cwe must be mindful that [t]his court has a basic judicial duty to avoid deciding a constitutional issue if anonconstitutional ground exists that will dispose of the case\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The following facts and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of this claim. At the conclusion of the third day of trial on October 17, 2006, the trial court found Shanaira to be neglected and directed the parties to present evidence on the proper disposition of the neglect petition and, in particular, on the issue of whether Shanaira should be placed with her mother in Florida. The court scheduled the next trial day for November 2, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">On that day, the court heard testimony from Janet Feliciano, a social worker employed by the department of children and families (department). Feliciano testified about a report that she had prepared concerning the respondent mother and her observations of Shanaira\u2019s interactions with her mother. Feliciano testified that it was the position of the department that sole custody and guardianship of Shanaira should be transferred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the respondent mother, and that her commitment to the custody of the commissioner was not necessary. Following the testimony of Feliciano, who was the only witness that day, the trial court declined to transfer sole custody of Shanaira to her mother in Florida and, instead, committed Shanaira to the custody of the commissioner. The court explained, however, that it was likely to transfer custody of Shanaira to the respondent mother in the relatively near future but that Shanaira would remain in Connecticut until at least the next hearing date. The court indicated that proceeding in that manner would be best for Shanaira and would provide an opportunity for the court to assure itself that Shanaira was ready for the move to Florida. The court scheduled the next hearing for December 15,2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">At the December 15, 2006 hearing on the motion to revoke, the intervenor sought to call witnesses and otherwise to participate in the hearing. Specifically, the intervenor sought to call her mother<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and Shanaira\u2019s foster mother, claiming that their testimony would demonstrate a marked deterioration in Shanaira\u2019s behavior and schoolwork. Because the court did not believe that the intervenor had standing at that stage of the proceedings, the intervenor\u2019s mother was not allowed to testify. The court did permit the foster mother to make a statement but did not permit any questioning by counsel. Shanaira\u2019s attorney then called Shanaira\u2019s teacher, Mary F., as a witness. The court conducted an examination of Mary F., and Shanaira\u2019s attorney also was permitted to question Mary F. briefly, after which the court conducted some follow-up questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The court then heard from counsel regarding the motion to revoke commitment. After the other parties had been heard, counsel for the intervenor asked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>the same opportunity, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">\u201cThe Court: ... I\u2019ll hear you out of respect for you, and that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t think you have standing ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">\u201c[Counsel]: Your Honor, I would just say there are some things that are troubling. [You\u2019ve] got status reports. [You\u2019ve] got a social study regarding the motion to revoke. The department knew that \u2014 heard from [the foster mother] that things \u2014 the behavior of this child since she went to Florida has really deteriorated. But you don\u2019t see that in there.

The court also awarded sole custody of Shanaira to the respondent mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Our resolution of the merits of the intervenor\u2019s claim requires us to determine whether the trial court properly applied \u00a7 46b-129 (m) and Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35a-14 (c) in limiting the intervenor\u2019s participation in the dispositional phase of the neglect proceedings.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This issue requires us to decide whether \u00a7 46b-129 (m) and Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35a-14 (c) contemplate a full evidentiary hearing when, as in the present case, the court is considering the proper disposition of a neglect petition. Such an inquiry presents an issue of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Southwick at Milford Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>523 Wheelers Farm Road, Milford, LLC, </em>294 Conn. 311, 318, 984 A.2d 676 (2009). \u201cWhen constru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>ing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. . . . In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 318-19. In addition, we note that \u201c[t]he interpretive construction of the rules of practice is to be governed by the same principles as those regulating statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Social Services </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>265 Conn. 723, 733-34, 830 A.2d 228 (2003). Our review of the language of \u00a7 46b-129 (m) and Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35a-14 (c) leads us to conclude that a full evidentiary hearing is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (m) provides that \u201c[t]he commissioner, a parent or the child\u2019s attorney may file a motion to revoke a commitment, and, upon finding that cause for commitment no longer exists, and that such revocation is in the best interests of such child or youth, the court may revoke the commitment of such child or youth. No such motion shall be filed more often than once every six months.\u201d Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35a-14 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhether to main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>tain or revoke the commitment is a dispositional question, based on the prior adjudication, and the judicial authority shall determine whether it is in the best interest of the child to maintain or revoke upon a fair preponderance of the evidence. The party seeking to maintain the commitment has the burden of proof that it is in the best interest of the child to maintain the commitment. The party seeking revocation of commitment has the burden of proof that no cause for commitment exists. If the burden is met, the party opposing the revocation has the burden of proof that revocation would not be in the best interest of the child. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Although these provisions do not expressly require an evidentiary hearing, we agree with Judge Borden that they implicitly mandate one, at least when a motion for revocation of commitment is contested. See <em>In re Shanaira C., </em>supra, 105 Conn. App. 732-33 (Borden, <em>J., </em>dissenting). In particular, before the commitment may be revoked upon motion, \u00a7 46b-129 (m) directs the court to make two findings: first, that there no longer is cause for commitment and, second, that revoking the commitment is in the child\u2019s best interest. This provision carries the implication that an evidentiary hearing shall be held because it strongly suggests that evidence must be presented by the moving party to establish facts necessary to warrant revocation of the commitment. Indeed, a determination of the best interest of a child frequently requires an evidentiary hearing. See, e.g., <em>Berglass </em>v. <em>Berglass, </em>71 Conn. App. 771, 784, 804 A.2d 889 (2002) (\u201c[t]he court . . . should not have modified weekly visitation without having held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether modification was in the best interest of the child\u201d). In the absence of a waiver of the right to a hearing by all parties who otherwise would be entitled to participate, this approach makes eminent good sense because the determination of a child\u2019s best interest is generally a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>intensive inquiry. See, e.g., <em>Malave </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>114 Conn. App. 414, 421-22, 970 A.2d 743 (2009) (\u201c[t]he best interest standard ... is inherently flexible and fact specific and gives the court discretion to consider all of the different and individualized factors that might affect a specific child\u2019s best interest\u201d). Moreover, frequently, either the facts or the inferences to be drawn therefrom are disputed by the parties. For these reasons, revocation hearings sometimes entail lengthy proceedings involving multiple witnesses. See, e.g., <em>In re Cameron C., </em>103 Conn. App. 746, 760, 930 A.2d 826 (2007) (revocation hearing conducted under \u00a7 46b-129 [m] occurred over period of fifteen days and involved testimony of thirteen witnesses and admission of forty exhibits), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 906, 942 A.2d 414 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Similarly, Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35a-14 (c) allocates burdens of proof with respect to whether cause for commitment exists and whether revocation is in the best interest of the child. Specifically, once the party seeking revocation has satisfied its burden of proving that no cause for commitment exists, the party opposing revocation bears the burden of proving that revocation would not be in the best interest of the child. Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35a-14 (c); see also <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>177 Conn. 648, 659, 420 A.2d 875 (1979) (\u201cCleary the burden is [on] the person applying for the revocation of commitment to allege and prove that cause for commitment no longer exists. Once that has been established . . . the inquiry becomes whether a continuation of the commitment will nevertheless serve the child\u2019s best interests. On this point, when it is a natural parent who has moved to revoke commitment, the state must prove that it would not be in the best interests of the child to be returned to his or her natural parent.\u201d). Insofar as Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35-14 (c) allocates the varying burdens of proof with respect to whether the original cause for commitment still exists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>and what is in the best interest of the child, we agree with Judge Borden that the provision clearly indicates that an evidentiary hearing is required because \u201c[i]t is obvious that allocations of burdens of proof imply an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>In re Shanaira C., </em>supra, 105 Conn. App. 733 (Borden, <em>J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The requirement of a hearing under \u00a7 46b-129 (m) and Practice Book (2006) \u00a7 35-14 (c) is consistent with previous decisions of the Appellate Court. For example, in <em>In re Stacy G., </em>94 Conn. App. 348, 892 A.2d 1034 (2006), the court explained that \u201ca natural parent, whose child has been committed to the custody of a third party, is entitled to a hearing to demonstrate that no cause for commitment still exists. . . . The initial burden is placed on the persons applying for the revocation of commitment to allege and prove that cause for commitment no longer exists. ... If the party challenging the commitment meets that initial burden, the commitment to the third party may then be modified if such change is in the best interest of the child. . . . The burden falls on the persons vested with guardianship to prove that it would not be in the best interests of the child to be returned to his or her natural parents. \u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 352 n.4; cf. <em>In re Justin F., </em>116 Conn. App. 83, 96, 976 A.2d 707 (\u201cIn a proceeding to revoke commitment, the moving party has the statutory burden to prove that cause for commitment no longer exists .... Notwithstanding this requirement, the record . . . reveals that the parents offered argument, but no evidence, to support their request. It is [axiomatic] that argument is not evidence.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]), cert. dismissed, 292 Conn. 913, 973 A.2d 660, cert. denied, 293 Conn. 914, 978 A.2d 1109 (2009), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Albright-Lazzari </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>559 U.S. 912, 130 S. Ct. 1298, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1087 (2010); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>54 Conn. App. 50, 57-58, 732 A.2d 808 (1999) (trial court improperly denied moth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>er\u2019s request for hearing on father\u2019s motion for modification of visitation when issue of child\u2019s best interest implicated by motion). Because the issue of whether Shanaira should be transferred to the custody of her mother was neither uncontested nor the subject of undisputed facts, the court was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing as the intervenor had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">It also is apparent that the intervenor did not receive the hearing to which she was entitled. Once the commissioner satisfied her burden of proving that no cause for commitment existed, the intervenor, who opposed the revocation of commitment, bore the burden of proving that revocation was not in Shanaira\u2019s best interest. Only if the intervenor had been afforded the opportunity to present evidence and to examine witnesses would she have had any meaningful possibility of meeting this burden. Although the intervenor was not precluded from participating in the hearing entirely, the limitations that the trial court improperly placed on that participation were significant and deprived her of a genuine opportunity to present her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">We disagree, finally, with the commissioner\u2019s assertion that any impropriety in limiting the intervenor\u2019s participation in the hearing was harmless. First, the intervenor was unable to call and question witnesses whose testimony might have caused the court to reach a different conclusion with respect to Shanaira\u2019s best interest. Although one of the intervenor\u2019s proposed witnesses, namely, Shanaira\u2019s foster mother, did testify at the hearing, the intervenor was not permitted to question her, and, therefore, we do not know whether the foster mother\u2019s testimony about Shanaira\u2019s problems was full and complete. Furthermore, the intervenor\u2019s other proposed witness, namely, her mother, never was allowed to testify even though she previously had been granted temporary custody of Shanaira.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the intervenor was barred from cross-examining witnesses who had been called by other parties, and we simply do not know how such cross-examination might have affected the court\u2019s ultimate decision to transfer custody of Shanaira to Shanaira\u2019s mother. Finally, in concluding that the intervenor lacked standing to participate in the hearing because her interest in and relationship with Shanaira was too attenuated, it is highly likely that the trial court did not give due consideration to the intervenor\u2019s position concerning Shanaira\u2019s best interest. For all of these reasons, the commissioner has failed to establish that the limitations that the trial court placed on the intervenor\u2019s ability to participate in the hearing in a meaningful way constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">It is important to note, however, that more than three and one-half years have elapsed since Shanaira began residing with her mother in December, 2006. There is no doubt that much has happened in Shanaira\u2019s life over that period of time, and, consequently, what is in Shanaira\u2019s best interest will depend largely on what has occurred since her move to Florida to live with her mother. Accordingly, we agree with Judge Borden that the focus of the new dispositional hearing must be on Shanaira\u2019s status and her best interest at the time of that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to that court for a new dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (m) provides: \u201cThe commissioner, a parent or the child\u2019s attorney may file a motion to revoke a commitment, and, upon finding that cause for commitment no longer exists, and that such revocation is in the best interests of such child or youth, the court may revoke the commitment of such child or youth.

See <em>In re Shanaira C., </em>supra, 105 Conn. App. 719-22. We surmise that the Appellate Court majority did not consider the intervenor\u2019s statutory claim because it did not construe the arguments that the intervenor made in her brief as raising such a claim. As we explain more fully hereinafter, Judge Borden, the dissenting judge, concluded otherwise and addressed the intervenor\u2019s statutory claim in addition to her due process claim. Id., 729, 731-33. Although the brief that the intervenor filed in the Appellate Court is not a model of clarity on this point, we agree with Judge Borden that the intervenor did raise a statutory claim in that court.

He observed that the hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motion to revoke was contested. <em>In re Shanaira C., </em>supra, 105 Conn. App. 730 <em>{Borden, J., </em>dissenting). Thus, Judge Borden concluded that \u201cwhatever informal procedures may be desirably employed in uncontested dispositional hearings in such sensitive matters as the placement of children by the juvenile division of the Superior Court\u201d are inapplicable in the present case. Id. Judge Borden also observed that, although the trial court had developed an extensive factual record during the neglect proceedings and clearly indicated its intent to send Shanaira to live with the respondent mother, those facts \u201cdid not permit the [trial] court to dispense with the procedural requirements attendant [to] motions to revoke commitment,\u201d unless all interested parties had so agreed. Id. Indeed, as Judge Borden further observed, the trial court\u2019s intention to revoke Shanaira\u2019s commitment was conditioned \u201con whether new evidence would be produced . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 730-31 <em>(Borden, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\"> As we previously noted; see footnote 7 of this opinion; Judge Borden concluded that the intervenor had raised a claim of a statutory right to an evidentiary hearing in addition to her due process claim. <em>In re Shanaira C., </em>supra, 105 Conn. App. 729 <em>{Borden, !., </em>dissenting). Thus, in contrast to the Appellate Court majority, Judge Borden addressed the intervenor\u2019s statutory claim.

The commentary to Practice Book (2009) \u00a7 35a-4 provides in relevant part: \u201cNew subsection (e) clarifies that intervenors may continue to participate in postdisposition proceedings only with the approval of the judicial authority.\u201d Although the commentary indicates that this amendment was intended to clarify, rather than to change, the governing law, we note that this amendment had not been adopted either at the time of the trial on the neglect petition in 2006 or when the Appellate Court issued its decision in 2008. Indeed, the commissioner makes only passing reference to this provision in her brief filed with this court. Moreover, although a commitment to the commissioner typically would dispose of a neglect petition, the record in the present case clearly indicates that Shanaira\u2019s commitment to the commissioner was not intended to dispose of the neglect petition because the trial court expressly stated that that commitment would be temporary. Under the particular facts presented, therefore, it reasonably may be maintained that the hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motion to revoke Shanaira\u2019s commitment was not a postdispositional proceeding within the meaning of Practice Book (2009) \u00a7 35a-4 (e). We note, finally, that, at the time of the commitment, the trial court did not indicate whether, and, if so, to what extent, the intervenor would be allowed to participate in any further dispositional hearing. In light of the foregoing, we do not apply Practice Book (2009) \u00a7 35a-4 (e) to the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\"> It is trae, as the commissioner asserts, that intervention may be granted limited to certain discrete issues, and, therefore, an intervenor may be dismissed once those issues have been resolved. See, e.g., <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>60 Conn. App. 134, 152, 758 A.2d 916 (2000) (\u201c[a] court has the authority to grant intervention limited to particular issues, and such limited intervention is not intended to allow enjoyment of all the prerogatives of a party litigant\u201d). Indeed, in <em>Rosado, </em>the intervenors had sought intervention \u201cfor the well-defined, limited purpose of filing a motion to quash and for a protective order, and otherwise to prevent disclosure of private, confidential information from their . . . personnel file records.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In the present case, however, no such limitation was placed on the intervenor\u2019s participation in the proceedings, and, consequently, the intervenor became a party for all purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\"> The commissioner relies on <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>259 Conn. 202, 789 A.2d 431 (2002), for the proposition that, when \u201cfundamental rights are implicated . . . standing serves a function beyond a mere jurisdictional prerequisite\u201d; id., 219; and that, as a result, \u201cany third party . . . seeking visitation must allege and establish a parent-like relationship as a jurisdictional threshold . . . .\u201d Id., 222. We note that this rule has been extended to the intervention of third parties in custody proceedings. <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>285 Conn. 24, 44, 939 A.2d 1040 (2008). In the present case, however, the evidence established that a parent-like relationship existed between the intervenor and Shanaira. Thus, the intervenor\u2019s status as a nonrelative, even when seeking guardianship and visitation, does not give rise to any constitutional concern.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b776-8\"> Both Shanaira and the respondent father submitted briefs to this court essentially adopting the arguments set forth by the intervenor. In addition, we granted the application of the Center for Children\u2019s Advocacy, Inc. (Center), for permission to appear as amicus curiae, and the Center filed a brief in which it maintained, as does the intervenor, that principles of due process, along with our statutory scheme as supplemented by the rules of practice and relevant case law, require a full evidentiary hearing on a contested motion to revoke a child\u2019s commitment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b776-9\"> We also need not reach the intervenor\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion in revoking Shanaira\u2019s commitment without explicitly determining whether cause for commitment continued to exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\"> The intervenor\u2019s mother previously had been granted temporary custody of Shanaira.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\"> We note, preliminarily, the commissioner\u2019s assertion that the intervenor failed to preserve her claims. We disagree with this contention. At trial, the intervenor asserted both that she had a due process and a statutory right to be heard at the revocation hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\"> The commissioner contends that, because Shanaira\u2019s foster mother already had testified about a deterioration in Shanaira\u2019s adjustment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>well-being, the proffered testimony of the intervenor\u2019s mother to that same effect would have been cumulative, and, consequently, its exclusion was harmless. We reject the commissioner\u2019s claim because such corroborative testimony from the intervenor\u2019s mother, if credited by the trial court, might have affected the court\u2019s decision. In other words, we are unable to conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the testimony of the intervenor\u2019s mother, when viewed in combination with the testimony of Shanaira\u2019s foster mother, would not have caused the trial court to take a different approach with respect to its disposition of the neglect petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
