The commission subsequently granted an application for an amendment to the special permit. The plaintiffs, Sanjit Shah, Mary Shah, Daniel Cooper and Karen Cooper,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who own land in New York within 100 feet of the undivided property, appealed separately from each approval pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants filed motions to dismiss the appeals, which the trial court in each appeal granted on the ground that the plaintiffs did not have standing to appeal because their properties are not located in the state of Connecticut. The plaintiffs then filed these appeals from the judgments of dismissal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reverse the judgments of the trial court in both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. Pacific Farm owned a seventy-four acre parcel of land known as Windsome Farms (property) in the town, which is bounded to the north by Puddin Hill Road in New York and Lukes Wood Road in Connecticut, and to the east by Smith Ridge Road in Connecticut. In 2007, Pacific Farm entered into a contract with Grace Property, pursuant to which Grace Property agreed to purchase approximately forty-eight acres of the property for the purpose of building a church.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>On July 30, 2007, Pacific Farm and Grace Property filed a subdivision application and an application for a special permit with the commission. The subdivision application sought approval of a plan to resubdivide<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the property into two parcels, parcel A and parcel B. The special permit application sought approval of a proposal to construct the church on parcel B. The proposal was divided into phase one, which consisted of renovating and adding to an existing building to create a temporary sanctuary pending construction of a permanent sanctuary, and phase two, which consisted of the construction of a new sanctuary building with seating for approximately 1200 persons and parking for 321 vehicles. The commission conducted public hearings on both applications in August and September, 2007. On November 27, 2007, the commission granted the subdivision application. It also granted the special permit application with the condition that the applicants would not be allowed to construct phase two, largely because of traffic concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs, who own land in New York<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> within 100 feet of the undivided property, appealed from the commission\u2019s decisions to the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 claiming that the subdivision and the proposed project violated various town zoning and subdivision regulations (first appeal). The defendants filed motions to dismiss the first appeal on the grounds that: (1) the plaintiffs had served only one copy of process on the town clerk, instead of two copies as required by \u00a7 8-8 (f) <em>(2)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and General Statutes \u00a7 52-57 (b) (5);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>plaintiffs did not own property within 100 feet of the land involved in the commission\u2019s decision, namely, parcel B on which the church was to be built, as required to establish statutory standing under \u00a7 8-8 (a) (l);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (3) the plaintiffs could not be aggrieved by the commission\u2019s decision because their property was not located in the state of Connecticut; and (4) the plaintiffs improperly had challenged two of the commission\u2019s decisions in one appeal. The trial court, <em>Karazin, J., </em>rejected the first, second and fourth claims, but concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing to appeal from the commission\u2019s decision pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 because their properties were located in New York. The court reasoned that, in enacting \u00a7 8-8, the legislature had intended to protect only the interests of persons who own land within this state. Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 first appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiffs then initiated the appeal to this court in Docket No. SC 18333.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Meanwhile, Pacific Farm and Grace Property had filed with the commission an application for an amendment to the special permit to allow them to construct a permanent church with a capacity for 900 persons. After a public hearing, the commission approved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>application. The plaintiffs appealed from that decision pursuant to \u00a7 8-8, claiming that the proposed project violated various town zoning regulations and that the commission had acted arbitrarily, capriciously and in abuse of its discretion in approving the amendment to the special permit (second appeal). The defendants filed motions to dismiss that appeal, again claiming that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiffs did not own land within 100 feet of the property involved in the commission\u2019s decision and because they did not own land within the state of Connecticut. The trial court, <em>Pavia, J., </em>rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiffs were not statutorily aggrieved because they did not own land within 100 feet of parcel B, but agreed with Judge Karazin\u2019s conclusion in the first appeal that the plaintiffs did not have standing to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (b) because they did not own land in this state. The trial court also concluded that, because Judge Karazin had ruled on that issue in the first appeal, the plaintiffs were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from relitigating it. Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the second appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiffs then initiated the appeal to this corut in Docket No. SC 18418. After the two appeals to this court were filed, Pacific Farm transferred all of its right, title and interest in the property to Grace Farms Foundation, Inc. (Grace Farms), and this court granted Pacific Farm\u2019s motion to substitute Grace Farms as a party defendant in both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The plaintiffs claim in both appeals that: (1) the trial court improperly concluded that they did not have standing to appeal from the commission\u2019s decisions pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 because they did not own land in this state; and (2) if the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 8-8 was correct, the statute violates article first, \u00a7 10, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and article four, \u00a7 2, of the United States constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendants dispute these claims and claim as an alternate ground for affirmance that the trial court improperly denied their motions to dismiss on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 land was not within 100 feet of the land involved in the commission\u2019s decisions. We conclude that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing to appeal from the commission\u2019s decisions pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 because they did not own land in this state,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and we reject the defendants\u2019 alternate ground for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In Docket No. SC 18418, the plaintiffs raise the additional claims that: (1) the trial court improperly concluded that their claims in the second appeal were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel; and (2) even if this court concludes that they are not statutorily aggrieved under \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1) because they do not own land within 100 feet of the land involved in the commission\u2019s decision, they are classically aggrieved. The defendants dispute these claims. We conclude that we need not determine whether the plaintiffs\u2019 second appeal to the trial court was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel because, even if it was, the judgment of the trial court in that case must be reversed in light of our decision reversing the judgment of the trial court in the first appeal. We need not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 second claim because we conclude that the plaintiffs were statutorily aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Finally, in Docket No. SC 18333, the defendants claim as an additional alternate ground for affirmance that the trial court should have dismissed the appeal because the plaintiffs had not properly served process on the commission. We reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">CLAIMS RELATING TO BOTH APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">We first address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court in each appeal improperly concluded that they lacked standing to appeal from the commission\u2019s decisions pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 because they do not own land in this state. The plaintiffs contend that the phrase \u201cany person\u201d as used in \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1) plainly and unambiguously encompasses all persons who own land within 100 feet of the land involved in a board or commission\u2019s decision, regardless of whether they own land within this state. The defendants counter that there is a strong presumption against the extraterritorial application of statutes that can be overcome only if the legislature has expressly stated that it will have extraterritorial effect. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cardwell, </em>246 Conn. 721, 741, 718 A.2d 954 (1998) (\u201cwe will not apply a criminal statute extraterritorially without a significant indication that the legislature intended it to have that effect\u201d); <em>Kennerson </em>v. <em>Thames Towboat Co., </em>89 Conn. 367, 374, 94 A. 372 (1915) (\u201c[u]nless the intention to have a statute operate beyond the limits of a [s]tate is clearly expressed or reasonably to be inferred from the language of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act, or from its purpose, subject-matter, or history, the presumption is that the statute is intended to have no extraterritorial effect\u201d). Accordingly, they argue, \u201cany person\u201d is limited to persons who own land in Connecticut. Although we do not agree with the plaintiffs that \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1) is plain and unambiguous, we conclude that it confers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>standing to appeal on persons who do not own land within this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In the first appeal, the trial court and the plaintiffs characterized the defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiffs were not entitled to appeal from the commission\u2019s decisions under \u00a7 8-8 (b) because they do not own land in this state as raising a question of aggrievement. We conclude, however, that because this court is not being asked to determine whether the type of injury suffered by the plaintiffs came within the scope of the statute, but, instead, whether they are proper parties to bring an appeal under the statute, it is more precise to characterize the claim as raising a question of statutory standing. See <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., </em>258 Conn. 313, 347, 780 A.2d 98 (2001) (\u201cIn order for a plaintiff to have standing, it must be a proper party to request adjudication of the issues. . . . Standing focuses on whether a party is the proper party to request adjudication of the issues, rather than on the substantive rights of the aggrieved parties.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u201cIn order to determine whether a party has standing to make a claim under a statute, a court must determine the interests and the parties that the statute was designed to protect. . . . Essentially the standing question in such cases is whether the . . . statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiffs position a right to judicial relief. . . . The plaintiff must be within the zone of interests protected by the statute. ... It has been [noted] that the zone of interests test bears a family resemblance to the scope of the risk doctrine in the law of torts. ... In tort law, it is not enough that the defendant\u2019s violation of the law caused injury to a plaintiff. The defendant must also owe that plaintiff a duty. Similarly, with respect to the law of [statutory] standing, it is not enough that a party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>injured by an act or omission of another party. The defendant must also have violated some duty <em>owed to the </em>plaintiff.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McWeeny </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>287 Conn. 56, 65, 946 A.2d 862 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Because an understanding of the reasons for and the scope of the doctrine of extraterritoriality is necessary for the resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they come within the zone of interests protected by the statutory scheme, including their claim that \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1) plainly and unambiguously encompasses persons who do not own land in this state, a review of the cases discussing that doctrine is appropriate at the outset. \u201cIt is a longstanding principle of American law that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. . . . This canon of construction ... is a valid approach whereby unexpressed congressional intent may be ascertained. ... It serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission </em>v. <em>Arabian American Oil Co., </em>499 U.S. 244, 248, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1991). Many state courts have applied this principle to state statutes. See <em>Avery </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>216 Ill. 2d 100, 184-85, 835 N.E.2d 801 (2005) (noting \u201clongstanding rule of construction in Illinois which holds that a statute is without extraterritorial effect unless a clear intent in this respect appears from the express provisions of the statute\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Consumer Protection Division </em>v. <em>Outdoor World Corp., </em>91 Md. App. 275, 287, 603 A.2d 1376 (\u201cas a general rule, one [s]tate cannot regulate activity occurring in another [s]tate, and ... in deference to that principle, regulatory statutes are generally con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>strued as not having extra-territorial effect unless a contrary legislative intent is expressly stated\u201d), cert. denied, 327 Md. 523, 610 A.2d 796 (1992); <em>Sexton </em>v. <em>Ryder Truck Rental, </em>413 Mich. 406, 434, 320 N.W.2d 843 (1982) (because \u201c[t]he general rule of law is that no state or nation can, by its laws, directly affect, bind, or operate upon property or persons beyond its territorial jurisdiction . . . [i]n order for a statute to have extraterritorial application, there must be clear legislative intent\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]). As these cases reveal, the primary reason for the presumption against the extraterritorial application of statutes is that states have limited <em>authority </em>to regulate conduct beyond their territorial jurisdiction. Thus, this rule of statutory interpretation is akin to other rules of construction intended to preserve the validity of a statute. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 805, 640 A.2d 986 (1994) (\u201c[I]n evaluating [a] . . . challenge to the constitutionality of [a] statute, we read the statute narrowly in order to save its constitutionality, rather than broadly in order to destroy it. We will indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality . . . .\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">A number of courts have held, however, that the presumption that a statute does not operate outside the state\u2019s territorial jurisdiction applies not only when the application of the statute would regulate out-of-state conduct or property, and would therefore be of questionable validity as applied, but also when the application of the statute would provide a remedy or a benefit to out-of-state persons, which the state clearly has the power to do. For example, in <em>BMW Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peugeot Motors of America, Inc., </em>860 F.2d 212, 213 (6th Cir. 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit construed a Kentucky statute that entitled motor vehicle dealerships to protest the establishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>of a new motor vehicle dealership selling vehicles in the same line if the new dealership would be within a ten mile radius of the existing dealership. The plaintiff, a motor vehicle dealership in Ohio, had brought an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, claiming that the defendant, which intended to open a dealership in Kentucky, had violated the notice provisions of the statute. Id. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ultimately concluded that the doctrine of extraterritoriality did not apply to the statute because \u201cKentucky can define the duties of its citizens without that definition being considered extraterritorial\u201d and, \u201cwhere the defendants\u2019 conduct occurs in-state, application of the law to that conduct is not extraterritorial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 214. Nevertheless, because the express policy of the statute was to \u201c \u2018protect and preserve the investments and properties of <em>the citizens of [Kentucky]\u2019 </em>\u201d; (emphasis in original) id., 215; the court concluded that the statute did not entitle out-of-state dealerships to protest the establishment of dealerships within the state. Id.; see also <em>Fireside Nissan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fanning, </em>30 F.3d 206, 211 (1st Cir. 1994) (Massachusetts dealership was not entitled to protest establishment of Rhode Island dealership under Rhode Island statute that was intended to protect Rhode Island dealerships); <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Keystone Food Products, </em>United States District Court, Docket Nos. 07-5502, 08-1277, 08-1554, 2008 WL 4115856, *6 (E.D. Pa. August 28, 2008) (\u201c[s]tate consumer protection laws are designed to protect the residents of the state in which the statutes are promulgated\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Peerless Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>29 Colo. App. 436, 440-41, 487 P.2d 574 (1971) (insurance company, as surety on bond issued to motor vehicle dealer, not hable under Colorado anti-fraud statute for dealer\u2019s fraud that occurred outside of Colorado).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Other courts have concluded, however, that there is no presumption that statutes that provide remedies or benefits are not for the benefit of persons outside the state\u2019s territorial jurisdiction, especially when the provision of a remedy to such persons would also provide in-state benefits. See <em>Metropolitan Enterprise Corp. </em>v. <em>United Technologies International </em>Corp., United States District Court, Docket No. 3:03CV1685JBA, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12274 (D. Conn. June 28,2004) (\u201c[examination of the statutory language [of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act] and interpretative case law reveals no reason why a straightforward application of the phrase \u2018in this [s]tate\u2019 would exclude the conduct alleged here: [a] Connecticut seller, in connection with the sale or the offering for sale of its jet engines, hatching and implementing a plan inside the borders of Connecticut the deceptive or unfair effect of which is felt outside those borders\u201d); <em>Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>19 Cal. 4th 1036, 1063, 968 P.2d 539, 80 Cal.

This is a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See <em>McWeeny </em>v. <em>Hart</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>ford, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 66. \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">We begin with the language of \u00a7 8-8 (b), which provides that \u201cany person aggrieved by any decision of a board, including ... a special permit or special exception pursuant to section 8-3c, may take an appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located . . . .\u201d Section 8-8 (a) (1) defines an aggrieved person as \u201cany person owning land that abuts or is within a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">We conclude that, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the phrase \u201cany person\u201d as used in \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1) does not plainly and unambiguously encompass persons outside the state\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. A number of courts have held that the use of the word \u201cany\u201d in a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>does not rebut the presumption that the statute does not operate extraterritorially. See <em>Dur-Ite Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial </em>Commission, 394 Ill. 338, 349, 68 N.E.2d 717 (1946) (doctrine of extraterritoriality applies \u201cto statutes using general words, such as any and all, in describing the persons or acts to which the statute applies\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Sexton </em>v. <em>Ryder Truck Rental, </em>supra, 413 Mich. 435 (same). We agree with these courts that, when a statute regulates conduct, the use of the phrase \u201cany person\u201d does not plainly and unambiguously refer to persons outside the state\u2019s territorial jurisdiction because we presume that the legislature is aware of the constraints on its power to regulate conduct extraterritorially. See <em>R. C. Equity Group, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>285 Conn. 240, 257 n.20, 939 A.2d 1122 (2008) (court presumes that legislature is aware of common law and statutory backdrop of its enactments). We recognize that, because \u00a7 8-8 merely provides a procedural remedy, construing the phrase \u201cany person\u201d to encompass persons who do not own land in this state would not result in the regulation of out-of-state conduct or property. See <em>BMW Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peugeot Motors of America, </em>supra, 860 F.2d 214; <em>Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 19 Cal. 4th 1059. Moreover, we agree with the courts that have concluded that, when a state statute does not regulate conduct outside the state, there is no presumption that the statute does not apply to persons outside the state because the reason for that presumption \u2014 that states have limited power to regulate conduct outside their territorial jurisdiction \u2014 does not apply. See, e.g., <em>Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 1059. Nevertheless, because the phrase \u201cany person\u201d is ubiquitous in our statutes, including statutes that regulate conduct; see generally, e.g., General Statutes, tit. 53 and 53a; we cannot conclude that the legislature intends, in every instance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>which it uses the phrase, to encompass persons outside the territorial jurisdiction of the state. Accordingly, in construing \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1), we must \u201clook for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McWeeny </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The public policy underlying the statutes authorizing municipalities to adopt planning regulations, which govern subdivision plans; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-26 (a); is \u201cto promote, with the greatest efficiency and economy, the coordinated development of the municipality and the general welfare and prosperity of its people,\u201d and \u201cto secure the uniform and harmonious growth of villages, towns and cities.\u201d <em>Ferndale Dairy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>148 Conn. 172, 176, 169 A.2d 268 (1961). Zoning regulations, which are \u201cconcerned primarily with the use of property\u201d; id.; and which govern the issuance of special permits; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 (a); are intended to \u201cprotect the public health, safety, convenience and property values.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 (a);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> see also New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Canaan Zoning Regs., art. I, \u00a7 1.2.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We see no reason why, in enabling municipalities to adopt planning and zoning regulations designed to advance these public interests, and in authorizing landowners in near proximity to the subject land use to enforce compliance with the regulations through the appeal process, the legislature would have intended to exempt from such enforcement properties in locations where the greatest and most immediate effect of a proposed development would be on the owners of property that is located in another state. The statutory scheme assumes that uniformity within a zone, an orderly development process and compliance with special permit regulations are inherently beneficial to a municipality, and to its present and future citizens, even if no person owning land within the municipality is immediately and directly affected by a proposed project.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, if land use in a municipality in this state would render an adjoining road in another state unreasonably dangerous, it is reasonable to conclude that citizens of this state also will use the adjoining road and will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>exposed to the same unreasonable risk to their health and safety as the out-of-state citizens. We conclude, therefore, that allowing persons who own land in another state to challenge the legality of a proposed project will protect the interests of a municipality and its citizens in uniform and harmonious development and in public health and safety, and will not solely benefit the persons who own land in another state at the expense of citizens of this state. In any event, even if we assume, in a particular case, that a person who does not own land in this state would be the primary beneficiary of an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (b), we see no evidence that the legislature intended in this remedial statute that a municipality would be able to impose all of the burdens of a land use within the municipality on persons who own land in other states, with no recourse for those persons. See <em>Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 19 Cal. 4th 1063 (\u201c[legislature may reasonably conclude that California does have a legitimate interest in discouraging unlawful conduct that has a potential to harm California investors as <em>well as persons in other </em>states\u201d [emphasis added]); cf. <em>Wellswood Columbia, LLCv.

In support of this claim, they point out that New York courts have held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>that persons who do not own land in a New York municipality cannot appeal from the municipality\u2019s land use decisions. See <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Oyster Bay, </em>57 Misc. 2d 821, 822-23, 293 N.Y.S.2d 558 (1968) (by statute, town does not have automatic standing to challenge zoning regulations of adjoining town); <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>43 Misc. 2d 616, 618, 251 N.Y.S.2d 996 (1964) (persons who do not reside in municipality are not aggrieved by decisions of municipality\u2019s board of appeals), aff'd, 24 App. Div. 2d 704, 262 N.Y.S.2d 431 (1965); <em>Browning </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>178 Misc. 576, 576-77, 34 N.Y.S.2d 280 (nonresidents of village were not aggrieved by decision of village\u2019s board of trustees because \u201cjurisdiction of the board of trustees of any village is confined to property and persons within the territorial limits of the village\u201d and nonresidents \u201cwere not entitled to a notice of hearing and no interest of theirs could be the subject of adjudication by the board\u201d), aff'd, 264 App. Div. 777, 34 N.Y.S.2d 729 (1942).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A fortiori, the defendants argue, persons who own land in this state would not have standing to challenge a land use decision of a New York municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We are not persuaded. First, we conclude that the defendants read <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Oyster Bay, </em>supra, 57 Misc. 2d 822, too broadly. In that case, a state statute provided that adjoining towns were entitled to notice of hearings concerning zoning regulations, but that they did not have the right to seek review of the regulations. The court held that the statute did not deprive adjoining municipalities of standing to challenge the approval of a special exception. Id., 823. Nevertheless, it concluded that the adjoining municipality lacked standing because it had not been prejudiced by the granting of the special exception. Id. Thus, <em>Huntington </em>does not stand for the broad proposition that adjoining towns, or their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>residents, lack standing to appeal from land use decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Second, to the extent that <em>Wood </em>v. Freeman, supra, 43 Misc. 2d 618, and <em>Browning </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 178 Misc. 576, support the general proposition that, because towns lack jurisdiction outside their territorial limits, nonresidents always lack standing to challenge their decisions, we disagree with them for the reasons previously set forth in this opinion. Indeed, as the plaintiffs point out, more recent New York cases have expressed a more expansive view of standing to challenge land use decisions. See <em>Sun-Brite Car Wash, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning &amp; Appeals, </em>69 N.Y.2d 406, 413-15, 508 N.E.2d 130, 515 N.Y.S.2d 418 (1987) (because, \u201cin zoning litigation in particular, it is desirable that land use disputes be resolved on their own merits rather than by preclusive, restrictive standing rules,\u201d and because \u201cthe welfare of the entire community is involved when enforcement of a zoning law is at stake,\u201d person who has suffered injury that is within zone of interests that regulation was designed to protect has standing to challenge zoning decision); <em>Douglaston Civic Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>36 N.Y.2d 1, 6, 324 N.E.2d 317, 364 N.Y.S.2d 830 (1974) (\u201cWe are troubled by the apparent readiness of our courts in zoning litigation to dispose of disputes over land use on questions of standing without reaching the merits, an attribute which is glaringly inconsistent with the broadening rules of standing in related fields. . . . [O]ur concern is heightened because of the particular need in zoning cases for a broader rule of standing.\u201d [Citations omitted.]); <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Oyster Bay, </em>supra, 57 Misc. 2d 822 (adjoining municipality has standing to appeal from land use decision if it is classically aggrieved). Accordingly, we reject the defendants\u2019 claim and conclude that the trial court in each appeal improperly determined that the plaintiffs in the present case lacked standing to appeal from the commission\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>sions on the ground that they do not own land in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We next consider the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court\u2019s decision in each appeal may be affirmed on the ground that the plaintiffs did not own property within 100 feet of the land involved in the commission\u2019s decisions granting the special permit and the amended special permit, as required to establish statutory standing under \u00a7 8-8 (a) (l).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Specifically, they contend that the plaintiffs are not statutorily aggrieved because the subdivision of the property was not stayed pending appeal; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (h);<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and because the plaintiffs do not own land within 100 feet of parcel B, on which the proposed church is to be built.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The following undisputed facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. As we have indicated, Grace Property and Pacific Farm sought to subdivide the property into two parcels, parcel A and parcel B, and sought a special permit to construct a church on parcel B. Although the plaintiffs own land within a 100 foot radius of the undivided property, it is not disputed that none of the plaintiffs owns land within a 100 foot radius of any portion of parcel B.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that aggrievement is a basic requirement of standing, just as standing is a fundamental requirement of jurisdiction. If a party is found to lack [aggrievement], the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Soracco </em>v. <em>Williams Scotsman, Inc., </em>292 Conn. 86, 91, 971 A.2d 1 (2009). \u201cBecause a determination regarding the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction raises a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Webster Ins., Inc., </em>294 Conn. 206, 214, 982 A.2d 1053 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In support of their conclusions that the plaintiffs owned property within 100 feet of the land involved in the commission\u2019s decisions, the trial court in each appeal relied on General Statutes \u00a7 8-25 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny plan for subdivision shall, upon approval ... be filed or recorded by the applicant in the office of the town clerk not later than ninety days after the expiration of the appeal period under section 8-8, or in the case of an appeal, not later than ninety days after the termination of such appeal by dismissal, withdrawal or judgment in favor of the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>cant . . . .\u201d The trial court in the first appeal concluded that, under this provision, subdivision approvals do not become final until any appeal is finally resolved <em>and </em>the subdivision plan is filed, and, therefore, the land in the present case remained undivided. In the second appeal, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe plan for subdivision cannot become final within the meaning of \u00a7 8-25 during the pendency of the appeal,\u201d but it did not indicate whether the subdivision would be effective as of the date that the appeal was terminated or the date that the subdivision plan was filed. Accordingly, both courts concluded that the \u201cland involved\u201d in the commission\u2019s decisions is the entire undivided property.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The defendants claim that these conclusions were incorrect because, under \u00a7 8-8, an appeal does not stay proceedings on the decision appealed from. Accordingly, they argue, the subdivision of the property was effective as of the date of approval and parcel B is currently a separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">We conclude that, when there has been an appeal from a subdivision approval, a subdivision becomes effective on the date that an appeal from the subdivision approval is terminated. In construing \u00a7 8-25 (a), we do not write on a blank slate. In <em>Fyber Properties Killingworth Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Shanoff </em>228 Conn. 476, 481-83, 636 A.2d 834 (1994), this court concluded that, when there has been no appeal from a subdivision approval, the subdivision becomes effective as of the date that the subdivision was approved, not the date that the subdivision plan was filed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In support of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>conclusion, this court relied on the language of \u00a7 8-25 (a) and General Statutes \u00a7 8-26c.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Id., 482. Because, under \u00a7 8-25 (a), the time for filing the subdivision plan runs from the date of approval, which is the effective date of the subdivision, and, in the case of an appeal, the time for filing runs from the date that the appeal is terminated, it is reasonable to conclude that the date that the appeal is terminated is the effective date of the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">This interpretation is bolstered by our statement in <em>Fyber Properties Killingworth Ltd. Partnership </em>that, \u201c[b]y amending ... \u00a7 8-25 (a) in 1993 . . . the legislature intended to link the date of filing more closely to the date of approval.\u201d Id., 482 n.14. If the legislature had intended that, even in the case of an appeal, the subdivision would be effective as of the date of approval, it is reasonable to conclude that it would have required that the time for filing the subdivision would run from that date, not from the date that the appeal was terminated. Put another way, in light of its intent to link the date of filing more closely to the date of approval, i.e., the effective date of the subdivision, we find it highly unlikely that the legislature intended that, in the case of an appeal, the subdivision would be in effect on the date of approval, but there would be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>subdivision plan on file for the indefinite period that the appeal is pending. Accordingly, we conclude that the subdivision approval in the present case will not be effective until these appeals terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We recognize that this interpretation of \u00a7 8-25 (a) appears to be inconsistent with \u00a7 8-8 (h), which provides in relevant part that appeals pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (b) \u201cshall not stay proceedings on the decision appealed from. . . .\u201d This court has held, however, that \u201c[w]hen general and specific statutes conflict they should be harmoniously construed so the more specific statute controls.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Longley </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>284 Conn. 149, 177, 931 A.2d 890 (2007). We must conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 8-25 (a), which specifically applies to subdivision approvals, trumps \u00a7 8-8 (h), which governs appeals from land use decisions generally. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court in each appeal properly concluded that the plaintiffs are statutorily aggrieved because they own land within 100 feet of the undivided property.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">CLAIM RELATING SOLELY TO DOCKET NO.

We conclude that we need not determine whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> applied in the second appeal, because, even if we assume that the trial court in that appeal was bound by the determination of the trial court in the first appeal, our conclusion that the trial court in the first appeal improperly concluded that the plaintiffs were not statutorily aggrieved also applies to the second appeal.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>293 Conn. 435, 457, 978 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>A.2d 1089 (2009) (\u201cjudgments that are not by their terms limited to prospective application are presumed to apply retroactively ... to cases that are pending\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">CLAIM RELATING SOLELY TO DOCKET NO.

CV85-0076922S and CV85-0077162S (August 27,1987), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. <em>Primerica </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 85, 558 A.2d 646 (1989). The trial court in that case concluded that, because \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1) confers standing to appeal on landowners who have not been classically aggrieved by a land use decision, \u201cthe policy reasons for recognizing out-of-state abutting landowners as aggrieved parties . . . are not particularly persuasive.\u201d Id. We disagree. In enacting the portion of \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1) that confers standing to appeal on persons who own land within 100 feet of the land involved in the decision, the primary intent of the legislature was not to grant standing to appeal to persons who are unaffected by land use decisions (although the statute may have had that incidental effect). Rather, the \u201clegislature presumed as a matter of common knowledge that persons owning property within close proximity to a projected zoning action would be sufficiently affected by the decision of a zoning agency to be entitled to appeal that decision to court.\u201d <em>Caltabiano </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 662, 668-69, 560 A.2d 975 (1989). The intent of the legislature was merely to eliminate \u201cthe delay, difficulty and expense of <em>proving </em>classical aggrievement . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 669. Moreover, even though there may be cases in which a person who is not affected by a land use decision will have statutory standing to appeal from the decision, that person cannot prevail in the appeal unless he or she establishes that the decision violated relevant statutes or regulations. Accordingly, we cannot presume that conferring standing to appeal on persons who do not own land in Connecticut will not advance the public policies that underlie the land use statutes, thereby benefiting citizens of this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\"> This clearly is not the law in Connecticut.

Thereafter, the plaintiff filed the subdivision map with the town clerk, as required by \u00a7 8-25. Id., 479. The defendant, the tax assessor for Killingworth, assessed the plaintiffs property as a completed subdivision as of October 1, 1989, which was after the date that the planning and zoning commission had approved the subdivision application, but before the date that the plaintiff had filed the subdivision map with the town clerk.

On appeal, this court concluded that a subdivision becomes effective for purposes of municipal taxation on the date that the commission approves the subdivision, not the date that the subdivision map is filed with the town clerk. Id., 483. We expressly stated, however, that, \u201c[i]n reaching this decision, we confine ourselves to the facts of this case.

Partnership </em>in 1994, those amendments have no effect on the applicability of our analysis in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b462-6\"> The defendants contend, however, that, even if the subdivision was not effective as of the date of the approval, if the trial court in the first appeal ultimately dismisses the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the subdivision approval, the subdivision will then become effective and the plaintiffs will lack aggrievement in the second appeal from the approval of the amended special permit application. See <em>Primerica </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 85, 94, 558 A.2d 646 (1989) (\u201cin order to retain standing as an aggrieved person, a party must have and must maintain a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the appeal throughout the course of the appeal\u201d). We disagree. Because, under the specific circumstances of this case, the subdivision application and the amended special permit application were interdependent parts of the same transaction, we conclude that the trial court in the first appeal will not be able to determine the legality of the subdivision approval before the trial court in the second appeal determines the legality of the amended special permit approval. Rather, the decision of the trial court in the first appeal will be contingent on the trial court\u2019s determination in the second appeal, and vice versa. Cf. <em>Lord Family of Windsor, LLC v. Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>288 Conn. 730, 737, 954 A.2d 831 (2008) (\u201c[I]n considering a subdivision application in its planning capacity, the commission is required to enforce applicable zoning regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>.... Thus, the commission is required to assume that a landowner who seeks a subdivision approval will use the subdivided property for the permitted purpose.\u201d [Citation omitted.]). In other words, if the trial court in the second appeal determines that the proposed use violates the zoning regulations, Grace Property and Grace Farms may decide that there is no reason to subdivide the property, and the first appeal may be rendered moot. Conversely, if the trial court in the first appeal determines that the subdivision violates the subdivision regulations, the second appeal will be rendered moot, because the parcel on which the proposed church is to be constructed will not exist. Because the first and second appeals are inextricably intertwined, consolidation of the appeals may be appropriate on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\"> \u201cThe common-law doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, embodies a judicial policy in favor of judicial economy, the stability of former judgments and finality. . . .
