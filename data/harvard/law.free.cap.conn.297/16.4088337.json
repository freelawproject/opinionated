The state appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court dismissing the juvenile delinquency proceedings brought against the respondent, Jan Carlos D., on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over the proceedings because the state had not commenced the proceedings on speedy information in violation of \u00a7 54-lf (a). We conclude that \u00a7 54-lf (a) does not apply to juveniles who receive such a summons and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. On June 4, 2008, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133 (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the respondent was served with a summons alleging that, in connection with an incident that had occurred on May, 14, 2008, he had committed assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61, and disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The respondent appeared in court on June 13, 2008, at which time the state filed a delinquency petition alleging that he had committed the foregoing crimes. At a hearing on July 23, 2008, the respondent orally moved to dismiss the charges on the basis of the delay between the incident during which the allegedly unlawful conduct took place and the service of the summons. Specifically, the respondent characterized the receipt of the summons as an arrest and argued that it was unlawful because it was not initiated on speedy information, which implicated the court\u2019s jurisdiction and, therefore, necessi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>tated dismissal of the charges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state argued that the proper remedy for the lack of speedy information was a motion to suppress rather than a motion to dismiss. The court dismissed the charges without prejudice on the ground that the respondent had not been arrested on speedy information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On August 11, 2008, the court granted the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">On September 23, 2008, the state filed a motion for articulation, requesting that the trial court articulate the factual and legal grounds for its decision to dismiss the charges against the respondent. The Appellate Court granted the motion and, on January 21, 2009, the trial court issued an oral articulation. The trial court stated that it was relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>115 Conn. 279, 283, 161 A. 239 (1932), to support its conclusion that it had the authority to dismiss delinquency proceedings when the respondent was subject to a warrantless arrest that was not on speedy information as required by \u00a7 54-If (a). Specifically, the court relied on our statement in <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 283, that, \u201c[t]he right to arrest without a warrant had its origin in the necessity of preventing the escape of offenders during the period of delay incident to the procuring of warrants. When there is time to procure a warrant without danger of the escape of the offender an arrest should not be made without it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The state argues that the court improperly dismissed the charges against the respondent because he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>not subject to a custodial arrest and therefore was not arrested for the purposes of \u00a7 54-lf (a). The state reasons that the summons did not constitute an arrest because it merely directed the respondent to appear in court on the appointed day and time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The respondent argues that \u00a7 54-lf (a), and the speedy information provision therein, apply in the present case because, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Superior Court for juvenile matters sits as a criminal court when hearing delinquency proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The issue of whether the trial court properly interpreted \u00a7 54-lf (a) presents a question of law, over which we employ plenary review. <em>Key Air, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>294 Conn. 225, 232, 983 A.2d 1 (2009). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . [General Statutes] \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 232-33. A statute is ambiguous if, when read in context, it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>291 Conn. 642, 654, 969 A.2d 750 (2009). Additionally, statutory silence does not necessarily equate to ambiguity. <em>Manifold v. Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 410, 419, 862 A.2d 292 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u201c[W]e are [also] guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construction . . . requires us to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter .... Accordingly, [i]n determining the meaning of a statute . . . we look not only at the provision at issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 310, 819 A.2d 260 (2003); <em>Felician Sisters of St. Francis of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Historic District Commission, </em>284 Conn. 838, 850, 937 A.2d 39 (2008) (\u201c[T]he legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construction . . . requires [this court] to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 l-2z, we begin with the text of the statute. Section 54-lf (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cPeace officers . . . shall arrest, without previous complaint and warrant, any person for any offense in their jurisdiction, when the person is taken or apprehended in the act or on the speedy information of others . . . .\u201d The plain language of the statute offers no clear guidance regarding whether \u00a7 54-lf (a) applies to juveniles, as it neither explicitly includes nor excludes juveniles from its purview. We turn our attention, therefore, to other related statutes. The legislature has provided specific protections for juveniles regarding speedy information. Section 46b-133 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNothing in this part shall be construed as preventing the arrest of a child, with or without a warrant, as may be provided by law, or as preventing the issuance of warrants by judges in the manner provided by section 54-2a, <em>except that no child shall be taken into custody on such process except on apprehension in the act, or on speedy information, or in other cases when the use of such process appears imperative. . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>added.) The statute also governs the arrest, release and detention of juveniles. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133 (b) through (d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Section 46b-133 is part of a larger legislative scheme governing the adjudication of criminal matters involving juveniles. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 et seq. It is well established that \u201cthe legislature has [created] a separate system for the disposition of cases involving juveniles accused of wrongdoing\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>206 Conn. 323, 329, 537 A.2d 483 (1988); and, accordingly, \u201cdelinquency proceedings in juvenile court are fundamentally different from criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>Ledbetter, </em>263 Conn. 1, 13, 818 A.2d 1 (2003). \u201cIndeed, adjudication as a juvenile rather than prosecution as an adult carries significant benefits, chief among which are a determination of delinquency rather than criminality; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121; confidentiality; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-124; limitations with respect to sentencing; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140; erasure of files; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-146; and isolation from the adult criminal population. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133 [d]; see also <em>In re Tyvonne M., </em>211 Conn. 151, 158-61, 558 A.2d 661 (1989). <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel C., </em>245 Conn. 93, 103, 715 A.2d 652 (1998). Thus, [a] delinquency petition does not charge a child with having committed a crime and . . . adjudication of a juvenile offense is not a conviction . . . and does not permit the imposition of criminal sanctions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">When read in the context of the statutory scheme applicable to juveniles, therefore, the <em>inapplicability </em>of \u00a7 54-lf (a) within that framework is plain and unambiguous. Indeed, the legislature\u2019s establishment of an \u201cunambiguous statutory framework [providing that criminal and juvenile proceedings are governed by separate procedures] counsels against interpolating into our juvenile justice system a single statute from the laws governing adult criminal procedures. The legislature has expressed no such intention.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>In re Prudencio O., </em>229 Conn. 691, 698, 643 A.2d 265 (1994). As part of the system for juvenile adjudication, the legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>established a procedure specific to juveniles; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-135 (right to counsel); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-138 (right to summon witnesses); and has prescribed the process by which a case is commenced. Many of the rights afforded adults at the commencement of criminal proceedings are specifically afforded to juveniles. Significantly, the legislature has established that a summons is a permissible method of commencing delinquency proceedings. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133 (c) (\u201c[w]hen a child is arrested for the commission of a delinquent act and the child is not placed in detention or referred to a diversionary program, an officer shall serve a written complaint and summons on the child and his parent, guardian or other person having control of the child\u201d). Additionally, as we have already noted, the legislature also has enacted a speedy information provision specific to juveniles. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133 (a) (\u201cno child shall be taken into custody on such process except on apprehension in the act, or on speedy information, or in other cases when the use of such process appears imperative\u201d). It is a well established principle of statutory construction that \u201cspecific terms in a statute covering a given subject matter will prevail over the more general language of the same or another statute that otherwise might be controlling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Branford </em>v. <em>Santa Barbara, </em>294 Conn. 803, 813, 988 A.2d 221 (2010). Accordingly, because the legislature has provided a specific procedure for commencing delinquency proceedings against juveniles, which includes service of a summons, and also has established a specific provision regarding speedy information, we conclude that \u00a7 54-If (a) does not apply to juveniles who receive a summons regarding the commencement of delinquency proceedings and alleging the commission of a crime. To determine otherwise would contravene \u201cthe legislature\u2019s intent that [juveniles] accused of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>wrongdoing be accorded different treatment from adults.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 361, 538 A.2d 185 (1988). Therefore, we conclude that \u00a7 54-lf (a) is inapplicable to juveniles in regard to the commencement of delinquency proceedings by service of a summons alleging the commission of criminal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cPeace officers, as defined in subdivision (9) of section 53a-3, in their respective precincts, shall arrest, without previous complaint and warrant, any person for any offense in their jurisdiction, when the person is taken or apprehended in the act or on the speedy information of others . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-11\"> The state appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133 provides in relevant part: \u201c(c) Upon the arrest of any child by an officer, such officer may release him to the custody of his parent or parents, guardian or some other suitable person or agency or may immediately turn him over to a juvenile detention center. When a child is arrested for the commission of a delinquent act and the child is not placed in detention or referred to a diversionary program, an officer shall serve a written complaint and summons on the child and his parent, guardian or other person having control of the child. Such parent, guardian or other person shall execute a written promise to appear in court at the time and place specified in such summons. If any person so summoned wilfully fails to appear in court at the time and place so specified, the court may issue a warrant for the child\u2019s arrest or a capias to assure the appearance in court of such parent, guardian or other person. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Although the legislature amended \u00a7 46b-133 during a special session in June, 2007; see Public Acts, Spec.

The state contends that, at most, the proper remedy for a violation of \u00a7 54-lf (a) is the suppression of any evidence tainted by the unlawful conduct. Because we conclude that \u00a7 54-lf (a) is inapplicable in the present case, we need not consider whether dismissal of the charges is the proper remedy for a violation of \u00a7 54-lf (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cJuvenile matters in the criminal session include all proceedings concerning delinquent children in the state and persons sixteen years of age and older who are under the supervision of a juvenile probation officer while on probation or a suspended commitment to the Department of Children and Families, for purposes of enforcing any court orders entered as part of such probation or suspended commitment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Although the legislature amended \u00a7 46b-121 in 2007; see Public Acts, Spec.

Hereinafter, all references to \u00a7 46b-121 are to the current 2009 statutory revision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b42-9\"> The respondent raises a due process claim, arguing for the first time on appeal that by subjecting him to a warrantless arrest, the state violated his rights under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the constitution of Connecticut. As this court has recognized repeatedly, \u201ca party may seek to prevail on unpreserved claims under the plain error doctrine; see Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; or, if the claims are constitutional in nature, under <em>[State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989)], if the party affirmatively requests and adequately briefs his entitlement to such review in his main brief.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>281 Conn. 486, 533 n.23, 915 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 888, 128 S.

The trial court, however, explicitly relied on \u00a7 54-lf (a), and the parties have not raised the applicability of \u00a7 46b-133 (a). Therefore, we are not presented with the issue of whether the requirements of \u00a7 46b-133 (a) apply to the issuance of a summons pursuant to \u00a7 46b-133 (c) and do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133 provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) Whenever a child is brought before a judge of the Superior Court, such judge shall immediately have the case proceeded upon as a juvenile matter.
