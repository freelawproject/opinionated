The state claims that the trial court failed to apply controlling precedent requiring narrow construction of a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity when it awarded the plaintiff, Herbert Hicks, postjudgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 37-3b. Because we conclude that the language in \u00a7\u00a7 52-556 and 37-3b does not constitute a clear and unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to a claim of postjudgment interest, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiff was injured dining an automobile accident in 2001. Claiming that a state employee negligently had caused the accident while operating a state owned and insured vehicle, the plaintiff brought an action against the state pursuant to \u00a7 52-556 and obtained a jury verdict in his favor. After the judgment was affirmed on appeal; see <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>State, </em>287 Conn. 421, 464, 948 A.2d 982 (2008); the state paid the plaintiff the amount of the judgment, but did not include postjudgment interest. The plaintiff filed a motion for postjudgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 37-3b, which the state opposed on the ground of sovereign immunity. On January 13, 2009, the trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs motion and ordered the state to pay postjudgment interest. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The issue of whether the express waiver of sovereign immunity in \u00a7 52-556 also waives the state\u2019s sovereign immunity with regard to the recovery of postjudgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 37-3b presents a question of statutory interpretation, over which we exercise plenary review. <em>Tayco Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>294 Conn. 673, 679, 986 A.2d 290 (2010). \u201cWhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Keeping these principles of statutory construction in mind, we turn to the question of whether the legislature, through \u00a7 52-556, waived the state\u2019s sovereign immunity with regard to postjudgment interest otherwise recoverable pursuant to \u00a7 37-3b. \u201cSovereign immunity relates to a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over a case, and therefore presents a question of law over which we exercise de novo review. . . . The principle that the state cannot be sued without its consent, or sovereign immunity, is well established under our case law. . . . It has deep roots in this state and our legal system in general, finding its origin in ancient common law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DaimlerChrysler </em>Corp. v. Law, 284 Conn. 701, 711, 937 A.2d 675 (2007). \u201cExceptions to this doctrine are few and narrowly construed under our jurisprudence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of sovereign immunity is a rule of common law that operates as a strong presumption in favor of the state\u2019s immunity from liability or suit. . . . [T]his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>court has recognized the well established principle that statutes in derogation of sovereign immunity should be strictly construed. . . . [When] there is <em>any doubt </em>about their meaning or intent they are given the effect which makes the least rather than the most change in sovereign immunity.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Envirotest Systems Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>293 Conn. 382, 387-88, 978 A.2d 49 (2009). \u201cWhen the legislature intends to waive immunity from suit or liability, it expresses that intent by using explicit statutory language.\u201d <em>Rivers </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>288 Conn. 1, 12, 950 A.2d 1247 (2008). Accordingly, in an action seeking damages against the state, \u201ca plaintiff seeking to circumvent the doctrine of sovereign immunity must show that . . . the legislature, either expressly or by force of a necessary implication, statutorily waived the state\u2019s sovereign immunity . . . .\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 314, 828 A.2d 549 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Section 52-556 expressly waives the state\u2019s immunity with regard to \u201cdamages\u201d for injuries caused by motor vehicles operated by a state employee and owned and insured by the state. The statute is silent as to whether the waiver of immunity with respect to liability for damages includes a waiver of immunity for postjudgment interest. Indeed, \u00a7 52-556 makes no reference whatsoever to postjudgmerit interest. We have stated that mere legislative silence \u201cdoes not . . . necessarily equate to ambiguity . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>291 Conn. 642, 654, 969 A.2d 750 (2009). In determining whether legislative silence renders a statute ambiguous, we read the statute in context to determine whether the language \u201cis susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Certainly, however, the absence of <em>any </em>reference in \u00a7 52-556 to postjudgment interest, particularly in light of the narrow con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>struction we accord to waivers of sovereign immunity, suggests that the only reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 52-556 is that the legislature did not, by waiving immunity from liability for damages, intend to waive immunity with respect to postjudgment interest. The scope of the intended waiver is clear from the language of \u00a7 52-556, which allows an injured person only to \u201crecover damages for such injury.\u201d Thus, the only way that the express waiver of immunity in \u00a7 52-556 could necessarily imply a waiver of immunity for postjudgment interest would be if the phrase \u201cdamages for such injury\u201d could be construed necessarily to include postjudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Because \u00a7 52-556 does not define the term \u201cdamages,\u201d we are guided by General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a), which provides: \u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language; and technical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly.\u201d \u201c[D]amages,\u201d which has acquired a specific meaning in the law, is defined as \u201c[m]oney claimed by, or ordered to be paid to, a person as compensation for loss or injury . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009). The \u201cinjury\u201d for which a plaintiff may recover damages is specifically identified in \u00a7 52-556 as the injury suffered as a result of a state employee\u2019s negligent operation of a state owned and insured motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Turning to \u00a7 37-3b, we emphasize that there is no language to suggest that postjudgment interest is awarded <em>as a part of damages </em>for the specific injury contemplated in \u00a7 52-556. Such interest is recoverable \u201cin any action to recover damages for injury to the person, or to real or personal property, caused by negligence, computed from the date that is twenty days after the date of judgment or the date that is ninety days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>after the date of verdict, whichever is earlier, upon the amount of the judgment.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 37-3b (a). Thus, interest pursuant to \u00a7 37-3b is computed only after and upon the amount of judgment. It is calculated <em>after </em>the trier of fact has calculated the amount of \u201cdamages for such injury\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. If, within twenty days, the defendant pays the damages awarded, then no interest is due. Moreover, the amount of interest recoverable is calculated only \u201cupon the amount of the judgment.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 37-3b (a). Interest accrues only if the damages are not paid. An award of interest, therefore, first necessitates a factual finding of a debt now due \u2014 a specific liquidated sum due. Thus, interest awarded pursuant to \u00a7 37-3b is in addition to and based upon the amount of damages as determined by the trier of fact. Postjudgment interest, therefore, cannot be an element of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">This reading of the plain language of \u00a7 52-556 is supported by our reasoning in <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 534 A.2d 888 (1987). In <em>Struckman, </em>we held that General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which waives sovereign immunity for \u201cdamages\u201d sustained by a person injured by means of a defective highway, does not waive immunity from prejudgment interest. Id., 556-59. We reasoned that, although \u201cthere is some ambiguity concerning whether the \u2018damages\u2019 referred to in \u00a7 13a-144 include interest ... a statute that generally allows interest awards does not waive a state\u2019s sovereign immunity unless there is an express provision to that effect in the statute.\u201d Id., 558-59. Accordingly, \u201c[i]n the absence of clear legislative intent\u201d that the waiver of sovereign immunity from damages in \u00a7 13a-144 also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>applies to interest, we declined to interpret the statute as waiving the state\u2019s sovereign immunity as to prejudgment interest. Id., 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">We therefore conclude that the meaning of the text of \u00a7 52-556 is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results. The term \u201cdamages\u201d in \u00a7 52-556 does not include postjudgment interest, and the only reasonable interpretation of the statute is that the state did not waive sovereign immunity with regard to postjudgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 37-3b.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The plaintiff contends, nonetheless, that postjudgment interest was an element of damages in 1927 when the legislature enacted \u00a7 52-556; see Public Acts 1927, c. 209; and, therefore, that the state\u2019s waiver of immunity with respect to damages necessarily implies a waiver of immunity with respect to postjudgment interest. He observes that in <em>Babes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>247 Conn. 256, 264-65, 721 A.2d 511 (1998), this court noted that, when the legislature waived sovereign immunity for a state employee\u2019s negligent operation of a state owned and insured motor vehicle in 1927 by enacting \u00a7 52-556, it intended that the state would be subject to the substantive rules governing negligence actions at that time. The plaintiff urges us to accede to the trial court\u2019s reasoning in the present case: \u201cThe statutory right to postjudgment interest as an element of damages, as currently codified in \u00a7 37-3b, was applicable in negligence cases long before the legislature waived sovereign immunity for negligence actions under \u00a7 52-556 in 1927 and, as such, the state is subject to \u00a7 37-3b in actions brought against it under \u00a7 52-556.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\"><em>Babes, </em>however, is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Babes, </em>the plaintiff administratrix sought to recover damages for the wrongful death of her decedent in an automobile accident that allegedly had been caused by the negligence of a state employee who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>operating a motor vehicle owned and insured by the state. <em>Babes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 260. The issue presented to this court was whether, \u201c[w]henthe [s]tate is sued pursuant to its waiver of sovereign immunity in ... \u00a7 52-556, it is immune from a reallocation of damages pursuant to the provisions of [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-572h (g)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the event that it is a liable defendant and the plaintiff is unable to recover the damages awarded against another liable defendant?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 257-59. This court held that the state is not immune from the reallocation of damages under \u00a7 52-572h (g) on the basis of the language, legislative history and attendant statutes of \u00a7 52-572h; id., 266-71; and, further, that the reallocation provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (g) were intended to apply to the state in the same manner that they apply to every other defendant. Id., 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">We did not, however, allow for an expansion of damages beyond those permitted by a common-law negligence action. Although we held that \u00a7 52-572h (g) is applicable to an action brought against the state pursuant to \u00a7 52-556; id., 271-72; we did not hold that reallocated damages are separate from \u201cdamages for such injury\u201d as described under \u00a7 52-556. Indeed, we stated that, \u201cif the legislature waives sovereign immunity by creating a separate statutory cause of action against the state . . . the statute should not be read so as to have implicitly waived the state\u2019s immunity from the imposition, pursuant to separate and distinct statutes, of damages or costs <em>in excess </em>of those damages expressly authorized in the statute creating the cause of action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 264-65. Put another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>way, in <em>Babes, </em>we held that when the state has waived liability with respect to damages, it cannot evade a portion of the liability it has accepted simply because the plaintiff is unable to recover damages against another liable defendant. Reallocation of damages pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h (g) does not require the state to pay any money to a plaintiff in excess of the damages recoverable pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. Recovery of postjudgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 37-3b, in contrast, would require the state to pay out of its coffers moneys above and beyond the amount recoverable pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. The reasoning of <em>Babes, </em>therefore, is not applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The plaintiff also contends that, from a public policy standpoint, postjudgment interest is necessary to the orderly payment of judgments. He argues that, without postjudgment interest, the state could delay payment on judgments without penalty. This argument ignores the \u201cstrong policy reason\u201d behind the doctrine of sovereign immunity \u2014 \u201cto prevent the imposition of enormous fiscal burdens on states.\u201d <em>Fetterman </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>192 Conn. 539, 551-52, 473 A.2d 1176 (1984). \u201cSovereign immunity rests on the principle and on the hazard that the subjection of the state and federal governments to private litigation might constitute a serious interference with the performance of their functions and with their control over their respective instrumentalities, funds and property.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pamela B. </em>v. <em>Ment, </em>244 Conn. 296, 328, 709 A.2d 1089 (1998). We previously have recognized that \u201cthe state engages in activities of a scope and variety far beyond that of any town or city, that the demands upon its resources figuratively approach infinity, and that state operations affect vastly larger numbers of people.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 330, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990). Public policy does not demand state liability for postjudgment interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>motor vehicle negligence cases. Moreover, there is no public policy exception to the principle that the state cannot be sued for money damages without its consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the plaintiffs motion for an award of postjudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\"> The plaintiff named both the state of Connecticut and the department of transportation as defendants in his complaint.
