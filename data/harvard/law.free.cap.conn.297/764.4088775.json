The plaintiffs, Thomas C. Foley and Foley for Governor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the ruling of the trial court denying their motion for a temporary injunction. The trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary injunction to: (1) enjoin the named defendant, the state elections enforcement commission (commission),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from approving the formation of the defendant Fedele 2010 Joint Gubernatorial Campaign Committee (joint committee) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-709;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) enjoin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the defendants, Nancy Wyman, the state comptroller, and Denise L. Nappier, the state treasurer, from disbursing campaign funds to the joint committee and to the defendants Fedele 2010 and Boughton for CT 2010, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 9-705<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>9-713.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After an expedited hearing, this court rendered judgment in the form of a truncated opinion affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>the ruling of the trial court. We indicated that a full opinion explaining our decision would be released at a later date. This is that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">To provide context for our analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we set forth at the outset an overview of the election program, which is administered by the commission and provides public financing for campaigns for certain state offices, including the offices of governor and lieutenant governor. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 9-702 and 9-703. In exchange for this financing, participating candidates agree to limit their campaign spending to amounts specified in the election program. In addition, to qualify for financing under the election program, participating candidates must obtain a specified aggregate amount of \u201cqualifying contributions\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 9-702 (b);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which consist of contributions from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>qualified electors that cannot exceed $100, with the aggregate amount depending on the office for which the candidate is running. General Statutes \u00a7 9-704. Candidates for the office of governor must obtain qualifying contributions in the aggregate amount of $250,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 9-704 (a) (l).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In addition to the initial grant of public funds, participating candidates receive supplemental matching grants when an opposing nonparticipating candidate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>receives contributions, loans or other funds, or makes an expenditure, in excess of the expenditure limit for the particular office for the applicable primary campaign or general campaign period. General Statutes \u00a7 9-713. The supplemental grants are distributed in increments when the nonparticipating candidate receives contributions or makes expenditures exceeding 100 percent, 125 percent, 150 percent and 175 percent of the applicable expenditure limit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 9-713 (a) through (d)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The election program also provides that a candidate for the office of lieutenant governor and a candidate for the office of governor are deemed to be campaigning jointly upon the occurrence of certain events.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 9-709. Under \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (B) (ii), \u201call contributions received by . . . [a] candidate committee of a candidate for the office of Lieutenant Governor who is deemed to be jointly campaigning with a candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor under subsection (a) of section 9-709, which meet the criteria for qualifying contributions to candidate committees under this section shall be considered in calculating such amounts . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">With this background in mind, we set forth the undisputed facts and procedural history. The Connecticut Republican Party (party) held its convention for the purpose of endorsing candidates for multiple statewide offices, including the office of governor, on May 21 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>22, 2010. The party endorsed Foley as its candidate for the office of governor and Mark D. Boughton as its candidate for the office of lieutenant governor. Foley for Governor, Inc., is Foley\u2019s campaign committee and Boughton for CT 2010 was Boughton\u2019s campaign committee. Michael C. Fedele and R. Nelson \u201cOz\u201d Griebel garnered sufficient support at the convention to qualify to be placed on the ballot in the Republican primary election as candidates for the office of governor. Fedele 2010 was Fedele\u2019s campaign committee and Oz for Governor, Inc., is Griebel\u2019s campaign committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Both Fedele and Boughton elected to participate in the election program. On July 2, 2010, Fedele 2010 and Boughton for CT 2010 formed the joint committee pursuant to \u00a7 9-709 (a) and applied for public funding under the election program. As of July 1, 2010, Fedele 2010 had raised $228,232 in qualifying contributions. The commission approved the formation of the joint committee and its application for public financing on July 8, 2010. The joint committee qualified for public financing under the election program only because, pursuant to \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (B) (ii), the commission deemed contributions received by Boughton for CT 2010 to be qualifying contributions to the joint committee. A number of individuals who had contributed to Boughton for CT 2010 before the formation of the joint committee also had contributed to Fedele 2010. In several cases, the aggregate amount contributed by an individual contributor to both candidates exceeded $100. Without these dual contributions that, in the aggregate, exceeded $100, the joint committee would not have met the $250,000 threshold for qualifying contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">On July 9,2010, the plaintiffs filed a verified complaint seeking a temporary and permanent injunction and a judgment declaring that \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) does not permit consideration of multiple contributions by the same individual that, in the aggregate, exceed $100 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>detemiining whether a joint campaign committee formed under \u00a7 9-709 is eligible for public funds under the election program; that \u00a7 9-709 does not permit an endorsed candidate for lieutenant governor to form a joint campaign committee with a nonendorsed candidate for governor; and that \u00a7 9-713 does not permit the disbursement to a participating candidate of supplemental funds on the basis of contributions received or expenditures made by an opposing nonparticipating candidate prior to the beginning of the primary campaign period. The plaintiffs also sought a temporary and permanent injunction enjoining the commission from approving the formation of the joint committee, enjoining Wyman from drawing an order on Nappier for payment of election program funds to the joint committee, and enjoining Nappier from disbursing funds to the joint committee. After a hearing, the trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary injunction based on its determination that, in light of the court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutes, they were not likely to prevail on the merits of their claims. The plaintiffs then filed an application for certification to appeal from the trial court\u2019s interlocutory ruling pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a, which the Chief Justice granted. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The plaintiffs claim on appeal that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) an endorsed candidate for lieutenant governor may form a joint campaign committee with a nonendorsed candidate for governor under \u00a7 9-709 (a); (2) amounts contributed to the committee for a candidate for the office of lieutenant governor before the start of the primary campaign may be considered in determining whether a joint committee has met the qualifying threshold under \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1); (3) when a single individual has made dual contributions to the committee for the candidate for the office of lieutenant governor and to the committee for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>candidate for the office of governor that, in the aggregate, exceed $100, the amount in excess of $100 may be considered in determining whether a joint committee has reached the qualifying threshold of $250,000 for candidates for the office of governor under \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1); and (4) in determining whether a candidate participating in the election program is entitled to supplemental grants for a primary campaign pursuant to \u00a7 9-713 (a), contributions received by or expenditures made by the opposing nonparticipating candidate before the primary period has started may be considered. We reject each of these claims and direct the trial court to render judgment for the defendants.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">We first address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly determined that an endorsed candidate for the office of lieutenant governor may form a joint campaign committee with a nonendorsed candidate for the office of governor under \u00a7 9-709 (a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Like all of the issues on appeal, whether \u00a7 9-709 (a) authorizes an endorsed candidate for lieutenant governor to form a joint campaign committee with a nonendorsed candidate for governor is a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>291 Conn. 307, 316, 968 A.2d 396 (2009). \u201cWhen construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. . . . In seeking to determine the meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. <em>If, </em>after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">\u201cIt is well settled . . . that we do not defer to [an agency\u2019s] construction of a statute \u2014 a question of law\u2014 when . . . the [provisions] at issue previously ha[ve] not been subjected to judicial scrutiny or when the [agency\u2019s] interpretation has not been time tested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Christopher R. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Retardation, </em>277 Conn. 594, 603, 893 A.2d 431 (2006). In the present case, \u00a7 9-709 has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny and the commission\u2019s interpretation of the statute has not been time tested. Accordingly, we do not defer to the commission\u2019s interpretations. See footnotes 8, 10 and 11 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statute. Section 9-709 (a) provides: \u201cFor purposes of this section, expenditures made to aid or promote the sue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>cess of both a candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor and a candidate for nomination or election to the office of Lieutenant Governor jointly, shall be considered expenditures made to aid or promote the success of a candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor. The party-endorsed candidate for nomination or election to the office of Lieutenant Governor and the party-endorsed candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor shall be deemed to be aiding or promoting the success of both candidates jointly upon the earliest of the following: (1) The primary, whether held for the office of Governor, the office of Lieutenant Governor, or both; (2) if no primary is held for the office of Governor or Lieutenant Governor, the fourteenth day following the close of the convention; or (3) a declaration by the party-endorsed candidates that they will campaign jointly. Any other candidate for nomination or election to the office of Lieutenant Governor shall be deemed to be aiding or promoting the success of such candidacy for the office of Lieutenant Governor and the success of a candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor j ointly upon a declaration by the candidates that they shall campaign jointly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The plaintiffs contend that, because the second sentence of \u00a7 9-709 (a) refers specifically to \u201c[t]he party-endorsed candidate for nomination or election to the office of Lieutenant Governor,\u201d the phrase \u201c[a]ny <em>other </em>candidate for nomination or election to the office of Lieutenant Governor\u201d in the third sentence of \u00a7 9-709 (a) must mean a nonendorsed candidate for the office of lieutenant governor. (Emphasis added.) They acknowledge, however, that the \u201ccandidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor\u201d in \u00a7 9-709 (a) can be either the endorsed candidate or the nonendorsed candidate. Thus, they contend that \u00a7 9-709 (a) contemplates only three possible combinations of can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>didates: (1) two endorsed candidates; (2) a nonendorsed candidate for the office of lieutenant governor and a nonendorsed candidate for the office of governor; and (3) a nonendorsed candidate for the office of lieutenant governor and the endorsed candidate for the office of governor. They contend that the legislature prohibited the endorsed candidate for the office of lieutenant governor from forming a joint committee with the nonendorsed candidate for governor because it wanted \u201cto discourage a party-endorsed candidate for lieutenant governor from undermining the party\u2019s will in endorsing its candidate for governor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The parties make no claim that \u00a7 9-709 (a) is clear and unambiguous, and we conclude that it is not. Accordingly, in determining its meaning, we may \u201clook for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the sam\u00e9 general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">We see no evidence that the legislative policy that \u00a7 9-709 (a) was designed to implement was to encourage or to discourage nonendorsed candidates for the office of lieutenant governor from choosing a particular running mate. If, as the plaintiffs argue, the legislature\u2019s intent was to discourage the endorsed candidate for the office of lieutenant governor from undermining the party\u2019s will by declining to run with the endorsed candidate for the office of governor, it is difficult to understand why it would authorize the endorsed candidate for the office of governor to undermine the party\u2019s will by declining to run with the endorsed candidate for lieutenant governor. Rather, the clear purpose of the statute, as reflected in its first sentence, is to limit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>expenditures of candidates for the offices of lieutenant governor and governor who are running on the same ticket to the amount that the candidate for the office of governor is authorized to spend under the election program. It is reasonable to conclude that the legislature imposed this limitation in recognition of the fact that candidates for the offices of governor and lieutenant governor appear together on the ballot in the general election and voters cast a single vote for both candidates. Conn. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 3; General Statutes \u00a7 9-181. Accordingly, campaign expenditures by one candidate in the campaign for general election effectively benefit both candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">With this purpose in mind, we conclude that the most reasonable interpretation of the phrase \u201c[a]ny other candidate for nomination or election to the office of Lieutenant Governor\u201d in the third sentence of \u00a7 9-709 (a) is that it means any candidate for the office of lieutenant governor other than an endorsed candidate who is running <em>jointly </em>with the endorsed candidate for the office of governor. In other words, the phrase includes a nonendorsed candidate for the office of lieutenant governor who is running jointly with a candidate for the office of governor, endorsed or not, <em>and </em>an endorsed candidate for the office of lieutenant governor who is running jointly with a nonendorsed candidate for the office of governor. If the legislature had intended the phrase to be limited to nonendorsed candidates for the office of lieutenant governor, it could have specifically used that phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">In addition, an interpretation of \u00a7 9-709 that treats candidates differently based on the candidate with whom they choose to run could render the statute constitutionally questionable under the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. \u201cIt is well established that this court has a duty to construe statutes, whenever possible, to avoid constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>infirmities . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>287 Conn. 237, 245, 947 A.2d 307, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 970, 129 S. Ct. 464, 172 L. Ed. 2d 328 (2008). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that an endorsed candidate for the office of lieutenant governor is authorized to form a joint campaign committee with a nonendorsed candidate for the office of governor under \u00a7 9-709 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">We next address the plaintiffs\u2019 claims related to \u00a7 9-704. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly rejected their contention that: (1) only qualifying contributions that are made to the candidate committee of a candidate for the office of lieutenant governor <em>after </em>the formation of a joint campaign committee may be considered in determining whether the joint committee has met the threshold qualifying amount; and (2) because contributions to the candidate committee of the candidate for the office of governor from a single individual that exceed $100 cannot be considered in determining whether the candidate has met the statutory qualifying threshold, when a single individual has contributed both to that candidate committee and to the candidate committee of a candidate for the office of lieutenant governor who is campaigning jointly with the candidate for governor, and the aggregate amount of the contributions exceeds $100, any amounts exceeding $100 cannot be considered. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Section 9-704 (a) (1) provides that, to be eligible to receive grants under the election program, the candidate committee of a candidate for the office of governor must receive $250,000 in contributions from individuals. Under \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (A), when a contribution from an individual contributor to the committee of a candidate for the officer of governor exceeds $100, the excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>amount cannot be considered in determining whether the candidate has reached the qualifying threshold. Section 9-704 (a) (1) (B) (ii) provides that \u201call contributions received by . . . [a] candidate committee of a candidate for the office of Lieutenant Governor who is deemed to be jointly campaigning with a candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor under subsection (a) of section 9-709, which meet the criteria for qualifying contributions to candidate committees under this section <em>shall be considered </em>in calculating such amounts . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Contributions from individuals to the candidate committee of the candidate for the lieutenant governor that do not exceed $100 are \u201cqualifying contributions\u201d under \u00a7 9-704 (a) (2)-<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that only qualifying contributions that are made to the candidate committee of a candidate for the office of lieutenant governor after the formation of a joint campaign committee may be considered in determining whether the joint committee has met the threshold qualifying amount because, under \u00a7 9-709 (b), the candidate committee of a candidate for the office of lieutenant governor is dissolved upon formation of a joint campaign committee and, therefore, it would be factually impossible for the candidate committee to receive contributions after that point. We will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>not adopt an interpretation of \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (B) (ii) that would render it completely ineffectual. See <em>State </em>v. Gibbs, 254 Conn. 578, 602, 758 A.2d 327 (2000) (\u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . Accordingly, care must be taken to effectuate all provisions of the statute.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 second claim, we must presume that the legislature was aware that individual donors might contribute to both the campaign committee of a candidate for the office of lieutenant governor and to the campaign committee of a candidate for the office of governor. If the legislature had intended to exclude the amount of such dual contributions exceeding $100 in determining whether the candidate for the office of governor has met the qualifying threshold, it could have said so expressly, and not in the cryptic manner claimed by the plaintiffs. Although we recognize that the statute is not a model of clarity, we conclude that the most reasonable interpretation of the language, <em>\u201call contributions received by .. . [the] candidate committee of a candidate for the office of Lieutenant Governor . . . </em>which meet the criteria for qualifying contributions to candidate committees under this section <em>shall be considered </em>in calculating such amounts\u201d;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (emphasis added) General Statutes \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (B) (ii); is that all contributions to the committee of the candidate for the office of lieutenant governor must be considered in determining whether the candidate for the office of governor has met the qualifying threshold of $250,000 if, at the time the contributions were received by the committee of the candidate for the office of lieutenant governor, they met the criteria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>for qualifying contributions to that candidate under \u00a7 9-704 (a) (2).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The plaintiffs contend, however, that this interpretation undermines one of the goals of the election program, namely, to encourage candidates to obtain broad grassroots support. We recognize that the legislative history of the statute indicates that the legislature imposed high qualifying thresholds and low individual contribution limits for this purpose and for the purpose of reducing the drain on the citizens\u2019 election fund.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The legislature also evinced a desire, however, to encourage candidates to participate in the election program thereby limiting their expenditures and reducing their reliance on contributions from special interests.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>absence of any express statutory provision, we cannot conclude that, when these legislative policies are in competition, the former trumps the latter. Accordingly, we are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Finally, we address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly decided that, in determining whether a candidate participating in the election program is entitled to supplemental grants for a primary campaign pursuant to \u00a7 9-713 (a) through (d), the commission may consider contributions received or expenditures made by an opposing nonparticipating candidate before the start of the primary campaign period.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The plaintiffs contend that, under the plain language of the statute, excess expenditures cannot be considered unless they are \u201cfor the applicable primary or general election campaign period . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 9-713 (a).

With respect to campaigns for the offices of governor and lieutenant governor, \u00a7 9-700 (11) defines \u201c \u2018[p]rimary campaign\u2019 \u201d as \u201cthe period beginning on the day following the close of ... a convention held pursuant to section 9-382 . . . and ending on the day of a primary held for the purpose of nominating a candidate for such office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Thus, \u00a7 9-713 (a) provides that a participating candidate is entitled to supplemental grants when the following three conditions are met: (1) \u201ccontributions, loans or other funds have been received, or ... an expenditure is made, or obligated to be made\u201d by a nonparticipating candidate; (2) the \u201cnonparticipating candidate ... is opposed by one or more participating candidates in a primary campaign or a general election campaign\u201d; and (3) the nonparticipating candidate\u2019s contributions and expenditures \u201cin the aggregate exceed one hundred per cent of the <em>applicable expenditure limit for the applicable primary or general elec</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number><em>tion campaign period, </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)

The relevant statutes establish different expenditure limits for the primary campaign period and the general campaign period; see General Statutes \u00a7 9-705 (a) (1) and (2); and we construe \u00a7 9-713 (a) as simply requiring a determination of the applicable expenditure limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Moreover, when the legislature wants to specify the time period in which an action must be performed, it knows how to do so.

Thus, the amounts spent by participating candidates before the convention are considered in determining whether a participating candidate has reached the overall expenditure limit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>the primary campaign set forth in \u00a7 9-702 (c) (B).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In light of the legislative intent to level the playing field, it is reasonable to conclude that, because a participating candidate cannot spend unlimited amounts before the convention, a nonparticipating candidate cannot spend unlimited amounts before the convention without taking the risk that the candidate\u2019s aggregate expenditures will trigger the supplemental grant provisions of \u00a7 9-713. We conclude, therefore, that, in determining whether a candidate who is participating in the election program is entitled to supplemental grants for a primary campaign pursuant to \u00a7 9-713 (a) through (d), the commission may consider contributions received or expenditures made by an opposing nonparticipating candidate before the primary period has started.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The ruling of the trial court is affirmed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In this opinion KATZ, PALMER and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-5\"> Because the trial court granted a motion by R.

It is reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended that the expenditures of nonparticipating candidates would be treated in a parallel manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b810-7\">GRUENDEL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AT-\">concurring. I join the majority opinion affirming the denial of injunctive relief by the trial court and concur with my colleagues in all respects, save for their interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1). Because I believe that statute plainly and unambiguously limits qualifying contributions by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>individual to $100, I write separately to express my disagreement with the interpretation espoused by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The factual recitation provided in the majority opinion accurately and amply details the dispute before us. I note for emphasis only the stipulated fact most salient to this concurrence: absent dual contributions made by the same contributors to the defendant campaigns of gubernatorial candidate Michael C. Fedele and lieutenant gubernatorial candidate Mark D. Boughton,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> their joint campaign committee would not have met the $250,000 threshold for qualifying contributions under the Citizens\u2019 Election Program (election program), General Statutes \u00a7 9-700 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">At issue is the proper construction of \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1). Section 9-704 is entitled \u201c[qualifying contributions.\u201d Subsection (a) (1) pertains to candidacies for nomination or election to the office of governor. It provides: \u201cThe amount of qualifying contributions that the candidate committee of a candidate shall be required to receive in order to be eligible for grants from the Citizens\u2019 Election Fund shall be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">\u201c(1) In the case of a candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor, contributions from individuals in the aggregate amount of two hundred fifty thousand dollars, of which two hundred twenty-five thousand dollars or more is contributed by individuals residing in the state. The provisions of this subdivision shall be subject to the following: (A) The candidate committee shall return the portion of any contribution or contributions from any individual, including said can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>didate, that exceeds one hundred dollars, and such excess portion shall not be considered in calculating such amounts, and (B) all contributions received by (i) an exploratoiy committee established by said candidate, or (ii) an exploratory committee or candidate committee of a candidate for the office of Lieutenant Governor who is deemed to be jointly campaigning with a candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor under subsection (a) of section 9-709, which meet the criteria for qualifying contributions to candidate committees under this section shall be considered in calculating such amounts . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The proper application of \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) presents an issue of statutory inteipretation over which our review is plenary. <em>Regional School District No. 12 </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, </em>292 Conn. 784, 790, 974 A.2d 709 (2009). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine the meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">I thus begin my analysis with an examination of the text of \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1), which I submit is plain and unambiguous with respect to the question before us. The statute commences with the statement that \u201c[t]he amount of qualifying contributions that the candidate committee of a candidate shall be required to receive in order to be eligible for grants from the Citizens\u2019 Election Fund shall be . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 9-704 (a). The statute continues by expressly indicating that subdivision (1) pertains exclusively to \u201cthe case of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1). Next is the provision requiring \u201ccontributions from individuals in the aggregate amount of two hundred fifty thousand dollars, of which two hundred twenty-five thousand dollars or more is contributed by individuals residing in the state.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">With that predicate set forth, \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) proceeds to enumerate two qualifiers, stating that \u201c[t]he provisions of this subdivision <em>shall </em>be subject to the following . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The first qualifier is the $100 proscription \u2014 \u201c[t]he candidate committee shall return the portion of any contribution or contributions from any individual, including said candidate, that exceeds one hundred dollars, and such excess portion shall not be considered in calculating such amounts . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (A). The second qualifier provides that \u201call contributions received by (i) an exploratory committee established by said candidate, or (ii) an exploratory committee or candidate committee of a candidate for the office of Lieutenant Governor who is deemed to be jointly campaigning with a candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor under subsection (a) of section 9-709, which meet the criteria for qualifying contributions to candidate committees under this section shall be considered in calculating such amounts . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Significantly, these are not competing or alternative criteria. The plain language of the statute contains the conjunction \u201cand,\u201d diction most pertinent to the present analysis. Accordingly, the two qualifiers contained in \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) must be read in tandem. In my view, the first plainly informs the second. As a result, whereas the majority concludes its analysis by emphasizing the lack of an \u201cexpress statutory provision\u201d in \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (B); see part II of the majority opinion; the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>sentence preceding that provision supplies that express statutory limitation. It is axiomatic that statutory provisions must in the first instance be considered in the context of their text and relationship to other statutes. <em>Regional School District No. 12 </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, </em>supra, 292 Conn. 790. I fail to see how \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (B) properly can be interpreted independently from \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (A), particularly when the legislature in drafting the statute expressly has required that both qualifiers apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">As I read \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1), which I am mindful pertains only to \u201cthe case of a candidate for nomination or election to the office of Governor,\u201d I understand it plainly to indicate that when a gubernatorial candidate forms a joint campaign committee with a lieutenant gubernatorial candidate pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-709, all contributions received by those candidates may be considered for caiculatory purposes of qualifying contributions, so long as they do not run afoul of the proscription of contributions by a single individual in excess of $100. Had the legislature intended to permit otherwise, the use of the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d makes little sense \u2014 \u201cor\u201d would better express that intent. In construing statutory language, \u201c[n]o part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase . . . and no word in a statute is to be treated as superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>227 Conn. 518, 528, 631 A.2d 1149 (1993); see also <em>Vibert </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>260 Conn. 167, 176, 793 A.2d 1076 (2002) (every word in statute presumed to have meaning). In addition, this court \u201crecently reaffirmed the significance\u201d of the use of the conjunction \u201c \u2018and\u2019 \u201d in the General Statutes. <em>Ahmadi </em>v. <em>Ahmadi, </em>294 Conn. 384, 393, 985 A.2d 319 (2009), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>283 Conn. 748, 796, 931 A.2d 198 (2007). The use of that conjunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>tion indicates that both conditions set forth in such a statute must be fulfilled. See <em>Location Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colaccino, </em>287 Conn. 706, 719 n.11, 949 A.2d 1189 (2008) (recognizing significance of conjunctive \u201cand\u201d); <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Irizarry, </em>220 Conn. 682, 687, 600 A.2d 1024 (1991) (\u201cuse of the conjunctive \u2018and\u2019 indicates that both conditions must be fulfilled\u201d); <em>Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grower, </em>207 Conn. 441, 455, 541 A.2d 1226 (1988) (\u201cwe find significance in the use of the word \u2018and\u2019 between the two stated conditions\u201d). That the General Assembly deliberately inserted the conjunction \u201cand\u201d between the two qualifiers contained in \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) (A) and (B) to me clearly evinces an intent to limit all qualifying contributions by an individual under \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) to $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Moreover, to read \u00a7 9-704 in the manner advanced by the majority is to insert into subsection (a) (1) (B) a provision \u2014 namely, that an individual\u2019s qualifying contributions to a joint campaign committee are not confined to the $100 maximum \u2014 that is not expressly contained in the statute and that effectively nullifies the preceding proscription contained in subsection (a) (1) (A). Such a construction contravenes the maxim that \u201c[w]hen construing a statute, we do not interpret some clauses in a manner that nullifies others, but rather read the statute as a whole and so as to reconcile all parts as far as possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co., </em>221 Conn. 149, 157, 602 A.2d 988 (1992). That construction is particularly troubling when, as outlined previously, it is possible to interpret the statute to apply all of its provisions harmoniously, and in a manner that does not yield an unworkable result. In light of the foregoing, I would conclude that the text of \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) plainly and unambiguously provides that an individual\u2019s contributions to both gubernatorial candidate committees and joint campaign committees formed pursuant to \u00a7 9-709 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>is confined to the $100 maximum for puiposes of calculating qualifying contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Furthermore, notwithstanding the analytical confines of \u00a7 l-2z, in light of the majority\u2019s discussion of legislative history, I am compelled to note that such extratextual evidence substantiates my interpretation of \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1). As the majority acknowledges, the legislative history reflects that the qualifying contribution requirements were intended to foster a return to grassroots campaigning. See 48 S. Proc., Pt. 21, 2005 Spec. Sess., p. 6431, remarks of Senator Donald J. DeFronzo (legislation creates \u201cincentive to grassroots operation and grassroots politics\u201d); id., p. 6730, remarks of Senator Donald E. Williams (legislation requires return \u201cto our roots\u201d and working with constituents \u201cat the local level\u201d). Limiting qualifying contributions by a candidate\u2019s constituents to the amount of $100 was integral to this end. See 48 H. Proc., Pt. 37, 2005 Spec. Sess., pp. 11, 349-50, remarks of Representative James Field Spallone (legislation \u201cgets people out with their constituents into their districts at our level, asking for small donations so they can reach the threshold\u201d); 48 S. Proc., supra, p. 6640, remarks of Senator Thomas P. Gaffey (legislation \u201crequires each and every one of us who\u2019s going to be a participant in this process under this structure to solicit campaign contributions from the very people we represent\u201d); 48 S. Proc., supra, p. 6396, remarks of Senator Mary Ann Handley (\u201cmajor piece\u201d of legislation \u201cis to control the amounts of money which individuals and groups can put into an election campaign\u201d); 48 S. Proc., supra, pp. 6712-13, remarks of Senator Martin M. Looney (qualifying contribution requirements are \u201cparticularly salutary element of the bill\u201d that underscores \u201cimportance for our democracy in the setting of threshold requirements\u201d). In addition, the qualifying contribution system was designed \u201cto avoid the situation of engaging or encouraging frivolous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>candidacies, and creating greater drains on the public fund.\u201d 48 S. Proc., supra, p. 6428, remarks of Senator DeFronzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Beyond those general propositions, the legislative history specifically addresses the question presented in this appeal as to whether the General Assembly, in enacting the election program, intended to limit all qualifying contributions by individual contributors to $100. A review of that extratextual evidence reveals that Senator DeFronzo, chairman of the government administration and elections committee, widely was recognized as the steward of this particular legislation, serving as both draftsman and foremost expert thereon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On that day in November, 2005, when the legislation came up for a vote, Senator DeFronzo explained the election program to his colleagues from the floor of the Senate, stating in relevant part that \u201c[qualifying contributions <em>are the same in all cases.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 6442.1 respectfully submit that this informed explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>tion cannot be reconciled with the analysis of \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) set forth in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Senator DeFronzo\u2019s statement that \u201c[qualifying contributions are the same in all cases\u201d is buttressed by testimony from members of the named defendant, the state elections enforcement commission (commission). On February 25, 2008, Jeffrey B. Garfield, executive director and general counsel of the commission, testified before the government administration and elections committee on House Bill No. 5505, entitled \u201cAn Act concerning the Citizens\u2019 Election Program.\u201d In response to a question from Senator Gayle Slossberg about nonqualifying contributions, Garfield detailed the type of contributions that are nonqualifying. He included in that fist \u201c [contributions from political action committees, political party committees . . . [and] in-kind contributions\u201d and then stated <em>\u201cas well as contributions over $100.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Government Administration and Elections Committee, Pt. 2, 2008 Sess., pp. 589-90. Similarly, the committee heard testimony from Beth Rotman, the commission\u2019s director of public campaign financing for the election program, on \u00a7 9-704. Rotman testified that \u201cto the best of a candidate\u2019s ability . . . you\u2019re actually supposed to return to the contributor anything that the campaign, to the best of its ability, believes is nonqualifying, so if there\u2019s lobbyists, contractors, political committees, <em>contributions in excess of $100, which is the limit for qualifying contribution.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 590. Nowhere in the hundreds of pages of legislative history on the election program is there any discussion or indication that contributions to a joint campaign committee may exceed that limitation. The legislative history overwhelmingly indicates that the proscription of excess contributions by an individual to a \u201ccandidate for nomi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>nation or election to the office of Governor\u201d \u2014 the only candidacy to which \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) applies \u2014 governs both gubernatorial candidate committees and joint campaign committees formed pursuant to \u00a7 9-709.1 submit that the legislative history not only speaks to the issue, but undermines the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute. For that reason, I part ways with my colleagues on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Apart from my disagreement as to the proper construction of \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1), I concur with the majority\u2019s determination that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief. In weighing the pertinent factors; see <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>230 Conn. 441, 446, 645 A.2d 978 (1994); I would conclude that the balancing of the equities in the present case militated against the imposition of a temporary injunction. In particular, I emphasize that the record before us contains the sworn affidavit of Michael A. Totilo, treasurer of Fedele\u2019s gubernatorial campaign. In that affidavit, Totilo avers that the Fedele campaign has expended virtually all of the funds provided to it by the commission under the election program. I further am cognizant that General Statutes \u00a7 9-717 (b) ostensibly shields the Fedele campaign irrespective of whether it properly was entitled to those funds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indulging every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling as our standard of review requires; see, e.g., <em>Board of Selectmen </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>294 Conn. 438, 453, 984 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>748 (2010); I thus would conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in the present case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-8\"> In addition to the Fedele and Boughton campaigns, the defendants include: Fedele 2010 Joint Gubernatorial Campaign Committee, the joint campaign committee formed by Fedele and Boughton; the state elections enforcement commission; Albert P.

Nappier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\"> See, e.g., 48 S.

See part II of the majority opinion. Furthermore, if the majority\u2019s presumption is accepted, then the senator\u2019s statement indicates his understanding that both gubernatorial candidate committees and joint campaign committees under \u00a7 9-704 (a) (1) would be subject to the same $100 individual contribution limitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 9-717 (b) provides: \u201cAny candidate who has received any funds pursuant to the provisions of sections l-100b, 9-700 to 9-716, inclusive, 9-750, 9-751 and 9-760 and section 49 of public act 05-5 of the October 25 special session prior to any such prohibition or limitation taking effect may retain and expend such funds in accordance with said sections unless prohibited from doing so by the court.\u201d That statute has not been the subject of judicial scrutiny and is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
