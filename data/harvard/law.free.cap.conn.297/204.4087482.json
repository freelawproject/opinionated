Marsh III,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> commenced administrative appeals in the trial court challenging the decisions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the defendant, the commissioner of motor vehicles, to suspend their motor vehicle operator\u2019s licenses (license) for ninety days after Stash and Marsh each failed a test utilized to detect the presence of alcohol in a subject\u2019s blood. General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following separate hearings on each matter, the trial court upheld the decisions of the defendant and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>claim that the trial court improperly concluded that there was sufficient proof that they had operated their motor vehicles while having the statutorily proscribed elevated blood alcohol content because a mathematical calculation is necessary to convert the results of a chemical analysis test performed on breath into the blood alcohol content ratio contemplated by \u00a7 14-227b (o),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and because the test results are subject to some margin of error. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On April 12, 2006, Stash was arrested and charged with violating General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On April 28, 2006, the defendant notified Stash that his license would be suspended for ninety days because he had failed a chemical alcohol test. The test had been administered using the Intoxilyzer 5000 EN (Intoxilyzer), a device that measures the presence of alcohol in a subject\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>exhaled breath. Two separate Intoxilyzer readings taken thirty-five minutes apart had indicated that Stash\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.166 percent and 0.145 percent, at both times exceeding the statutoiy limit of 0.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Similarly, on November 6, 2008, Marsh was taken into custody for allegedly violating \u00a7 14-227a and, on November 28, 2008, he was notified that his license would be suspended for ninety days because he had failed a chemical alcohol test. Two separate Intoxilyzer readings taken thirty-three minutes apart had indicated that Marsh\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.177 percent and 0.158 percent, at both times exceeding the statutory limit of 0.08 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The plaintiffs separately requested hearings pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (e). Following those hearings, the defendant upheld the suspension of their licenses, concluding that the Intoxilyzer results indicated that the plaintiffs had operated their motor vehicles while having an elevated blood alcohol content. Thereafter, the plaintiffs individually appealed from the defendant\u2019s decisions to the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In their appeals, the plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that the Intoxilyzer results were inadequate to prove that they had an elevated blood alcohol content because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the device produced results expressed on a weight of alcohol to volume of breath basis rather than a weight of alcohol to weight of blood basis, as required by \u00a7 14-227b (o). According to the plaintiffs, there was no evidence of the weight of alcohol present in 100 grams of their blood, as required to establish an elevated blood alcohol content pursuant to the statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The trial court remanded Stash\u2019s appeal to the defendant\u2019s hearing officer for the purpose of taking additional expert testimony concerning the authorization, use and function of the Intoxilyzer. After conducting an additional hearing, the hearing officer made certain findings of fact, largely crediting the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert witness, Robert Powers, the director of the controlled substances toxicology laboratory at the department of public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Stash thereafter filed an amended appeal in which he reiterated his claim that there was no evidence of the weight of alcohol per 100 grams of his blood as statutorily required, because the readings produced by the Intoxilyzer were expressed as a weight of alcohol to volume of breath ratio. Stash also argued that, as a general matter, Intoxilyzer readings were not always accurate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On December 23, 2008, the trial court dismissed Stash\u2019s appeal after finding that Powers\u2019 testimony constituted substantial evidence in support of the hearing officer\u2019s findings. The trial court subsequently dismissed Marsh\u2019s appeal on the same rationale. See footnote 4 of this opinion. The trial court disagreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the measurement produced by an Intoxilyzer did not comport with the requirement of \u00a7 14-227b (o) (1) that \u201ca ratio of alcohol in the blood . . . that is eight-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight\u201d be proven.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, Stash filed a motion for reargument and reconsideration, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The plaintiffs claim on appeal to this court that the defendant failed to show that they had an elevated blood alcohol content as required by \u00a7 14-227b (o). Specifically, they argue that the defendant improperly used a weight of alcohol to volume of breath ratio to establish that they had an elevated blood alcohol content when \u00a7 14-227b (o) requires proof of a weight of alcohol to weight of blood ratio. According to the plaintiffs, there was no evidence of any mathematical calculation or other conversion to transform the weight to volume Intoxilyzer results in their cases into weight to weight ratios. The plaintiffs also argue that the trial court improperly failed to credit certain evidence in the record as to the inaccuracy of Intoxilyzer results.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">We note the applicable standard of review. \u201c[J]udicial review of [a] commissioner\u2019s action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189], and the scope of that review is very restricted. . . . [R]eview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sengchanthong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>281 Conn. 604, 609, 917 A.2d 942 (2007); see also General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 Q).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Our examination of the record on appeal, and the briefs and arguments of the parties, persuades us that the judgments of the trial court upholding the defendant\u2019s suspension of the plaintiffs\u2019 licenses should be affirmed. Because the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on these issues. <em>Stash </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>51 Conn. Sup. 452, 1 A.3d 275 (2008). It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>268 Conn. 426, 428-29, 844 A.2d 853 (2004); <em>Stebbins </em>v. <em>Doncasters, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 231, 234-35, 819 A.2d 287 (2003); <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wysocki, </em>243 Conn. 239, 241, 702 A.2d 638 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\"> Stash and Marsh appealed from the judgments of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. Prior to that transfer, the Appellate Court had granted Stash\u2019s motion to consolidate his appeal with Marsh\u2019s appeal. The two appeals raise the same issue. For convenience, we refer to Stash and Marsh collectively as the plaintiffs and individually by name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a), \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within [an] agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the Superior Court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b228-9\"> Pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (e) (1), any person whose motor vehicle operator\u2019s license is suspended is entitled to a hearing before the defendant prior to the effective date of the suspension. The hearing is limited to a determination of the following issues: \u201c(1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both; (2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such person refuse to submit to [a chemical] test or analysis [of his blood, breath or urine] <em>or did such person submit to such test or analysis, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test or analysis indicated that such person had an elevated blood alcohol content; </em>and (4) was such person operating the motor vehicle.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">. . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (g). Although \u00a7 14-227b was amended by No. 09-187, \u00a7 63, of the 2009 Public Acts, those amendments have no bearing on the merits of this appeal. For convenience, we refer to the current 2009 revision of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">The present appeals challenge the findings of the hearing officer, who was appointed by the defendant to hear these matters, as to the third issue in \u00a7 14-227b (g), specifically, that the results of chemical tests of the plaintiffs\u2019 breath indicated that they had an elevated blood alcohol content.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b228-12\"> When Marsh commenced his administrative appeal, he filed a motion to join his appeal with the pending consolidated administrative appeals of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Stash and several other individuals who are not involved in the present case (Stash\u2019s case). Following the dismissal of Stash\u2019s case, the trial court granted Marsh\u2019s motion to join Stash\u2019s case, then dismissed Marsh\u2019s appeal for the reasons stated in the memorandum of decision disposing of Stash\u2019s case. See <em>Stash </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>51 Conn. Sup. 452, 1 A.3d 275 (2008). Although Marsh is not a named party in that decision, the trial court\u2019s reasoning in Stash\u2019s case applies to Marsh\u2019s case as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\"> Section 14-227b authorizes the defendant to suspend a person\u2019s license or operating privileges when that person operates his motor vehicle while having an \u201celevated blood alcohol content . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (d); see also General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (e) (1). For purposes of \u00a7 F4227b, \u201c \u2018elevated blood alcohol content\u2019 \u201d is defined, in relevant part, as \u201ca ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person that is eight-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (o) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\"> Section 14-227a (a) criminalizes the act of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or both. A person may be found to have committed the foregoing offense if he operates a motor vehicle while having an elevated blood alcohol content. As in \u00a7 14-227b, an \u201c \u2018elevated blood alcohol content\u2019 \u201d is defined for purposes of \u00a7 14-227a as \u201ca ratio of alcohol in the blood of [a] person that is eight-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a). Section 14-227a was amended by No. 09-187 of the 2009 Public Acts, but those amendments have no bearing on the merits of this appeal. For convenience, we refer to the current 2009 revision of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> Stash and Marsh each sought, and received, a stay of the suspension of his license pending the outcome of the proceedings in the trial court. Stash thereafter sought, and received, an extension of the stay of his license suspension pending the outcome of this appeal. The record does not indicate that Marsh secured a similar extension. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 61-11 (b) and 61-12. Accordingly, it appears likely that Marsh\u2019s license suspension already has expired, thereby rendering this court unable to afford him any practical relief. Marsh\u2019s appeal is not moot, however, due to the collateral consequences that potentially are attendant to license suspensions, namely, the increasing penalties that are imposed upon successive violations of \u00a7 14-227b. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (i); see also <em>Schallenkamp </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>29 Conn. App. 576, 580 n.6, 616 A.2d 1157 (1992), aff'd, 229 Conn. 31, 639 A.2d 1018 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\"> In this regard, Stash argued that the hearing officer improperly failed to credit the testimony of Michael Hlastala, an expert in lung physiology, that he had presented at the hearing on remand. Stash did not attempt to demonstrate, however, that his own Intoxilyzer readings were inaccurate or that they fell within any margin of error testified to by Hlastala. Stash also suggested that use of the Intoxilyzer was unconstitutional because the device was more likely to produce inaccurate readings with female or African-American test subjects. The record indicates, however, that Stash is neither female nor African-American.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\"> The trial court relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Pilotti, </em>99 Conn. App. 563, 568, 914 A.2d 1067, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 903, 919 A.2d 1037 (2007), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Tietjen, </em>105 Conn. App. 59, 64, 935 A.2d 1033 (2007), appeals from criminal convictions pursuant to \u00a7 14-227a, in which the Appellate Court rejected claims similar to those raised by the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
