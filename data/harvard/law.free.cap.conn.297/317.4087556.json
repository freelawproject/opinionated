Woodruff,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the sole defendant, Tasha Hemingway, resulting from an automobile accident in which the defendant, a state employee, caused the vehicle that she was driving to collide with the rear of the plaintiffs vehicle.

App. \u00a7 501 et seq. (act);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> prevented the plaintiff from litigating his claim while the defendant was engaged in active military service. We disagree, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. On December 13, 2006, the plaintiff and the defendant were involved in a motor vehicle accident when the front of the defendant\u2019s vehicle collided with the rear of the plaintiffs vehicle. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought the action underlying this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>appeal, alleging that the accident had been caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. The plaintiff named only the defendant in his complaint; he did not name or serve process on the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The defendant subsequently filed a motion to dismiss with an accompanying affidavit, contending that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because she was immune from suit. The defendant claimed that, at the time of the accident, she was employed by the Connecticut National Guard and was performing one of her job duties, namely, returning a vehicle to the home station, and thus she was acting in her capacity as a state employee. She therefore asserted that she was entitled to the qualified immunity afforded to state employees pursuant to \u00a7 4-165. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The plaintiff responded that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction because: (1) armed forces personnel are liable for damages caused in the line of duty; (2) actions against state employees for automobile accidents are expressly authorized; (3) actions against a state employee are treated as actions against the state itself; and (4) the act barred the plaintiff from litigating his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The trial court granted the motion to strike, concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action because \u201c\u00a7 4-165 affords statutory immunity to the defendant, who, the plaintiff concede [d], was acting within the scope of her employment with the state at the time of the collision.\u201d The trial court rejected the plaintiffs claim that armed forces personnel are liable for damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 27-70 and 4-142 (2); see footnotes 4 and 5 of this opinion; reasoning that \u201cthere is nothing within the language of these statutes negating the statutory immunity afforded to a state employee under ... \u00a7 4-165.\u201d The trial court additionally rejected the plaintiffs claim that actions against a state employee for automobile accidents are authorized by \u00a7 52-556. See footnote 6 of this opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The trial court relied on the express language of the statute, which permits actions <em>against the state </em>for automobile accidents caused by state employees. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-556. Because the trial court found that the state had not been made a party to the action, and there was not any authority permitting a trial court to treat an action against an employee as one against the state, it determined that the plaintiffs reliance on \u00a7 52-556 was misplaced. The trial court finally concluded that the plaintiffs reliance on the act was improper. The court, quoting <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Schille, </em>131 Conn. 449, 452, 40 A.2d 745 (1994), reasoned that the stay of proceedings permitted by the act while a litigant is engaged in active military service must be \u201cconstrued to protect those who have been obliged to drop their own affairs to take up the burdens of the nation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) As a result, the trial court determined that \u201c[i]t is the interests of the defendant, not the plaintiff, that are to be protected under [the act].\u201d This appeal followed. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 4-165 afforded the defendant immunity and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Our examination of the record on appeal and the briefs and arguments of the parties persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. Because the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt its concise and well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on the issues. See <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>51 Conn. Sup. 461, 2 A.3d 1045 (2009). It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. See, <em>e.g., National Waste Associates, LLC v. Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America, </em>294 Conn. 511, 515, 988 A.2d 186 (2010); <em>Royal Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Terra Firma, Inc., </em>287 Conn. 183, 189, 947 A.2d 913 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-10\"> The plaintiffs employer at the time of the accident, Carmen Anthony Restaurant Group, intervened as a plaintiff in the negligence action, seeking to recover the workers\u2019 compensation benefits that it paid to the plaintiff following the automobile accident with the defendant. Because the intervening plaintiff does not raise an argument on appeal, for convenience we refer only to Woodruff as the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-11\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we subsequently transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-165 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No state officer or employee shall be personally liable for damage or injury, not wanton, reckless or malicious, caused in the discharge of his or her duties or within the scope of his or her employment.
