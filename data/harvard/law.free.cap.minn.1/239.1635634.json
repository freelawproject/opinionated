Rice, and took the deed thereof in the name of said Swift; and that he was living in a sumptuous and luxurious manner, without any independent income, and without means or property except that which he is concealing from his creditors.</p><p id=\"b239-7\">Hpon this affidavit, a warrant of Attachment 'was issued against the property of the Defendant,</p><p id=\"b239-8\">Who afterwards appeared by Attorneys, and moved to vacate and set aside the warrant:</p><p id=\"b239-9\">Because, the affidavit on which it was obtained was insufficient ;</p><p id=\"b239-10\">Because, the facts stated as the ground on which the warrant of Attachment was obtained, are not true; and</p><p id=\"b239-11\">Because, the service and return of the warrant were insufficient, irregular and void.</p><p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The motion was accompanied by the affidavit of the Defendant, admitting his indebtedness in the State of New-York, bnt denying that he had been engaged in real-estate, exchange or money transactions in Minnesota, except as the agent of George K.
