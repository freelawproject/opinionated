Ahl, Respondent, <em>vs. </em>Roswell B. Johnson, Appellant.</parties>\n\n\n\n\n<summary id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>This suit was commenced by Bill in Chancery, in the District Court for the County of \"Washington, Second Judicial District, and was brought to compel the specific performance on the part of Appellant of a written Agreement to sell and convey a town-lot in the City of Stillwater, in said County.</summary>\n\n\n<summary id=\"b216-7\">And further states, that the Complainant had tendered and offered unto the Defendant the full balance of said purchase money and interest due and owing by virtue of the Agreement, and that he had always been ready and willing to perform his part of the said agreement, &amp;c. and that the balance was unproductive in his hands: with the usual prayer for a specific performance, Injunction, &amp;c.</summary>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<summary id=\"b217-8\">Elijah A. Bissell testified that he was at the house of Complainant in Stillwater about the 20th of December, 1852, when he. visited said Ahl on his own business, when Defendant,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Johnson, called and said he understood that he, the Complainant, had a sum of money for him for the lot, and that he, Defendant, was ready to give him a deed for the lot upon the receipt of the money, which money Johnson then demanded of the Complainant and called witness to notice the same. The amount of money demanded by Defendant was $106,12. At the same time, Johnson tendered the deed for the lot, (which is exhibited to witness,) upon which witness put his private mark (the letter \u201c B \u201d) at that time. Complainant replied that he had had some money, but that he had paid it out. He had not the money then, and did not offer to give the Defendant any money.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b218-5\">Opon cross examination, witness states that the deed was not read to or by Complainant at the time of the tender. Witness put his private mark on the deed at Dr. Ahl\u2019s house. Witness never read the deed before to-day, and had not seen it since he put his mark on it. It was tendered in the evening about seven o\u2019clock, at the same time the money was demanded. Witness knows the deed only by his private mark ; does not know whether the same was filled up when tendered, as it now appears. About the time Johnson was leaving the house, Complainant stated that he had deposited some money with Bartlett, which witness understood to be to pay Johnson for the lot.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b218-6\">Charles D. Gilfillan testified that he was a Notary Public, and took the acknowledgment of the deed from Johnson and wife to Complainant on the 18th of December, 1852, and tliat said deed was filled up and executed as it purports to have been, at the time he took the acknowledgment. He witnessed the execution thereof. Said deed was tendered to Complainant by M. E. Ames on the 23d of December, 1852, at his law office in Stillwater, and at the same time demanded the money due the Defendant for the premises mentioned in the deed, stating that he was instructed by Defendant to make such tender and demand, and that Complainant replied that he had no money, not even enough to pay his taxes. That he had given some money to Bartlett, and Johnson ought to have taken it from him then. That Bartlett was away, and Johnson must wait until he came back. Harley Curtis was present at the time.</summary>\n\n<summary id=\"b219-4\">Harley Curtis, in his testimony, corroborates the evidence \u25a0of Gilfillan; and says further, that at the time of the tender, Solicitor Ames \u201c demanded from Ahl the sum of money which \u201cthe Complainant\u2019s Bill in this suit alleges had been tendered \u201cto the Defendant.\u201d He, witness, marked the deed with his name, \u201c H. Curtis,\u201d at the time of the tender.</summary>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<summary id=\"b220-9\"><em>Second. </em>That it was the intention of the parties in this case to make <em>the time </em>of payment specified an essential part of the contract to sell, and the <em>time o\u00ed </em>payment was an essential element by the terms of Agreement, and the Agreement is conclusive evidence thereof. 7 <em>Paige's Oh.

Morse testified that while acting as Clerk in the employ of the Defendant between the 20th.of October and the 18th of November, 1851, he heard the Defendantask the Complainant for the balance due on that lot, which lot witness understood to be the same that he (Complainant) had built a house on. That said Ahl complained, in reply, that he had a good many debts out, which, as soon as he could collect in, he would settle up with Defendant. Heard Defendant ask Complainant for the balance due on the lot, at least twice, if not three times. Complainant replied that he had no money, that he didn\u2019t want Defendant to shove him, and would pay the balance due on the lot as soon as he could collect in. Understood Johnson to say to Complainant that he was ready to make him a deed whenever he paid the balance. Had no recollection of hearing the Defendant say that the time of payment had expired, and that he (Complainant) would not get a deed from him for the lot.</p><p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>On cross examination, states that Solicitor Ames did not, as he thinks, demand any particular sum of money; thinks the -deed was not read to Complainant by Ames, or any one else.</p><p id=\"b219-5\">AT. E. Ames testified that the agreement was placed in his hands as an Attorney by the Defendant, in the latter part of October, 1851, with instructions to call upon and collect the money from Mr. Ahl, and in case of payment to deliver him a deed. Witness met Complainant at the \u201c Lake House,\u201d about the last of October or first of November, and told him he would deliver him a deed upon payment of the money. Complainant replied that he could not raise the money at that time, and that Mr. Johnson must hold on in the matter. Defendant directed the witness, as his Solicitor, to deliver the deed to the Complainant upon his paying into his, Solicitor\u2019s, hands the balance that was admitted to be due upon the lot, as stated in the Bill of Complaint, (and further corroborated the testimony of the witnesses Gilfillan and Curtis.)</p><p id=\"b219-6\">Cross examined, says, at the time he saw Complainant at the \u201cLake House\u201d in October or November, 1851, no suit had been commenced; and at the time of the tender of the deed, nothing was said about settling this suit or the costs of it.</p><p id=\"b219-7\">The original deed from Johnson and wife to the .Complainant, was annexed to the Depositions and referred to as exhibit \u201cB.\u201d</p><p id=\"b219-8\">The Complainant offered the Deposition of Frederick K. Bartlett, who testified that on the 1st of November, 1851, he tendered the Defendant $107,10 in lawful currency of the United States, (giving a description of each piece,) and said to Mr. Johnson, \u201cI hereby offer and tender to you $107,10, as \u201cprincipal and interest in full to this 1st day of November, \u201c1851, due upon contract signed by yourself,\u201d &amp;c., (giving description of the contract mentioned in the Bill,) and then and there demanded a deed of said property. \u201c And you are here- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201c by notified that the said sum so. tendered is always in readi- \u201c ness to be paid by F. IL Bartlett, at his house in Stillwater.\u201d The money was placed upon the table, Air. Johnson sitting near the same, and I said, there is the money. He got up and went out of the office, and did not take it, nor did he offer to give me a deed, at any time, for said Ahl.</p><p id=\"b220-5\">The foregoing is the substance of the evidence offered on the part of the Complainant and Defendant on the trial of the issues of fact herein, touching the questions of \u201c tender,\u201d and upon the hearing the Court decreed a specific performance of the contract upon the payment by the Complainant to the Defendant, of the balance admitted to be due in the Bill, for principal and interest, and for costs, &amp;c.</p><p id=\"b220-6\">And the cause comes to this Court upon Appeal from the final decree of the District Court.</p><p id=\"b220-7\">Points relied upon by the Appellant\u2019s Counsel for a reversal of the decree:</p><p id=\"b220-8\"><em>First. </em>That the Agreement made on the 15th day of June 1850, between the parties, and set forth in the Bill and contained in the evidence, was an <em>executory agreement </em>by the Defendant <em>to sell </em>and convey the premises therein mentioned at a future specified time, upon condition of the payment of the consideration-money <em>at the time </em>agreed upon, but no sale was ever made or consummated.</p><p id=\"b220-11\"><em>Fourth. </em>The condition precedent, contained in an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ment to be performed by a party, must be fully performed on his part, and at the time agreed upon, before he is entitled to ask a specific performance of the other party, and without which Courts will not compel a specific performance. 10 <em>Johnson\u2019s Pep. p. </em>203, <em>Cxmningham vs. Morrell; </em>5 <em>Perm\u2019s Pep. p. </em>406, <em>Paige vs. Att; </em>18 <em>Wendell\u2019s Pep. p. </em>187; 13 <em>ib. p. </em>258 ; 8 <em>ib. p. </em>615, <em>Slocum vs. Despard; Chitty on Contracts {1th Am.
