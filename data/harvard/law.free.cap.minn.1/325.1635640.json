It was further provided, that in case of failure in the performance of either of the covenants of the said Stinson, the said Douse-man should have the right to declare the contract void, and to recover all the interest which should have accrued upon the contract up to the time he should so declare it void, as rent, for the use and occupation of the premises; to take immediate possession thereof, and to regard the persons in possession, as tenants holding without permission.</p><p id=\"b325-7\">The complaint then states that the Defendant did not, on the 1st September, 1854, or at any time previous, pay the Plaintiff $2,000 with interest, according to the contract, or any part thereof; that he did not have the buildings on the lot insured for $1500, in a good insurance company, and the policy made payable, in case of loss, to the Plaintiff; that he did not pay ,all the taxes assessed on said premises, from the first of May, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>1853; and that he had entirely failed to perform any of the-covenants and agreements on his part to be performed according to said contract.</p><p id=\"b326-5\">That the Plaintiff, on the 14th of September, 1854, had declared the said contract void, by notice in writing: which notice set forth the reasons why the same was so declared void, to wit: on account of the non-performance of the covenants on his (Defendant\u2019s) part to be performed, as above mentioned; that said notice was duly served upon the Defendant by mail; and that the Defendant was indebted to the Plaintiff for all the interest which had accrued on said contract, from the date thereof until the 14th September, 1854, to wit: in the sum of $481 16,- \u2014 for which sum the Plaintiff demands judgment.</p><p id=\"b326-6\">The Defendant\u2019s answer admits the execution and delivery of the contract, and, in answer to the allegation in the complaint, to the effect that he had not paid the sum of $2,000 and interest on the 1st day of September, 1854, he says:</p><p id=\"b326-7\"><em>First. </em>That on the 7th day of February, 1854, at Prairie du Ohien, in Wisconsin, he (Defendant), at the request of the Plaintiff, for the payment of said sum and interest, executed and delivered to Plaintiff his (Defendant\u2019s) negotiable note, dated on that day, whereby he promised to pay the Plaintiff' or order $2,000, on the 1st day of September 1854, with interest, at the rate of ten per cent, per annum from date, and which note was then and there accepted by Plaintiff, for the payment aforesaid, due September 1st, 1854.</p><p id=\"b327-5\"><em>Third. </em>Tbe Defendant further states that be was always ready to pay said note, from tbe maturity thereof, and still is; and that be tendered tbe full amount thereof to tbe Plaintiff on tbe 12th day of October, 1854, before tbe commencement of this action <em>\u2022 </em>and that be brings tbe money into court, &amp;c. \u2022 and that said note is still outstanding against him.</p><p id=\"b327-6\"><em>Fov/rth. </em>Tbe Defendant further states that be caused tbe buildings on said lot to be insured on tbe 21st day of February, 1854, by a good insurance company, and has kept tbe same insured ever since, for tbe sum of $1500; that on tbe 9th of October, 1854, be obtained tbe consent of said insurance company to transfer bis (Defendant\u2019s) interest in said policy to Plaintiff, and on said day transferred said interest therein to said Plaintiff, and tendered tbe same to him, which be refused, and brings tbe same into court, &amp;c.

L. Becker to pay certain taxes assessed upon said property by the City of St. Paul \u2014 said Becker then being the authorized agent to receive the same \u2014 and tendered to him the amount so assessed: which he (the said Beckex\u2019), being also one of the attorneys for the Plaintiff in this action, then refused to accept, or give Defendant any satisfaction in the prenxises. And brings such assessments into court, &amp;c. and says that he has paid and offered to pay all taxes assessed upon said premises since the 1st day of May, 1853, and that no-loss or damage has been sustained by said premises by reason of any delay in the payment thereof; and that he has done and performed all of the covenants and agreements by him to be kept and performed in said contx\u2019act set fox\u2019th.</p><p id=\"b328-6\"><em>Seventh. </em>As to the allegation of the non-payment of interest, the Defendant answers that he has paid all the interest due the Plaintiff by the terms of said contract, and is ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and willing to pay to tbe Plaintiff according to tbe terms of said contract all tbe interest accruing tbereon; and denies that tbe whole or any part of tbe interest accruing upon said contract remains due or owing from bim to Plaintiff.</p><p id=\"b329-5\">Tbe Plaintiff demurred to tbe several parts of tbe Defendant\u2019s answer as follows:</p><p id=\"b329-6\">To tbe first subdivision thereof, \u2014 Because no fact is stated showing that tbe Plaintiff agreed to receive said note in payment of tbe sum due upon tbe contract, or that be did accept and receive \u00abaid note in payment of said sum, or that tbe Plaintiff ever agreed to relinquish or did relinquish any rights under tbe said contract; and because it appears that said note remained in tbe possession of and belonged to the Plaintiff until tbe same was due \u2014 that it bad not been paid, and that tbe revocation of said contract by Plaintiff would be a bar to any action on tbe note.</p><p id=\"b329-7\">To the second subdivision of said answer, \u2014 Because it does not relate to any allegations in tbe Plaintiff\u2019s complaint in any manner, but refers to matters wholly foreign to tbe subject-matter of tbe action, and amounts to nothing more than an averment that tbe Defendant did not pay tbe sum due tbe' Plaintiff <em>beocmse he had n\u2019t the money.</em></p><p id=\"b329-8\">To tbe third subdivision of said answer,- \u2014 -Because tbe action is upon a special contract to pay tbe Plaintiff $2,000 on tbe 1st day of September, 1854, and not that be would pay or tender $2,140 on tbe 12tb day of October, 1854, after said contract bad been declared void; and because tbe averment that tbe Defendant tendered tbe sum of $2,140, or any other sum, on tbe 12th October, 1854, is not an answer to tbe complaint for tbe breach of contract upon which tbe action is founded.</p><p id=\"b329-9\">To tbe fourth subdivision of said answer, \u2014 Because tbe same is not responsive to any allegation in tbe complaint, and is an allegation to tbe effect that on tbe 14th day of .Se|&gt;tember, 1854, and when tbe contract was declared void, tbe Defendant had utterly violated tbe provision therein in reference to insurance ; and because this action is not for damages occasioned by fire, but for interest, as rent for use and occupation.</p><p id=\"b329-10\">To tbe fifth subdivision of said answer, \u2014 Because it is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>attempt to set up an alleged verbal <em>\u201cunderstanding\u201d </em>\u2014 to add to, vary, and contradict tbe express terms of a written contract ;\u2022 and because the reasons set forth are insufficient to justify or excuse tbe violation of tbe contract, as any amount paid by an insurance company in case of loss would bave been applied by operation of law, upon tbe purchase-money for tbe property specified in tbe contract.</p><p id=\"b330-5\">To tbe sixth subdivision of said answer, \u2014 Because tbe contract was declared void by tbe Plaintiff on tbe 14th day of September, 1854; and no act done or attempted to be done thereafter by tbe Defendant, under or pursuant to the contract,, in tbe exercise of bis rights derived therefrom, is any legal defence to tbe Plaintiff\u2019s claim in this action.</p><p id=\"b330-6\">And to tbe seventh subdivision of said answer, \u2014 Because tbe same is contradictory of itself and of tbe other portions of said answer.</p><p id=\"b330-7\">Tbe demurrer to tbe answer was sustained in tbe District Court with leave to answer over. Afterwards, tbe Plaintiff entered bis judgment for want of an answer, and tbe Defendant obtained bis writ of Error to review tbe proceedings of tbe District Court.</p><p id=\"b330-8\">Tbe following is tbe assignment of errors on behalf of tbe Plaintiff in Error:</p><p id=\"b330-9\">That tbe Defendant may interpose, by way of answer, tbe equities arising in this case, and is not driven to bis action for specific performance. <em>La/ws of Mvn. of </em>1853, <em>p. </em>3, <em>et seq./ </em>4 <em>Howard\u2019s Pr.

Ed.</em></p><p id=\"b330-11\">That tbe acceptance and conversion of tbe first draft drawn by Thomas Stinson \u2014 a third party \u2014 under tbe agreement averred in tbe answer, was a payment of said note, and tbe Plaintiff\u2019s remedy was on tbe draft. <em>CMity on </em>Contracts, <em>pp.-767 </em>\u2014 770, and cases cited</p><p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>That, from the time of making the contract and taking possession under it, the equitable title to the premises was in the Defendant, and could not be divested at the will of the Plaintiff, for the causes stated in the complaint. 2 <em>Lead.
