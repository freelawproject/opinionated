(1982). Appellant, Essie Rollins, alleges that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (the FDLE) denied her promotional opportunities because she is black; she now seeks promotion and back pay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial in the district court, the FDLE presented a non-discriminatory reason for denying Rollins\u2019 requests for promotion: that Rollins had disrupted the work place by repeatedly making spurious claims of racially disparate treatment in an extremely hostile and antagonistic manner. The district court, sitting without a jury, concluded that the FDLE had shown a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying Rollins\u2019 request for promotion, and therefore entered judgment for the FDLE.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">In this appeal, Rollins contends that the FDLE\u2019s reason for denying her promotion is precluded by section 704(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee for complaining of racial discrimination. We disagree. In our view, section 704(a) does not give an employee a license to complain as Rollins did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-18\">The district court found that Rollins began her employment with the FDLE in 1976 as a Classification of Crime Information Input Technician (CIIT)-I. In 1978, she was promoted to CUT \u2014 II; she was still employed in that classification when this case came to trial in 1987. During her employment with the FDLE, Rollins frequently lodged informal complaints of discrimination with her superiors; she also filed formal charges of racial harassment against one of her supervisors with the Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR) and with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>(EEOC).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequent to her promotion in 1978, Rollins applied unsuccessfully for numerous other promotions within the FDLE.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">In evaluating Rollins\u2019 Title VII claim, the district court applied the standards enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). The district court found that Rollins established a prima facie violation of Title VII because she was a protected minority, was qualified for and applied for promotion, was rejected despite her qualifications, and other employees with equal or lesser qualifications who were not members of the protected minority were promoted instead. <em>See Mortensen v. Callaway, </em>672 F.2d 822, 823 (10th Cir.1982) (applying <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to discriminatory denial of promotion). The district court held, however, that the FDLE had successfully rebutted Rollins\u2019 claim by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying her promotion \u2014 that the denial of promotion was based on the manner in which Rollins complained of discrimination, not on the fact that she complained.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The record is replete with a variety of incidents which support the district court\u2019s determination. We briefly mention three of these. First, a number of witnesses testified that Rollins habitually bypassed the chain of command by bringing her complaints of discriminatory employment practices directly to the Commissioner of the FDLE, and on one occasion to the Governor of Florida, rather than to her unit supervisor, assistant supervisor, bureau chief, deputy director, or director. Rollins, moreover, refused to follow the avenues prescribed for lodging such complaints; though she knew that FDLE time sheets were not to be used for recording grievances, she frequently wrote her allegations of discrimination upon them. Second, the sheer number and frequency of Rollins\u2019 complaints of discrimination, most of which were plainly spurious,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was overwhelming. The district court cited the testimony of Alan Spradley, Rollins\u2019 unit supervisor since 1981, who said that he spent more time addressing Rollins\u2019 repeated complaints of racially discriminatory practices than those raised by all of his other employees combined. He testified that Rollins\u2019 constant complaining and unsupported allegations had a damaging effect on morale within his unit. Third, as Spradley detailed in his testimony, Rollins frequently expressed her complaints in an insubordinate and antagonistic manner. According to Spradley, on one such occasion Rollins called him a \u201cfool\u201d and told him \u201cto look up the definition and it\u2019s accurate.\u201d Spradley also stated that Rollins told him that Charles Jacobs, the FDLE Director, was untrustworthy and that he \u201clie[d] with a straight face.\u201d Doris E. Jenkins, an FDLE staff counsel who handled many of Rollins\u2019 complaints, testified that \u201cit was the atten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>tion that Ms. Rollins was enjoying more so than looking for intermediate relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The testimony regarding these incidents led the district court to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">Defendants met their burden of rebuttal through evidence that failure to promote Rollins was due to her quarrelsome and antagonistic behavior and preoccupation that everything was racially motivated. Not only did defendants meet the light burden of rebuttal, but they proved their case far beyond a preponderance of the evidence. The evidence relating to Ms. Rollins compels the conclusion that in her career at FDLE she set herself up as the defender of black interests. In her zeal however, she permitted racial antagonism, not reason, to become her hallmark, with the result that any supervisor faced with the prospect of having to supervise her would have serious reservations and certain difficulty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">On appeal, Rollins argues that the district court erred in considering evidence concerning the insubordinate and disruptive manner in which she lodged her complaints.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rollins bases her contention that complaining about racially motivated misconduct can never be a legitimate basis for the denial of a promotion, no matter the manner in which the employee complains, on the language of section 704(a) of the Civil Rights Act. Section 704(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchap-ter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (1982). According to Rollins, if her complaints of disparate treatment are protected under the statute, then they can not serve in any way as a legitimate reason for refusing to promote her.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">In determining whether Rollins\u2019 conduct is protected under section 704(a), we recognize that the protection afforded by the statute is not limited to individuals who have filed formal complaints, but extends as well to those, like Rollins, who informally voice complaints to their superiors or who use their employers\u2019 internal grievance procedures. <em>See Armstrong v. Index Journal Co., </em>647 F.2d 441, 448 (4th Cir.1981); <em>Sias v. City Demonstration Agency, </em>588 F.2d 692, 694-96 (9th Cir.1978). We also recognize that the statute shields an employee from retaliation regardless of the merit of her complaints so long as she can show a good faith, reasonable belief that the challenged practices violate Title VII. <em>See Payne v. McLemore\u2019s Wholesale &amp; Retail Stores, </em>654 F.2d 1130, 1137 (5th Cir. Unit A Sept. 1981),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1000, 102 S.Ct. 1630, 71 L.Ed.2d 866 (1982). The only question before us, therefore, is whether the district court erred in holding that the hostile and disruptive manner in which Rollins complained of FDLE\u2019s allegedly illegal employment practices transgressed the bounds of the protection afforded by section 704(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">Though the legislative history of section 704(a) is murky,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it is well estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>lished that the protection afforded by the statute is not absolute. This court has repeatedly recognized that some otherwise protected conduct may be so disruptive or inappropriate as to fall outside the statute\u2019s protection. <em>See Payne, </em>654 F.2d at 1142; <em>Whatley v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., </em>632 F.2d 1325, 1329 (5th Cir. Unit B 1980); <em>Rosser v. Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union Local No. 438, </em>616 F.2d 221, 223 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 886, 101 S.Ct. 241, 66 L.Ed.2d 112 (1980). We have held that to qualify for the protection of the statute, the manner in which an employee expresses her opposition to an allegedly discriminatory employment practice must be reasonable. This determination of reasonableness is made on a case by case basis by balancing the purpose of the statute and the need to protect individuals asserting their rights thereunder against an employer\u2019s legitimate demands for loyalty, cooperation and a generally productive work environment. <em>See Payne, </em>654 F.2d at 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">In applying this balancing test, our approach is consistent with those of our sister circuits which have addressed the issue. <em>See Jones v. Flagship Int\u2019l, </em>793 F.2d 714, 728 (5th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1065, 107 S.Ct. 952, 93 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1987); <em>Pendleton v. Rumsfeld, </em>628 F.2d 102, 108 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>Hochstadt v. Worcester Found. for Experimental Biology, </em>545 F.2d 222, 231 (1st Cir.1976). <em>But see Curl v. Reavis, </em>740 F.2d 1323, 1329 n. 5 (4th Cir.1984) (dicta).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If, under this balancing test, the manner in which the employee complains is found to be unreasonable, it falls outside the protection of the statute; the employee\u2019s conduct then may be deemed an independent, legitimate basis for the denial of her promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The case before us thus \u201craises the question, put simply, of whether [the district court erred in finding that] plaintiff went \u2018too far\u2019 in her particular employment setting.\u201d <em>Hochstadt, </em>545 F.2d at 231. We conclude that it did not. The record reveals, and the trial court found, that FDLE denied Rollins\u2019 applications for promotions because she had earned the reputation as a disruptive complainer who antagonized her supervisors and colleagues and impaired the morale of her unit. Such conduct, even when associated with complaints of discrimination, has been held to fall outside the protection of section 704(a) and to provide the employer with a legitimate basis for its action. <em>See, e.g., Whatley, </em>632 F.2d at 1329 (hostile and accusatory complaints of discriminatory practices and failure to follow established reporting procedures constituted legitimate reason for discharge); <em>Hochstadt, </em>545 F.2d at 234 (constant complaints of discriminatory practices at inappropriate times and settings which damaged team morale constituted legitimate reason for discharge). We accordingly hold that the district court did not err in concluding that the manner in which Rollins presented her complaints provided the FDLE with a legitimate basis for denying her promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-12\">. Rollins also seeks such relief against James W. York, former Commissioner of the FDLE.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b476-13\">. Section 704(a) is codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (1982). This action was brought also pursuant to the provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), which provides a remedy for the deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States. Rollins seeks relief under section 1983 for the violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\">. The FCHR found that there was no basis to believe that Rollins had been discriminated against on account of her race. Similarly, the EEOC found no cause for Rollins' complaints of discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\">. Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut the inference of discrimination by presenting a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying the plaintiff her promotion. <em>See Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Defendant\u2019s burden of rebuttal, however, is \u201cexceedingly light\u201d; the burden is \" \u2018merely one of production, not proof.\u201d' <em>Perryman v. Johnson Prods. Co., </em>698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Lee v. Russell County Bd. of Educ., </em>684 F.2d 769, 773 (11th Cir.1982)). If the defendant successfully rebuts the plaintiffs prima facie case, the plaintiff must carry the ultimate burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that a discriminatory intent motivated the denial of plaintiffs promotion. <em>Id. </em>at 1142. The plaintiff may meet this burden indirectly, by showing that the defendant\u2019s proffered explanation is pretextual, or directly, by showing that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the denial of promotion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b477-10\">.The district court mentioned as a typical example of one of Rollins\u2019 frivolous complaints an incident involving a social event planned during the football season. Some of the FDLE employees organized a \u201cbeer bash\" to watch an \"important\u201d Florida State University football game on television. Rollins protested vehemently that equal treatment was not accorded Florida A &amp; M University, a predominantly black university in Tallahassee. Her co-workers \u2014 many of them black \u2014 told her, \"You're just making this a racial thing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">.

City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1982), this court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit, including Unit A, handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\">. As the First Circuit has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A65\">Neither in its wording nor legislative history does section 704(a) make plain how far Congress meant to immunize hostile and disruptive employee activity when it declared it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee \u201cbecause he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter....\u201d The statute says no more, and the committee reports on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1963, which later became Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>repeat the language of 704(a) without any explanation.
