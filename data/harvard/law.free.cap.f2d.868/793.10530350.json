HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Alvin Elzy, an inmate in custody of the Louisiana Department of Corrections, appeals the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 action. Because we find that Elzy\u2019s claim is time-barred by Louisiana\u2019s one-year statute of limitations, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Elzy filed this \u00a7 1983 action against Warden Robertson, erroneously identified in the complaint as Warden Roberson, in June 1987. He complained that he was injured by another inmate at the Orleans Parish Prison on September 14,1984. Elzy alleged that although he received surgical treatment at Charity Hospital for the resulting eye injury, Warden Robertson refused to return him to the hospital for necessary follow-up treatment. Elzy claims that he continued to have problems with his eye for approximately two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">During a <em>Spears </em>hearing, Elzy confirmed that he was transferred from Orleans Parish and Warden Robertson\u2019s custody on February 12, 1985. The magistrate advised Elzy that Louisiana\u2019s one-year statute of limitations barred his suit, and recommended that the suit be dismissed. The district court adopted this recommendation over Elzy\u2019s objections, and entered judgment on August 12, 1988. Elzy moved to \u201cvacate and amend the judgment and order.\u201d The district court denied that motion, repeating its conclusion that Elzy\u2019s suit was time-barred. Elzy now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The district court found Elzy\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action time-barred under Louisiana\u2019s one-year statute of limitations, La.Civ.Code Ann. art. 3492 (West Supp.1988). Article 3492 governs suits for delictual actions, and has been applied by this court as the pertinent statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 actions against Louisiana state officials. <em>See Freeze v. Griffith, </em>849 F.2d 172, 175 (5th Cir.1988). We revisit the applicability of this prescriptive period to \u00a7 1983 actions in Louisiana in light of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Owens v. Okure, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">In <em>Okure, </em>the Supreme Court held that where a state provides multiple statutes of limitations for personal injury actions, courts considering \u00a7 1983 claims should borrow the state\u2019s residual or general personal injury limitations period rather than the prescriptive period for enumerated intentional torts. 109 S.Ct. at 582. The Court explicitly rejected our decision in <em>Gates v. Spinks, </em>771 F.2d 916 (5th Cir.1985), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1065, 106 S.Ct. 1378, 89 L.Ed.2d 603 (1986), which selected Mississippi\u2019s one-year limitations period for intentional torts rather than its six-year limitations period for \u201ccauses of action not otherwise provided for.\u201d 771 F.2d at 919. This latter statute governed, for the most part, negligence and strict liability actions as well as actions based on theories other than tort. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">In contrast to Mississippi, which has two prescriptive statutes for different personal injury claims, Louisiana has only one personal injury prescriptive period. Article 3492 reads, \u201cDelictual actions are subject to a liberative prescription of one year. This prescription commences to run from the day injury or damage is sustained.\u201d The comments to the article state that \u201c[t]he notion of delictual liability includes: intentional conduct, negligence, abuse of right, and liability without negligence.\u201d Comment (b) following art. 3492 (West Supp.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">Louisiana has no other personal injury prescriptive period. Although Louisiana has a residual ten-year prescriptive period for \u201cpersonal actions,\u201d article 3499, it does not apply to tort actions. <em>Manion v. Pollingue, </em>524 So.2d 25, 32 (La.App.), <em>writ denied, </em>530 So.2d 572 (1988); <em>see also McLaughlin v. Herman &amp; Herman, </em>729 F.2d 331, 332 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Reserve Ins. Co. v. Fabre, </em>243 La. 982, 149 So.2d 413, 415, <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 816, 84 S.Ct. 49, 11 L.Ed.2d 51 (1963). \u201cCourts should resort to residual statutes of limitations only where ... [they] embrace[ ], either explicitly or by judicial construction, unspecified personal injury actions.\u201d <em>Okure, </em>109 S.Ct. at 582 n. 12. Since article 3492 is Louisiana\u2019s only statute of limitations for personal injury actions, we find no error in the district court\u2019s application of that article\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>one-year prescriptive period to Elzy\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
