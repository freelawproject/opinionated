Because the AU applied the incorrect legal standard in evaluating the evidence according to the rebuttal provisions of 20 CFR sec. 727.203(b)(3), we vacate the decision and remand for consideration under the correct standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-16\">Petitioner Thomas filed a claim for black lung benefits in 1975. After a complete administrative hearing, the first AU to deal with the matter awarded Thomas benefits in 1981. United States Steel Corp. (USSC), respondent here and the coal mine operator that had employed Thomas for twenty-eight years and that is responsible for payment of benefits, appealed the AU decision to the BRB. The BRB remanded for further consideration of the evidence under regulatory rebuttal provisions. 20 CFR secs. 727.203(b)(2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-17\">A new administrative hearing was conducted because of the death of the initial AU responsible for the case. The second AU in charge of the matter denied benefits. For purposes of section 727.203(b)(3) analysis, the AU applied the \u201csignificant relationship\u201d test and found that the employer, USSC, had shown that there was no significant relationship between the former miner\u2019s disability and his occupational exposure. The BRB affirmed the AU\u2019s denial of benefits. On appeal petitioner challenges the AU\u2019s use of the \u201csignificant relationship\u201d standard as being incorrect in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Black Diamond Coal Mining Co. v. Benefits Review Board, </em>758 F.2d 1532 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-18\">In reviewing BRB decisions, a court of appeals has a limited function: it must determine whether the correct legal standards have been applied and whether the BRB has shown the proper deference to the AU\u2019s factual findings. <em>See Avondale Shipyards, Inc. v. Vinson, </em>623 F.2d 1117, 1119 n. 1 (5th Cir.1980). In the present case, we determine that the AU applied the incorrect legal standard under section 727.203(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-19\">This Court has interpreted the language of 20 CFR sec. 727.203(b)(3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to mean that \u201cthe employer must show that <em>no part </em>of the claimant\u2019s disability arose out of mine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1525\">*1525</page-number>employment_ Even where pneumoconi-osis is only a \u2018contributing cause\u2019 of claimant\u2019s total disability, benefits must be awarded as long as no other ground for rebuttal has been established.\u201d <em>Black Diamond, </em>758 F.2d at 1534. This view is in accord with the opinion of other circuits on the question. <em>See Carozza v. United States Steel Corp., </em>727 F.2d 74, 78 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Bethlehem Mines Corp. v. Massey, </em>736 F.2d 120, 123 (4th Cir.1984); <em>Gibas v. Saginaw Mining Co., </em>748 F.2d 1112, 1120 (6th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1116, 105 S.Ct. 2357, 86 L.Ed.2d 258 (1985); <em>Consolidated Coal Co. v. Smith, </em>837 F.2d 321 (8th Cir.1988); <em>Palmer Coking Coal Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>720 F.2d 1054, 1058 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Rosebud Coal Sales Co. v. Weigand, </em>831 F.2d 926, 928-29 (10th Cir.1987) (\u201cThe \u2018significant part\u2019 test is wholly at odds with the decisions rendered by six courts of appeals ... which apply Section 727.203(b)(3) as written, requiring that any relationship between the disability and coal employment be ruled out.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-5\">There is conflicting evidence in the record as to whether petitioner Thomas suffers from occupational-related pneumo-coniosis. Applying the \u201csignificant relationship\u201d test, the AU at the second administrative hearing held that \u201cthere is not a significant relationship between Claimant\u2019s total disability and his occupational exposure.\u201d Under the appropriate test, the AU must determine whether occupational exposure contributed in <em>any </em>way to Thomas\u2019s disability. For this reason, we reverse the BRB order and remand this case for consideration under the proper standard. <em>See New Orleans (Gulfwide) Stevedores v. Turner, </em>661 F.2d 1031, 1041 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-6\">For the above reasons, we VACATE and REMAND for further consideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1598-14\">.
