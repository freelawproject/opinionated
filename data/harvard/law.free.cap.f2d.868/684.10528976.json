SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"Axco\">Francisco Villanueva worked for SHRM Catering Services, Inc. (\u201cSHRM\u201d), aboard an offshore platform owned by Shell Offshore Inc. (\u201cShell\u201d). He was injured during the course of his employment when a railing he was using to climb stairs gave way. Villanueva filed a third-party complaint against Shell and then, through his attorney, agreed to settle the claim for $18,000. Shell sent Villanueva a letter memorializing the agreement, which Villa-nueva\u2019s attorney signed and sent back. Before the settlement was approved, however, SHRM, through its worker\u2019s compensation insurance carrier, CNA Insurance Company (\u201cCNA\u201d), intervened in an attempt to recover medical and compensation benefits that had been paid to Villanueva pursuant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d). When Villanueva and CNA were unable to settle CNA\u2019s claim for reimbursement, Vil-lanueva refused to execute a release of his claim against Shell or to accept Shell\u2019s check.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Shell tendered the $18,000 into court and moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion at a conference at which Villanueva\u2019s counsel was not present. Villanueva now appeals, arguing that the settlement agreement was not enforceable and that his attorney\u2019s absence at the conference necessitates vacating the summary judgment and allowing him to reinstate his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">Our review of the district court\u2019s action proceeds <em>de novo, </em>adhering to the same standards which the court used. <em>See Schuster v. Martin, </em>861 F.2d 1369, 1371 (5th Cir.1988). Hence, we review the record independently, make any factual inferences in favor of the non-movant, and then ask whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>When state law governs issues in dispute, some deference is due to the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law of the state in which it sits. <em>Smith v. Mobil Corp., </em>719 F.2d 1313, 1317 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">Agreeing that the settlement agreement was enforceable under Louisiana law, we uphold the summary judgment, notwithstanding Villanueva\u2019s counsel\u2019s absence at the summary judgment conference. We also decide issues of law concerning SHRM\u2019s and CNA\u2019s right to assert an equitable lien on the proceeds of the settlement and the validity of Villanueva\u2019s cross-claim against CNA for unreimbursed medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-16\">Villanueva brought his complaint against Shell pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (\u201cOCSLA\u201d), 43 U.S. C. \u00a7 1331 <em>et seq., </em>which governs fixed oil platforms more than three miles off the coast. The OCSLA provides that in any civil or criminal dispute arising on these structures, federal courts are to apply the law of the \u201cadjacent state,\u201d to the extent that those laws are applicable and not inconsistent with the OCSLA or other federal laws and regulations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1333(a)(2)(A); <em>Matte v. Zapata Offshore Co., </em>784 F.2d 628, 630 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number><em>nied, </em>479 U.S. 872, 107 S.Ct. 247, 93 L.Ed.2d 171 (1986).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since Louisiana is the adjacent state here,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we turn to Louisiana law, which defines and describes \u201ctransactions\u201d or \u201ccompromises\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-4\">A <em>transaction </em>or <em>compromise </em>is an agreement between two or more persons, who, for preventing or putting an end to a lawsuit, adjust their differences by mutual consent, in the manner which they agree on, and which every one of them prefers to the hope of gaining, balanced by the danger of losing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">This contract must either be reduced into writing or recited in open court and capable of being transcribed by the record of the proceeding....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">La.Civ.Code Ann. art. 3071 (West Supp.1989) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Louisiana courts favor compromises and treat them as a form of contract. <em>See Durbin v. Cockerham, </em>442 So.2d 634, 636 (La.App. 1st Cir.1983). We have no doubt that Shell\u2019s letter, which by its terms reduced the agreement to writing, became a valid and enforceable contract when Villa-nueva\u2019s counsel verified its terms and assented to them by signing and returning the letter to Shell. In Louisiana, attorneys are presumed to have authority to negotiate settlement agreements for their clients. <em>See F &amp; S Equip. Co. v. International Matex Tank Terminals, </em>469 So.2d 256, 257 (La.App. 4th Cir.1985). Absent evidence that the client\u2019s consent was not clear and express, the agreement is binding. <em>Id. </em>No such evidence is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Villanueva maintains that the letter\u2019s requirement that he execute a \u201cfull receipt, release, and indemnity\u201d represents a condition precedent to the compromise and that because that condition was not satisfied, the compromise is not enforceable. However, we do not read the letter that way. Instead, execution of the receipt, release, and indemnity document was a condition subsequent to the underlying settlement, and a condition which Shell imposed and therefore had the right to waive. Thus, when Shell tendered the $18,000, it fulfilled its obligation per the agreement and was entitled to enforce it. The same would be true if Villanueva\u2019s counsel had drafted the letter and imposed an analogous condition, an admission of liability for example. We therefore cannot accept Villanueva\u2019s contention that the additional terms and conditions stated in the letter indicate that the settlement was only a tentative one.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">Intervenors in this suit, SHMA and CNA, ask this court to recognize their lien upon the proceeds of the settlement. Though the LHWCA does not expressly provide for such a lien, the Supreme Court and this circuit have long recognized that the employer has a subrogation right to be reimbursed, from the worker\u2019s net recovery from a third-party, for the full amount of compensation benefits the employer has paid. <em>See Bloomer v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>445 U.S. 74, 79, 100 S.Ct. 925, 928, 63 L.Ed.2d 215 (1980); <em>Allen v. Texaco, Inc., </em>510 F.2d 977, 979-80 (5th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">Our opinion in <em>Peters v. North River Ins. Co., </em>764 F.2d 306 (5th Cir.1985), gives a thorough overview of the legislative history supporting the employer\u2019s right to a lien, and explains how the funds are to be distributed when such a lien arises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-14\">(1) the worker retains his litigation expenses and a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee; (2) the employer receives from the recovery a credit for any compensation liabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ty not yet satisfied and reimbursement for compensation already paid; and (3) the worker retains what is left, if anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 312 (citing <em>Ochoa v. Employers Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>724 F.2d 1171, 1177 (5th Cir.), <em>vacated, </em>469 U.S. 1082, 105 S.Ct. 583, 83 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), <em>adhered to on remand, </em>754 F.2d 1196 (5th Cir.1985)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the district court\u2019s summary judgment order did not address the employer\u2019s right to a lien, we remand to the court for findings as to the appropriate amount of the lien<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and for a determination of the proper distribution of the settlement funds consistent with this opinion and <em>Peters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Villanueva also filed a cross-claim in this action, seeking from CNA unpaid workers\u2019 compensation benefits and reimbursement for unpaid medical expenses. CNA responds that because Villanueva failed to seek its approval of the settlement with Shell, he is barred under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(g)(1)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> from seeking further benefits and reimbursements. This, too, is an issue we addressed in <em>Peters, </em>noting that if an employee settles with a third party for more than the compensation benefits to which he is entitled, section 933(f)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> extinguishes the employer\u2019s liability for any un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>paid benefits. 764 F.2d at 311.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, if the worker settles for less, section 933(g) precludes further liability on the part of the employer unless the employee has obtained the employer\u2019s and the carrier\u2019s pri- or approval. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Though the lack of findings makes it impossible to tell whether the settlement agreement was for more or less than the amount of compensation to which Villa-nueva was entitled, there can be but one result in the instant case: SHRM and CNA bear no further liability for compensation benefits. If the settlement was greater than the amount of compensation benefits due, section 933(f) extinguishes SHRM and CNA\u2019s liability, and if it was less, section 933(g) precludes his seeking additional benefits. Hence, on remand we instruct the district court to deny Villanueva\u2019s cross-claim for additional benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Finally, Villanueva contends that the summary judgment must be set aside because his counsel was not present at the summary judgment conference and did not receive notice of that conference until after it had been held. We note, however, that Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 confers upon the parties no right to an oral hearing on summary judgment motions. <em>See Jones v. Newton, </em>775 F.2d 1316, 1318 (5th Cir.1985). The question then becomes whether the proceedings were so unfair as to deny Villanueva his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Although we view with some suspicion the district court\u2019s termination of this litigation in the presence of defendant\u2019s counsel, but not Villanueva\u2019s counsel, our review of the record reveals no unfair prejudice to Villanueva, for the simple reason that his counsel failed to lay the groundwork for a defense against the motion, the only notice his counsel claims he did not receive is the notice pertaining to the conference. There were at least two other notices sent to Villanueva\u2019s counsel concerning the summary judgment motion: The motion itself, and the district court\u2019s interim order stating that the motion would be decided on the briefs. Yet, he filed no response to the motion and failed to move the district court for reconsideration after its decision in his absence. Hence, given Villanueva\u2019s counsel\u2019s neglect of the summary judgment motion prior to and after the conference, we have no reason to infer that his absence at the conference unfairly prejudiced his client.</p>\n<p id=\"AQc\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"AMt\">We hold that the settlement agreement, reduced as it was to writing and signed by Villanueva\u2019s counsel, was enforceable under Louisiana law; therefore the summary judgment was properly granted. However, because we also find that, as a matter of law, the employer and the insurance carrier were entitled to a lien on the proceeds of the settlement and are liable for no future compensation benefits, we VACATE the judgment and REMAND to the district court so that it can determine, in a manner consistent with this opinion, the proper amount of that lien and the appropriate distribution of the settlement proceeds.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-11\">. However, the OCSLA expressly provides for the application of the LHWCA to employee injuries occurring as a result of operations on fixed platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf. <em>See 43 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(b); <em>Doucet v. Gulf Oil Co., </em>783 F.2d 518, 525 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 883, 107 S.Ct. 272, 93 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-9\">. <em>See also Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, </em>477 U.S. 207, 106 S.Ct. 2485, 91 L.Ed.2d 174 (1986). There, the Supreme Court noted that the \"intent behind the OCSLA was to treat the artificial structures covered by the Act as upland islands or as federal enclaves within a landlocked State, and not as vessels, for purposes of defining the applicable law because maritime law was deemed inapposite to these fixed structures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 106 S.Ct. at 2492.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b760-16\">. Shell and CNA both offer an alternative argument in their briefs to the effect that state law should not apply here because the issue of enforceability of settlements is not substantive but procedural. We do not shoot at decoy ducks: The issue here is not what procedures are to be used to enforce an enforceable agreement, but whether the agreement here, memorialized in letter form, constitutes an exchange of promises which the court can be prevailed upon to enforce. We cannot imagine a question of law that is more \"substantive.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b761-5\">. <em>Peters </em>states that this is the distribution scheme to be followed \"at least where the settlement agreement does not specifically mention the compensation lien.\u201d 764 F.2d at 312. Here, the letter signed by Villanueva's counsel does state that \u201cout of the payment of $18,000, Mr. Villanueva will reimburse his employer\u2019s compensation carrier whatever may be necessary to satisfy their lien, if any.\u201d That declaration, however, merely recites the employer\u2019s right to reimbursement and does not expressly structure the distribution of proceeds in a way different from what we described in <em>Peters. </em>The only lingering question is whether such a statement might be read to require Villanueva to satisfy the compensation lien before deducting his own litigation expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that it could be so read, we noted in <em>Peters </em>that \u201d[t]he compensation lien, however, attaches to the worker\u2019s net recovery. If the worker\u2019s recovery is insufficient to cover both the worker\u2019s litigation expenses and the compensation lien, therefore, the litigation expenses must be paid first.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ochoa, </em>724 F.2d at 1177). Hence, we see no reason in the instant case to deviate from the distribution scheme set forth in <em>Peters.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b761-6\">. CNA\u2019s brief on behalf of itself and the employer baldly asserts in its conclusion that the lien amount should include CNA\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees for pursuing judicial enforcement of its lien; presumably, that would include fees for proceedings in the district court as well as this appeal. While there is statutory authority permitting employers to offset attorneys\u2019 fees against an award when the <em>employer </em>prosecutes the action against the third-party tortfeasor, <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(e)(1)(A), we find no statutory or judicial authority, and CNA does not alert us to any, supporting the proposition that the employer should be entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees when it seeks to enforce its lien on the judgment obtained by the <em>worker. </em>As the Court stated in <em>Bloomer, </em>445 U.S. at 85, 100 S.Ct. at 931, when Congress has established a statutory scheme thoroughly governing such actions, we should be reluctant to deviate from the general rule that each party pays its own fees, and award attorneys\u2019 fees absent express statutory authorization. In any case, CNA has not adequately briefed the issue and hence must be considered to have abandoned the claim. <em>See Estiverne v. Louisiana State Bar Ass'n, </em>863 F.2d 371, 374 n. 1 (5th Cir.1989) (citing <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>779 F.2d 287, 295 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1109, 106 S.Ct. 1518, 89 L.Ed.2d 916 (1986)). On remand, the district court therefore should ignore any request from CNA that its lien include attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b761-10\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(g)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">If the person entitled to compensation (or the person\u2019s representative) enters into a settlement with a third person ... for an amount less than the compensation to which the person (or the person\u2019s representative) would be entitled under this chapter, the employer shall be liable for compensation ... only if written approval of the settlement is obtained from the employer and the employer\u2019s carrier, before the settlement is executed, and by the person entitled to compensation (or the person\u2019s representative)....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b761-12\">, Section 933(f) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-13\">If the person entitled to compensation institutes proceedings [against a third party] ... the employer shall be required to pay as compensation under this chapter a sum equal to the excess of the amount which the secretary determines is payable on account of such injury or death over the net amount recovered against such third person. Such net amount shall be equal to the actual amount recovered less the expenses reasonably incurred by such person in respect to such proceedings (including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">Thus, for example, if the employee\u2019s net from the settlement were $10,000 and the employer\u2019s compensation liability determined to be $8,000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>there would be no excess, and thus, no further liability for the employer under this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b762-13\">. <em>See also Petroleum, Helicopters, Inc. v. Collier, </em>784 F.2d 644, 645-46 (5th Cir.1986). There, we held that because an employer has an interest in protecting statutory right to set-off even when the employer has waived any subrogation rights against the third-party tortfeasor, a worker's failure to seek employer\u2019s and carrier\u2019s approval of settlement precludes liability for future compensation benefits despite the existence of such a waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
