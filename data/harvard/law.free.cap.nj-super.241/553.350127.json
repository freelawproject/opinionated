Just before the trial began, the trial judge dismissed count four of the indictment, adding that if defendant was convicted on count three and not sentenced to a custodial term, the State could show that defendant possessed phencyclidine within 1000 feet of school property for sentencing purposes. The parties agreed that Municipal Court Complaint W-603278 for possession of marijuana contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10 would also be submitted to the jury for resolution. Defendant was found guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>In preparation for sentencing, the State agreed that defendant would serve a two year period of parole ineligibility rather than the ordinary three year term on count six pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-12; that count three (possession of phencyclidine) would merge with count five (possession of phencyclidine with intent to distribute), and that the municipal complaint would merge with count one. The trial judge also merged count two with count one and count six with count five. In so doing, he ruled that the anti-merger language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 was meant only to ensure that the parole disqualifier provided in that statute be preserved in the event of merger. He sentenced defendant on count one to a custodial term of 18 months with a one year period of parole ineligibility pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7. That sentence was to run concurrently with the sentence on count five but consecutive to the three year sentence previously imposed for defendant\u2019s violation of his probation. On count five, the judge imposed the presumptive custodial term of seven years with a two year period of parole ineligibility, to run concurrently with count one but consecutive to defendant\u2019s sentence for violating probation. The judge also imposed the following aggregate penalties: $60 Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty; $2,750 D.E.D.R. penalty; $100 lab fees; and forfeiture of defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license for a period of 12 months after defendant\u2019s release from incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Defendant appeals claiming that the following errors warrant reversal:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">POINT I:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">THE COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">POINT II:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">THE COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">POINT III:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">THE COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO MERGE POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA WITH INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE WITH POSSESSION OF PCP WITH INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The State filed a cross appeal which was consolidated with defendant\u2019s appeal, claiming that the trial judge erred in merging defendant\u2019s convictions contrary to the provisions of <em>N.J. S.A. </em>2C:35-7. We have carefully reviewed this record in light of the claims advanced by defendant which we have concluded are entirely lacking in merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). We consider the State\u2019s appeal to be likewise without merit. In our view, the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 is correct. We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Perskie in his opinion of June 10, 1988. In reaching this conclusion, we choose to follow Judge Skillman\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 574 A.2d 487 (App.Div.1990) (decided May 8, 1990; Skillman, J.A.D., concurring in part and dissenting in part). <em>But see State v. Anaya, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 568 A.2d 1208 (App.Div.1990); <em>State v. Blow, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>184, 567 A.2d 253 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b586-6\">LANDAU, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWDF\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">I concur with the affirmance of Dillihay\u2019s convictions, and the rejection of his contentions on appeal. As to the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 merger issue presented by the State\u2019s cross-appeal, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The majority has chosen to rely upon Judge Skillman\u2019s dissent in <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 574 A.2d 487 (App.Div.1990). I am convinced, however, that the Legislature has made clear in unambiguous terms its intention to create a separate non-mergable crime by enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7, not merely to impose and preserve the parole ineligibility requirement. It could have readily accomplished the latter objective by a direct amendment with a penalty enhancement or parole ineligibility clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Respectfully, I prefer to adopt the majority reasoning in <em>Gonzalez </em>as expressed by Judge Brody, and in cases such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>State v. Anaya, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 39, 568 A.2d 1208 (App.Div. 1990); <em>State v. Blow, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>184, 189-92, 567 A.2d 253 (App.Div.1989); <em>State v. Ogar, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>459, 471, 551 A.2d 1037 (App.Div.1989); as well as my dissenting comments in <em>State v. Soto, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 575 A.2d 501 (App.Div. 1990) decided by us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Accordingly, I would reverse on the merger issue and remand for resentencing. In resentencing, the trial judge should, of course, take into consideration the principles enunciated in <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 643, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985), <em>cert. </em>den., 475 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>308 (1986), and echoed in <em>State v. Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>112, 121-22, 527 A.2d 1362 (1987).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
