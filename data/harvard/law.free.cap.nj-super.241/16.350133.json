Tax </em>473 (1989). We are in accord with the majority\u2019s conclusion that under the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-1 to -40) funds borrowed by a taxpayer corporation from its corporate great-grandparent which holds no shares of the taxpayer\u2019s stock are to be included in the net worth of the taxpayer only if the funds are indirectly owed to the parent of the taxpayer corporation. 10 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 483. Specifically, we agree that the word \u201cholders,\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4(d)(5), is restricted to the actual record holders of stock, even when such record holders are wholly owned subsidiaries of the controlling grandparent or great-grandparent corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">We do not read Judge Andrew\u2019s opinion as requiring the Division of Taxation to acquiesce in and blindly accept the label that a taxpayer places on a transaction. As noted by Judge Andrew, however, \u201c[tjhere is nothing in the record to indicate that the loans at issue were mere sham transactions designed solely to evade corporation business taxes.\u201d 10 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 491, n. 4. We find no basis in the record to disturb that conclusion. <em>See Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed on the principal appeal and cross appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
