The trial judge merged Count Two into Count Three and sentenced defendant on the first count to a term of 15 years with five years parole ineligibility and to a concurrent seven-year term with three years parole ineligibility on Count Three. A $60 Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty was also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The following facts were developed at trial. On May 1,1986, at approximately 2:45 p.m., Camille Williams and her sister Denise Shannon were walking down Seventeenth Street by West Side Park in Newark. Williams and Shannon were returning to Williams\u2019 home from a check-cashing establishment located on Springfield Avenue. Having cashed a Social Security check and obtaining her mother\u2019s food stamps, Williams was carrying approximately $271 in cash and $250 worth of food stamps. Additionally, Ms. Williams was also carrying over $100 in cash from her work as a hair stylist.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">As the sisters were walking along Seventeenth Street, a man, later identified as defendant, wearing a black jogging suit with \u201cturbo boost\u201d on one shoulder of the top, approached them and asked Williams if she had a cigarette. After Williams replied \u201cno,\u201d defendant continued walking. Defendant then pushed Shannon away and shoved Williams up against a chain link fence. He took from his waist a silver handgun with black taping around the handle, aimed it at Williams\u2019 neck and told her to \u201cgive it up.\u201d Ms. Williams put her hands in the air. Defendant searched her clothing, and removed her identification, all of the cash, and her mother\u2019s food stamps. He told Williams to run but when she refused, defendant ran away. Williams then telephoned police.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The next day, Williams and her sister went to the police station to look at an array of photographs of possible perpetrators. After looking through approximately ten books of mug shots, Williams identified defendant as the robber. After Williams had picked out defendant\u2019s photo, she showed that page of photos to her sister who also picked out defendant\u2019s photo.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Defendant then testified on his own behalf. He denied any knowledge of the robbery in question. He claimed that he did not rob Williams and that he never saw her before. During defendant\u2019s cross-examination, the trial judge allowed, over objection, questioning regarding defendant\u2019s 1986 arrest for possession of a handgun and permitted a rebuttal witness to testify concerning the prior arrest for purposes of affecting Hutchins\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">While cross-examining defendant, after inquiring about both the defendant\u2019s prior CDS conviction and the date of the arrest in the instant case, the assistant prosecutor asked defendant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">Q. Tell me, do you know anything about guns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">A. No, never had one, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">Q. You never had a gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">The assistant prosecutor then asked:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">Q. February 1986, you weren\u2019t arrested with a .38 caliber gun?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">Defense counsel immediately objected to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">At a sidebar conference with the trial judge, the State represented that it was prepared to call one of the detectives involved in arresting defendant in February 1986 to show under <em>Evid.R. </em>55 defendant\u2019s knowledge of handguns to counter defendant's denial of knowledge or prior possession. The trial judge rejected the offer under that rule and commented, \u201cI don\u2019t think it has relevance to his knowledge and intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">The trial judge denied defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial and held that both the prosecutor\u2019s questions were proper and that the arresting officer could testify as a rebuttal witness for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201ccredibility purposes only.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later, the trial judge clarified his ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">So ray ruling is clear, the State has a rebuttal witness to affect the credibility of the witness only, [sic] only the credibility of the witness will be allowed to offer [sic] testimony that you were in possession of a gun on February 8, 1988, to the limited testimony of Detective Gold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The next day, at the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s case, the State called Detective James Gold as a rebuttal witness over defendant\u2019s continuing objection. Gold testified to the details of the February 1986 arrest, specifically that, while attempting to locate and arrest defendant\u2019s brother, Gold and other officers encountered defendant whom they mistook for his brother. Gold stated that defendant began to pull a .38 caliber handgun out of his coat pocket when confronted, whereupon defendant was knocked down, beaten and subdued.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Between direct and cross-examination of Gold, the trial judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">[T]his evidence is rebuttal evidence and it\u2019s being offered in rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s testimony about not having a gun on a date some three months prior to this incident. This evidence is not to be used by you in any way whatsoever as substantive proof of the commission of the offense in this crime. <em>It\u2019s merely offered for a very limited purpose as to whether or not it effects (sic) the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony. </em>[Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Also, in his final charge to the jury he stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">[T]he State has offered rebuttal testimony as to a prior arrest dealing with a gun. <em>This also may only be used to effect (sic) a defendant\u2019s credibility. </em>The defendant stated during his testimony that he was not aware of a gun and in fact he did not have a gun on a prior occasion. So the State in its rebuttal testimony offered this prior arrest some three months prior. But I specifically instruct you that this is not proof, substantive proof of the crime charged here. <em>It\u2019s only allowed to be considered by you as to whether or not it effects (sic) the defendant\u2019s credibility as to his testimony. </em>[Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">On appeal defendant raises the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\">I The State made an irrelevant unduly prejudicial inquiry into defendant\u2019s familiarity with guns (not raised below), and the court erred in allowing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>State to ask defendant about his arrest for possession of a handgun and, to introduce extrinsic evidence regarding that arrest to affect defendant\u2019s credibility in direct violation of <em>Evidence Rules </em>22(d) and 47.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Essentially, defendant asserts that there were three separate errors committed by the trial judge with regard to this line of evidence and questioning. First he contends the question \u201cTell me, do you know anything about guns?\u201d was irrelevant under <em>Evidence Rule </em>7(f) and alternatively, so unduly prejudicial under <em>Evidence Rule </em>4 that it outweighed any probative value which it might otherwise have had. Secondly, he submits the court improperly allowed the State to question defendant regarding his prior arrest in order to affect his credibility when only convictions, not arrests, may be used to impeach a witness. <em>State v. McBride, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 267, 517 A.2d 152 (App.Div.1986); <em>State v. Landeros, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>69, 72, 118 A.2d 521 (1956); <em>State v. Amwine, </em>67 <em>N.J.Super. </em>483, 486, 171 A.2d 124 (App.Div.1961). Finally, he maintains the judge erroneously allowed a rebuttal witness to testify to the details of the defendant\u2019s prior arrest in order to affect defendant\u2019s credibility, in direct violation of <em>Evidence Rule </em>22(d) and 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u201cRelevant evidence\u201d is evidence having any tendency in reason to prove a material fact. <em>Evid.R. </em>1(2). All relevant evidence is admissible. <em>Evid.R. </em>7(f). Conversely, irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. Relevancy is tested by the probative value the evidence has with respect to the points at issue. <em>Manieri v. Volkswagenwerk A.G., </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 429, 376 A.2d 1317 (App.Div.1977), certif. den. 75 <em>N.J. </em>594, 384 A.2d 824 (1978). The true test is the logical connection between the proffered evidence and a fact in issue, <em>i.e., </em>whether the thing sought to be established is more logical with the evidence than without it. <em>Id. </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 429-430, 376 A.2d 1317; <em>accord, State v. Coruzzi, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>273, 302, 460 A.2d 120 (App.Div.), certif. den., 94 <em>N.J. </em>531, 468 A.2d 185 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The rule speaks in term of a \u201cmaterial\u201d fact which is logically probative evidence. This reflects the concept that relevancy is really composed of two parts: probative value and materiality. <em>Biunno, Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 2, <em>Evid.R. </em>1(2) at 4-5 (Anno.1990). Probative value concerns the tendency of evidence to establish the proposition that it is offered to prove. <em>State v. Allison, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>9, 17, 504 <em>A.</em>2d 1184 (App.Div.1985); <em>McCormick, Evidence </em>(3 ed. 1984), \u00a7 185 at 541. Materiality concerns the relation between the propositions for which the evidence is offered and the issues in the case. <em>State v. Allison, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>9, 17, 504 A.2d 1184 (App.Div.), certif. den., 102 <em>N.J. </em>370, 508 A.2d 235 (1985); <em>McCormick, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 185 at 541 (3d ed. 1984). A material fact is one which is really in issue in the case. <em>Biunno, supra, </em>Comment 2, <em>Evid.R. </em>1(2) at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It is difficult to understand precisely what the State had in mind in asking defendant whether he \u201cknew anything about guns?\u201d Everyone knows something about guns; they know they are dangerous, that they can kill, that there are several kinds of guns, <em>i.e., </em>handguns, shotguns, rifles or BB guns and sundry other guns. The question asked by the assistant prosecutor had absolutely no relevancy to the facts or the issue, <em>i.e., </em>whether defendant robbed the victim at gun point on May 1, 1986, which defendant denied. It is a question which should have never been asked and never answered because it had no logical relationship to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The last question concerning defendant\u2019s arrest was even more egregious. It is obvious that the assistant prosecutor knew that the answer to the first question was false and the second question concerning defendant\u2019s arrest was beyond the limits of propriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">While the State may prove a prior conviction to affect the credibility of a witness, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-12, <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127, 386 A.2d 378 (1978), it can only do so if there was, in fact, such a conviction. Inquiry concerning an arrest, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>reference to simply an arrest, is prohibited. <em>State v. Cooper, </em>10 <em>N.J. </em>532, 555-556, 92 A.2d 786 (1952). <em>State v. Searles, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 215, 197 A.2d 384 (App.Div.1964). The <em>Searles </em>court makes it clear that where defendant\u2019s case rests upon his credibility, admission of testimony or the posing of questions concerning defendant\u2019s prior arrest, constitutes plain error and requires reversal of the conviction, and a new trial. <em>Id.; see also State v. Dunphy, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>531, 537, 117 <em>A.</em>2d 617 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Generally, a witness may not be impeached by producing extrinsic evidence to contradict another witness\u2019 assertion about collateral facts. <em>McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 47 at 110. If the collateral fact sought to be contradicted is elicited on cross-examination, this safeguarding rule is often expressed by saying that the answer is conclusive or that the cross-examiner must \u201ctake the answer.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">To determine the collateral fact, the classical approach is that the facts which would have been independently provable regardless of the contradiction are not \u201ccollateral.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the question concerning previous knowledge and possession of guns could not in any way have been introduced independently because it was irrelevant and thus collateral. As stated in 3A <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(Chadbourn Rev.1970) \u00a7 1003 at 961: \u201cCould the fact, as to which error is predicated, have been shown in evidence for any purpose independently of the contradiction?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Two general kinds of facts meet this collateral test and are not collateral. The first are facts that are relevant to the substantive issues in the case. <em>McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 47 at 110-11; 3A <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 1004 at 965 (\u201cthe issues in the case indicate what facts would be relevant.\u201d). Succinctly stated, here the prosecutor may not ask any irrelevant question and then bootstrap herself to impeach credibility because the answer to the question is false.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The second kind of facts which would not be collateral includes \u201cfacts which would be independently provable by extrinsic evidence, apart from the contradiction, to impeach or disqualify the witness.\u201d <em>McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 47 at 111. This includes the admissibility of evidence for the purpose of impeaching some specific testimonial quality such as moral conduct, bias, corruption, skill, intoxication or illness, opportunity of observing the events, recollection, narration, and prior inconsistent statements. 3A <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 1005 at 966-976. <em>See also Biunno, supra, </em>comments 5 to 12 <em>Evid.R. </em>20, at 266-283.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u201cFacts showing misconduct of the witness [for which no conviction has been had] are not within this second kind of facts, but are collateral, and if denied on cross-examination cannot be proved to contradict.\u201d <em>McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 47 at 111. Irrelevant evidence which might improperly affect a witness\u2019 credibility may not be admitted into evidence. See <em>Graf v. Folarno, </em>99 <em>N.J.Super. </em>173, 177, 239 A.2d 15 (App.Div.), certif. den., 51 <em>N.J. </em>463, 242 A.2d 12 (1968) (cross-examination of an expert medical witness concerning his writings for \u201cmen\u2019s magazines\u201d in the field of his expertise were improperly admitted). Also, specific instances of a witness\u2019 conduct, relevant only insofar as they may tend to prove a trait of his character, may not be used to affect credibility. <em>Evid.R. </em>22(d); <em>State v. Mondrosch, </em>108 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 4, 259 A.2d 725 (App.Div.1969), certif. den., 55 <em>N.J. </em>600, 264 A.2d 71 (1970) (proffered evidence as to past actions of a prosecution witness indicating he had previously falsely accused certain persons of committing criminal acts was inadmissible as affecting credibility where the alleged acts of the witness were not subject to conviction of a crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Although <em>Evid.R. </em>20 permits examination of a witness and the introduction of extrinsic evidence <em>relevant </em>upon the issue of credibility, the rule is subject to Rules 22 and 47. To affect credibility of a witness, <em>Evid.R. </em>22 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(c) evidence of traits of his character other than honesty or veracity or their opposites, shall be inadmissible; d) evidence of specific instances of his conduct, relevant only as tending to prove a trait of his character, shall be inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>Evid.R. </em>47 permits proof of a character trait\u2014here defendant falsely stating that he knew nothing about guns and never had a gun\u2014only by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">(a) testimony in the form of opinion, (b) evidence of reputation, or (c) evidence of conviction of a crime which tends to prove the trait. <em>Specific instances of conduct not the subject of a conviction of a crime shall be inadmissible. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\"><em>See State v. Hummel, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 334 A.2d 52 (App. Div.), certif. den., 67 <em>N.J. </em>102, 335 <em>A.</em>2d 54 (1975) (court properly refused to permit defendant charged with carnal abuse to show that the complainants had previously fabricated complaints of serious matters or had previously engaged in misconduct or disorderly conduct); <em>State v. Ryan, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 384 <em>A.</em>2d 570 (App.Div.1978) (a rape victim could not be cross-examined concerning a specific instance of sexual intercourse in which she had engaged with an unknown man other than defendant the night before the rape); <em>State v. Schlanger, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 551-552, 485 A.2d 354 (Law Div.1954) (criminal defendant prohibited from cross-examining an accomplice witness of the State as to whether he rep&amp;rted the fruits of their common crime on his income tax returns).
