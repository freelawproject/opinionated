We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">At the time of his death, Peter Manzo was president of the Union, having held that position for approximately five years. He was also vice-president of the International Union, a separate entity. On December 26, 1985, Mr. Manzo sustained injuries in an automobile accident. At the time of the accident, Mr. Manzo was driving an automobile, leased by the Union, from his home in Lodi to the union office in New York City. The judge of compensation found that the accident occurred at 6:20 a.m., on 1-95 in Teaneck. Although the immediate cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>of death was occlusive coronary artery disease, as determined by an autopsy performed by the medical examiner and stated in the death certificate, the medical examiner also found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">With regard to the actual etiology of Mr. Manzo\u2019s demise however I believe it is fair to say in terms of medical probability that there is a causal relationship between Mr. Manzo\u2019s death and either the multiple traumas which resulted from the accident or the combined effect of those traumas and the trauma of surgery upon him, taking into account his underlying cardiac condition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [Footnote supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">At issue is whether petitioner\u2019s claim is barred by the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule. The judge of compensation concluded it was not and the employer appeals. The \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule ordinarily precludes an award of compensation benefits for injuries sustained during routine travel to and from an employee\u2019s regular place of work. Since the rule had became diluted by a series of exceptions, in 1979 the Legislature included in its extensive amendments to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, L.1979, <em>c. </em>283, a provision defining when employment commences. <em>See Livingstone v. Abraham &amp; Straus, Inc., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>89, 96, 543 A.2d 45 (1988). This legislation reflects the Legislature\u2019s disagreement with the judiciary\u2019s broad reading of the statutory criteria for coverage. The Legislature drafted the statute to \u201cestablish [ ] relief from the farreaching effect of the \u2018going and coming rule\u2019 decisions by defining and limiting the scope of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100-101, 543 A.2d 45. Thus, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36 was amended to include the following pertinent language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">Employment shall be deemed to commence when an employee arrives at the employer\u2019s place of employment to report for work and shall terminate when the employee leaves the employer\u2019s place of employment, excluding areas not under the control of the employer; provided, however, when the employee is required by the employer to be away from the employer\u2019s place of employment, the employee shall be deemed to be in the course of employment when the employee is engaged in the direct performance of duties assigned or directed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the employer; but the employment of employee paid travel time by an employer for time spent traveling to and from a job site or of any employee who utilizes an employer authorized vehicle shall commence and terminate with the time spent traveling to and from a job site or the authorized operation of a vehicle on business authorized by the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In his extensive fact-finding in this case, the judge of compensation found that Manzo\u2019s home in Lodi had become a \u201cjob site\u201d by virtue of the union business being conducted there.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He further concluded that before leaving home on the morning of his death Manzo was performing union business. Therefore, his trip on the morning in question from his home to his office was found by the judge of compensation to have occurred while he was going from one job site to another and thus arose out of and in the course of his employment. Therefore the judge concluded that his death<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> entitled petitioner to dependency benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>We recognize our limited scope of review, <em>ie., </em>when the findings of the judge of compensation could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record, considering the proofs as a whole and with due regard to the opportunity of the judge to hear the witnesses and judge their credibility and with due regard to the agency\u2019s expertise when such expertise is a pertinent factor, we are bound by those findings. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965). However, where the focus of the dispute is not on credibility but, rather, alleged error in the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the underlying facts and the implications to be drawn therefrom, our function broadens somewhat. Where our review of the record \u201cleaves us with the definite conviction that the judge went so wide of the mark that a mistake must have been made,\u201d we may \u201cappraise the record as if we were deciding the matter at inception and make our own findings and conclusions.\u201d <em>Snyder Realty v. BMW of N. Amer., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65, 69, 558 A.2d 28 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">(4] We fully accept the determination of the judge of compensation that petitioner was an extremely credible witness<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that her husband, the decedent, was a dedicated union president who was at all times concerned with the welfare of the Union and its members and cautious as to expenditures made by it. Decedent\u2019s office was located in New York City where his secretary and all appropriate office equipment were located. The Union also had an office in East Orange which contained a telephone, furniture for meetings, and a photocopy machine, although it was not staffed. We also accept the findings of fact by the judge of compensation that decedent, as president of the Union, often conducted union business from his home. He used the recreation room for meetings with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>associates, and a back room (labeled as the radio room because it also contained his ham radio operation and a computer used for the radio, both unrelated to union activities) for the conduct of union business. His wife testified that all business records were kept there, as well as the phone which was paid for by the Union.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was conceded that the Union did not make any payment to decedent for the use of his home, nor did he claim such use on his income tax return.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The Union has approximately 4,000 members and approximately 100 shops located in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. There were four business agents. As president, decedent was in charge of the Union and did not report to any superior. The judge of compensation found that decedent was in fact the Union, and thus his decisions were those of the Union, particularly the decision to utilize his home for union business.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Here the petitioner argues, and the judge of compensation found, that because the decedent regularly used his home to conduct union business it had become a job site. In <em>McKeever v. N.J. Bell Tel. Co., </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 430 A.2d 247 (App.Div.), certif. den. 87 <em>N.J. </em>410, 434 A.2d 1086 (1981), a case decided after the enactment of the 1979 amendments, the court concluded that it was essential for a corporate attorney for New Jersey Bell Telephone to work at home in order to live up to his employer\u2019s expectations, that his employer encouraged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>such activity, which the attorney did constantly with his employer\u2019s knowledge. Thus, when that attorney died as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident when driving home from work with his briefcase containing handwritten notes pertaining to a matter on which he was currently working for his employer, his dependent was found to be entitled to dependency benefits, reversing the decision of the judge of compensation to the contrary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although <em>McKeever </em>provides some support for the petitioner, we believe this type of exception to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule is what the Legislature intended to eliminate by its 1979 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The <em>McKeever </em>court relied upon <em>Paige v. The City of Rahway, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>177, 376 A.2d 1226 (1977), and <em>Sabat v. Fedders Corporation, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>444, 383 A.2d 421 (1978). In his dissent in the latter case, Justice Clifford stated, \u201cOnce again the Court chips away at the going and coming rule, eroding it in one breath and vouchsafing its endurance in the next.\u201d We believe the 1979 amendment was the Legislature\u2019s response to such cases as <em>Paige </em>and <em>Sabat. </em>Even in the <em>Sabat </em>case, the Supreme Court had noted in a footnote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">We note that Sabat\u2019s employment situation differs dramatically from that of employees who take work home out of a sense of self-imposed moral obligation or self-perceived necessity arising out of an inability to cope with their workload during their normal workday. The benefits of such activity are predominantly personal with only an incidental enhancement of the efficient functioning of the employer enterprise. In such cases the work connection is, without more, too attenuated to justify the imposition of the costs of off-duty injuries on the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">[ 75 <em>N.J. </em>at 451, 383 A.2d 421]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">This subject is discussed by Professor Larsen in terms of the dual purpose doctrine as it applies to working at home. <em>See </em>1</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>Larsen, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 18.31, 18.32 and 18.33, in which he observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">When reliance is placed upon the status of the home as a place of employment generally, instead of or in addition to the existence of a specific work assignment at the end of the particular homeward trip, three principal <em>indicia </em>may be looked for: the quantity and regularity of work performed at home; the continuing presence of work equipment at home; and special circumstances of the particular employment that make it necessary and not merely personally convenient to work at home. <em>[Id., </em>\u00a7 18, 32 at 4-309]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The issue was squarely addressed by the California Supreme Court in <em>Santa Rosa Junior College v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board, </em>708 P.2d 673, 40 <em>Cal.3d </em>345, 220 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>94 (1985). There, the decedent, a college mathematics instructor was killed while driving from the school to his home. At the time of the accident, decedent had some student papers he intended to grade that evening. It was his practice to bring home a few hours of work each night. He worked in a section of his living room reserved for that purpose where he kept duplicate copies of necessary books. His wife explained that her husband did this because on campus he was subject to interruption by students. There was further evidence that working at home by the faculty was the rule rather than the exception even though an office was provided for each instructor. The court held that the fact that an employee regularly works at home does not transform the house into a second job site unless such was required by the employer. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">... Generally, \u2018[w]ork done at home may exempt an injury occurring during a regular commute from the going and coming rule if circumstances of the employment\u2014and not mere dictates of convenience to the employee\u2014make the home a second job site. If the home becomes a second business situs, the familiar rule applies that injuries sustained while traveling between job sites is compensable____ [T]he commute does not constitute a business trip if the employees work at home for their own convenience: \u2018serving the employee\u2019s own convenience in selecting an off-premise place to work is a personal and not a business purpose.\u2019 [Citation omitted.] [708 P.2d at 679, 220 Cal.Rptr. at 99-100]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The court noted that the contemporary professional\u2014the draftsman, the engineer, the lawyer\u2014frequently take work home, \u201cfb]ut this hearthside activity\u2014while commendable\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>does not create a white collar exception to the going and coming rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680, 220 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 101.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">That is the issue in this case. Was it necessary for Mr. Manzo to use his home for the conduct of union business or was it simply for his personal convenience? The judge of compensation recognized this when he said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">The question that I have is either if I find as I do that the home was a work place, within the meaning of the insurance policy or as a job site within the meaning of the statute, I have to come to the second point of whether or not any work was being performed at the job site or work place of the home the morning of December 26th, 1985, because if I find that there was no work being performed any other finding that I made about the house does not make that injury compensable, because it was his home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">As noted, the Union provided an office in New York, staffed by a secretary and business equipment, and an office in New Jersey which contained business equipment, so the conclusion of the judge of compensation that Mr. Manzo\u2019s work related activities at home were for the benefit of the Union, as opposed to his own convenience, is not supported by the evidence. The judge of compensation concluded that Mr. Manzo was the Union and therefore his decision to work at home was the decision of the Union. We do not subscribe to that proposition. The judge apparently further concluded that, because he found that Mr. Manzo had done some union work at home before leaving for his office on the fatal day, he was traveling from one job site to another (although some of the work that he was performing was not for the Local but for the International). Initially, the judge acknowledged that he had very serious reservations about the petitioner\u2019s right to recover in this case, but indicated that after hearing the testimony he did not have any doubt in his mind that Manzo was performing work at his home on that particular day that benefited the Union and thus the accident was compensable. We disagree. If Manzo had been injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>while performing union activities at home, even for his own convenience, benefits may have been properly payable. <em>See </em>1 <em>Larsen, Workers\u2019Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 18.34 at 4-318. However, there is no dispute that, \u00e1t the time of the accident preceding Mr. Manzo\u2019s death, he was on his way from his home to his office in New York City. Thus, accepting all of the findings of fact by the judge of compensation, we disagree with his conclusions on those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-9\">We note from the medical examiner's report received into evidence that Mr. Manzo was admitted to the hospital at 10:45 a.m. It is not clear from the record as to where he was between the happening of the accident at 6:20 a.m. and his admission to the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We concluded in <em>Nemchick v. Thatcher Glass Mfg. Co., </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 495 A.2d 1372 (App.Div.1985), that the Legislature intended to preserve the \"special mission\" exception to the going and coming rule when an employee is away from the work place at his employer's direction and \"when the employee is engaged in the direct performance of duties assigned ... by the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 495 A.2d 1372. In <em>Ward v. Davidowitz, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 468 A.2d 250 (App.Div.1983), we noted that the amendment was to eliminate an employer\u2019s responsibility for accidents occurring in areas not under the employer\u2019s control unless the employee is required to be away from the work place by the employer. The fact that a bus company employee was provided free transportation on bus company\u2019s buses as a benefit of his employment which he used for commuting to and from work did not bring that travel to work within the scope of his employment. <em>Mahon v. Reilly\u2019s Radio Cabs, Inc., </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 513 A.2d 367 (App.Div.1986), certif. den. 107 <em>N.J. </em>79, 526 A.2d 159 (1987). A police officer who was permitted by police department regulations to wear his uniform while traveling to and from work in his private automobile was not entitled to benefits for injuries sustained in an automobile accident. <em>Plodzien v. Township of Edison Police Department, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 549 A.2d 59 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\">As noted, the immediate cause of death was occlusive coronary artery disease, but respondent seems to concede, apparently based upon the medical examiner's opinion quoted above, that Mr. Manzo\u2019s death was at least in part causally related to the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We note however that the judge made findings based upon Mrs. Manzo\u2019s observations of her husband's activities between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. before he left the house, notwithstanding her testimony that she did not get up at the time her husband did, as noted by appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Petitioner testified that it was at her insistence that her husband had the Union pay for the telephone since he was using his own telephone for union business at his own expense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\">As to this circumstance, the judge of compensation made an unusual observation when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">... He could have easily taken that home or a portion of that room, there are many tax benefits that could have been used by Mr. Manzo and he had\u2014if I had information of him milking the Tax Law or milking some other situation I would have come to a different conclusion, but this is a guy who didn\u2019t care about the dollars for himself.

Since no dates are set forth in the opinion, we are unable to determine when Mr. McKeever died or when the judge of compensation rendered his decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\">We further note that such an exception would seem to create a distinct advantage to white collar workers not available to blue collar workers who are unable to take home projects requiring equipment and manual labor to accomplish.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
