D. 1894, the above named Jackson Orr and D. J. Martin personally appeared before me at my office in Denver and made answer to the charges against them of malfeasance in office, viz.: that on Monday, January 8, 1894, on application made, the said Jackson Orr and D. J. Martin, as composing a majority of the fire and police board of the city of Denver, appointed a special policeman and sent him to remain at a gambling house in said city of Denver, not for the purpose of restraining gambling, or of obtaining proof thereof, but for its regulation or protection contrary to law, and that said action of the majority of said fire and police board was with the knowledge that it was in violation of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-8\">\u201c \u2018 After some discussion between the executive and counsel for the defendants, the Hon. Henry Charpiot, Y. D. Markham and A. H. Martin, the issues were finally agreed upon as follows: It was admitted that a special policeman was detailed on the day and date mentioned in the charge, and was sent to a gambling house, but it was denied that the said special policeman was sent to said gambling house for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the purpose of either regulating or protecting the same, but defendants alleged that the said special policeman was sent to said gambling house for the specific purpose of preserving peace, preventing riots and disturbances, preventing minors, intoxicated persons or others under disability from frequenting the said gambling house, to apprehend any person guilty of any disturbance or breach of the peace, and for the purpose of getting information as to the presence or whereabouts of suspicious characters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\">\u201c \u2018 And upon these issues the case went to trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">\u201c \u2018 The testimony was voluminous, and as bearing directly on the issues, the following is uncontradicted and quoted from the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-7\">\u201c \u2018 BE YIEWING- TESTIMONY.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-8\">\u201c \u2018 Mr. Gardner testified that he was a special policeman, was detailed to attend to gambling houses and received his instructions from the chief of police, which instructions were to keep out minors and not allow them to gamble, and also prohibit intoxicated men from gambling, to see that the house was promptly closed at midnight, and to report all suspicious characters to the chief of police. He had no instructions to stop gambling or report it. His hours were from 2 o\u2019clock p. M. until midnight; saw plenty of gambling going in the gambling house. Did not wear a police uniform, but did wear a star. Was paid for his services by the gambling house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-9\">\u2018\u201cLieutenant John F. Stone testified that he was at this time ranking officer next to the chief of police, and had held his position two years and nine months; that the instructions given to the special police were substantially as herein-above stated; that special policemen had been detailed by Messrs. Orr and Martin to gambling houses; that shortly after Messrs. Orr, Martin and Trimble were appointed they re-established the specials put in gambling houses. These houses are kept open until midnight and anybody may enter except minors and intoxicated persons. Lieutenant Stone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>testified that it was an impossibility to close all gambling houses and stop gambling in Denver, and that the appointment of special policemen was the best method to limit, gambling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-4\">\u201c \u2018 A. W. Kellogg, chief of police, testified that he gave instructions to all specials, which instructions he received from the board.

Pollard testified that he was a special policeman at the gambling house over Tortoni\u2019s; that there were in that house a roulette wheel, faro table and card table, and plenty of gambling; that as a special policeman he was under the instructions of the chief of the board. The proprietors of the gambling house never gave him any instructions; he was paid the first week by the gambling house proprietors, but received his instructions entirely from the chief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\">\u2018\u201cTESTIMONY OF DEFENSE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-7\">\u201c \u2018 Ex-Commissioner W. G. Trimble, a witness produced in behalf of the commissioners, testified that he assisted defendant in the appointment of special policemen, and that he knew that they were to be sent to gambling houses, and thought that was the best plan for regulating and controlling the evil. The special policemen were not paid by the city, but they were given to understand that they were to be under the exclusive control of the police department.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-8\">\u201c \u2018 Commissioner Martin asked witness Trimble on his direct examination: \u201c Is it not a fact that the police and fire board required those gambling houses to pay those policemen in their houses for the protection of their house by them, or otherwise they would be closed up?\u201d and witness Trimble, ex-commissioner, answered: \u201cThat was the fact of the matter.\u201d The statute vs. gambling was also referred to. After the testimony was completed, the executive listened to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>argument of Hon. Henry G. Charpiot, counsel for defendants, and held matter for several days that the evidence might be typewritten. An unusual pressure of official business has prevented the executive from an early consideration of this case, but after careful deliberation the executive is compelled to find the charge sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-4\">\u201c \u2018 The defendants admit sending special policemen to gambling houses. The question at issue is only as to the object of defendants in sending these special policemen to gambling houses. The charge is that it was for the purpose of protecting or regulating the gambling business; the defendants deny this and assert that it was for the specific purpose of preserving the peace, preventing riots and disturbance, preventing minors, intoxicated persons or others under disability from frequenting said gambling houses; apprehend any person guilty of a disturbance or breach of the peace and for the purpose of getting information as to the presence and whereabouts of suspicious characters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">\u201c \u2018 THE FACTS ADMITTED.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">\u201c \u2018The fact is admitted that gambling houses, provided with roulette, faro and card tables, were running wide open in Denver, and with the full knowledge of the police. Special pains were taken to prove that these special policemen, though paid by the gambling houses, were under the orders and specially represented the police. The charge is that these special policemen were really protecting the gamblers\u2019 business. The answer denies this specifically, but the answer is not under oath, and neither of the defendants were sworn in the case. Ex-Commissioner Trimble testified, in answer to the inquiry of Commissioner Martin, that the police and fire board required the gambling houses to pay these special policemen in their houses for the protection of their houses by them, or otherwise they would be closed up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-7\">\u201c \u2018 It appears to the executive that the charge that the special policemen are sent to the gambling houses for their protection, is fully established by this testimony of the defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u201c\u2018As to the answer of defendants that the special policemen were sent to the gambling houses for the specific purpose of preserving the peace, preventing riots and disturbances, preventing minors and intoxicated persons from frequenting said gambling houses, and to apprehend any person guilty of any disturbance or breach of the peace, the statute of the state quoted clearly makes using, or keeping gambling devices for use, a breach of the peace, as much as theft, burglary or riot. Police officers are empowered to even break open doors to get at this machinery of vice. People whom these special policemen saw gambling were engaged in the violation of law, or breach of the peace, as much as though a minor or an intoxicated person should gamble. The law is just as imperative that a guilty person should be arrested for one crime as for the other. The evidence clearly shows that all this violation of law was known and recognized by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-4\">\u201c \u2018 CONCLUSIONS OE THE EXECUTIVE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">\u201c \u2018 Aside from the direct testimony above quoted, the tone of the answer and defense is, that special policemen were sent to these gambling houses, not for the purpose of stopping any violation of law or breach of the peace known as gambling, but other violations of law, as riot, fighting, etc., which often result from the crime of gambling. The practical effect of such a policy must be to protect the gambler in his unlawful occupation from the indignation of those defrauded by his crime. The police might as well be sent to a prize fight, not to arrest the principals and prevent the crime, but to keep peace among the spectators, and then claim that such action was not a protection of prize fighting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-6\">\u201c \u2018 I therefore find from the evidence in this case that :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-7\">\u201c \u2018 <em>First </em>\u2014 The defendants, as members of the fire and police board, in knowingly sending special policemen to the gambling houses of the city of Denver for the protection of said houses by the city police, were guilty of malfeasance in office; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201c \u2018 <em>Second </em>\u2014 That in failing to cause to be arrested persons whom they knew to be in open violation of the law, they were guilty of neglect of duty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">\u201c \u2018 It is, therefore, for the cause hereinbefore specified, ordered, this 7th day of March, 1894:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">\u201c \u2018 That Jackson Orr be, and he is hereby, removed from the office of fire commissioner of the city of Denver; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\">\u201c \u2018 D.

O\u2019Reilly.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b542-8\">Mr. Justice Goddard</author>\n<p id=\"AUv\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">We have uniformly declined to give an opinion in response to executive or legislative questions propounded under section 8, article VI of the Constitution, that might affect private rights or prejudice private interests. A strict adherence to this rule of practice would preclude our answering the present inquiry, since it in terms calls for an <em>ex parte </em>decision of the rights of contesting claimants to an office. But the gravity of the situation and the impending danger to life and property disclosed by the accompanying statement, imperatively demand that we so far depart from this rule as to give an opinion upon the facts as submitted, without prejudice to the rights to show other or different facts. We do this hoping thereby to allay popular excitement and avert riot and bloodshed. We feel more at liberty in so doing in the present instance for the reason that the power of the governor to remove incumbents of the offices of fire and excise commissioner has recently been thoroughly and elaborately argued before us, and upon careful consideration decided by this court in the case <em>Trimble v. The People ex rel. Phelps, ante, </em>187. In that case the power of the governor to remove an incumbent of the office of police commissioner of the city of Denver, for cause other than political, was clearly recognized. Chief Justice Hayt, speaking for the court, said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u201c The statute only requires that the reason for removal shall be other than political, and that it shall be stated in writing. The words \u2018 but not for political reasons \u2019 are words of limitation, and could have been deemed necessary by the legislature for but one reason, to wit, that otherwise the governor might remove for political purposes. The intent on the part of the legislature to confer the power of removal for any other cause satisfactory to the governor is made plain by the words of limitation. * * * The legislature had the power to provide for the creation of a police commissioner for the city of Denver; it had the power to provide the manner in which such office should be filled, and there can be no doubt that it had like power to provide for removals. * * * The investiture of the power of removal here given is'restrieted in but two particulars ; it must not be exercised for political reasons, and the cause of removal must be stated in writing. In considering removals under this act, we must assume that the lawmaking body was of the opinion that the requirement that the cause of removal should be stated in writing was the only check necessary to prevent an arbitrary and oppressive abuse of the power. * * * Under the statute the cause that may be sufficient to warrant removal is to be determined by the governor, and no mode of inquiry being prescribed, he is at liberty to adopt such mode as to him shall seem proper, without interference on the part of the courts. * * * The governor having determined that a sufficient cause for removal existed, and having exercised the power confided to him, relator is without remedy in this proceeding. It is the duty of the courts to uphold the executive power, as it has been conferred by the legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Therefore, if the statement of the cause assigned for the. removal of Orr and Martin be accepted as true, as it must be upon this inquiry, and the removal was made therefor and not for political reasons, the action of the governor was clearly within the power conferred upon him by the legislature under the doctrine announced in that case, and it.follows that upon notice of such order of removal the right of Orr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>and Martin to hold the offices and exercise the powers of fire and excise commissioners of the city of Denver terminated ; and Mullins and Barnes, if duly appointed and qualified as set forth in the foregoing statement, were entitled to enter upon the duties of those offices respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">But it further appears from the communication submitted that Orr and Martin refuse to surrender the offices, and for some reason question the validity of the order of removal and the legality of the appointment of Mullins and Barnes. We .are not advised upon what ground they rest their refusal or predicate their right to retain the offices; nor can we in this <em>ex parte </em>proceeding inquire into or consider them. Their sufficiency must be determined in a different proceeding, and should in the first instance be submitted to another tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Certain expressions in the <em>Trimble </em>case, supra, were referred to and relied upon in argument as announcing a doctrine the reverse of this. In that case the power of removal by the executive was contested upon various grounds. One of 'these grounds was that a determination as to whether a cause of removal existed was judicial in character, and it was also contended that the governor could not act in the absence of a statute fixing the procedure. It was in answer to the latter claim that the following language was used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">\u201c The office of police commissioner is created by the statute ; it was accepted by the relator under the conditions imposed by the act, among which was that the incumbent should hold it subject to removal by the governor for cause. Under the statute the cause that may be sufficient to warrant removal is to be determined by the governor, and no mode of inquiry being prescribed, he is at libei'ty to adopt such mode as to him shall seem proper, without interference on the part of the courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The words \u201cwithout interference on the part of the courts,\u201d as the context shows, have reference to the procedure only; that as to this, the executive could adopt such mode as he might deem proper and suited to the occasion; that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>not contemplated by the act that he should be required to institute an inquiry in its nature judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\">No question was then mooted as to the power of the courts to entertain any appropriate proceeding to ascertain the title to the office in ease the incumbent should attempt to hold over in opposition to the executive order. On the contrary, in that case, the jurisdiction of the court was invoked by the removed official and his right to the seat was denied as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">So also the following language used in the <em>Trimble </em>ease, viz.: \u201c The governor having determined that a sufficient cause for removal existed, and having exercised the power confided to him, relator is without remedy in this proceeding,\u201d had reference to the facts then before the court. The contestants by petition and answer had brought the facts relied on fully to the attention of the court for its judgment thereon ; there was no pretense that anything further could be shown material to the issue. The court did not say to the petitioner, \u201c You had no right to test the validity of the removal in this proceeding; \u201d but it did say, in effect, \u201c The facts shown by the record are not sufficient to warrant a decision in your favor, and the judgment of ouster entered by the district court was unwarranted and must be set aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">That no further doubt may exist upon this question, we say, without hesitancy, that if the executive order of removal is questioned by the incumbent, the courts have the power, and it is exclusively within their province, to pass upon such objections and determine as between the respective claimants the right to the office in question, and the law provides a plain and adequate procedure for that purpose; and a speedy determination of such question is insured by express statute. Mills\u2019 An. Stats., p. 880. All law-abiding citizens will, and all others should be required to, submit such controversies to these tribunals for settlement. The district attorney is empowered by statute to bring an action for that purpose. Code, 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">It was suggested by counsel in argument that an unquali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>fied answer to the precise question presented should be given, and it was asserted that this court is bound by its own precedents to make response.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\">The <em>Speakership </em>case, 15 Colo. 520, was referred to in support of these suggestions. That case bears little or no analogy to the present controversy. The constitution invests the house of representatives with the power of electing its own speaker, and no other department of the government has any voice in the matter; but,in the present controversy, as already shown, a resort to ordinary judicial proceedings is the proper mode of determining who are entitled to the offices of fire and excise commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">It is true, in the <em>Speakership </em>case, Governor Routt asked, among other questions, \u201c Who is now the speaker of said house ? \u201d This court did not, however, give a direct answer, but submitted certain questions for argument, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201c (1) Has the court any authority under the constitution and laws to pass upon the matters thus presented for its opinion ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201c (2) What is the state of the law, parliamentary or otherwise, pertaining to the subjects covered by the executive inquiry ? \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">After the argument the court remarked in its opinion that a judicial opinion in respect to an <em>ex parte </em>inquiry from the executive department concerning the affairs of the legislative department, was anomalous and peculiar, and also indicated that the court could not adjudicate the speakership contest and enforce its views in a direct proceeding. Nevertheless, the court felt bound to express an opinion in obedience to the constitutional mandate. After considering the state of the law, parliamentary and otherwise, and the constitutional objections urged against the power of the house to remove its speaker, the law was declared by the court as follows: '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u201c The house of representatives has the power, by the vote of \u2018 a majority of the whole number of members elected,\u2019 to remove its speaker from office and to elect another in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>stead, in the manner stated in the executive communication submitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The court did not, however, assume to state who was speaker ; but observed that the majority of the house \u201c must assume and bear the responsibility for the exercise of their powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">It was further urged in argument that this court should not make any observations concerning the powers and duties of the executive; that to do so would be an interference with a co-ordinate department of the government. In response to executive questions this court has in every instance endeavored to show that respect to the governor which is due to his high office. We have always recognized, as we do now, that the three governmental departments are co-ordinate, and that neither can lawfully encroach upon the province of the other. And while we concede to the governor full liberty to submit such questions as he may deem consistent with his <em>executive </em>powers, this court reserves for itself the right to express its opinion freely, in whole or in part, or not at all, as it shall deem consistent with its <em>judicial </em>powers and constitutional obligation. An opinion controlled or restricted by other influences than our own judgment and consciences, would not be the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">But it is contended that the statements in reference to calling out the military were inserted for the purpose of showing the importance of the question and the'solemnity of the occasion under which the question was submitted. Such was undoubtedly the purpose of the statements. Were it not for the threatened dangers by force, military and otherwise, the question propounded would not be important nor the occasion solemn.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">We will not for a moment entertain the idea that in submitting this question his excellency, the governor, was actuated by other than a sincere desire to be advised as to the extent and scope of his statutory and constitutional powers, so that he may act advisedly and correctly in the discharge of his offleial functions; nor do we believe that he is averse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>to receiving any dispassionate advice that may enable him better to know and perform those functions. We feel in duty bound, therefore, after having entertained and decided, as definitely as we feel at liberty to do, the specific question submitted, to go further and express our views upon those features of the situation that more directly affect the public welfare and are of more vital importance to the community than the question, \u201c Who shall discharge the duties of -fire and excise commissioner?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">We are clearly of the opinion that the governor is greatly in error in assuming that it devolves upon him to enforce his order of removal. His constitutional oath to \u201c take care that the laws be faithfully executed \u201d imposes no such obligation upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">His duty and responsibility cease upon the making of the order or appointment, and any attempt on his part to personally enforce such order or install his appointee is beyond any express or implied duty or power imposed or conferred upon him by constitution or statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The police, fire and excise commissioners, though appointed by the governor, are not charged with duties pertaining to the chief executive department of the state. They are municipal officers, the same as the mayor and other officers of the city elected by the people. We are unable to see how the governor is charged with the duty of seating a member of the fire and police board any more than he is charged with the duty of seating any municipal officer elected by the people. Will it be contended that it is the duty of the chief executive of the state to install into office, by force if necessary, every county, precinct or municipal officer whom he may deem entitled to such office in advance of the determination of any controversy that may arise concerning such office ? A proposition so fraught with danger to every principle of free government cannot for a moment be entertained; and if such power cannot be lawfully exercised by the governor acting in his civil capacity, <em>a fortiori </em>is the use of military force to that end by him as commander in chief, unauthorized.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The constitution expressly provides (sec. 22, Bill of Rights) \u201c that the military shall always be in strict subordination to the civil power.\u201d The governor\u2019s warrant as commander in chief to call out the militia of the state is found in section 5, art. 4 of the Constitution, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">\u201c The governor shall be commander in chief of the military forces of the state * * * he shall have power to call out the militia to execute the laws, to suppress insurrection or repel invasion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">There can be no pretense that the conduct of Orr and Martin constitutes the insurrection contemplated in the foregoing provision, and therefore the call must have been based upon the ground that the militia were needed \u201c to execute the laws.\u201d We repeat that by no rule of construction can the power and duty imposed upon the governor \u201c to execute the laws \u201d be held to authorize the forcible induction of an appointee into office. In this provision of the constitution, the phrase, \u201cto execute the laws,\u201d contemplates the enforcement of a judicial process \u2014 that is, the enforcement of a right or remedy provided by the law and judicially determined and ordered to be enforced, and not an arbitrary enforcement by the executive of what he may consider the law to be. Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., pp. 87-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We thing it too clear for argument that if Orr and Martin were guilty of the conduct charged and were acting in violation of law in resisting removal, their wrong doing affords no justification for calling out the militia to forcibly eject them.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">A proper regard for the reputation and peace of the community would dictate that the claimants institute proper proceedings in court to determine their right to the offices. In this way a speedy and peaceful result can be reached, and the person entitled to the office installed therein without disturbance or delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">So much has been said as to the delay incident to ordinary judicial proceedings, we desire to call attention again to our statute above cited, which requires proceedings of this character to be advanced; and if parties are diligent, the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>will not permit unnecessary delay, but other causes will be postponed in order that proceedings of this kind may be speedily determined. Some delay is, of course, inevitable. Reasonable time must always be allowed for the consideration of the rights of the parties in the administration of justice under a free government. Monarchical and despotic governments can undoubtedly proceed more speedily than a representative government in the enactment, administration and execution of the laws. Reasonable delay is the price we pay in order to secure the protection and vindication of personal and property rights under a government like ours; and when it is once conceded that the hardship resulting from such delay justifies a resort to the summary exercise of arbitrary power, either by the civil or military authority, then will justice be dethroned and despotism or anarchy usurp her seat.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
