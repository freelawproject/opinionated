It was contemplated that the officers should receive their regular pay during their vacations. In addition to the ordinary duties of police, the officers of the city of Haverhill performed without extra pay duties in connection with parades, strikes, fires, liquor raids, and other matters during hours when they were not on regular duty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-7\">The salary bill for 1899 provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-8\">Sergeant, day and night patrolmen, including extinguishing of street lights, all fees received from trial justice, police, district, and municipal courts, superior, supreme, and United States courts, either for the service of processes or attendance as witness to go into the city treasury, per day, $2.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-9\">If competent, it was agreed that orders providing for vacations without loss of pay, similar to that passed this year, were passed by the city and acted upon by the officers during the years 1883, 1884,1885,1886,1887,1888,1889,1890,1892, 1893,1894,1896.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-10\">The police officers are appointed for a term of four years under and since the passage of the statute. There is no provision in the charter or ordinance of the city affecting this case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-11\"><em>M. A. </em>Pingree, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-12\"><em>C. A.

It would come fairly within the authority conferred on cities and towns to make such reasonable provisions as they should deem conducive to their welfare \u201c for directing and managing the prudential affairs, preserving the peace and good order, and maintaining the internal police thereof.\u201d Pub. Sts. c. 27, \u00a7 15; c. 28, \u00a7 2. It would also come within the power conferred on the mayor and aldermen of Haverhill to make such regulations for the government of the police department not inconsistent with law as they deem proper.
