Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Richardson, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-13\">There was evidence that the plaintiff was the owner of certain horses and carriages used in conveying passengers in the city of Boston; that the defendant was a livery-stable keeper; and that on October 9, 1897, the plaintiff was indebted to the defendant in the sum of $489.99 for board and care of her horses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The following instrument, which was executed on October 11, 1897, was put in evidence: \u201cBoston, October 9, 1897. I relinquish to S. F. Johnson all claim on the three horses (3), one Kimball landau, and one Bennett coup\u00e9 now in his possession, until his claim of $439.99 for board and care is paid in full, which I agree to do by weekly payments of $15. The board from this (October 9) date to be paid weekly, E. F. Eadigan, Julia A. Eadigan.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">On October 10, 1897, the defendant asserted a claim of statutory lien upon the horses, and refused to allow them to be taken from the stable. Thereupon Edward F. Eadigan, the husband of the plaintiff, called upon the defendant, and testified that in the conversation which then took place the defendant said, \u201c If you will have this release of the horses drawn, and signed and handed to me, I will then permit you to go on with the use of your horses in the ordinary course of business.\u201d The plaintiff contended that that was the consideration for the agreement, which was not stated in the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">This evidence was objected to,but the judge admitted it; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">After the defendant had detained the horses, and before the signing of the paper above set out, the plaintiff had a conversation with the defendant, regarding which she testified as follows: \u201c The first remark I made to him was that he was the last one I thought would stop me from making a living. He said he did n\u2019t intend to stop me, but he thought it better between him and myself if I would sign over all my horses, carriages, and stuff that was in his stable; he would make out this paper if I would sign it, and he would protect me. I could continue in business just the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">The defendant objected to this evidence, but the judge admitted it; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-9\">The witness further testified that when she signed the paper the defendant said to her, \u201c Now, Mrs. Eadigan, go ahead, take the horses. You have seven months to pay that in. That ain\u2019t very hard \u201d; that thereafter she continued using the property as she had before the horses were detained; and that almost immediately she made default in her payments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-10\">Concerning this interview the defendant testified as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201c The plaintiff said, \u2018 Mr. Johnson, I have got the money right here. I can pay that bill, but I don\u2019t wish to.\u2019 I asked her if she would tell why not. \u2018Well,\u2019 she said, \u2018if I pay that bill Mr. Radigan will not work. I want him to go on to a team and earn a living. I also may wish to collect money which is owing to us, and if I settle the bill he will settle back and won\u2019t do it\u2019; and I told her that that was a pretty good policy or something to that effect, and I should like to help her in any way I could, but I needed money bad, and I believe she .asked me what could be done, and I told her I thought if she could insure my bill by giving me some hold on the property, something so that I should be safe, we could fix it so she could take her teams out and continue her business.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">On cross-examination, the defendant testified that the understanding and agreement was that the plaintiff should release the horses to him by the paper referred to, if he would let her go along in her business and pay by the week.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s horses and carriages continued to be kept at the defendant\u2019s stable after the execution of the foregoing instrument, and continued to be used by her as before in the transaction of her business, being returned each night to the defendant\u2019s stable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">On October 19, the plaintiff paid the defendant $15, for which the defendant made out a receipt on an ordinary blank form running as follows: \u201c Received from Mrs. E. F. Radigan, Fifteen xkk Dollars for use of horses and carriages. $15.00.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">On October 25,1897, the plaintiff paid $15, on October 29, 1897, $100, and on November 10, 1897, $15, taking therefor receipts reading substantially as that above set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-9\">On December 16, 1897, the plaintiff paid $25 and took therefor a receipt reading \u201c on account \u201d instead of \u201c for use of horses and carriages.\u201d The total of these payments represented by receipts upon blank forms was $170.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-10\">The defendant did not render bills for payments due on the $15 instalments, or \u201c old board \u201d so called, part of the agreement of October 9, but he did render bills for board of the horses subsequently to that agreement, which bills were always in the following form: \u201c Mrs. E. F. Radigan, to S. F. Johnson, Dr. To board, days. Storage, days.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Between the words \u201c board \u201d and \u201c days \u201d on each bill was written the number of days unpaid for, and between the words <em>u </em>storage \u201d and \u201c days \u201d a pen mark was drawn indicating that there was no charge for storage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">From October 9,1897, to January 15, 1898, the plaintiff continued to keep her property at the defendant\u2019s stable, and during that time paid $156 on that account, leaving a balance due on January 15, 1898, for the \u201c new board \u201d so called, of $128.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">The amount of $156 was in no part represented by the receipts aggregating $170 heretofore spoken of. On January 21, 1898, nothing further having been paid by the plaintiff, the defendant again asserted a claim of statutory lien, and refused to allow the plaintiff\u2019s property to be taken from the stable. On February 5, 1898, the husband of the plaintiff, acting for her, paid to the defendant $100, and received therefor a receipt upon an ordinary blank form reading for $100 on account; and at that time asked permission to take out a horse and carriage, which permission was refused by the defendant, who, at that time, stated that the whole bill must be settled in full before he would permit the property to be taken from his stable. If the payment of $100 was added to the payment of $170 hereinbefore mentioned, for which receipts upon blank receipt forms were given, reading either \u201c for use of horses and carriages \u201d or \u201c on account,\u201d the total sum paid would amount to $270; and if applied by weekly payments under the agreement of October 9, 1897, would represent eighteen weeks, covering a period from October 9, 1897, to February 13, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">On February 11, 1898, the plaintiff and the defendant computed the amount due on the \u201c new board,\u201d so called, as follows: Taking the amount due January 15 at $128, and adding thereto four weeks\u2019 board to and including February 12, amounting to $72, made a total amount due upon that account of $200, and the defendant deducted therefrom the sum of $15 for such use as had been made of the horses since they had been detained by him, January 21, 1898 ; and upon this basis of computation the defendant would be entitled to $185, for \u201c new board \u201d up to and including February 12,1898. Thereupon the plaintiff tendered to the defendant the sum of $185, stating that it must be applied only in payment of the board of the horses since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>October 9, 1897, and asked for a receipt. The defendant refused to give a receipt for the $185, claiming that the whole amount for both the new and old board had become due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\">Upon cross-examination, the plaintiff testified that she did not know when it was that she got behind on the payments of $15 a week, and that the last bill, which she received on January 15, 1898, showed $128 due for the new board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-6\">On cross-examination, the defendant testified that he recognized the bill of January 15, 1898; that he there charged for board of horses, nothing else, $128 ; that up to February 5 the bill would be $182; that there would be $18 to and including February 12, and taking out $15 for use of the horses would make $185 up to and including that date; that the $15 part of the agreement of October 9 had been all paid before a certain interview of February 11, at the office of his counsel, although the instalments had not been paid regularly when due; that some instalments which were due had not been paid when the horses were detained on January 21,1898; that, at the time of the interview on February 11, when the $185 was paid, the \u201c new board \u201d part of the agreement of October 9 was all paid, and a day or two in advance ; that he did not remember hearing his attorney say that he claimed to own the property in question, but did remember hearing the plaintiff\u2019s attorney ask, \u201c If you own these horses, why are you giving us $15 credit for the use of them ? \u201d ; that the words in the receipts, \u201c for use of horses,\u201d did not signify that he claimed to own the horses; that if the $185 were applied upon account for new board, it would fully discharge that obligation; that if the $270 were applied upon the amount due under the agreement at the rate of $15 a week, it would have paid that account to and including February 12; and that he claimed the balance due to him upon the whole account to be $169.99, which amount is arrived at by taking the $270 paid from the $439.99 mentioned in the original agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-7\">On February 14,1898, the defendant delivered to the plaintiff all her property excepting that covered by the instrument of October 9, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-8\">On June 10, 1898, the defendant served upon the plaintiff the following instrument, but nothing was ever done under it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>after service : \u201c Boston, June 10, 1898. To Julia. A. Radigan and E. F. Radigan. You are hereby notified that as you have failed to perform the obligations of your agreement of October 9,1897,1 intend to enforce payment and performance of said agreement by sale of the property pledged, to wit: three horses, one Kimball landau, and one Bennett coup\u00e9. Stephen F. Johnson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">At the interview of February 11,1898, the plaintiff demanded of the defendant the property mentioned in the agreement of October 9, 1897, and the defendant refused to comply with the demand. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the defendant asked that a verdict be ordered for him. The judge refused so to do; and the 'defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and, in answer to a question submitted to them, found that there was no conversion of the property not covered by the agreement of October 9. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-8\"><em>A. H. </em>Russell, <em>(E. M. Moore </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-9\"><em>W. M. Noble, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b91-10\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao_c\">The testimony that was offered by the plaintiff for the purpose of showing that the defendant agreed that if the plaintiff would have the release drawn and signed and handed to him he would then permit her to go on using the horses in the ordinary course of business was a plain attempt to engraft upon the written contract an oral agreement contemporaneous with it and was inadmissible. It tended to vary the contract as written by introducing into it another stipulation. This could not be done under the guise of showing what the consideration was. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>167 Mass. 309. <em>Knowlton </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>146 Mass. 86. <em>Simanovich </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>145 Mass. 180. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>4 Gray, 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">We think that the transaction was in the nature of a pledge of the property described in the contract as security for the payment of the sum named at the rate of $15 per week. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Dolliver, </em>132 Mass. 103. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>5 Allen, 34. Upon the failure or neglect of the plaintiff to pay as agreed, the whole debt became due, and the defendant could enforce his security by a sale of the pledge <em>(Upham </em>v. <em>Smith, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>7 Mass. 265, <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>100 Mass. 425, 427) ; or he could waive the breach of the agreement, and if he did so, and the plaintiff afterwards paid the instalments as they fell due and in other respects observed the conditions of the pledge, a sale by the defendant would constitute a conversion. Whether the defendant by accepting the amounts which were paid after ho demanded a settlement in January, 1898, waived his right to insist upon the payment of the whole debt, was a question for the jury under suitable instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The'defendant also contends that he had a lien as stable keeper, and that, therefore, this\" action cannot be maintained. But so far as the exceptions show he dealt with the property as pledgee, and not by virtue of any lien which he had as stable keeper. We are in doubt, as the exceptions stand, how far, if at all, the matter of the lien and how it would affect the rights of the' parties was brought to the attention of the court. At another trial the facts may appear more fully, and we therefore do not deem it wise to discuss the matter now.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
