Sts. c. 145, \u00a7 11, and St. 1895, c. 427, for the affirmation of a contract of marriage into which the libellant had entered with knowledge that within two years thereof a decree of divorce from a former wife had been granted against the libellee, it cannot be said that a request by the libellant for a ruling, \u201c as matter of law, that the said libel should be granted,\u201d was improperly refused by the presiding judge.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-9\">Libel, under the provisions of Pub. Sts. c. 145, \u00a7 11, and St. 1895, c. 427, for the affirmation of a marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-10\">At the hearing in the Superior Court, before Braley, J., it appeared that the libellant and libellee were married on October 22, 1890, and lived together as husband and wife until November 15, 1897; that on February 4, 1889, a former wife of the libellee obtained a decree of divorce against him which was made absolute on August 2,1889; and that the present libellant at the time of her marriage knew that two years had not elapsed since the libellee had been divorced from his former wife. At the close of the testimony of the libellant, who was the only witness at the hearing, she requested a ruling upon the evidence \u201c as matter of law that the said libel should be granted.\u201d The judge refused so to rule, and dismissed the <em>libel; </em>and the libellant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-11\"><em>H. H. </em>Armington, for the libellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-12\"><em>T.

But so far as appears from the bill of exceptions the only request made of the court by the libellant was that it should rule upon the evidence \u201c as matter of law that the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>libel should be granted.\u201d As the bill of exceptions stands, therefore, the question presented by it is whether we can say that the refusal of the court to rule as requested by the libellant, that upon the evidence as matter of law the libel should be granted, was wrong. We do not see how we can say so. One of the conditions upon which a subsequent marriage which has been entered into under the circumstances described in the statute may be legalized is, that \u201c such subsequent marriage contract was entered into by at least one of the parties in good faith, in the full belief that the former husband or wife was dead, or that such former marriage had been annulled by divorce.\u201d St. 1895, c. 427. We cannot say that the judge may not have found that the subsequent marriage was not entered into \u201c in good faith, in the full belief \u201d on the part of the libellant or libellee that the \u201c former marriage had been annulled by divorce.\u201d The libellant was the only witness, and it cannot be held as matter of law that the judge was bound to believe what she said.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">Dealing with the case as it comes before us, we think that it is clear that the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\n<em>/So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
