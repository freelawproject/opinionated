The fact is, even our best \u2022 western manufacturers have been at their wit\u2019s end to know just what to do, or when to begin, and to what extent to employ their plants. But there seems to be a movement of the waters indicating considerable activity in the near future, as soon as the election is over. At any rate, we are: getting ready for a rush of business, and -hope we will not be disappointed.\u201d . &gt;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-6\">Thereupon, on November 4, 1896, the plaintiff-.'notified the defendant that he would hold the \"defendant responsible under the agreement for his damages by reason of\" the defendant\u2019s alleged breach -thereof, and the plaintiff immediately went into the market and attempted to get work for \"his shop from other parties than the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-7\">The case was. argued at the bar in October, 1898, and after-wards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-8\"><em>F.

But\" the language of the instrument indicates more.. The defendant, \"for the period of a year the beginning of which when the \"contract was made was some two months in the future, \u201c employs \u201d the plaintiff, an individual sh\u00f3p-owner, \u201c to produce certain drop forgings \u201d at his own plant and shop. The plaintiff \u201c hereby agrees to and does hereby accept said employment, and agrees to give during said period \u201d to the defendant <em>\u201c </em>the full and entire use of his said plant and shop,\u201d save one drop hammer, the use of which he reserves \u201c for forging wrench forgings only,\u201d and he also agrees to - furnish\" at -his -own expense all machinery, tools, and imple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ments, except dies, which he is to furnish at cost. Then the defendant \u201c agrees to furnish all of the steel or other material for the manufacture and product of said drop forgings, which said steel and the manufactured product therefrom, and all scrap which shall be produced by said forging, shall be and remain at all times the property of the \u201d defendant. \u201c The forgings so produced and manufactured shall be shipped \u201d as the defendant \u201c shall from time to time direct; and the scrap which shall be produced \u201d sold and its proceeds fully accounted for to the defendant. The prices to be paid for the manufacture of the forgings \u201c shall be determined from time to time by the mutual agreement of the parties hereto,\u201d and the plaintiff \u201c shall render monthly statements of account,\u201d and the defendant \u201c shall remit and pay the amount of the same on or before the tenth \u201d of the next month.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">While the true meaning of the document is not easy to determine, and depends much upon the emphasis to be given to its respective parts, a majority of the court are of the opinion that it must be so construed that under the agreed facts the plaintiff has a right of action. As we construe the language, there is in the document a positive hiring of the plaintiff by the defendant for a year, explicitly accepted by the plaintiff, and a distinct agreement that the plaintiff shall also give the defendant the full and entire use for the year of his plant and shop, reserving only the right to use one drop hammer in forging articles of but a single kind. Such language could not have been used to merely confer upon the defendant an option to have as much or as little work done at the plaintiff\u2019s shop as the defendant might choose and at prices to which the plaintiff must agree. Whatever meaning is to be given to the word \u201c certain \u201d in the phrase <em>\u201c </em>to produce certain drop forgings,\u201d it is going too far to say that it marks the contract as one meant merely to give the defendant an option. The rest of the instrument, as the part already considered, indicates that the parties expected that the shop would be operated continuously, and the contract may fairly be construed to require that it should be so operated, and that each party agreed to do what was incumbent on it to have the shop so operated. The amount of material to be furnished and the amount of product to be turned out are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>measured by the capacity of the plant and shop, \u201c the full and entire use \u201d of which is to be given to the defendant during the period. The careful provision for monthly accounts and payments is in the same direction, and could hardly have been drawn in its present form if the purpose had been merely to give an option, as the defendant contends. But the most decisive consideration is that already mentioned, that there is an employment of the plaintiff for a year, and an obligation on his part to give the defendant for the same period \u201c the full and entire use \u201d of his whole plant and shop, reserving a restricted use of a single machine only. The fact that the parties met a week after the contract was made and two months before the \u25a0 year was to begin, and then agreed upon prices to be paid for the manufacture of certain kinds of drop forgings which might be manufactured by the plaintiff for the defendant under the agreement, looks in the same direction. Construing the contract as an agreement that the defendant was bound to furnish the plaintiff, whom he had hired for a year with the use of his shop, with work during the year to the capacity of his shop, and that the parties had agreed that they would agree upon the prices to be paid, it was reasonable and necessary for them to meet at once, and before the year began, to settle a scale or list of prices. But if the contract was a mere option to be exercised by the defendant it would be unreasonable for the parties in April, 1896, to agree upon prices for work which might never be ordered, or not ordered until so remote a time as to make the prices unjust to one party or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In the opinion of a majority of the court, the proper construction of the instrument is that the defendant was bound by it to keep the plaintiff and his shop employed during the year, unless the plaintiff should upon request unreasonably refuse to come to a mutual agreement as to prices, or should otherwise break the agreement.
