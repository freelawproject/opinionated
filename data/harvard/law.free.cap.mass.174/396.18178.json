The plaintiff prays that the collector be enjoined from selling the property, and from collecting \u201c so much of said tax as is or should have been laid upon the property taken or destroyed by said city of Worcester by its said decree; that it may be declared that said board of assessors shall apportion such part of said tax as should be justly laid upon the remaining portion of the plaintiff\u2019s said estate.\u201d A temporary injunction was issued by the Superior Court, and the case was reserved upon bill and answer for the determination of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">If it be true, (which we do not decide,) that the land covered by the taking of the city made April 14, 1897, was not taxable, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was a petition for abatement, under Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7\u00a769-76, for it is admitted that the balance of the parcel of land not taken was owned by the plaintiff and was taxable. <em>Schwarz </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>151 Mass. 226. <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>152 Mass. 372, 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u25a0The plaintiff had a complete remedy at law, and there is no jurisdiction in equity to enjoin the performance by the collector of taxes of his public duty to secure payment of all taxes committed to him for collection by the assessors, <em>(Loud </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>99 Mass. 208); much less is there any jurisdiction in this court sitting in equity to reassess a tax already laid, and to determine what part \u201c should be justly laid upon the remaining portion of said real estate,\u201d as the plaintiff asks in this bill. The prayer that this court should enter a decree declaring that the board of assessors shall apportion the tax was abandoned at the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"ARq\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
