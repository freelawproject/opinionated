The Superior Court so ruled, and reported the case to the Supreme Judicial Court. See 113 Mass. 238. It was determined that the deeds did not affect the respondent\u2019s statutory right to raise his dam so as to flood above the mark fixed by them, and that the complaint under the mill act was properly brought; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>and after further hearings on the complaint, and on exceptions in this court, an order was passed on December 15, 1874, renewed on March 9, 1875, and again on July 8, 1875, for a sheriff\u2019s jury to assess the damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\">On October 11, 1875, the respondent filed a paper, reciting that he \u201c now utterly and forever refuses to have thrust or forced upon him and utterly disclaims any right whatsoever of raising the water in said mill pond \u201d above the limit named in the deeds to him, and on October 12, 1875, the order for a sheriff\u2019s jury was stricken off. On May 16, 1876, the parties made the following agreement: \u201c It is agreed that the case of Philip Brady, complainant, against Willard Blackinton he compromised as follows, viz.: \u2014 The said Blackinton shall pay the said Brady for damages to date the sum of three hundred dollars and shall also pay one half the costs of Court, as paid to the Clerk of the Court, and the cas\u00e9 shall be entered Neither Party.\u201d These sums were paid, and at the June term, 1876, the entry of \u201c Neither Party \u201d was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-6\">At the present trial the defendant denied that she had raised the water in her pond above the high-water mark or flowed the plaintiff\u2019s premises, except as authorized by the deeds ; but she did not set up or claim that she had flowed the plaintiff\u2019s premises under the mill act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-7\">The defendant contended, and asked the judge to rule, that if she had raised the waters in her pond above the high-water mark, and flowed the plaintiff\u2019s premises at any time and in any manner not authorized by the deeds, the plaintiff\u2019s only remedy was by complaint under the mill act; and that this action could not be maintained.

Pub. Sts. c. 190, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, 28. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Wading River Reservoir, </em>113 Mass. 235. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Blackin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>ton, </em>113 Mass. 238. The plaintiff concedes that there has been no verdict nor award, but he contends that the height to which the defendant had a right to flow under the mill act as well as under the deeds was fixed and determined by the paper filed by the predecessor in title of the defendant in the case of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Blackinton, ubi supra. </em>That was a complaint under the mill act in which the defence claimed that the defendant, under the deeds to him or otherwise, had no right to flow above the high-water mark named in the deeds. The court decided otherwise, and July 3,1875, an order for a sheriff\u2019s jury to assess damages was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\">On October 11,1875, the respondent filed the paper in which he says he \u201c now utterly and forever refuses to have thrust or forced upon him, and utterly disclaims any right whatsoever of raising the water \u201d above the limit named in the deeds to him. The order for the jury was \u201c stricken off \u201d the next day, and on May 16, 1876, the parties made the agreement of compromise which was shortly carried out, the case being disposed of by the entry of \u201c Neither Party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">In the first place the paper does not purport to be an agreement, Its language would seem to imply that the respondent did not expect an agreement, for he speaks of having the easement under the mill act \u201c thrust or forced \u201d upon him. He had been beaten in his defence upon the question of liability; the court had ruled that he had an easement under the' mill act, and he was about to face a jury upon the question of damages for that easement. He could not avoid his responsibility for the value of that easement without the consent of the complainant. The paper could not have the effect of depriving the complainant of a right which the court had just decided he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Nor was it a conveyance of the easement which the respondent had under the mill act, for it was not under seal. <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Sanford, </em>9 Met. 395. <em>Isele </em>v. <em>Schwamb, </em>131 Mass. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Nor does it appear that the complainant ever accepted the disclaimer, or in any way agreed to it, or that the subsequent settlement was based upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
