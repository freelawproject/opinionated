As bearing upon the question the judge gave an instruction to which the defendant\u2019s counsel at the close of the charge excepted. He then further instructed the jury upon this point, and the defendant\u2019s counsel said nothing further. The defendant, after verdict for the plaintiff, excepted; and the exceptions were allowed if the defendant was entitled to an exception to the part of the charge first mentioned. <em>Held, </em>that no exception was saved.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-9\">Tort, for an assault and battery.

The judge by the additional instructions cured what he supposed was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\u25a0difficulty in the mind of the defendant\u2019s counsel. In the language of Mr. Justice Knowlton in <em>McCart </em>v. Squire, 150 Mass. 484, \u201cIf the defendants\u2019 counsel still . . . intended to save an exception, it was his duty, in fairness to the plaintiff, as well as to the judge, to make known his dissent from the views last expressed by the presiding justice, and his wish to save an exception.' The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, to avoid an exception, might then have suggested some qualification of the charge, or the judge might of his own motion have given further instructions which would\u2019 have prevented the possibility of misunderstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The other exception was waived,</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
