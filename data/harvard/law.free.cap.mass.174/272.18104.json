Under the first clause Vogler agrees to assign to Taylor certain shares of the stock \u201c to be held by the said Taylor in trust for the treasury purposes of the said corporation.\u201d Then follows the clause in controversy: \u201c And the said Vogler further agrees to assign to himself and said Taylor, jointly, one thousand (1,000) shares of said stock, to be held by them under a joint trust for use and disposal as they may deem advisable for the general promotion of the interests of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The important clause of Exhibit M is the further agreement between Vogler and Taylor, \u201c that if at the end of three months from the formation of the said joint trust no disposal of the stock held thereunder shall have been made by said joint trustees, the said joint trust shall be dissolved and said shares returned to said Vogler, who shall forthwith assign three hundred (300) of said shares to said Taylor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We are of opinion that it cannot be said, as matter of law, that on the face of the agreements of April 13, 1895, the corporation is a beneficiary as to the one thousand shares, after-wards reduced to five hundred; and that the decree of the justice of the Superior Court, dismissing the bill with costs, was correct. <em>Ordered accordingly.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\"> The agreement marked Exhibit A recited that Vogler was the owner of certain letters patent, and that Taylor was to take the necessary steps for the formation of a corporation for the purpose of purchasing the patents and developing, manufacturing, and selling the inventions covered by the letters patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
