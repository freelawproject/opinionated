At the trial in the Superior \u2022 Court, before Braley, J., the defendant requested a ruling that \u201c on the pleadings, as matter of law, this action for the enticement of the plaintiff\u2019s husband by the defendant cannot be maintained.\u201d The judge refused so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-13\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions. The facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-14\"><em>G. W. </em>Anderson, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-15\"><em>S. A. </em>Fuller, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b323-16\">Lathrop, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANZ\">We do not find it necessary in this case to determine whether a woman can maintain an action against another woman for the loss of <em>consortium </em>occasioned by her husband\u2019s leaving her, as we are of opinion that the declaration in the case sets forth no cause of action, and that the judge should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>have ruled that the action could not be maintained on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The declaration charges that <em>i( </em>the defendant induced and allured the said Neville [the plaintiff\u2019s husband] from his and the plaintiff\u2019s home, and won the love and affection of the said Neville, and alienated the affection of the said Neville from the plaintiff, whereby the plaintiff has been greatly distressed in mind, and, by reason of the said Neville\u2019s alienation as aforesaid, has neglected to support and care for the plaintiff, whereby the plaintiff has suffered physically as well as mentally, and has been distressed in body and mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In this Commonwealth, alienation of affections alone is not a substantive cause of action, even where a husband brings the action, but is merely an aggravation of damages, for the loss of <em>consortium. Bigaouette </em>v. Paulet, 134 Mass. 123. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, ante, </em>287. See also <em>Lellis </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>24 Ont. App. 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The judge who tried this case was probably misled by the reporter\u2019s statement of the second count in <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Heywood, </em>121 Mass. 236. It is there said that the second count alleged \u201c that the defendant had alienated the affections of the plaintiff\u2019s wife from the plaintiff, and had enticed her to desert him.\u201d An inspection of the papers in the case shows, however, that loss of <em>consortium </em>was properly charged. It may also be said that in <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Heywood </em>no question arose on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">There is no ground for the position that in an action for unlawfully enticing away or harboring a man\u2019s wife, or even for criminal conversation, it is not necessary to allege loss of <em>consortium. </em>See <em>Winsmore </em>v. <em>Greenbank, </em>Willes, 577; <em>Guy </em>v. <em>Livesey, </em>Cro. Jac. 501; <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Scyssor, </em>Cro. Jac. 538; 2 Chit. Pl. (6th Am. ed.) 643; Oliver, Prec. (3d ed.) 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">For these reasons, without further considering the exceptions, we are of opinion that they must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
