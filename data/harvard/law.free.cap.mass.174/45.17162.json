On July 7, 1896, the plaintiffs, by leave of court, amended their writs and declarations by substituting Delmont L. Weeks as the defendant for the Nantucket Central Railroad Company. Weeks was the owner of the railroad when the labor was performed, when the statement required by the statute was filed, when the action was brought, and when the amendment was made and allowed. New summonses after the amendment were issued and served ; and they were accepted in the following words: \u201c I hereby accept service, and appear for the defendant, Delmont L. Weeks, in the within-named cases, and adopt as his answer the answer already filed in these cases. Henry S. Milton, Attorney for Delmont L.

We think the court had the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Each plaintiff had a claim against the owner of the railroad as such, for labor upon the railroad, and each sought to maintain his claim by a suit against the owner. It happened that they were mistaken as to who was the owner, and upon discovering the mistake they asked to amend by substituting the name of the real owner for the party they had supposed to be the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The cause of action was not changed, and the amendment was for the purpose of enabling them to maintain their actions against the very party whom they at the first sought to hold, namely, the owner of the road whoever he might be, or, in other words, to enable them to maintain their actions for the cause for which they were intended to be brought. Pub. Sts. c. 167, \u00a7 42. <em>Winch </em>v. Hosmer, 122 Mass. 438. In each case the entry must be, <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
