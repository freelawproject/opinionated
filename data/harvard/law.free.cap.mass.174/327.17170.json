The record further shows that the defendant appealed. This appeal was necessarily \u201cto the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>then next to be held in the same county.\u201d Pub. Sts. c. 155, \u00a7 58. This, by the St. of 1897, c. 490, \u00a7 3, was the first Monday in October. There is nothing in the record to show that he did not so appear. The only ground alleged in the motion for arrest of judgment is, that the District Court ordered him to recognize with sureties for his appearance before the Superior Court next to be holden at Worcester, on the first Monday in November, 1898, and he did so recognize. But such an error in the order of the court or in the recognizance is no ground for a motion in arrest of judgment. The case is very similar in this respect to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campion, </em>105 Mass. 184. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>11 Gray, 203; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>14 Gray, 383 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leighton, </em>7 Allen, 528; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>147 Mass. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
