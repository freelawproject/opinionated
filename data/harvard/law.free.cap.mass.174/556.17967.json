The lowering-was done by a street railway company, acting under authority of a franchise granted it by the selectmen of the defendant.' The bill of exceptions does not state when this was done, although it was stated at the argument that it was before the St. of 1898, c. 578, entitled \u201cAn Act relative to street railways.\u201d It was not disputed at the argument that the selectmen acted within their authority in granting the franchise; and it was admitted that the case did not come within the Pub. Sts. c. 52, \u00a7 15, which provide compensation in case of damages occasioned by the raising, lowering, etc., of a highway or townway. Under these circumstances we see no ground for holding the defendant liable. <em>Callender </em>v. Marsh, 1 Pick. 418. <em>Brown </em>v.
