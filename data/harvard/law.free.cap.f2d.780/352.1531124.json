The district court disputed the Secretary\u2019s conclusions, and entered summary judgment for the plaintiff. Since we conclude that this decision did not accord the appropriate deference to administrative policies in a complex area, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">The Medicare program, Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395-1395zz (West 1983), provides federal funding for medical care for the aged and disabled, and consists of two parts. Part A is an insurance program covering inpatient hospital care and extended post-hospital or home health care; it is funded by Social Security payroll contributions. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1395c-1395i-2. Part B provides insurance benefits for physician services and outpatient services and supplies: it is funded by individual premium payments and federal contributions. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1395j-1395w. This appeal involves the Part A program.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">For 1983 and earlier cost years, the Secretary reimbursed providers such as plaintiff, Butler County Memorial Hospital, for the reasonable cost of Part A services. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1395x(u), 1395x(v)(1)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute allows the Secretary to appoint a \u201cfiscal intermediary\u201d to ascertain the reasonable costs owed to providers and to process claims and disburse funds. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1395h.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Most provider costs are reimbursed at a single per diem rate, but a regulation promulgated by the Secretary allows a higher level of payment for \u201cspecial care units\u201d (SCUs). During the relevant time, it provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-17\"><em>Intensive care units, coronary care units, and other special care inpatient hospital units. </em>To be considered an intensive care unit, coronary care unit, or other special care inpatient hospital unit, the unit must be in a hospital, must be one in which the care required is extraordinary and on a concentrated and continuous basis and must be physically identifiable as separate from general patient care areas. There shall be specific written policies for each of such designated units which include, but are not limited to burn, coronary care, pulmonary care, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>trauma, and intensive care units but exclude postoperative recovery rooms, post-anesthesia recovery rooms, or maternity labor rooms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(d)(10) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In this matter, the fiscal intermediary, Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania, determined that costs incurred by a certain unit in the Butler Hospital should be reimbursed at the lower level in the 1980 cost year and not as an SCU. Blue Cross decided that the hospital\u2019s \u201cMaxicare Unit\u201d (MCU) met all of the regulatory requirements for SCUs, except that the care provided was not \u201cextraordinary, concentrated and continuous.\u201d This decision decreased the hospital\u2019s claimed reimbursement by $45,000 in the 1980 cost year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hospital first appealed to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, which affirmed the intermediary, and then to the Deputy Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, who also affirmed. The decision of the Deputy Administrator represents the final position of the Secretary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(1) (West Supp. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The Deputy Administrator wrote that the regulatory terms do not lend themselves to precise definition, thus in determining whether a unit qualifies as an SCU the specific types of SCUs enumerated in the regulation should be used as points of reference. The Secretary\u2019s position is that the intensity of care provided by an SCU should not only be significantly greater than routine care but also \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as that provided in the other types of units mentioned in \u00a7 405.-452(d)(10). In applying this standard, the Secretary considered evidence relating to the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit (ICU) and found that the care provided there was substantially more intensive than MCU care. In reversing this decision, the district court rejected the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the regulation. It decided that the only relevant question was whether the MCU\u2019s services were extraordinary, concentrated and continuous, and that comparison with other SCUs was irrelevant. It further held that the MCU met the regulatory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">This Court\u2019s role is not to impose its own interpretation of the SCU regulation, but instead to defer to the Secretary\u2019s position so long as it is reasonable. <em>Presinzano v. Hoffman La Roche, Inc., </em>726 F.2d 105, 111 (3d Cir.1984). The reference in the provision to \u201cextraordinary, concentrated and continuous care\u201d does not lend itself to easy definition, and \u201ca court must necessarily look to the administrative construction of the regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945). That construction controls \u201cunless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Id.; United States v. Lario-noff </em>431 U.S. 864, 872, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 2155, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">In addition, the provision permitting judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s Medicare determinations requires that such review be conducted in accord with the Administrative Procedure Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(1) (West Supp.1985). That statute requires that a court uphold agency policies, including those pronounced in adjudications such as that at issue here, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551(13), 701 (1982), unless they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 706(2)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We must there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>fore accept the agency\u2019s view so long as the \u201cinterpretation is within the range of reasonable meanings that the words of the regulation admit.\u201d <em>Psychiatric Institute of Washington, D.C., Inc. v. Schweiker, </em>669 F.2d 812, 818-14 (D.C.Cir.1981) (per curiam); <em>see Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 566, 100 S.Ct. 790, 797, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Such deference is especially appropriate here, where the Secretary\u2019s resolution involves a complex scheme of reimbursement for a sizable number of medical procedures. Legislators and judges are not medical specialists, and for that reason it is necessary that administrative agencies develop and apply medical expertise. Accordingly, Congress described only sparsely the means of assessing reasonable costs owed to Medicare providers, and instead assigned the primary responsibility for such assessments to the Secretary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(1)(A) (1982); <em>see also id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1395g(a), 1395hh. We must be cautious lest we disturb this appropriate allocation of governmental functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Turning to the proper interpretation of the SCU regulation, we note first that this Court has had two opportunities to assess the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the SCU regulation, and its summary affirmances in those cases bred some confusion. In <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital of Bethlehem, Pa. v. Schweiker, </em>[1981-2 Transfer Binder] Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 31,501 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 12, 1981), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>688 F.2d 824 (3d Cir.1982), the district court rejected the Secretary\u2019s contention that care provided in a proposed SCU should be \u201cequal\u201d to that provided in recognized SCUs, and reversed the administrative refusal to recognize a particular hospital unit as an SCU. Later, in <em>Metropolitan Hospital v. Provider Reimbursement Review Board, </em>[1983-2 Transfer Binder] Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) 1133, 101 (E.D.Pa. July 11, 1983), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>735 F.2d 1350 (3d Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 781, 83 L.Ed.2d 775 (1985), the district court upheld the Secretary\u2019s comparison of a hospital\u2019s MCU with other SCUs in the facility, and its denial of SCU status to a provider. The district court cited <em>Saint Luke\u2019s, </em>however, and agreed with its decision that a strict equality test is \u201cunsupported by the statutory language.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Hospital, </em>1133, 101 at 10538 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">The Secretary now insists that both eases comport with her current interpretation that proposed SCUs be \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as others listed in the regulation. This appears to be a fair characterization of the cases, and also a permissible interpretation of the regulation. As the court observed in <em>John Muir Memorial Hospital, Inc. v. Schweiker, </em>664 F.2d 1337 (9th Cir.1981), the terms \u201cextraordinary, concentrated and continuous\u201d do not lend themselves to a ready medical definition. In view of its ambiguity, the regulation may reasonably be perceived as <em>ejusdem generis, </em>limiting its coverage to units similar to those enumerated specifically in the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Indeed, every appellate court to address this issue has supported the Secretary's present position. <em>Carraway Methodist Hospital Center v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 1006, 1009-10 (11th Cir.1985) (SCUs must be \u201csubstantially the same\u201d); <em>NKC, Inc. v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>747 F.2d 1100, 1101-02 (6th Cir.1984) (\u201csame level of care\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 2019, 85 L.Ed.2d 301 (1985); <em>St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital of Boston v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>746 F.2d 918, 919 (1st Cir.1984) (per curiam) (comparisons may be used as guidance); <em>Lexington County Hospital v. Schweiker, </em>740 F.2d 287, 290 (4th Cir.1984) (\u201cspecial care status was reserved for units that were equivalent to an intensive care unit.\u201d); <em>Villa View Community Hospital, Inc. v. Heckler, </em>728 F.2d 539, 541 (D.C.Cir.1984 (per curiam) (care is \u201csimilar\u201d); <em>Community Hospital of Indianapolis v. Schweiker, </em>717 F.2d 372, 376 (7th Cir.1983) (care need not be identical but should be comparable); <em>Sun Towers, Inc. v. Schweiker, </em>694 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>1036, 1038 (5th Cir.1983) (comparison is permissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In sum, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is reasonable and the district court erred in rejecting it and imposing the court\u2019s own view. Further, public policy favors consistent, nationwide application of rules in social welfare programs, and thus this Court should be reluctant to contradict the unanimous position of other circuits. Finally, Congress itself gave the Secretary broad discretion to determine the reasonable cost of provided services, and it cannot be said that the agency\u2019s practice is at odds with this directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The hospital argues that even if its Maxi-care Unit must be compared with its recognized SCU, the intensive care unit, the Secretary\u2019s finding of an unfavorable comparison is not supported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">According to the hospital, its MCU provided care in 1980 that was extraordinary, concentrated and continuous within the Secretary\u2019s definition, in that it was identical to that offered in the ICU. The units were housed next to each other, and apart from the routine care areas of the hospital. Patients in need of constant and strict medical supervision were admitted to the units interchangeably unless they required one of two specialized procedures. Specialized emergency equipment and medication were available to both units and were also used interchangeably. Nurses received the same specialized training for critical care and could serve in either unit. Further, the same severe restrictions on activities and possessions applied to patients in both units.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The hospital also points to certain statistics to support its case. It notes that over 90% of MCU patients were transferred to routine care before being discharged from the hospital, suggesting that the MCU served only critically ill persons. In addition, the average stays in the ICU and MCU in 1980 were comparable (ICU, 27.6 days; MCU, 24.57 days; routine, 7.19 days). While not all of the 19 beds in the MCU could be viewed from a central nursing station, as was possible in the 10-bed ICU, nearly every occupied MCU bed was monitored continuously by telemetry equipment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Moreover, the hospital refers to the fact that the MCU met all SCU requirements established by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals, and that the state approved an SCU designation under a regulation almost identical to the federal provision. Finally, two experts \u2014 the hospital\u2019s Critical Care Division nursing director, and a private physician experienced in critical care \u2014 testified that the units were essentially identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">Despite this evidence, the Deputy Administrator stressed differences between the MCU and ICU. He declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-14\">The Provider asserts that, except for two specialized procedures, patients were admitted interchangeably to the MCU or ICU. The Deputy Administrator believes that this assertion is a subjective conclusion of the provider\u2019s witnesses, which does not appear to be supported by objective observations such as nurse-to-patient ratio, per diem costs, and patient transfer statistics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">The ratio of patient hours to nursing hours was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-16\">ICU 1.49 to 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-17\">MCU 2.17 to 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-18\">Routine 4.83 to 1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-19\">The costs per patient day were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-20\">ICU $271.67</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-21\">MCU 153.09</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-22\">Routine 92.25</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-23\">As for patient transfers, records indicate that 30% of all MCU admissions were patients from the ICU and that 45% of all patients discharged by the ICU entered the MCU. According to the Secretary, all of these statistics indicate that care in the MCU was less intensive, and that the MCU <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>served as a \u201cstep-down unit\u201d providing intermediate care.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">This record would appear to provide substantial evidence supporting the Secretary\u2019s ruling, given the judicial deference to be accorded to her authority. Although the intensity of care in the MCU is closer to that offered in the ICU than that provided elsewhere in the hospital, there is a clear distinction between the two units. The 77% increase in costs per day in the ICU as compared to the MCU is especially persuasive, so the Court will defer to the Secretary\u2019s medical expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The hospital itself did not argue or produce witnesses who testified that the difference in these statistics is irrelevant. Instead, it insisted, and the district court agreed, that other factors explain the discrepancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">There was greater staffing of nurses in the ICU, maintains the hospital, because nurses there were on 24-hour call for cardiac emergencies throughout the hospital. In addition, two specialized procedures \u2014 arterial pressure monitoring and insertion of temporary cardiac pacemakers \u2014 were performed only in the ICU and required the services of three nurses for up to an hour.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The costs were higher in the ICU, the hospital asserts, because of the special procedures,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and because each bed in the ICU occupied more space than an MCU bed and was therefore assigned a higher proportion of the hospital\u2019s capital costs. The hospital also claims that transfers were made from the ICU to the MCU not because the standard of care was different, but in order to make room in the ICU for patients requiring special procedures. In addition, patients were transferred from intensive care in order to provide a psychological boost.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">No evidence in the record, however, supports any of these contentions. In civil litigation, the burden of proving a fact generally rests with the party asserting its existence. This is especially true where the material necessary to buttress the proposition lies particularly within the knowledge of that party. <em>See Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, </em>512 F.2d 527, 538 (D.C.Cir.1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>426 U.S. 290, 96 S.Ct. 1978, 48 L.Ed.2d 643 (1976). Here, the hospital\u2019s assertions are based on empirical data, but it has provided no statistical corroboration and has relied simply on the testimony of its medical staff. Consequently, the hospital\u2019s proffer is insufficient to meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">The record presented to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board contains no evidence showing that the difference between nurse/patient ratios in the MCU and in the ICU is attributable to the ICU nurses\u2019 duties elsewhere in the hospital or in the special procedures. Notably, there are no documents showing how many patients receive the special procedures or their cost, so the hospital\u2019s claims concerning patient costs and transfers cannot be verified. Further, although the record contains several hundred pages of financial records and other data, it is not possible to determine from them how much of the cost differential is owing to the different size of the units. Nothing in the record explains how costs are apportioned on the basis of square footage, and indeed there is little data showing the assignment of costs to the MCU.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">Thus, the hospital has not met its burden, and on this record the Secretary\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">The district court impermissibly made its own assessment that the MCU met the regulatory definition, and forgave the hospital for statistical differences between the MCU and ICU by accepting its testimony concerning proof not in the record. These rulings were clearly erroneous. The judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ment therefore will be vacated and the case remanded with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-12\">. The reimbursement aspect of Medicare disbursements has been abandoned for post-1983 cost years. The Secretary now makes \"prospective payment\u201d for reasonable costs based on patient diagnoses, rather than the costs actually incurred by providers. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww (West 1983). This new statutory scheme is not at issue in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\">. Only the 1980 cost year is before the Court. The SCU regulation was amended shortly thereafter, and the hospital concedes that its MCU does not qualify for the subsequent years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\">. Plaintiff argues that since the Secretary recognized the MCU as an SCU until the 1980 cost year, the administrative position in this record is not entitled to deference. But an agency is entitled to change course, and as long as it adequately explains its new position that view will be accorded deference. <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v.
