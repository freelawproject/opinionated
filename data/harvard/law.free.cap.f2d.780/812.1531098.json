BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">Alfonso Calderon appeals the decision of the Railroad Retirement Board which affirmed the appeals referee\u2019s decision that June 19, 1982 was the beginning date of Calderon\u2019s disability annuity. We affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">On November 23, 1981, Calderon was disqualified from railroad service pending a medical evaluation. Disputing the disqualification, he applied for unemployment benefits. Calderon was thereafter recalled to work in June 1982, working from June 16 to June 18 and receiving $249.21 in compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-18\">On September 2, 1982, Calderon filed an application for a disability annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, et seq.). An accompanying statement alleged that his disability began in November 1981. The Bureau of Retirement Claims granted his request for an annuity on November 22,1982, but because of the three-day work period in June 1982, made the annuity effective June 19, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-19\">Calderon appealed the decision on May 2, 1983, contending that his annuity should have commenced on November 23, 1981, the date of his disability. His request for a hearing was denied because no factual issues were deemed to be in controversy. The appeals referee affirmed the June 19, 1982 date as the earliest date Calderon\u2019s annuity could begin. The Railroad Retirement Board affirmed and adopted the decision of the appeals referee. Calderon then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-20\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b899-21\">This court will not set aside a decision of the Board \u201cif it is supported by substantial evidence, is not arbitrary and has a reasonable basis in law.\u201d <em>Akins v. Railroad Retirement Board, </em>721 F.2d 652, 653 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Lowe v. Railroad Retirement Board, </em>294 F.2d 115,116 (9th Cir.1961) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-22\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b899-23\">Calderon\u2019s employer reported that it paid Calderon $249.21 in compensation for one month of service in 1982 and that the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>he last worked was June 18, 1982. The Railroad Retirement Act provides that an annuity shall begin \u201cnot earlier than ... the date following the last day of compensated services of the applicant.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231d (a)(iii). Calderon does not dispute the fact that he worked from June 15,1982, to June 18, 1982. He does, however, allege that the three-day period was only a \u201ctrial work period\u201d and, therefore, did not change his date of disability. Calderon, while admitting that there is no trial work provision in the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA), argues that this court should look to the Social Security Act for disability guidelines. We decline to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Congress, when passing the RRA, provided for occupational disability annuities. In so doing, Congress enacted provisions to define the qualifications and conditions of awarding such annuities. Nothing is mentioned regarding a trial work period and this court does not have the power to amend an act of Congress to provide such a work period. <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>442 U.S. 544, 99 S.Ct. 2470, 61 L.Ed.2d 68 (1979). Justice Marshall, speaking for a unanimous court in <em>Rutherford, </em>442 U.S. 544, 99 S.Ct. 2470, 61 L.Ed.2d 68 (1979), stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-5\">Under our constitutional framework, federal courts do not sit as councils of revision, empowered to rewrite legislation in accord with their own conceptions of prudent public policy. See <em>Anderson v. Wilson, </em>289 U.S. 20, 27, 77 L.Ed. 1004, 53 S.Ct. 417 [420] (1933). Only when a literal construction of a statute yields results so manifestly unreasonable that they could not fairly be attributed to congressional design will an exception to statutory language be judicially implied. See <em>TVA v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. [153] at 187-88, 57 L.Ed.2d 117, 98 S.Ct. 2279 [2298 (1978)]. Here, however, we have no license to depart from the plain language of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 555, 99 S.Ct. at 2477.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">This court must look to the RRA to determine when Calderon\u2019s annuity begins. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231d(a) provides that \u201c... an annuity ... shall begin with the month in which eligibility therefor was otherwise acquired, but ... not earlier than ... the date following the last day of compensated service of the applicant.\u201d \u201cCompensation\u201d is defined in 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231(h)(1) as \u201cany form of money remuneration paid to an individual for services rendered as an employee to one or more employers____\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231(d)(1) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-11\">\u201cAn individual is in the service of an employer whether his service is rendered within or without the United States if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-12\">(i) (A) he is subject to the continuing authority of the employer to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his service, or (B) he is rendering professional or technical services and is integrated into the staff of the employer, or (C) he is rendering, on the property used in the employer\u2019s operations, personal services the rendition of which is integrated into the employer\u2019s operations; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-13\">(ii) he renders such service for compensation, or a method of computing the monthly compensation for such service is provided in section 231b(j) of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">Based on the foregoing facts and statutes, it is clear that Calderon\u2019s disability annuity cannot begin until after his last day of compensated service: June 18, 1985. This court is satisfied upon the record that the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, was not arbitrary, and had a reasonable basis in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">The decision of the Board is</p>\n<p id=\"Aj_\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">. We disagree with the dissent's argument that in this case we should look to cases interpreting the Social Security Act. The dissent bases this argument on the similarity of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(4)(A) of the SSA and 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(e)(3) of the RRA. This section of the RRA speaks of an individual already in receipt of an annuity when compensated service is rendered. Calderon, at the time he rendered compensated service, was not yet in receipt of an annuity. Therefore, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(e)(3) of the RRA is not applicable to the case at hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>PREGERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Neither the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) nor the regulations promulgated thereunder expressly provide for a \u201ctrial work period.\u201d But the RRA does provide: \u201cNo annuity under subsection (a)(1) of [section 231a] ... shall be paid with respect to any month in which an individual in receipt of an annuity ... thereunder shall render compensated service to an employer____\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(e)(3). Thus, once an annuity begins, compensated service during a trial work period only <em>suspends </em>the disabled employee\u2019s entitlement to the annuity for any month during which such service is rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">The Social Security Act (SSA), however, expressly provides for a period of trial work for disabled individuals. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(4)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The underlying principle of the SSA\u2019s \u201ctrial work period\u201d is that services performed during that period are \u201cdeemed not to have been rendered for the purpose of determining whether the individual\u2019s disability ceased.\u201d <em>Parish v. Cali-fano, </em>642 F.2d 188, 193 (6th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(4)(A) of the SSA and 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(e)(3) of the RRA are functionally parallel provisions because both deal with the effect of trial work upon entitlement to disability benefits. Because these parallel provisions are directed at the same underlying problem regarding suspension of disability payments during trial work periods, we should look to social security cases to guide us in determining Congress\u2019s intent as it relates to the instant railroad retirement case. <em>See Estes v. Railroad Retirement Board, </em>776 F.2d 1436, 1438 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Burleson v. Railroad Retirement Board, </em>711 F.2d 861, 862 (8th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">The \u201ctrial work period\u201d expressly provided by section 1382c(a)(4)(A) of the SSA allows for a trial work period of up to nine months <em>after </em>an application for disability is filed. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1592(e); <em>Parish, </em>642 F.2d at 193. In considering the rationale that underlies section 1382c(a)(4)(A), the Sixth Circuit in <em>Parish </em>held that \u201c[i]t would be reasonable to apply the same principle to an attempt to work <em>before </em>filing an application for benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) Unsuccessful trial work <em>before </em>applying for social security benefits, therefore, is also deemed not to have been rendered for the purpose of determining when an individual is entitled to disability payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">The reasoning of <em>Parish </em>is persuasive and should be applied in the instant case. <em>Cf. Estes, </em>776 F.2d 1436, 1438-39 (following <em>Parish </em>in holding that employment of a multiple sclerosis victim during a remission period did not constitute \u201csubstantial gainful employment\u201d under the RRA disability provisions). Like trial work, an individual\u2019s compensated service rendered <em>before </em>applying for RRA benefits should not, under the <em>Parish </em>rationale, control whether the individual\u2019s disability had in fact ceased. Consequently, Calderon\u2019s three-day trial work period in June 1982 should indicate nothing about whether his disability had actually ceased at that time. To start Calderon\u2019s annuity on June 19, 1982 because he rendered compensated service for three days would use the \u201ccompensated service\u201d language of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231d(a)(iii) to determine, in effect, that Calderon\u2019s disability had ceased before that date. Because the referee acknowledged that Calderon\u2019s disability began in November 1981, to deny Calderon annuity payments from that time would treat \u201ccompensated service\u201d during the trial work period as a determination that his disability had actually ceased before June 1982, whereas the contrary is in fact true. This, I submit, is not a reasonably legitimate construction of the operative statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-16\">The Board\u2019s decision to start Calderon\u2019s annuity on the day following his three days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>of trial work in June 1982 is based on a technical reading of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231d(a)(iii), and is at odds with the case law developed under the analogous SSA provision. Moreover, the Board\u2019s decision penalizes the conscientious employee who tries to handle his or her old job but is thwarted by disability. Finally, the Board\u2019s decision frustrates federal policy of assisting the disabled. The Board\u2019s decision should therefore be reversed. The annuity, after deducting proper set-offs, should be computed as of November 23, 1981, the date Calderon became disabled from further railroad service.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-12\">.
