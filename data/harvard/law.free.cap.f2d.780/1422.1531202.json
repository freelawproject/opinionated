For the reasons stated below, we hold that the factual allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action under section 1983 for infringement of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional right of access to the courts and that such a claim is not barred by res judicata, but that the complaint fails to state a cause of action under section 1985. We therefore reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand this cause to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-12\">This action arises out of the same factual scenario as <em>Collier v. City of Springdale, </em>733 F.2d 1311 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>105 S. Ct. 186 (1984). For purposes of brevity, we simply will refer to <em>Collier </em>for a concise statement of the general factual background. <em>See </em>733 F.2d at 1312. Drawing on the allegations of the complaint, we will state additional facts pertinent to the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-16\">The Harrisons own a blueberry farm in Springdale, Arkansas. Their property is located near a creek into which raw sewage from the Bradshaw sewer lift station is discharged whenever the lift station fails to handle the flow of sewage. In July 1980 the lift station failed, resulting in the discharge of raw sewage into the creek. The sewage entered the groundwater and polluted the Harrisons\u2019 only sources of irrigation water for their blueberry crop \u2014 their well and the creek. A city investigation confirmed that the discharged sewage surfaced in the Harrisons\u2019 well, resulting in damage to their blueberry crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-20\">In August 1982 the Harrisons filed suit in the Chancery Court of Washington County, Arkansas against the Springdale Water and Sewer Commission (Commission) for injunctive relief and damages resulting from the sewage discharge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission is a public agency created by the City of Springdale, Arkansas (City), and, pursuant to its authority, operates and maintains the sewer system and the Bradshaw lift station. The Harrisons allege that after they filed their suit the three members of the Commission \u2014 Walter Turn-bow, Larry Clinkscales, and Harold Henson \u2014 conspired to force the Harrisons to sell their property to the City in order to eliminate their complaints regarding sewage discharges. The City made a written offer to purchase the Harrisons\u2019 property for $67,500 and threatened to condemn their property if the offer was not accepted. The Harrisons rejected the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-21\">In March 1983 the Commission filed a counterclaim in the pending chancery court action to condemn the Harrisons\u2019 property and recorded a lis pendens. When the Commission filed its counterclaim, it had an engineer\u2019s report indicating that the sewage discharge and overflow problem could be resolved without acquiring additional property. It is alleged, however, that the Commissioners conspired with the consulting engineers to fabricate a need to condemn the Harrisons\u2019 property. It is further alleged that the Commissioners, at a special meeting on June 6, 1983, adopted the fabricated need, ratified their prior malicious and unlawful acts, and instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>their attorneys to proceed with the condemnation counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-4\">On July 14, 1983 a hearing was held by the chancellor to determine whether the Commission\u2019s proposed taking of the Harri-sons\u2019 property was necessary and whether it was for a public purpose. During the hearing, Commissioner Clinkscales and the Commission\u2019s attorney, W.H. Taylor, admitted that the condemnation counterclaim was filed only as a tactical measure to pressure the Harrisons to settle their damage claim against the Commission. The Harrisons also allege that, in furtherance of the conspiracy, an employee of the engineering consulting firm testified falsely at the hearing that the City needed the Harri-sons\u2019 property for sewer improvements. The chancellor dismissed the counterclaim without prejudice in January 1984 on the ground that there was no public purpose for the taking. Nevertheless, it is alleged, the Commission continued its conspiracy by appealing the chancellor\u2019s dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Harrisons then filed this action on February 15, 1984 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-5\">The Harrisons allege that the Commission\u2019s actions were an arbitrary and malicious abuse of power and that the individual Commissioners and the engineers conspired to use their power as public officials \u201cto punish those citizens who seek justice in the courts,\u201d in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 &amp; 1985. The Harrisons further allege that the City and the Commission are immune from suit under Arkansas law and that their only remedy is a federal civil rights action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-6\">The City, after filing its answer to the complaint, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and for the first time raised the affirmative defense of res judicata as to the Harrisons\u2019 conspiracy claim. The City argued that such a claim should have been asserted as a compulsory counterclaim under Arkansas law and that the Harrisons\u2019 failure to assert it in the state court action barred them from asserting it in the present federal court action. The City apparently construed the complaint as alleging a conspiracy claim only under section 1985. Likewise, the City apparently construed the complaint to allege a section 1983 claim only for a taking without just compensation, and argued that this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Collier </em>mandated that the section 1983 claim be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-12\">The District Court agreed with both of the City\u2019s contentions and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The court read the complaint as alleging a section 1983 claim only on the theory of a taking without just compensation, and dismissed that claim on the authority of <em>Collier. </em>As to the section 1985 claim, the court noted that the Harrisons had relied upon a conspiracy theory in defending against the state court condemnation counterclaim, and that such a claim constituted a compulsory counterclaim in the state action under Rule 13 of the Arkansas Rules of Civil Procedure. The court noted further that even if the Harrisons did not become aware of the conspiracy until the evidence was developed in the state action, they should have amended their pleadings to conform to the procf. Since the Harrisons \u201chad a full and fair opportunity to develop this theory in state court,\u201d the District Court held that \u201cthe result therein is res judicata as to the issues raised in the instant action.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Springdale Water and Sewer Commission, </em>No. 84-5018 (W.D.Ark. Sept. 26, 1984) (order granting motion to dismiss).</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-14\">In reviewing the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim, we follow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>\u201caccepted rule\u201d that a complaint should not be dismissed \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-02, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). We must assume the plaintiffs factual allegations to be true and must view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>See May v. Commissioner, </em>752 F.2d 1301, 1303 (8th Cir.1985). Moreover, a complaint should not be dismissed \u201cmerely because a plaintiff\u2019s allegations do not support the particular legal theory he advances, for the court is under a duty to examine the complaint to determine if the allegations provide for relief on any possible theory.\u201d <em>Chapman v. Musich, </em>726 F.2d 405, 408 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 325, 83 L.Ed.2d 262 (1984) (quoting <em>Thomas W. Garland, Inc. v. City of St. Louis, </em>596 F.2d 784, 787 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 899, 100 S.Ct. 208, 62 L.Ed.2d 135 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-6\">After reviewing the complaint, we hold that the Harrisons have sufficiently stated a cause of action under section 1983 for infringement of their constitutional right of access to the courts, that they have not stated a cause of action under section 1985, and that the present action is not precluded under Arkansas law by virtue of the prior state court proceeding. We turn now to discuss each of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-14\">\u201c[I]n any \u00a7 1983 action the initial inquiry must focus on whether the two essential elements to a \u00a7 1983 action are present: (1) whether the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) whether this conduct deprived a person of rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 535, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1912, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1512-15\">As was true in <em>Collier, </em>\u201cit is clear that the alleged conduct of the City and the Commission satisfies the \u2018under the color of state law' requirement and therefore we must only decide whether [the Harrisons] ha[ve] been deprived of a right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Collier, </em>733 F.2d at 1313.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1512-16\">In their brief the Harrisons concede that the District Court was correct in dismissing their claim for a taking without just compensation on the authority of <em>Collier. </em>In <em>Collier, </em>this Court held that the availability of a state post-taking remedy for compensating property owners whose property had been taken for public use<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> precludes a section 1983 action premised on a \u201ctaking\u201d theory. Since the taking was not \u201cwithout just compensation,\u201d the property owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>had failed to state a claim under section 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 1316-17.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1513-5\">We thus agree with the District Court that the Harrisons\u2019 \u201ctaking\u201d claim was not cognizable under section 1983. That does not mean, however, that the factual allegations in the complaint fail to state a claim under section 1983 on any other theory. As noted above, the complaint should not be dismissed if the factual allegations state a claim under any theory, even though not one advanced by the plaintiff. A review of the complaint leads us to the conclusion that the Harrisons have sufficiently stated a cause of action under section 1983 for infringement of their constitutional right of access to the courts, in violation of their First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances, as applied to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-6\">The present case presents a somewhat novel context in which the constitutional right of access to the courts is implicated. Most of the cases involving this right have arisen in the context of a prisoner\u2019s right of access to the courts. <em>See, e.g., Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977); <em>Sanders v. St. Louis County, </em>724 F.2d 665 (8th Cir.1983); <em>Garland v. Polley, </em>594 F.2d 1220 (8th Cir.1979); <em>Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex v. Greenholtz, </em>436 F.Supp. 432 (D.Neb.1976), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>567 F.2d 1381 (8th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 841, 99 S.Ct. 132, 58 L.Ed.2d 140 (1978). The applications of constitutional rights, however, do not remain static. Clear precedent exists indicating that the constitutional right of access extends to the circumstances in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-13\">The United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[t]he right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition.\u201d <em>California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, </em>404 U.S. 508, 510, 92 S.Ct. 609, 611, 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1972).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court has noted that the right to petition is \u201camong the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights,\u201d <em>United Mine Workers v. Illinois State Bar Association, </em>389 U.S. 217, 222, 88 S.Ct. 353, 356, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967), and that it has \u201ca sanctity and a sanction not permitting dubious intrusions,\u201d <em>Thomas v. Collins, </em>323 U.S. 516, 530, 65 S.Ct. 315, 322, 89 L.Ed. 430 (1945). As an aspect of the First Amendment right to petition, the right of access to the courts shares this \u201cpreferred place\u201d in our hierarchy of constitutional freedoms and values.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-14\">It has been noted in this Circuit that \u201caccess to the courts is a fundamental right of every citizen.\u201d <em>Greenholtz, </em>436 F.Supp. at 436.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An individual\u2019s eonstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>tional right of access to the courts \u201ccannot be impaired, either directly ... or indirectly, by threatening or harassing an [individual] in retaliation for filing lawsuits. It is not necessary that the [individual] succumb entirely or even partially to the threat as long as the threat or retaliatory act was intended to limit the [individual\u2019s] right of access.\u201d <em>Sanders, </em>724 F.2d at 666. The cases from this Circuit, as well as from others, make it clear that state officials may not take retaliatory action against an individual designed either to punish him for having exercised his constitutional right to seek judicial relief or to intimidate or chill his exercise of that right in the future. <em>See, e.g., id.; Garland, </em>594 F.2d at 1223; <em>Hall v. Sutton, </em>755 F.2d 786, 787 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Matzker v. Herr, </em>748 F.2d 1142, 1150-51 (7th Cir.1984) (\u201cAn act taken in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutionally protected right is actionable under \u00a7 1983 even if the act, when taken for a different reason, would have been proper.\u201d); <em>Lamar v. Steele, </em>693 F.2d 559, 562 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 821, 104 S.Ct. 86, 78 L.Ed.2d 95 (1983); <em>Milhouse v. Carlson, </em>652 F.2d 371, 374 (3d Cir.1981); <em>Silver v. Cormier, </em>529 F.2d 161, 163 (10th Cir.1976).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An individual is entitled to \u201cfree and unhampered access to the courts.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Cleggett v. Pate, </em>229 F.Supp. 818, 821-22 (N.D.Ill.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-7\">We believe that the factual allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a claim under section 1983 for infringement of the Harrisons\u2019 constitutional right of access to the courts. The Harrisons have alleged that they filed suit in state court against the Commission and the City, and that the defendants conspired to force them to settle their lawsuit and to sell their property to the City by filing a frivolous condemnation counterclaim. The complaint states that, \u201cOne of the defendants, Larry Clinkscales, a commissioner, and the City\u2019s attorney, Mr. W.H. Taylor, admitted that the condemnation claim was filed as a tactical move to put pressure on the Harrisons to settle their damage claim against the City. The City had no plan for using the Harrisons\u2019 property at the time the counterclaim was filed.\u201d Complaint at 4, \u00b6 15. The real gist of the Harrisons\u2019 complaint is found in their statement that \u201cif public officials are allowed to use that power [of eminent domain] to punish those citizens who seek justice in the courts, then the courts and justice will be denied to many citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, \u00b6 21. If such allegations are proved at trial, the Harrisons are entitled to recover damages for infringement of their constitutional right of access to the courts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-4\">In general terms, section 1985 proscribes five different types of conspiracies: (1) conspiracies to interfere with the performance of official duties by federal officers (section 1985(1)); (2) conspiracies to interfere with the administration of justice in federal courts (first clause of section 1985(2)); (3) conspiracies to interfere with the administration of justice in state courts (second clause of section 1985(2)); (4) private conspiracies to deny any person enjoyment of \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d and \u201cequal privileges and immunities under the laws\u201d (first clause of section 1985(3)); and (5) conspiracies to interfere with the right to support candidates in federal elections (second clause of section 1985(3)). <em>See Kush v. Rutledge, </em>460 U.S. 719, 724, 103 S.Ct. 1483, 1487, 75 L.Ed.2d 413 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-5\">As noted in <em>Kush, </em>three of the five categories \u2014 the first, second and fifth \u2014 relate to federal institutions and processes. <em>Id. </em>Because the Harrisons have alleged no federal involvement with the conspiracy, any claim under section 1985 must fall within either the third or the fourth category. Moreover, because the Harrisons do not allege that they were members of a class which suffers from invidious discrimination, they have failed to state a claim under the fourth category. <em>See Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 1798, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, we must determine only whether the complaint states a claim under the third category, <em>i.e., </em>the second clause of section 1985(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This issue is apparently one of first impression in this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-7\">All of the circuits that have addressed the issue have uniformly held that the \u201cequal protection\u201d language of the second clause of section 1985(2) requires an allegation (and proof) of class-based animus. <em>See Bretz v. Kelman, </em>773 F.2d 1026, 1028-30 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Kimble v. D.J. McDuffy, Inc., </em>648 F.2d 340, 343-44 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1110, 102 S.Ct. 687, 70 L.Ed.2d 651 (1981); <em>Williams v. St. Joseph Hospital, </em>629 F.2d 448, 451 (7th Cir.1980); <em>Dacey v. Dorsey, </em>568 F.2d 275, 277 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 906, 98 S.Ct. 2238, 56 L.Ed.2d 405 (1978); <em>Brawer v. Horowitz, </em>535 F.2d 830, 840 (3d Cir.1976); <em>Hahn v. Sargent, </em>523 F.2d 461, 469 (1st Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 1495, 47 L.Ed.2d 754 (1976); <em>see also Jones v. United States, </em>536 F.2d 269, 271 (8th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1039, 97 S.Ct. 735, 50 L.Ed.2d 750 (1977) (obiter dictum). We agree with the reasoning and holding of those courts that an allegation of class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus is required to state a claim under the second clause of section 1985(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-8\">The Court in <em>Griffin, </em>in construing the first clause of section 1985(3), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1515-9\">The language requiring intent to deprive of <em>equal </em>protection, or <em>equal </em>privileges and immunities, means that there must be some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators\u2019 action. The conspiracy, in other words, must aim at a deprivation of the equal enjoyment of rights secured by the law to all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>403 U.S. at 102, 91 S.Ct. at 1798 (emphasis in original). After examining the legislative history of section 1985, the Court noted that a contrary construction of this clause would have presented serious constitutional problems by creating a \u201cgeneral federal tort law\u201d against any private tor-tious conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>The Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Griffin </em>under the first clause of section 1985(3) applies equally as well to the second clause of section 1985(2). The \u201cequal protection\u201d language appears in both clauses, and only in these two clauses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As noted in <em>Kush, </em>these two clauses \u201cencompass underlying activity that is not institutionally linked to federal interests and that is usually of primary state con-cern____ Each of these portions of the statute contains language requiring that the conspirators\u2019 actions be motivated by an intent to deprive their victims of the equal protection of the laws.\u201d 460 U.S. at 725, 103 S.Ct. at 1487.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-5\">The Court in <em>Kush </em>explained why class-based animus was not required under the first clause of section 1985(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1516-6\">First, the scope of the <em>Griffin </em>opinion [was] carefully confined to [the \u201cequal protection\u201d language in the first clause of \u00a7 1985(3)]____ Second, the analysis in the <em>Griffin </em>opinion relied heavily on the fact that the sponsors of the 1871 bill added the \u201cequal protection\u201d language in response to objections that the \u201cenormous sweep of the original language\u201d vastly extended federal authority and disrupted state control over private conduct. That legislative background does not apply to portions of the statute that prohibit interference with federal officers, federal courts, or federal elections. Third, and of greatest importance, the statutory language that provides the textual basis for the \u201cclass-based, invidiously discriminatory animus\u201d requirement simply does not appear in the portion of the statute that applies to this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1516-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 726, 103 S.Ct. at 1488 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-12\">We agree with the Ninth Circuit that \u201c[t]he reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Kush </em>compels the conclusion that an allegation of class-based animus is an essential requirement of a claim under the second clause of \u00a7 1985(2).\u201d <em>Bretz, </em>773 F.2d at 1029 (footnote omitted). Because the Harrisons have made no such allegation, they have failed to state a claim under section 1985.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1516-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-14\">In its Order dismissing the complaint, the District Court noted that the Harrisons had relied upon a conspiracy theory in defending against the Commission\u2019s condemnation counterclaim in the prior state court proceeding. The District Court stated that such a claim constituted a compulsory counterclaim in that action under Arkansas Rule 13, and held that the Harrisons failure to assert it in the state action was \u201cres judicata as to the issues raised in the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>stant action.\u201d The court cited as authority for dismissing the complaint on this ground only this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davidson v. Lonoke Production Credit Association, </em>695 F.2d 1115 (8th Cir.1982) (applying Arkansas law).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1517-5\">Section 1738 provides that the \u201c[a]cts, records and judicial proceedings [of any state court] shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States ... as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State ... from which they are taken.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738. The Supreme Court has held that section 1738 requires a federal court to apply the same preclusive effect to a prior state court judgment as the courts of that state would apply. The statute applies in section 1983 actions and extends to both issue preclusion (or collateral estoppel), <em>see Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980), and claim preclusion (or res judicata), <em>see Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education, </em>465 U.S. 75, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984). \u201cIt has long been established that \u00a7 1738 does not allow federal courts to employ their own rules of res judicata in determining the effect of state judgments. Rather, it goes beyond the common law and commands a federal court to accept the rules chosen by the State from which the judgment is taken.\u201d <em>Kremer v. Chemical Construction Co., </em>456 U.S. 461, 481-82, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1897-98, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982). Thus, it is to Arkansas law to which the District Court should have looked, and to which we look now, to determine the pre-elusive effect of the prior state court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1517-8\">The Arkansas Supreme Court has held that the failure to plead a compulsory counterclaim is res judicata as to that claim in a subsequent action between the parties. <em>See May v. Exxon, </em>256 Ark. 865, 867-68, 512 S.W.2d 11,12 (1974). Rule 13 of the Arkansas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \u201c[a] pleading shall state as a [compulsory] counterclaim any claim which, at the time of filing the pleading, the pleader has against any opposing party, if it <em>arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s </em>claim____ Ark.R.Civ.P. 13(a) (emphasis added). All other counterclaims \u201cnot arising out of the [same] transaction or occurrence\u201d are merely permissive under Rule 13(b). The adoption of Rule 13 abolished the strict compulsory counterclaim rule contained in Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 27-1121, which had been construed to make <em>all </em>counterclaims mandatory. <em>See May, </em>256 Ark. at 867, 512 S.W.2d at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1517-11\">Based on our examination of Arkansas case law, we are convinced that the Arkansas courts would not deem the Harrisons\u2019 section 1983 claim to have been a compulsory counterclaim in the prior state chancery court proceeding. Therefore, the District Court erred in holding that the present action is barred by principles of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b1517-12\">Perhaps the most analogous case to the present one is <em>Lytle v. Zebold, </em>235 Ark. 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>357 S.W.2d 20 (1962) <em>(Lytle II), </em>a case decided under section 27-1121, the old mandatory counterclaim statute. In <em>Lytle I, </em>dissatisfied beneficiaries of a testamentary trust had unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the trust in a prior proceeding. <em>See Lytle v. Zebold, </em>227 Ark. 431, 299 S.W.2d 74 (1957) <em>(Lytle I). </em>Thereafter the executor of the estate sought a ruling that those beneficiaries had forfeited their rights under the will by challenging the validity of the trust in violation of a \u201cno-contest\u201d clause in the will. The beneficiaries contended that the executor should have asserted the forfeiture claim as a compulsory counterclaim in the prior proceeding, and that his failure to do so barred its assertion in the second action. The Arkansas Supreme Court rejected this view.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1518-4\">This contention is unsound. It was not until this court had announced its decision in the first proceeding <em>[Lytle </em>/] that it became definitely known that the [beneficiaries] had made an unsuccessful rather than a successful attack upon the will. Before the final judgment the issue was in doubt. Hence when the executor filed his answer he was not in a position to assert that the [beneficiaries] had violated the prohibition against a will contest. By analogy ... one who is wrongfully and maliciously made a defendant in a civil proceeding does not have to assert a claim for malicious prosecution in that very suit. It is not until the first case has been carried to its conclusion that the cause of action for malicious prosecution can be shown with certainty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"apj-dedup-1\">235 Ark. at 19-20, 357 S.W.2d at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-7\">The analogy to the present case is striking. At the time the Harrisons filed their answer to the condemnation counterclaim, there was no certainty that the Commission would fail to demonstrate that its proposed taking of the Harrisons\u2019 property was necessary and for a public purpose. Indeed, the Commission attempted to demonstrate such a need in the chancery court and on appeal. Only during the chancery court hearing did the alleged \u201cadmissions\u201d of the Commission\u2019s motive for filing the counterclaim come to light. By then the issues had been joined. <em>See </em>Ark.R.Civ.P. 13(d) (providing that if a counterclaim \u201cmatures or is acquired after all the issues are joined, it may be asserted by the pleader in a separate action\u201d); <em>Valley Forge Insurance Co. v. Camer, </em>277 Ark. 447, 449, 642 S.W.2d 317, 318 (1982).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1518-8\">In <em>Bowen v. Danna, </em>4 Ark.App. 232, 632 S.W.2d 234 (1982), the plaintiff-purchaser filed a damage suit in circuit court for fraud in the inducement and sale of real estate. The defendant-sellers subsequently filed a separate foreclosure action in the chancery court. In the chancery action the purchaser sought to prove that retaliation for the filing of her fraud suit was the motive for the sellers\u2019 commencement of the foreclosure action. The plaintiff presented no evidence as to fraud by the sellers prior to the execution of the mortgage. The chancery court entered a decree of foreclosure. Subsequently the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>court dismissed the plaintiffs fraud action on the basis of res judicata. The circuit court held, in essence, that the fraud action was a compulsory counterclaim and should have been asserted in the foreclosure action. The Arkansas Court of Appeals disagreed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1519-5\">In this situation, we have essentially two different cases. This case was a suit for fraud and misrepresentation in the inducement and sale of real property. In this case, [the purchaser] sought money damages and a jury trial. In the suit in chancery court, [the sellers] brought a foreclosure action based upon default. [The purchaser] raised the defense of fraud and misrepresentation, but not in the sale of the property as was the subject of the suit in the circuit court, but only as these terms related to the allegations of default. Fraud and misrepresentation in the sale of the property was neither raised in the pleadings nor was it argued in the proceedings in chancery court____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1519-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 234-35, 632 S.W.2d at 235 (relying also in part on Rule 13(a)(1) \u201cpending action\u201d exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-7\">As in <em>Bowen, </em>\u201cwe have essentially two different cases.\u201d The first was a condemnation counterclaim based ostensibly on a perceived public purpose. The second is a section 1983 claim based on an alleged infringement of the constitutional right of access to the courts. It is difficult for us to see how the Harrisons\u2019 claim arose out of the same \u201ctransaction or occurrence\u201d as the Commission\u2019s condemnation counterclaim. Indeed, the two claims did not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, but rather one was born from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-8\">We also question whether the Harrisons could have asserted any damage counterclaim in the prior proceeding. \u201cA party\u2019s counterclaim is not compulsory if it cannot be asserted in the same proceeding as the opposing party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Arkansas Power &amp; Light Co., </em>683 F.2d 1149, 1158 (8th Cir.1982) (applying Arkansas law). In <em>Edwards </em>the Court noted that \u201cjust compensation is the sole issue for determination in an eminent domain proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1154, and went on to state that \u201c[o]bviously, if the plaintiffs could not have asserted their action in state court, their failure to do so cannot justify the invocation of the res judicata and compulsory counterclaim doctrines against them here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1155. <em>See also Gorchik v. Gorchick, </em>10 Ark.App. 331, 336-37, 663 S.W.2d 941, 944 (1984) (husband\u2019s intentional tort claim for damages not a compulsory counterclaim in wife\u2019s divorce action since chancery court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate it under \u201cclean-up doctrine\u201d); <em>cf. Chamberlain v. Newton County, </em>266 Ark. 516, 519-20, 587 S.W.2d 4, 6 (1979) (chancery court had no jurisdiction over trespass action for damages since equity has no jurisdiction over action to recover unliqui-dated tort damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-10\">Based on the foregoing authorities, we conclude that under Arkansas law the Har-risons\u2019 present section 1983-claim was not a compulsory counterclaim which should have been asserted in the prior chancery court proceeding. The District Court erred in holding to the contrary and in dismissing the complaint on the basis of res judicata.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1519-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-12\">We hold that the Harrisons\u2019 complaint states a claim under section 1983 for infringement of their constitutional right of access to the courts in violation of their First Amendment right to petition, that the complaint does not state a claim under section 1985, and that their present action is not barred by res judicata for their failure to assert it as a compulsory counterclaim in the prior state chancery court proceeding. In so holding, we express no opinion as to the merits of the Harrisons\u2019 section 1983 claim.

Since the Harrisons have alleged a violation of a substantive constitutional right independent of the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause <em>simpliciter, </em>the existence of an adequate state remedy under the <em>Parratt </em>analysis is irrelevant. <em>See Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 536, 101 S.Ct. at 1913 (distinguishing cases in which substantive constitutional right involved); <em>see also Hudson v.

Our holding that the Harrisons have failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1985 does not mean that they could not show a conspiracy under \u00a7 1983. Proof of a conspiracy, however, is not an indispensable requirement under \u00a7 1983 as it is under \u00a7 1985. It is merely a mechanism by which to establish the necessary state action, <em>see Ad-ickes v. S.H.

In <em>Davidson, </em>this Court was required to determine whether Arkansas law recognized an exception to the general rule requiring mutuality of estoppel. That case, however, involved only the offensive use of <em>issue </em>preclusion (or collateral estoppel), and not the application of <em>claim </em>preclusion (or res judicata), as in the present case. Under the doctrine of res judica-ta, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating matters that were or could have been raised in that action. Under the doctrine of collateral estop-pel, once a court has actually decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision may preclude relitigation of that same issue in a subsequent suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first action. <em>See Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 414, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). Since the District Court dismissed the Harrisons\u2019 <em>claim </em>(as contrasted with merely granting summary judgment on and precluding relitigation of an <em>issue </em>previously decided), this case clearly does not invoke principles of collateral estoppel. The District Court and defendants seem to have confused the issues as well as the terminology. The precise issue, it seems to us, is whether the Harrisons were required, under Ark.R.Civ.P. 13(a), to assert their present \u00a7 1983 claim as a compulsory counterclaim in the prior state court action. If so, they are barred by principles of res judicata, as construed by the Arkansas appellate courts, from asserting their claim here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1518-5\">. At oral argument the City\u2019s attorney conceded that the Harrisons\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim matured or was acquired after the issues already had been joined. He contended, however, that since the language in Arkansas Rule 13(d) providing that a subsequently acquired claim \"may be asserted ... in a separate action\u201d is not present in the federal counterpart, Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(e), the Harrisons were <em>required </em>to assert their \u00a7 1983 claim as a separate action in <em>state </em>court, and not in a federal forum. We find this argument to be totally without merit. The City cites to no Arkansas appellate case, and our research discloses none, construing its rule in that manner. Although the Supreme Court has noted that \u00a7 1983 claims <em>may </em>be brought in state court, <em>see Martinez v. California, </em>444 U.S. 277, 283 n. 7, 100 S.Ct. 553, 558 n. 7, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980), and although Arkansas has in fact permitted such claims to be brought in its state courts, <em>see Beaumont v. Robinson, </em>282 Ark. 181, 668 S.W.2d 514 (1984), it has never been held that \u00a7 1983 claims <em>must </em>be brought in state courts on the basis of a state procedural rule <em>permitting </em>such claims to be brought \u201cin a separate action.\u201d Moreover, we have serious doubts whether such a rule would be constitutional. In any event, the only possible basis on which the Harrisons would be barred from asserting their \u00a7 1983 claim in the present federal action is the application of res judicata under Arkansas law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1519-13\">.
