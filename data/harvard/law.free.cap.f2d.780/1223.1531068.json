The district court did not consider whether the proposed transactions would effect an end run around the protection granted creditors in Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. For this reason, we vacate the district court order that affirmed the bankruptcy court decision authorizing the debtor to proceed with lease negotiations and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-22\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-23\">Appellee, Continental Air Lines, Inc. (\u201cCAL\u201d), filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on September 24, 1983. During the period relevant to this case, CAL operated its commercial airline service as a debtor-in-possession, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1107-1108. CAL owes appellants, its Institutional Creditors (\u201cInstitutional Creditors\u201d), in excess of $30 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-24\">On March 16, 1984, CAL filed with the bankruptcy court a motion for authority to enter into lease agreements for two DC-10-30 aircraft. CAL represented that the leased aircraft would allow it to strengthen and enhance profitability and cash flow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>greatly and to increase the asset value of its Mid Pacific and South Pacific operations. In an accompanying motion to limit and restrict notice of the motion to enter into the leases, CAL further represented that the two aircraft were necessary in order for CAL to preserve its route authority in the Pacific, supposedly one of its most valuable assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">The bankruptcy court granted CAL\u2019s latter motion; a three-day hearing on the proposed leases commenced on March 30, 1984. On April 6, 1984, the bankruptcy court signed an order authorizing the leases. The bankruptcy court amended this order on April 16, 1984. Under the terms of the amended order, the bankruptcy court authorized the leases subject to its approval of the final terms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court found that if CAL did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"api-dedup-2\">implement new DC10-30 service to its Mid-Pacific and South Pacific route system, CAL\u2019s revenue and profit forecast for 1984 and thereafter [would] be jeopardized, CAL [would] be unable to effectively compete over these routes, and CAL and its estate [might] not be able to protect and preserve these route systems for the benefit of CAL, its bankruptcy estate and the creditors therecf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">The bankruptcy court concluded that CAL had properly sought authority under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363 to enter into the leases, that the Mid and South Pacific route systems were extremely valuable assets of the bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a), and as a debtor-in-possession CAL \u201cis under a duty to take reasonable steps to preserve, protect and enhance the assets of its bankruptcy estate which have value for the benefit of CAL and its creditors.\u201d The bankruptcy court further concluded that \u201c[t]his duty is subject to the overall impact of any proposed individual action on the existing financial condition of the Debtor and the attendant risks to creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">On appeal to the district court, the Institutional Creditors argued that the purpose of the proposed transaction was to avoid and shortcut the process that leads to a plan of reorganization, hence the bankruptcy court lacked the power to approve the leases in light of <em>In re Braniff Airways, Inc., </em>700 F.2d 935 (5th Cir.1983). In rejecting the Institutional Creditors\u2019 position and affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, the district court held that, unlike <em>Braniff, </em>CAL\u2019s proposed leases did not \u201cdictate the terms of any future plan of reorganization, nor [would they] leave CAL with so few assets that reorganization [would become] unlikely.\u201d The leases did not have restrictions \u201con voting or any requirement for release of claims and [would] not alter any creditor\u2019s priority.\u201d Instead, \u201cthe proposed transaction by CAL is a \u2018use, lease or sale\u2019 of the debtor\u2019s assets as permitted under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363, and as such it was within the bankruptcy court\u2019s power to approve the agreement without submitting it to a vote of the creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">On appeal to this Court, the Institutional Creditors present us with two basic sets of issues. The first concerns the statutory authority for CAL\u2019s proposal to enter into a 10-year post-petition financial commitment in excess of $70 million. The second addresses the adequacy of the process the Institutional Creditors received in the approval of the leases. Because we are not yet convinced that there is authority for the leases, we decline to reach the second set of issues on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-10\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b) TRANSACTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">Given the novelty of CAL\u2019s proposed use of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an overview of the relevant statutory and case law authority for the proposed transaction is in order. A debtor-in-possession under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107 is authorized, absent court order otherwise, to operate the debtor\u2019s business. 11 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>\u00a7 1108. Such a debtor-in-possession, \u201cafter notice and hearing, may use, sell, or lease, other than in the ordinary course of business, property of the estate.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">When a proposed use, sale, or lease of assets is outside the ordinary course of business, \u00a7 363(b) requires that the assets be property of the estate. What is included in property of the estate is determined by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541. We also agree with the Second Circuit that implicit in \u00a7 363(b) is the further requirement of justifying the proposed transaction. <em>In re Lionel Corp., </em>722 F.2d 1063, 1071 (2d Cir.1983). That is, for the debtor-in-possession or trustee to satisfy its fiduciary duty to the debtor, creditors and equity holders, there must be some articulated business justification for using, selling, or leasing the property outside the ordinary course of business. <em>Id. See also Matter of Baldwin United Corp., </em>43 B.R. 888, 906 (Bankr.S.D. Ohio 1984) (The debtor-in-possession \u201cis required to justify the proposed [transaction] with sound business reasons\u201d); <em>Matter of St. Petersburg Hotel Assoc., Ltd., </em>37 B.R. 341, 343 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1983) (Section 363 \u201calso impliedly requires the Court to find that it is good business judgment for the Debtor to enter into\u201d the transaction.). Whether the proffered business justification is sufficient depends on the case. As the Second Circuit held in <em>Lionel, </em>the bankruptcy judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-5\">should consider all salient factors pertaining to the proceeding and, accordingly, act to further the diverse interests of the debtor, creditors and equity holders, alike. He might, for example, look to such relevant factors as the proportionate value of the asset to the estate as a whole, the amount of elapsed time since the filing, the likelihood that a plan of reorganization will be proposed and confirmed in the near future, the effect of the proposed disposition on future plans of reorganization, the proceeds to be obtained from the disposition vis-a-vis any appraisals of the property, which of the alternatives of use, sale or lease the proposal envisions and, most importantly perhaps, whether the asset is increasing or decreasing in value. This list is not intended to be exclusive, but merely to provide guidance to the bankruptcy judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">722 F.2d at 1071. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Baldwin United Corp., </em>43 B.R. 888, 905-906 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-8\">If the requirements in \u00a7 363(b) are satisfied, a proposed transaction is still subject to the requirements in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(d) and (e). According to \u00a7 363(d), the use, sale or lease of estate property is authorized under \u00a7 363(b) \u201conly to the extent not inconsistent with any relief granted under section 362(c), 362(d), 362(e) or 362(f)....\u201d Section 363(e) further provides that, on the request of an entity having an interest in property used or proposed to be used, \u201cthe court, with or without a hearing, shall prohibit or condition such use ... as is necessary to provide adequate protection of such interest.\u201d Adequate protection, as defined by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 361, may be cash payments, additional or replacement liens, or such other relief as to provide \u201cthe indubitable equivalent of such entity\u2019s interest in such property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-9\">Finally, as this Court recognized in <em>Braniff, </em>\u00a7 363 does not authorize a debt- or and the bankruptcy court \u201cto short circuit the requirements of a reorganization plan by establishing the terms of the plan <em>sub rosa </em>in connection\u201d with a proposed transaction. 700 F.2d at 940. When a proposed transaction specifies terms for adopting a reorganization plan, \u201cthe parties and the district court must scale the hurdles erected in Chapter 11. <em>See, e.g., </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125 (disclosure requirements); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1126 (voting); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1129(a)(7) (best interest of creditors test); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1129(b)(2)(B) (absolute priority rule).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-11\">AUTHORITY FOR CAL\u2019S PROPOSED LEASES</p>\n<p id=\"Aop\">Applying the foregoing principles and our decision in <em>Braniff </em>to today\u2019s case, we must consider (1) whether the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>transaction represents a use, sale, or lease of estate property; (2) whether the district court erred in finding that the business justifications offered for the transaction were sufficient to warrant authorization to proceed with lease negotiations; (3) whether the proposed transactions otherwise violate or are incompatible with the provisions of Chapter 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">It is undisputed in this case that the proposed transaction is outside the ordinary course of business, thus invoking \u00a7 363(b). CAL argues that the asset it proposes to use under \u00a7 363(b) is estate funds. According to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541, property of the estate includes \u201c[pjroceeds, product, offspring, or profits of or from property of the estate,\u201d as well as \u201c[a]ny interest in property that the estate acquires after commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541. Property of the estate therefore includes funds derived from airline operations or other sources. <em>See In re Lotta Water Land Co., </em>25 B.R. 32 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1982) (distinguishing earnings attributable to individual debtor from earnings attributable to estate for corporate debtor); <em>Matter of Sundale Associates, Ltd., </em>23 B.R. 230, 232 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1982) (property acquired post-petition becomes an asset of the estate). Hence the application of these funds to satisfy lease obligations is a use of estate property pursuant to \u00a7 363(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">We further conclude that the district court did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court finding that the business justifications CAL offered in support of the leases are sufficient to authorize proceeding with lease negotiations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> something the Institutional Creditors do not challenge at this point. Institutional Creditors\u2019 Reply Brief at 3. The record shows that CAL\u2019s routes in the Mid and South Pacific are of significant economic value to it; that the new aircraft would allow CAL (1) to satisfy an increase in the quantity of airline services demanded as a result of a change in exchange rates; (2) to exploit an existing competitive advantage by offering new route combinations and by filling a void left by withdrawing carriers; (3) to take advantage of foreign governments\u2019 willingness to negotiate additional service requests; and (4) to increase cash flow as well as profits. These reasons were sufficient to warrant authorizing CAL to proceed with lease negotiations, subject to review of all considerations upon having the. terms of the final agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">With respect to the other provisions of \u00a7 363, the Institutional Creditors do not argue here that the proposed leases are somehow inconsistent with any of the relief granted under Section 362(c), 362(d), 362(e) or 362(f). 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(d). And, while implicit in the focus of their primary contention, the Institutional Creditors did not request the bankruptcy court to grant them adequate protection under \u00a7 363(e). Rather, the Institutional Creditors\u2019 primary argument is that the proposed leases represent pieces of a creeping plan of reorganization, incompatible with our holding in <em>Braniff. </em>In this regard, the Institutional Creditors assert that the district court fundamentally erred in confining the scope of our holding in <em>Braniff </em>to whether a transaction is a use, sale, or lease of estate property. Institutional Creditors\u2019 Brief at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-13\">In <em>Braniff </em>we recognized that a debtor in Chapter 11 cannot use \u00a7 363(b) to sidestep the protection creditors have when it comes time to confirm a plan of reorganization. Likewise, if a debtor were allowed to reorganize the estate in some fundamental fashion pursuant to \u00a7 363(b), creditor\u2019s rights under, for example, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1125, 1126, 1129(a)(7), and 1129(b)(2) might become meaningless. Undertaking reorganization piecemeal pursuant to \u00a7 363(b) should not deny creditors the protection they would receive if the proposals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>were first raised in the reorganization plan. <em>See In re Allison, </em>39 B.R. 300, 303 (Bankr.D.N.M.1984). At the same time, we fully appreciate that post-petition, pre-confirmation transactions outside the ordinary course of business may be required and that each hearing on a \u00a7 363(b) transaction cannot become a mini-hearing on plan confirmation. Balancing these considerations, we hold that when an objector to a proposed transaction under \u00a7 363(b) claims that it is being denied certain protection because approval is sought pursuant to \u00a7 363(b) instead of as part of a reorganization plan, the objector must specify exactly what protection is being denied. If the court concludes that there has in actuality been such a denial, it may then consider fashioning appropriate protective measures modeled on those which would attend a reorganization plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">The district court in today\u2019s case did not consider the Institutional Creditors\u2019 claims that they were being denied certain protection they would receive if the transaction were part of a reorganization plan. Because the bankruptcy court may have lacked statutory authority to authorize the leases if the Institutional Creditors could have defeated a plan of reorganization containing the leases<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or may have had to condition certain terms of any lease, we VACATE the district court\u2019s order and REMAND for consideration consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">. The bankruptcy court approved the lease transactions by separate order dated August 13, 1984. The Institutional Creditors have appealed these orders but this appeal is not presently before the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">. We have found no case and none has been brought to our attention where a debtor-in-possession has proposed under \u00a7 363(b) to use estate funds to satisfy obligations under a lease not contemplated in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">. We interpret the bankruptcy court order as going no further than this, however. As the bankruptcy court undoubtedly recognized, in granting authority to proceed subject to approval of the final lease terms, a thorough analysis of business justifications is not practical until the terms are finally struck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">. During oral argument counsel for the Institutional Creditors represented that if the leases were part of a reorganization plan the Institutional Creditors could have \"knocked [the leases] right out.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"ald-dedup-1\">. Since the procedural issues in this case will be moot if the lower court determines that CAL\u2019s proposed leases are invalid as a matter of law, we decline to reach those issues at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
