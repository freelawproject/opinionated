Code \u00a7 38.1-49, <em>et seq. </em>(1950), based on the same alleged misconduct as gave rise to her federal cause of action under ERISA. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and dismissed all of Powell\u2019s claims. We agree with the district court that Powell\u2019s state law claims are preempted by ERISA, and that extracontractual and punitive damages are not, in these circumstances, available under ERISA, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b506-18\">Powell received disability benefits under the Plan from February 1978 through May 1983. She complains of constant harassment by C &amp; P and Connecticut General throughout this period, causing her and her son emotional distress and precipitating her divorce. According to Powell, the appel-lees repeatedly demanded unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>medical reports, refused to provide her attorney with copies of her claim file, and unjustifiably withheld benefit payments on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Powell\u2019s benefits were terminated in June 1983, after she received a substantial Social Security award, which represented monthly benefits retroactive to July 1977. When combined with the Social Security award, Powell\u2019s Plan benefits exceeded 50% of her base pay prior to disability, the benefits ceiling under the Plan. Powell refused C &amp; P\u2019s request to refund the overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Thereafter, Powell filed this action and the defendants counterclaimed for a refund of benefits. The counterclaim was nonsuit-ed after Powell\u2019s complaint was dismissed, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">A. <em>Preemption of State Law Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">With certain stated exceptions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ERISA preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d governed by ERI-SA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a). \u201cState law\u201d is defined to include \u201call laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law, of any State.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">In <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 96-97, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2899-1900, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983), the Supreme Court, citing legislative history and referring to the language and structure of the statute, construed the preemption clause in its broadest sense, and held that \u201c[a] law \u2018relates to\u2019 an employee benefit plan ... if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d Thus, the scope of \u00a7 1144(a) is not limited to state laws \u201cspecifically designed to affect employee benefit plans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 103 S.Ct. at 2900.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The state laws at issue in <em>Shaw, </em>the New York Human Rights Law (prohibiting discrimination in employment, including discrimination in employee benefit plans on the basis of pregnancy), and New York\u2019s Disability Benefits Law (requiring employers to pay sick-leave benefits to employees unable to work due to pregnancy), \u201cclearly \u2018relate to\u2019 \u201d employee benefit plans. <em>Id. </em>at 97, 103 S.Ct. at 2900. The Court observed, however, that some state actions may affect employee benefits plans in \u201ctoo tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law \u2018relates to\u2019 the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, n. 21, 103 S.Ct. at 2901, n. 21. This category includes, for example, state garnishment of a spouse\u2019s pension income to enforce alimony and support orders. <em>Id., citing American Telephone and Telegraph Co. v. Merry, </em>592 F.2d 118 (2d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"axe-dedup-0\">In this case, none of the state laws under which Powell claims relief have any intrinsic connection with employee benefit plans. The question is therefore whether state law <em>claims </em>which relate to the administration of an ERISA-governed plan, but which arise under general state <em>laws </em>which themselves have no impact on employee benefit plans, are within the scope of ERISA preemption. Given the \u201cunparalleled breadth\u201d of the preemption clause, <em>Holland v. Burlington Industries, Inc., </em>772 F.2d 1140, 1147 (4th Cir.1985), and the broad remedial policy of ERISA, we hold that state laws, insofar as they are invoked by beneficiaries claiming relief for injuries arising out of the administration of employee benefit plans, \u201crelate to\u201d such plans and, absent an applicable exemption, are preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">The preemption clause effectuates a broad remedial policy to protect the interests of participants in ERISA-governed plans and their beneficiaries \u201cby establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.\u201d 29 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u00a7 1001(b). Thus, ERISA imposes extensive duties on plan administrators, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1114, and provides a comprehensive scheme for the criminal and civil enforcement of fiduciary obligations, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1131-1132.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To the extent that ERISA redresses the mishandling of benefits claims or other maladministration of employee benefit plans, it preempts analogous causes of action, whatever their form or label under state law. <em>See Depen-dahl v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>653 F.2d 1208, 1215-16 (8th Cir.1981) (\u201cIf Congress has already provided a remedy [under ERI-SA], ... the state law is preempted, regardless of whether or not a conflict exists which involves a direct interference by the state law with [ERISA].\u201d). A contrary rule would undermine ERISA\u2019s important policy of promoting uniformity in employee benefit laws, reflected in the legislative history, in the Act\u2019s declaration of policy, and in the preemption clause itself, by creating the \u201cpotential ... for conflicting employer obligations and variable standards of recovery.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>at 1147. Accordingly, the state law claims in this case, all of which relate exclusively to alleged breaches of fiduciary responsibility in the administration of C &amp; P\u2019s employee benefit plan, \u201crelate to\u201d the plan and, unless an exception applies, are preempted, leaving Powell to such remedies as are available under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">This analysis comports with several recent Ninth Circuit decisions in which that court concluded that state claims based on the maladministration of employee benefit plans are preempted by ERISA, even where the state statutory and common law under which the claims arise bears no inherent connection with ERISA-governed plans. <em>See Ellenburg v. Brockway, Inc., </em>763 F.2d 1091, 1095 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Scott v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>754 F.2d 1499,1504-05 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Blau v. Del Monte Corp., </em>748 F.2d 1348, 1356 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Russell v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>722 F.2d 482, 487-88 (9th Cir.1983), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985). <em>See also Gilbert v. Burlington Industries, Inc., </em>765 F.2d 320, 327 (2d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Powell contends that even if her state law claims are within the scope of ERISA\u2019s preemption provision, her claims for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for violations of the Virginia Unfair Trade Practices Act, both of which purport to impose duties on insurers,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are nevertheless rescued from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>preemption by an \u201cinsurance saving clause,\u201d which provides that ERISA does not \u201cexempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance....\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A). We disagree. The insurance saving clause is limited by the so-called \u201cdeemer clause,\u201d which provides that no employee benefit plan \u201cshall be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer ... or to be engaged in the business of insurance ... for purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies [or] insurance contracts____\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(B). Thus, C <em>&amp; </em>P cannot be deemed to be an insurer or otherwise engaged in the business of insurance by virtue of its sponsorship of the Plan and Powell\u2019s claims against C &amp; P under state laws regulating insurance are not exempted from preemption by the insurance saving clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Since Connecticut General is not an \u201cemployee benefit plan,\u201d the deemer clause is inapplicable to it. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(B). Powell contends that as an insurance company, Connecticut General is subject to state laws regulating insurance, including the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and the Virginia Unfair Trade Practices Act, and that these claims are therefore saved from preemption by the insurance saving clause, \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We read the insurance saving clause, however, to exempt from ERISA\u2019s preemptive effect only those state insurance laws that regulate the \u201cbusiness of insurance.\u201d Regulation of the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d is expressly reserved to the states by the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1011-1015,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and ERISA\u2019s insuranee saving clause, which is similarly worded and which reflects the concerns of McCarran-Ferguson, is most reasonably construed to cover the same category of state insurance regulation. <em>See Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -n. 21, 105 S.Ct. 2380, 2392 n. 21, 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985) (\u201cThe ERISA saving clause ... appears to have been designed to preserve the McCarran-Ferguson Act\u2019s reservation of the business of insurance to the States.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">The primary features of an insurance contract are the spreading and underwriting of a policyholder\u2019s risk. <em>Group Life &amp; Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., </em>440 U.S. 205, 211, 99 S.Ct. 1067, 1073, 59 L.Ed.2d 261 (1979). In enacting the McCar-ran-Ferguson Act, \u201cCongress was concerned with the type of state regulation that centers around the contract of insur-ance____\u201d <em>SEC v. National Securities, Inc., </em>393 U.S. 453, 460, 89 S.Ct. 564, 568, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969). The Act did not, however, \u201cpurport to make the States supreme in regulating all the activities of insurance <em>companies; ... </em>only when they are engaged in the \u2018business of insurance\u2019 does the statute apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459-60, 89 S.Ct. at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-18\">In its role as Plan administrator, Connecticut General neither spreads nor underwrites insurance risks; there is no insurance policy or contract. Rather, Connecticut General provides certain purely administrative claims processing functions pursuant to an administrative services agreement with the Plan\u2019s sponsor, C &amp; P.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, notwithstanding that Virginia\u2019s implied covenant of fair dealing and Unfair Trade Practices Act may in some circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>stances reach even the purely administrative activities of insurers,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> such regulation would not bear upon the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d within contemplation of ERISA\u2019s insurance saving clause and thus is not saved from preemption by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">B. <em>Availability of Extracontractual and Punitive Damages under ERISA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Having received all of the benefits to which she is entitled, Powell seeks extra-contractual and punitive relief under ERI-SA to compensate her for various alleged physical ailments, the decline of her marriage, her son\u2019s emotional distress, and the deterioration of her mental health, on account of the mishandling by C &amp; P and Connecticut General of her disability claim. Powell contends that such extraordinary relief is available under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3) which authorizes a civil action by a plan beneficiary \u201c(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of [ERISA] or the terms of the plan, or (B) <em>to obtain other appropriate equitable relief, </em>(i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of [ERISA] or terms of the plan.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985), the Supreme Court held that extracontractual and punitive damages are not available to a participant or beneficiary under \u00a7 1132(a)(2), which authorizes a civil action by the Secretary or by a plan participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary \u201cfor appropriate relief under \u00a7 1109,\u201d which relates to liability for breach of fiduciary duty. The question whether or to what extent extracontractual and punitive relief is authorized by way of the catchall provision in \u00a7 1132(a)(3) for \u201cother appropriate equitable relief\u201d was expressly reserved. <em>Id. </em>at-n. 5, 105 S.Ct. 3089 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Powell urges that notwithstanding the use of the word \u201cequitable\u201d in \u00a7 1132(a)(3) and its implications for excluding the damage remedies she seeks, ERISA incorporates the fiduciary standards and principles of trust law, the violation of which, although ordinarily redressed in equity, may nevertheless give rise to monetary damages in appropriate cases. The legislative history supports Powell\u2019s theory that Congress intended to import into ERISA principles of trust law, <em>see </em>H.R.Rep. No. 533, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 11 (1973), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p. 4639, as does the language of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a), which expressly incorporates a general \u201cprudent man\u201d standard of care for ERISA fiduciaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Powell\u2019s argument is self-defeating, however, because even assuming that \u201cother appropriate equitable relief\u201d may, in certain circumstances, include extracontractual or punitive damages, such relief is generally not available in an action by a beneficiary against a trustee for breach of trust. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 205 (1959) (liability for breach of trust is limited to (a) loss in value of trust estate; (b) profits accrued by trustee; or (c) profits lost to estate); G. Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, the Law of Trusts &amp; Trustees, \u00a7 862 (2d ed. 1982) (trustee is usually charged only with the loss in value of the trust estate although exemplary damages are occasionally awarded in a few states where malice or fraud is involved); A. Scott, The Law of Trusts, \u00a7 198.1 (1967) (\u201cwhere the trustee is not under an immediate and unconditional duty to pay money to the beneficiary, the beneficiary cannot maintain an action at law against him.\u201d). Thus, the provision for \u201cother appropriate equitable relief,\u201d whatever it embraces, cannot be held to authorize extracontractual or punitive damages for the breach of a plan administrator\u2019s fiduciary duties under ERISA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Accordingly, the district court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment as to Powell\u2019s claims for extracontraetual and punitive damages under ERISA, and her complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-13\">. Specifically, the complaint alleges that C &amp; P and Connecticut General failed to discharge ' their fiduciary duties solely in the interest of Plan beneficiaries pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1); breached their duties of disclosure under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1021; and failed to provide Powell with adequate written notice of termination, as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-11\">. The most important of these exceptions allow continued operation of state insurance, banking, and securities laws, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A), and generally applicable criminal laws, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-4\">.

A plan may recover from its administrator any losses resulting from the breach of fiduciary duties and may seek \"such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of such fiduciary,\u201d \u00a7 1109(a). Any person who willfully violates the provisions of ERISA may be fined, upon conviction, up to $5,000, or imprisoned up to one year, or both, and in the case of violations by other than an individual, a fine of up to $100,000 may be imposed, \u00a7 1131.

The Virginia Unfair Trade Practices Act constitutes Article 6 of Virginia\u2019s Insurance Code and declares as its purpose the regulation of trade practices in the business of insurance. Specifically, Powell alleges in her complaint that the defendants violated \u00a7 38.1-52.1 which provides that \u201d[n]o person shall make, issue, [or] circulate ... any estimate, illustration, circular, statement, sales presentation, omission, or comparison which (1) Misrepresents the benefits, advantages, conditions or terms of any insurance policy.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">The implied covenant of good faith arises, in certain circumstances, from the \"relationship of confidence and trust ... between the insurer and the insured which imposes upon the insurer the duty to deal fairly with the insured in the handling and disposition of any claim covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>Price, </em>206 Va. 749, 761, 146 S.E.2d 220, 227-28 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">.
