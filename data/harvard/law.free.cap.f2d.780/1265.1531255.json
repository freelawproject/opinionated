RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1351-27\">Following state law, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that an insurance company failed to pay a claim made on a health insurance policy without just and reasonable grounds and that it owed both the amount claimed and attorneys\u2019 fees. We affirm the amount it awarded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>fees, and, in addition, assess the fees due for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">Joseph F. Powell bought two accident and health policies from Old Southern Life Insurance Company to become effective May 1, 1981. Nineteen months after the insurance coverage began, Powell underwent coronary bypass surgery. Old Southern denied liability for the medical expenses on the basis that Powell\u2019s condition preexisted the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">Our jurisdiction of this case being founded on diversity, Louisiana law applies. Louisiana courts hold that an insurer seeking to defend its denial of coverage on a contract\u2019s preexisting-condition clause bears the burden of proof with respect to establishing whether the plaintiff\u2019s condition preexisted the insurance contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">Depositions of three physicians were submitted to the court. The surgeon who performed the bypass stated that he could not determine how long the plaintiff had had significant blockage of his arteries: it might have been months or years. A specialist in cardiology who had examined the plaintiff in 1974 also testified by deposition. This specialist was of the impression that in 1974 Powell had suffered from angina caused by coronary arteriosclerosis. Powell\u2019s family physician, however, had disagreed and had treated Powell for esophagitis, that is, an inflamed esophagus. The district court did not find this evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that Powell\u2019s heart condition began prior to May 1981. It considered significant the fact that the specialist who examined Powell in 1974 could not \u201cstate to a medical certainty the length of time necessary for a vessel to acclue.\u201d While this expression may not state the issue with precision, it is apparent from reading the surrounding findings that the court did not find this deposition or the others persuasive evidence that the coronary blockage preexisted the taking of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">Turning to whether the defendant was also responsible for the payment of penalties and attorney\u2019s fees under the Louisiana statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court concluded that the evidence Old Southern had before it when it denied Powell\u2019s claim was not evidence of a type that would put a reasonable and prudent businessman \u201con his guard.\u201d When it denied the claim, the insurance company had before it only copies of bills from various doctors in a hospital, and a hospital report that stated that Powell was well until \u201cabout two years ago when he started having dyspnea on exertion and intermittent chest pain, described as retrosternal tightness, occurring usually with exertion.\u201d The same report states that the plaintiff was hospitalized \u201ca few years ago\u201d for an \u201calleged myocardial infarction,\u201d at which time the plaintiff allegedly had severe chest pain lasting about two hours. The court concluded that this was the only substantive evidence on which the insurer had denied liability and that this evidence was not clear enough to put a reasonable and prudent businessman on guard. The court reasoned that before denying coverage the insurance company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>should have conducted further investigation into the history of its 19-month policyholder. \u201cIf it had done so, it is doubtful that the claim would have been denied,\u201d the district court held, relying on a Louisiana Supreme Court decision, <em>Lopez v. Blue Cross of </em>Louisiana.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In granting the plaintiff judgment, the court fixed attorney\u2019s fees at $3,000 pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">Old Southern attacks the court\u2019s findings on the merits as clearly erroneous, relying, in large part, on Fifth Circuit jurisprudence holding that the trial court\u2019s findings are accorded less credit when the evidence consists entirely of depositions and similar documentary evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its last term, however, the Supreme Court held, in <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North Car</em>olina,,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the mandate of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applies equally to district court findings based on documentary evidence. Having read the record, we find ample support in it for the trial judge\u2019s conclusions on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">Relying on the state statute, the district court also awarded the prevailing plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>in \u201can ordinary diversity case where the state law does not run counter to a valid federal statute or rule of court, and usually it will not, state law denying the right to attorney\u2019s fees or giving a right thereto, which reflects a substantial policy of the state, should be followed.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In accordance with this policy, federal courts in diversity cases have followed state statutes allowing attorney\u2019s fees unless the state practice directly conflicts with a federal statute or rule of court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-15\">State law conflicts with no federal statute or rule applicable to this ease and, indeed, the plaintiff\u2019s right to attorney\u2019s fees is not disputed. Old Southern contends, however, that the amount awarded was excessive, without further supporting this attack. The district court, apparently following the lead of <em>Dowden v. Commonwealth Life Insurance </em>Company,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a Louisiana state court decision, did not exact a statement of time spent by counsel for the successful insured, and made no findings of the kind that are generally required by our circuit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Dowden, </em>the Louisiana court stated, \u201cWhen attorney fees are awarded as a result of arbitrary nonpayment of insurance benefits, such an award is deemed to be a penalty and the value of attorney fees need not be proven.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Whether, as federal procedure requires, evidence of the value of the attorney\u2019s services must be adduced or whether state law control, need not be resolved in this case, as the issue was not raised by the parties below. However, we note that in <em>Shakey\u2019s Inc. v. </em>Covalt,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that, under the <em>Erie </em>doctrine, federal law, not state law, determines the method of computing the amount of attorney fees due, even though the right to fees is based on state law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>In <em>Woods v. International Harvester Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>however, the Fifth Circuit implied that the manner used to calculate an award, of attorney fees is governed by state practice. That case turned on whether a federal court would enforce a contingency fee agreement valid under state law. We said, only, \u201cWhether or not we would have enforced the contingency fee agreement, we cannot say the trial court\u2019s procedure was a \u2018clear case of abuse.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">Noting the issue, we need not decide whether, in a diversity case, attorneys\u2019 fees granted in a Fifth Circuit federal court are to be fixed in accordance with the criteria set by <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as more fully explained in <em>Copper Liquor II,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or in accordance with state rules. In this case no issue concerning the amount of fees due or the method of calculating the award was raised in the district court, and we do not consider issues not raised below unless they present a pure question of law or a refusal to do so would \u201cresult in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This issue does not meet either exception. Because we find the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination as to the amount of fees to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">The statute also entitles Powell to reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with this appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In accordance with Rule 47.8.1 of the Local Rules of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, counsel for Powell has filed an affidavit listing the hours spent in preparation of this appeal. The itemization of hours appears reasonable, and the court considers a fee of $100 per hour reasonable for the services rendered. Accordingly, the judgment for attorney\u2019s fees is increased to $6,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">. <em>Lake Charles Memorial Hospital v.
