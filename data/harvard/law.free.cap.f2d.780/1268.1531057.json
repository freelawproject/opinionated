WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"A_zY\">Appellant Jean Welch was injured while working as a marine technician on the ferry landing dock at Galveston, Texas. Claiming under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, she sued her employer, the Texas Highway Department, and the State of Texas, for her injuries. In addition she also sued the manufacturer of the mobile crane which she alleges contributed to her injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Her Jones Act claim was dismissed by the district court on the assertion of sovereign immunity by the State of Texas and the Texas Highway Department, 533 F.Supp. 403 (S.D.Tex.1982). A panel of this Court by a split decision reversed the decision of the district court, <em>Jean E. Welch v. State Dept. of Highways and Public Transportation and the State of Texas, Drott Mfg. Co. and J.I. Case Co., </em>739 F.2d 1034 (5th Cir.1984). Rehearing en banc was granted, 739 F.2d at 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-16\">The Highway Department of the State of Texas operates on a twenty-four hour basis a free automobile and passenger ferry between Point Bolivar and Galveston, Texas, across the waters which constitute the entrance to the Harbor of Houston, the third busiest port in the United States. The length of the ferry boat journey is approximately three miles from dock to dock. Without the ferry boat, a person wishing to travel from one area to the other by highway would have to drive approximately 130 miles. Appellant Welch was an employee of the Highway Department in the operation of the ferry. Her status as a \u201cseaman\u201d under the Jones Act is assumed and is not at issue. The State Highway Department was an insurer under the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, Texas Rev. Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 8306 et seq. (Vernon). Appellant, having been injured in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>course of employment, clearly was entitled to compensation benefits under that law. She sued instead in federal court under the Jones Act for the full measure of damages to which injured seamen are entitled if they can prove negligence of their employer which caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">The defense of the State, upon which it prevailed in the district court, is the defense of sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. While the Eleventh Amendment in terms only bars federal court jurisdiction in a suit by a citizen of one state against another state, the background under which the Amendment was adopted establishes a far broader foundation for the claim of sovereign immunity by the several states. It was assumed by the framers of the Constitution that the states could claim sovereign immunity not only in their own courts but in the federal courts. But in 1793, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 </em>Dali. 419,1 L.Ed. 440, that the jurisdiction of the federal courts extended to a suit by the citizen of one state against another state as against a claim of sovereign immunity by the state. At the next meeting of Congress following this decision the Eleventh Amendment was proposed, and it was quickly ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">While this is the only reference to sovereign immunity in the United States Constitution, it is established without question that the amendment simply broadened the sovereign immunity which already existed in the states as to their own courts. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>16 Otto 196, 207, 106 U.S. 196, 207, 1 S.Ct. 240, 249, 27 L.Ed. 171 (1882); <em>Hans v. Louisiana, </em>134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890); <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">The question raised by Welch bringing her Jones Act suit against her employer, the State of Texas, in federal court has been the subject of considerable doubt and confusion in the law. The starting point for the modem development of the law is <em>Parden v. Terminal R.R. Co., </em>377 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1207,12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964), in which the Supreme Court found a forced implied state waiver of sovereign immunity in Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act claims. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-60. The Court took the position that the state by operating for profit an interstate railroad as a common carrier, a federally regulated business, automatically waived its sovereign immunity. It is also clear that in terms the Jones Act remedies are based upon the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">Of relevance also to the origins of the modern law of waiver of sovereign immunity by the states when the federal government is acting in the field of its plenary powers is a case which antedated the <em>Par-den </em>case, <em>Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission, </em>359 U.S. 275, 79 S.Ct. 785, 3 L.Ed.2d 804 (1959). The Court held that the Jones Act applied to maritime employees of the bi-state commission. The Court then went on to hold that the agreement of the states of Tennessee and Missouri to set up the interstate bridge commission by means of an interstate compact, which commission was given the authority to \u201csue-and-be-sued\u201d, constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity by the states to a Jones Act suit against the commission. For later developments in the law, as set out below, it is important to emphasize that in <em>Petty </em>the interstate compact under the Constitution had to be and was approved by the Congress. Congress had in terms, therefore, accepted the sue-and-be-sued clause as it related to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">If the <em>Parden </em>case were to stand unlimited, it would dictate a reversal of the district court decision in this case and authorize Welch to bring her Jones Act suit in federal court. But the broad sweep of the <em>Parden </em>decision, although it has not been overruled, has overtly been limited by later decisions as its full implications have surfaced. <em>Employees of the Dept. of Public Health &amp; Welfare v. Missouri Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number><em>Public Health &amp; Welfare, </em>411 U.S. 279, 286, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 1618, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973) , has regularly been cited by the Supreme Court following a citation of the <em>Parden </em>case because in the <em>Missouri Public Health &amp; Welfare </em>case the Supreme Court modified <em>Parden </em>by holding that Congress must express itself in \u201cclear language\u201d to cause a private federal remedy for employees to be applicable to state employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">A second case regularly cited by the Supreme Court is <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974) , which relied upon the <em>Missouri Public Health &amp; Welfare </em>case to find a lack of waiver by the state of its sovereign immunity as to citizen suits against the state under the Federal Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled Program under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1385. <em>See </em>Note, Reconciling Federalism and Individual Rights: The Burger Court\u2019s Treatment of Eleventh and Fourteenth Amendments, 68 Va.L.Rev. 865, 871 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">On March 4, 1985, the Supreme Court in <em>County of Oneida, New York v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1245, 84 L.Ed.2d 169, cited <em>Parden, Missouri Public Health &amp; Welfare, </em>and <em>Edelman </em>as establishing the Supreme Court\u2019s approach to congressional action forcing the states to yield their sovereign immunity otherwise existing under the Eleventh Amendment. The Court explicitly recognized that these cases involved \u201cwaiver [of sovereign immunity] for purposes of suit under a federal statute\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">We relied upon the <em>Missouri Public Health &amp; Welfare </em>case in <em>Intracoastal Transportation, Inc. v. Decatur County, Georgia, </em>482 F.2d 361 (5th Cir.1973), in finding the state had not impliedly waived its immunity against claims brought under the Bridge Act of 1906 simply by operating in a federally regulated sphere. \u201cThe private litigant must show that Congress <em>expressly </em>provided that the private remedy is applicable to the states.\u201d 482 F.2d at 365 (emphasis added). Again, in <em>Freimanis v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., </em>654 F.2d 1155, 1160 (5th Cir.1981), we confirmed our decision in <em>Intracoastal </em>to find no forced implied waiver by the state in a private employee suit brought under the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-12\">If there had been any doubt that we have correctly viewed the later Supreme Court cases as limiting the <em>Parden </em>case, that doubt was effectively and completely removed by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Atascadero State Hospital &amp; California Dept. of Mental Health v. Douglas James Scanlon, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985), decided June 28th of this past year. The case involved suits by private litigants seeking monetary relief under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. The state agencies moved for dismissal of the complaints on the ground the Eleventh Amendment barred the federal courts from entertaining respondents\u2019 claims. The claim of sovereign immunity was accepted by the holding of the United States Supreme Court. The Court stressed that in its opinion in <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>it had said that the state will be deemed to have waived its immunity \u201conly where stated \u2018by the most express language or by such overwhelming implication from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction\u2019 \u201d, 415 U.S. at 673, 94 S.Ct. at 1361, quoting <em>Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., </em>213 U.S. 151, 171, 29 S.Ct. 458, 464, 53 L.Ed. 742 (1909). The Court further said that even in the case of Fourteenth Amendment claims against the states, the Supreme Court in <em>Pennhurst v. State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), required \u201can unequivocal expression of congressional intent to \u2018overturn the constitutionally guaranteed immunity of the several states\u2019 \u201d, quoting <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 342, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 1146, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979), and citing the <em>Missouri Public Health &amp; Welfare </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-15\">The Court went on to state its own ruling in language even more specific. Justice Powell in his opinion for the Court said: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>\u201cCongress may abrogate the States\u2019 constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear <em>in the language of the statute. </em>The fundamental nature of the interests implicated by the Eleventh Amendment dictates this conclusion.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 3147 (emphasis added). The Court then restated and explained this requirement by stressing that Congress\u2019 power to abrogate a state\u2019s immunity means that in those circumstances the usual constitutional balance between the state and federal government does not obtain and that it is therefore \u201cincumbent upon the federal courts to be certain of Congress\u2019 intent before finding that federal law overrides the guarantees of the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d Justice Powell then stated categorically: \u201cThe requirement that Congress unequivocally express its intention in the statutory language ensures such certainty.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 3148. Even more strongly in the next paragraphs the Court said \u201cCongress must express its intention to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment in unmistakable language <em>in the statute itself\" </em>105 S.Ct. at 3148 (emphasis added). Finally it should be noted that the opinion does not ignore the earlier <em>Parden </em>decision. It is cited along with the other later cases in a footnote appended to this final quotation from the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">It would be difficult to make a legal principle more definitive than did Justice Powell writing for the Court in the <em>Atas-cadero </em>case. Congress can force the states to yield their sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment only when it so states in clear language <em>within the statute itself.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">The other side of this constitutional principle was also set out by the Supreme Court in a decision on February 19th of this past year. The case is <em>Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985). That case held that the employees of the San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority were covered by and entitled to the protections of the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and they could enforce their claims by suits brought by these governmental employees in federal and state courts. This holding was pursuant to a 1974 amendment to the FLSA under which Congress had in terms within the language of the statute itself extended its coverage to virtually all public employees of the states and their governmental entities. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(e)(2)(C), (s)(6), and (x). So in the space of four months we have one decision of the Supreme Court upholding the power of Congress to abrogate state sovereignty with unequivocal language contained in the statute itself and another decision holding that state sovereignty under the Eleventh Amendment remains intact in the absence of unequivocal language contained within the relevant statute itself. The Court has established a bright line rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-9\">This summary of the law conclusively establishes that Welch did not have the power to bring a Jones Act suit against the State of Texas in the federal court absent an express waiver of sovereign immunity by the State of Texas. Such a suit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment in the absence of specific congressional language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>contained within the statute itself requiring the abrogation of sovereign immunity. We should also emphasize that, as it is not now before us, we pretermit consideration of the question whether a state maritime employee can pursue a Jones Act claim in state court as against a state sovereign immunity assertion. In doing so we follow the pattern of the Supreme Court holdings in the cases establishing the law with respect to federal court suits. The Supreme Court also has not dealt with this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">Appellant urges that there has been an express waiver by the State of Texas of its sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act. The Act does waive immunity to suit against the state for personal injuries proximately caused by the negligence of state employees acting within the scope of employment if the injury arises from \u201cthe operation or use of a motor driven vehicle and motor driven equipment.\u201d Texas Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 6252-19 \u00a7 3 (Vernon Supp. 1980-81). Appellant\u2019s injury did arise from the use of motor driven equipment by a state employee. Section 19 of the Act, however, limits this waiver of immunity. It provides that a governmental unit carrying Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance is entitled to the \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d granted by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cto private persons and corporations\u201d. The claim is made that since the State of Texas admittedly cannot insulate private employers from Jones Act and maritime remedies, <em>Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, </em>346 U.S. 406, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953), granting the state agency \u201call of the privileges and immunities\u201d constitutes an express waiver of sovereign immunity by the state under the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">The short answer to this assertion is that it requires a tortured interpretation of the phrase \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d to find that those words constitute a waiver of the right of the state to limit suits by injured state employees in federal court. Instead, the obvious purpose of the statutory provision is to give to state agencies adopting Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation the protections against suits by injured employees for recovery of damages based upon negligence. If Texas had intended to withdraw its desire for coverage under the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by withdrawing the immunity in Jones Act cases, the granting of the \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d of the state Act was an exceedingly strange way to do it, and a much clearer way could have been found in simple language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-8\">Of controlling importance in this case is recognition of the fact that once it is determined that Congress has not required the state to waive its sovereign immunity by unequivocal language in the statute, the question of whether the state has or has not waived immunity from suits in the federal court is a matter of state law. If the state has spoken in interpreting its law, it is not within our authority to reinterpret the law. <em>See Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm., </em>359 U.S. 275, 278, 79 S.Ct. 785, 788, <em>supra. </em>We have the authoritative state interpretation of these very provisions. In <em>Lyons v. Texas A &amp; M University, </em>545 S.W.2d 56 (Tex.Civ.App. 1976), the precise issue of the case before us was decided by the Texas court. The case involved the injury of a seaman on a vessel owned and operated by Texas A &amp; M University, a governmental unit of Texas. The Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Act had been adopted by the University and was applicable to the injury. Lyons, however, brought suit to recover damages for unseaworthiness, maintenance and cure, and negligence under the Jones Act. The Texas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the state district court in dismissing the claim. It found that section 19 of the Texas Tort Claims Act was intended to make the workers\u2019 compensation remedy exclusive. The Supreme Court of Texas denied review, finding no reversible error. Tex. Writs of Error Table, 134 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-9\">It is also noteworthy that the <em>Lyons </em>opinion was written by the late Judge Cire when he was serving on the Texas Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>Civil Appeals. Judge Cire was the United States District Judge who rendered the district court decision in the case which is before us. It strengthens the application of the state law for the district judge who applied it to have been the judge who created the authoritative state interpretation when he was on the state court. In any event, we give some deference to interpretations of state law by the district judges because of their particular knowledge of local law. <em>NCH Corp. v. Broyles, </em>749 F.2d 247, 253 n. 10 (5th Cir.1985). Judge Cire knew what the law of the State of Texas was with respect to express waiver. We accept his interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">We conclude that the State of Texas has not waived expressly its sovereign immunity beyond that contained in Section 19 of the statute which gives state employees coverage only under the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation law if the agency has adopted that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">Appellant makes a final analytical assertion that the State of Texas, by applying its own workers\u2019 compensation law to this injury of a maritime employee, has placed an unconstitutional condition upon its assertion of sovereign immunity. Reliance is grounded upon the Supreme Court case of <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, </em>244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086 (1917), which held that state workers\u2019 compensation statutes could not apply to injuries occurring on navigable waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-7\">Such an unconstitutional conditions analysis is not relevant here. The <em>Jensen </em>case did not concern itself with a maritime employee of a state. Instead, as must be emphasized throughout in the consideration of this and similar cases, the Court was dealing with private maritime employment. The analysis must be under the doctrine of sovereign immunity and the Eleventh Amendment. The established law is that the State of Texas, absent waiver, is not subject to suit in federal court under a statute passed as part of the federal plenary regulatory powers unless the federal government has expressly undertaken in terms within the statute to require waiver of immunity under that statute. This leaves the state free to provide workers\u2019 compensation for injuries to its own employees as against a suit in federal court. Otherwise, there would be a federally imposed remedy abrogating sovereign immunity without expressed intention to impose such a remedy. In terms this is inconsistent with <em>Atascadero </em>and also the principle of the political control of federal regulation by the states acting through the Congress which the Court emphasized in the <em>Garcia </em>case. 105 S.Ct. at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-10\">We hold that since Congress has not in terms within the Jones Act required waiver of state immunity as to the maritime employees of the states, and there has been no actual waiver by the state, the State of Texas was not subject to suit by an injured state maritime employee in federal court under the Jones Act. The decision of the district court denying Jones Act recovery to appellant, a maritime employee of the State of Texas, is in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1355-17\">. Appellant\u2019s claim against the mobile crane manufacturer is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1358-5\"><em>. </em>A current analysis by Professor Martha Field of the Harvard Law School is in full agreement. In a comprehensive article entitled <em>Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority: </em>The Demise of a Misguided Doctrine, 99 Harv.L. Rev. 84-118 (Nov.1985), Professor Field evaluates the impact of <em>Atascadero </em>in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahlf\">The Court last Term, for example, four months after the <em>Garcia </em>decision, ruled in <em>Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon </em>that Congress would not be deemed to have exercised its power to require states to defend in federal court against individuals\u2019 claims that the states are violating federal enactments, unless Congress has so stated in absolutely explicit language in the enactment itself. Because the Court imposed that condition retrospectively, it effectively placed upon Congress the burden of reenacting statutes regulating states if it would have states answer in federal court to individuals' suits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1358-11\">In a footnote following this textual statement, Professor Field points out that in the analogous situation Congress did reenact the Fair Labor Standards Act to make it applicable to state employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1360-12\">THOMAS GIBBS GEE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"akr-dedup-0\">specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-13\">I concur in Judge Williams\u2019 careful opinion, writing separately only to confess an earlier error. Although, for the reasons given in my writing for the panel in this case at 739 F.2d 1034, I believe it was incorrectly reasoned, further reflection has convinced me that <em>Lyons v. Texas A &amp; M University, </em>545 S.W.2d 56 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Houston [14th Dist.] 1977, writ ref\u2019d, n.r.e.) is an authoritative interpretation of state law by a Texas court, one which we are duty bound to follow. Under Texas practice, the notation \u201cwrit ref\u2019d n.r.e.\u201d indicates that the Texas Supreme Court was not satisfied that the opinion of the intermediate appellate court correctly declared the law in all respects, but that no error was present that required reversal of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>judgment. The <em>Lyons </em>opinion is therefore of a species that represents the most doubtful of Texas appellate authority. Nevertheless, it <em>is </em>Texas authority, and the holding in question was crucial to the judgment \u2014 which cannot have been correct if it was wrong. I therefore agree that we are bound by it.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1361-4\">PATRICK E. HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"azc-dedup-0\">with whom Judges GARWOOD and ROBERT MADDEN HILL join, specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">I join the majority opinion but emphasize that the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Scanlon </em>is but a specific application of a broader principle \u2014 one essential to the implementation of its concept that states must fight for their sovereignty in the political arena, as found in its <em>Garcia </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">The posed question is whether a seaman employed by the State of Texas is covered by the Jones Act. Its answer challenges our ability to write clear rules for deciding which federal statutory regulatory schemes include states. Ironically, our challenge is best met by passing it to the Congress through the familiar principle that we will not infer that legislation applies to the states. So the Court teaches, if in a subtle way, in <em>Garcia, Employees </em>and <em>Edelman </em>and now, more pointedly, in <em>Scanlon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">The first inquiry, not addressed by the majority, is whether the federal statute applies to state operations at all. The concepts of federalism upon which <em>Garcia </em>as-sertedly rests require that we construe federal statutes to exclude states from their coverage unless Congress expressly indicates otherwise. If a federal statute does not recite its applicability to states, the inquiry should end. Only if a federal law explicitly governs state behavior do we reach the question of whether the Eleventh Amendment bars a private citizen from suing under the federal statute in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-9\">The core holding of <em>Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985) is that Congress\u2019s power to impose its will upon the states is limited by the structural arrangement of our federal system, rather than by ad hoc judicial line calls as to when federal legislation infringes upon \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cfundamental\u201d state powers. The protections of state power built into the federal system, such as equal state representation in the Senate, are said to find their expression in the outcomes of political struggles, of political not judicial process. As the Court observed in <em>Garcia, </em>many federal statutes expressly exempt states from coverage, reflecting state success in the federal political arena. <em>See </em>105 S.Ct. at 1019. Others, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act at issue in <em>Garcia, </em>expressly include states in their sweep. <em>See </em>105 S.Ct. at 1008-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">The more difficult question is when the courts should infer that Congress meant to subject states to federal regulation if a federal statute is by its terms applicable to a broad group such as \u201cany seaman\u201d or \u201cany person,\u201d but makes no reference to states. In rejecting judicial refereeing and measures of the level of intrusion into state affairs by a federal statute, <em>Garcia </em>necessarily holds that the answer cannot be \u201csometimes.\u201d Being forced to deduce whether states have been brought within a federal statutory scheme based on the peculiar attributes of the scheme \u201cinevitably invites an unelected federal judiciary to make decisions about which ... policies it favors and which ones it dislikes.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-13\">But there is a more direct corollary of <em>Garcia: </em>federal statutes not expressly applicable to states are not. Although <em>Garcia\u2019s </em>specific holding extended FLSA coverage to public transit systems, the Court reaffirmed that \u201cthe States occupy a special and specific position in our constitutional system,\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 1020, and that there are \u201cundoubtedly\u201d limits on the federal power \u201cto interfere with state functions <em>...,\u2019\u2019 </em>105 S.Ct. at 1016. <em>Garcia </em>concludes that the primary limit on this power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>is the political process of state participation in federal decisionmaking. If this process is to have its force, legislation that is meant to affect states must say so; states will then be aware of proposed federal legislation perceived to intrude into their operations, and will be able to draw their political weapons. But if legislation is silent or half-heartedly ambiguous as to its effect on states, and a court later declares that it applies to states, the process will have been skewed and the states will have been effectively sandbagged. The result would be a sidestepping of the structural protections outlined in <em>Garcia </em>and a return of the judges from the sidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">Insistence on express articulation of congressional purpose is not only internal to <em>Garcia, </em>but is a long-recognized safeguard of federalism. In <em>Parker v. Brown, </em>317 U.S. 341, 351, 63 S.Ct. 307, 313, 87 L.Ed. 315 (1943), the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1362-5\">In a dual system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state\u2019s control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">The <em>Parker </em>Court applied this principle by holding that the Sherman Act did not apply to state conduct, even though that act purports to govern the behavior of all \u201cpersons.\u201d <em>See also Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe, </em>442 U.S. 653, 666-68, 99 S.Ct. 2529, 2537-38, 61 L.Ed.2d 153 (1979) (\u201cwhite persons\u201d referred to in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 194 includes most artificial entities, but not states); <em>Weber v. Board of Harbor Commissioners, </em>85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 57, 70, 21 L.Ed. 798 (1873) (\u201cStatutes of limitation are not ... held to embrace the State, unless she is expressly designated, or necessarily included by the nature of the mischiefs to be remedied\u201d). In addition, in <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, </em>451 U.S. 1, 24, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 1543, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981), the Court, construing the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, demanded that Congress \u201cexpress clearly its intent to impose conditions on the grant of federal funds so that the States can knowingly decide whether or not to accept those funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-8\">The requirement of explicit statement has also long governed the applicability of federal statutes to the federal government. In <em>United States v. United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947), the Court held that the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts\u2019 prohibition of suits by \u201cemployers\u201d to enjoin strikes did not restrain the United States. The Court noted the \u201cold and well-known rule that statutes which in general terms divest preexisting rights or privileges will not be applied to the sovereign without express words to that effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272, 67 S.Ct. at 686; <em>see also United States v. Wittek, </em>337 U.S. 346, 358-59, 69 S.Ct. 1108, 1114, 93 L.Ed. 1406 (1949); <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>215 U.S. 190, 197, 30 S.Ct. 35, 54 L.Ed. 153 (1909); <em>Dollar Savings Bank v. United States, </em>86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 227, 239, 22 L.Ed. 80 (1873). Even when concerns of sovereignty are absent, the courts have insisted upon plain expressions of congressional purpose to highlight the line between congressional and judicial roles in other contexts, such as with the expressed reluctance to imply private rights of action according to needs perceived by courts. <em>See, e.g., Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 575-76, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 2489, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-9\">In short, were we writing on a clean slate, we ought unhesitatingly to apply the principle of express congressional articulation to the Jones Act. That act covers \u201c[a]ny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employ-ment____\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688. If we insisted upon explicit Congressional statement the Jones Act would not apply to state employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-11\">Yet the slate is not clean. Most relevant here, it is marked by <em>Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission, </em>359 U.S. 275, 79 S.Ct. 785, 3 L.Ed.2d 804 (1959). Like this case, <em>Petty </em>was a Jones Act suit by an injured employee of a state-operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>ferry. The <em>Petty </em>court held that because Congress did not expressly <em>exempt </em>states from the operation of the Jones Act, states were Jones Act \u201cemployers.\u201d 359 U.S. at 282-83, 79 S.Ct. at 790-791.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-4\">While <em>Garcia </em>must ultimately lead to the rejection of <em>Petty\u2019s </em>construing presumption, <em>Garcia </em>itself did not do so, because it construed a statute that expressly governs state workers. <em>Petty\u2019s </em>substantive reading of the Jones Act as covering state-employed seamen remains unquestioned in any other later Supreme Court case; the Court, rather, has chosen to distinguish <em>Petty </em>on its facts. <em>See Edelman, </em>415 U.S. at 672, 94 S.Ct. at 1360. We cannot do the same here because our case involves the same statute and, indeed, virtually identical facts. Until the Court reconsiders the Jones Act holding of <em>Petty, </em>I concede, as I must, that it binds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">If a federal statute does not expressly include state operations, it is, under my view, properly read as inapplicable to states and no question of waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity would be present. As far as the states are concerned, such a statute is identical to one that expressly exempts states. There is no federal right for state employees to lay claim to, and the state\u2019s invocation of its Eleventh Amendment immunity is not reached. Waiver of state immunity under the Eleventh Amendment would arise then only when the statute was expressly applicable to the states but silent or inexact with regard to the state\u2019s right to be free of suits by private citizens in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">I concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that Congress did not abrogate the immunity enjoyed by Texas under the Eleventh Amendment. In doing so, I reluctantly concur in its implicit conclusion that Jones Act seamen include employees of the state.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1363-7\">JOHN R. BROWN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ahg-dedup-1\">with whom ALVIN B. RUBIN, REAVLEY, POLITZ, TATE, and JOHNSON, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-8\">Because the opinion by Judge Williams for the Court treats two Supreme Court decisions as though they no longer have any binding vitality and because those decisions command a determination (i) that the Jones Act applies to vessels owned or operated by a state; and, (ii) that the abrogation of Eleventh Amendment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> immunity which is clearly established for FELA cases, is necessarily extended to the Jones Act, which incorporates FELA, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-9\">As is obvious from what I believe to be the important questions, the answer is one of Congress\u2019 constitutional power and how it has been exercised. To my way of thinking, the crucial point is whether Congress has abrogated state immunity to suit, not whether there has been a waiver on the part of Texas, a maritime employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unlike the majority, I do not see waiver as relevant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is my opinion that the Supreme Court has ruled that the FELA abrogates state Eleventh Amendment immunity. In the Jones Act case before us, involving the same statute, we cannot hold differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>\n<em>I. Admiralty Supreme</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">My view is that Article III of the Constitution gives Congress plenary power over admiralty and maritime matters. Our framers did this for a very understandable reason. Almost all commerce at the time of our nation\u2019s founding was waterborne. In order to allow for the free flow of trade across occasionally jealous and protectionist state boundaries, the delegates meeting in Philadelphia made Congress the custodian of power over both interstate commerce and admiralty. Moreover, the Constitution makes a distinction between its grant to Congress of power over interstate commerce and its allocation to the federal government of exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty. As I see it, this distinction in phraseology was deliberate then, and is of crucial significance now. It is crucial because Congress is given a special interest in maintaining the uniformity of admiralty and has exercised its plenary power over maritime matters in enacting the Jones Act. In doing so,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-5\">[Tjheir purpose was not to strike down or abrogate the system, but to place the entire subject \u2014 its substantive as well as its procedural features \u2014 under national control because of it intimate relations to navigation and to interstate and foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1364-6\"><em>Panama Railroad Co. v. Johnson, </em>264 U.S. 375, 386, 44 S.Ct. 391, 393, 68 L.Ed. 748, 755 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-7\">In exercising its exclusive power over admiralty, Congress chose expressly to make the provisions of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51 <em>et seq., </em>an integral part of the Jones Act. If there was any question about this incorporation from the statutory language or legislative history of the Jones Act, a long line of Supreme Court decisions has removed all doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since this incorporation has been determined to be constitutional, the question for us to resolve is whether there is any collision between Congress\u2019 plenary admiralty power and the Eleventh Amendment. My view is that the framers\u2019 interest in the uniformity of admiralty \u2014 revealed in the almost unquestioned delegation of power over admiralty matters to the United States government with little dissent even on the part of the antifederal-ists \u2014 mandates the conclusion that Texas, as a maritime employer, is subject to the Jones Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-10\">A remaining consideration then is whether the Eleventh Amendment, under the interpretations given it by the Supreme Court that extend its scope beyond the face of its language, bars federal court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-11\">This dissent is divided into the following analytical framework: Part II discusses the plenary nature of the admiralty power granted to Congress by the Constitution. Part III deals with the Jones Act, its incorporation of the FELA, and its abrogation of state immunity. Part IV then considers the Supreme Court\u2019s recent pronouncements on federalism in <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Atas-cadero.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1364-12\">\n<em>II. Congress\u2019 Admiralty Power is Plenary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-13\">As the Jones Act begins with Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, so do I. This article extends the judicial power of the United States \u201cto all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\u201d. In addition, Article I, Section 8, confers upon Congress the power \u201cto make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States or in any department or offices therecf.\u201d In <em>South</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number><em>ern Pacific Co. v.

Stewart, </em>253 U.S. 149, 156, 40 S.Ct. 438, 64 L.Ed. 834, 838 (1920), \u201cthe necessary consequence [of any other conclusion] would be destruction of the very uniformity in respect of maritime matters which the Constitution was designed to establish.\u201d The Constitution</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay5q\">took from the states all power, by legislation or judicial decision, to contravene the essential purposes of, or to work material injury to, characteristic features of such law, or to interfere with its proper harmony and uniformity in its international and interstate relations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1365-13\"><em>Id. </em>253 U.S. at 160, 40 S.Ct. at 440. In <em>Knickerbocker </em>the Court also recognized, and chose to emphasize, that Congress\u2019 admiralty power was much greater than its power to regulate interstate commerce. \u201cThe distinction between the indicated situation created by the Constitution relative to maritime affairs and the one resulting from the mere grant of power to regulate commerce, without more, should not be forgotten.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 40 S.Ct. at 440.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>Thus, the plenary power of Congress over admiralty has long been upheld.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is more extensive than Congress\u2019 power over interstate commerce. If, however, Congress neglects to expressly include the states within the scope of a maritime enactment \u2014 as it did in passing the Jones Act\u2014 there remains the question of whether the statute applies to the states. Our inquiry must focus on the congressional abrogation of state immunity under the Jones Act; if abrogation is found, the Eleventh Amendment does not forbid suit in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">\n<em>III. The Jones Act Abrogates State Immunity to Suit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-Pk\">The Jones Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMDv\"><em>any seaman </em>who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action <em>all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common law right or remedy in case of personal injury to railroad employees shall apply; </em>and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable. <em>Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">The FELA, incorporated by the Jones Act, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-8\"><em>[ejvery common carrier </em>by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several states ... <em>shall be liable </em>in damages <em>to any person </em>suffering injury while he is <em>employed by any such carrier </em>in such commerce ... [and that] [u]nder this chapter an <em>action may be brought in a district court of the United </em>States____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-9\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51, 56 (emphasis added). In <em>Panama Railroad Co. v. Johnson, </em>264 U.S. 375, 44 S.Ct. 391, 68 L.Ed. 748 (1924), the Supreme Court expressly held that the Jones Act was enacted pursuant to Congress\u2019 admiralty powers. <em>See also Engel v. Davenport, </em>271 U.S. 33, 46 S.Ct. 410, 70 L.Ed. 813 (1926); <em>Kendell v. United States, </em>37 U.S. 524 (12 Pet. 524), 9 L.Ed. 1181 (1838); <em>In re Health, </em>144 U.S. 92, 12 S.Ct. 615, 36 L.Ed. 358 (1892). The extent to which Congress forbade any limitation, restriction, or reduction of these rights is reflected in \u00a7 55 of FELA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-10\">Any contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever, the purpose of intent of which shall be to enable any common carrier to exempt itself from any liability created by this chapter, shall to that extent be void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-11\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 55. This broad, remedial statute provides a remedy to <em>all seamen; </em>thus, I now turn to consider whether this exercise of plenary authority over admiralty is on a collision course with the Eleventh Amendment when it is invoked to provide a remedy for a state-employed seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-12\">\n<em>Petty is Decisive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6q\">\n<em>Jones Act Applies to States</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-13\">There is no question whether the Jones Act applies to state-operated vessels.

Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission, </em>359 U.S. 275, 79 S.Ct. 785, 3 L.Ed.2d 804 (1959).

The Jones Act (46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688) has no exceptions from the broad sweep of the words \u201cAny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may\u201d etc. The rationale of <em>United States v.

Adding universality to the term \u201cany seaman\u201d in the Jones Act is the Court\u2019s observation that \u201c[tjhere is no more apt illustration of the involvement of the commerce power and the power over maritime matters than the Jones Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 79 S.Ct. at 789-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">\n<em>Parden is the Answer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ac5-dedup-0\">Within five years of <em>Petty\u2019s </em>determination that the Jones Act applies to state-operated vessels, <em>Parden v. Terminal Railway Co., </em>377 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1207, 12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964), held that FELA was effective to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity for a state-operated, interstate railway. <em>Parden </em>is still the law. It has yet to be overruled, and its constant citation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is living proof that it is still alive, well and controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-12\">Although some of the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Parden </em>speaks in terms of a \u201cwaiver\u201d by Alabama of its immunity to suit, I firmly believe that <em>Parden </em>stands for Congress\u2019 abrogation of the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity in FELA. The essential principle of <em>Parden </em>is that \u201cwhen a state leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own and enters into activities subject to congressional regulation, it subjects itself to that regulation as fully as if it were a private person or corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>377 U.S. at 196, 84 S.Ct. at 1215. This is shown convincingly from the structure of the Court\u2019s reasoning. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASH\">By adopting and ratifying the Commerce Clause, the states empowered Congress to create such a right of action against interstate railroads; by enacting the FELA in the exercise of this power, Congress conditioned the right to operate a railroad in interstate commerce upon amenability to suit in federal court as provided by the Act; by thereafter operating a railroad in interstate commerce, Alabama must be taken to have accepted that condition and thus consented to suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqDz\"><em>Id. </em>377 U.S. at 192, 84 S.Ct. at 1213. While the Court speaks occasionally in terms of waiver, its rationale is really one of the exercise of constitutional power.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>talk of waiver was purely a palliative for holding states subject to the act of Congress. A spoonful of sugar always helps the medicine go down. Indeed, in its discussion of the palliative nature of waiver, the <em>Parden </em>Court reveals that congressional power \u2014 not consent or acquiescence by Alabama \u2014 is what is at stake because otherwise \u201cthe congressional power to condition such an act upon amenability to suit would be meaningless if the state, on the basis of its own law or intention, could conclusively deny the waiver and shake off the condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>377 U.S. at 196, 84 S.Ct. at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">Thus, the allusions to waiver, despite later efforts to structure or depict them as such, are by no means the Court\u2019s basis for holding Alabama liable in <em>Parden. </em>This can be seen from the way in which the Court stated the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1368-5\">Here, for the first time in this court, a state\u2019s claim of immunity against suit by an individual meets a suit brought upon a cause of action expressly created by Congress. Two questions are thus presented (1) did Congress in enacting the FELA intend to subject a state to suit in these circumstances? (2) did it have the power to do so, as against the state\u2019s claim of immunity?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1368-6\"><em>Id. </em>377 U.S. at 187, 84 S.Ct. at 1210.

It found that an exercise of pure power on the part of Congress was sufficient to abrogate the states\u2019 immunity. The states had ceded to Congress, for the national good that uniformity would bring, that portion of their sovereignty dealing with the power to regulate interstate commerce. In the Court\u2019s view, the decision to regulate employers of interstate railway workers, be they private parties or state governments, was for Congress alone.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1368-12\">While a state\u2019s immunity from suit by a citizen without its consent has been said to be rooted in the \u2018inherent nature of sovereignty,\u2019 the states surrendered a portion of their sovereignty when they granted Congress the power to regulate commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1368-13\">If Congress made the judgment that, in view of the dangers of railroad work and the difficulty of recovering for personal injuries under existing rules, railroad workers in interstate commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>should be provided with the right of action created by the FELA, we should not presume to say, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, that it intended to exclude a particular group of such workers from the benefits conferred by the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\"><em>Id. </em>377 U.S. at 191, 84 S.Ct. at 1212 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">In language about the commerce power which rings even truer about Congress\u2019 power over admiralty, the <em>Parden </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1369-6\">This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution---- If, as has always been understood, the sovereignty of Congress, though limited to specified objects is plenary as to those objects, the power over commerce within foreign states, and among the several states, is vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single government, having in its constitution the same restrictions on the exercise of the power as are found in the Constitution of the United States. <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>9 Wheat 1, 196-97, 6 L.Ed. 23, 70 (1824).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1369-8\"><em>Id. </em>377 U.S. at 191, 84 S.Ct. at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-9\">The admiralty power is more extensive than the commerce power, in the sense of the states\u2019 inability to infringe upon admiralty\u2019s national uniformity. The Jones Act, an exercise of this broad, plenary power, by its very terms incorporates the FELA which the Supreme Court holds abrogates a state\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity. In light of these observations, <em>Parden, </em>which abolished state immunity for state railroad employees covered by the FELA, must do the same for state seamen because their rights come from the same statute. \u201cBy engaging in the railroad business a state cannot withdraw the railroad from the power of the federal government to regulate commerce.\u201d <em>New York v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 572, 582, 66 S.Ct. 310, 314, 90 L.Ed. 326, 333 (1946). Similarly, by operating a ferry, the State of Texas cannot remove the ship or the seamen on her from the power of the federal government to regulate maritime activities. <em>See Foremost Insurance Co. v. Richardson, </em>457 U.S. 668, 674-75, 102 S.Ct. 2654, 2658, 73 L.Ed.2d 300, 306 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-11\">\n<em>Fifth Circuit Bridge Act Cases Inconsequential</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">The importance of Congress providing a private cause of action as evidence of an intent to abrogate the states\u2019 immunity to suit is nicely shown in reverse by our cases considering the Bridge Act: <em>Intracoastal Transportation v. Decatur County, Georgia, </em>482 F.2d 361 (5th Cir.1973), and <em>Freim-anis v. Sea-Land Service, </em>654 F.2d 1155 (5th Cir.1981). In <em>Intracoastal </em>we concluded that the \u201cBridge Act of 1906 does not create a cause of action in private parties\u201d; consequently, we sustained the state\u2019s claim to immunity. Similarly, in <em>Freiman-is </em>we focused on the lack of a private remedy for violations of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899. We specifically juxtaposed Congress\u2019 lack of intention to give a private cause of action in these Acts with Congress\u2019 clear intention to sanction private action in the FELA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Pf\">Congress in exercising this regulatory authority over navigation did not, as it had in the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, create any civil cause of action in favor of private parties injured by any violation of the Act.

Thus, in contradistinction to the Jones Act and its incorporation of the FELA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap1\">the presently relevant statute regulating the bridging of navigable streams does not confer any new civil remedy upon private parties and thus cannot by logical inference be read as intended to impose equivalent civil liability upon an otherwise immune state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1369-14\"><em>Red Star Towing, </em>423 F.2d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-15\">\n<em>Parden is Still Alive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AD-I\">The majority suggests \u2014 if it does not squarely hold \u2014 that <em>Parden </em>has been sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>nificantly limited by the Supreme Court in <em>Employees v. Dept. of Public Health, </em>411 U.S. 279, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973), and in <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). In note 1 of <em>Employees </em>the majority states that <em>Parden </em>was premised on the conclusion that Alabama, by operating the railroad, had consented to suit in the federal courts under the FELA. I simply do not subscribe to this view. I believe that the essential principle of <em>Parden </em>\u2014 state liability to federal suit when Congress acts pursuant to a plenary power \u2014 remains unaffected by <em>Employees </em>and <em>Edelman, </em>and I now consider the very different situations before the Court in the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">The Court in <em>Employees </em>stated that <em>Par-den </em>concerned only a rather isolated state activity, whereas <em>Employees </em>dealt potentially with all office workers in the state government of Missouri. Most importantly, <em>Employees </em>concerned the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). By the very terms of the original FLSA, states were exempted from coverage. Confusion arose because of a later congressional amendment that concerned state hospital employees. The Court decided that it would:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-5\">be surprising in the present case to infer that Congress deprived Missouri of her constitutional immunity without changing the old \u00a7 16(b) under which she could not be sued or indicating in some way by clear language that the constitutional immunity was swept away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\"><em>Employees </em>411 U.S. at 285, 93 S.Ct. at 1618.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">In <em>Employees </em>the Court merely declined \u201cto extend <em>Parden </em>to cover every exercise by Congress of its commerce power, where the purpose of Congress to give force to the Supremacy Clause by lifting the sovereignty of the states and putting the states on the same footing as other employers is not clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>411 U.S. at 286-87, 93 S.Ct. at 1618-19. Thus, the Court refused to find abrogation of state immunity because there was a confusing expression on the part of Congress. First the FLSA had clearly exempted states; a later amendment then introduced confusion. There is no such confusion with the Jones Act or the FELA. It has long been established that the FELA includes <em>every </em>employer and gives <em>every </em>employee of an interstate railroad a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-9\">Indeed, using the Supreme Court\u2019s own method of distinguishing <em>Employees </em>from <em>Parden, </em>we have in the case before us only the isolated activity of operating a ferry. This activity is the equivalent of the operation of a railroad in interstate commerce through the Jones Act\u2019s incorporation of FELA. It is not the widespread type of intrusion upon all governmental functions of the states that would have resulted from extending FLSA in <em>Employees. </em>In <em>Employees, </em>the Court\u2019s reluctance to find the necessary intention to include the states within the FLSA was influenced by Congress\u2019 confusing amendments. This confusion, as the Supreme Court held, showed a lack of congressional intention to abrogate the states\u2019 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">The next case setting out the Supreme Court\u2019s approach to the Eleventh Amendment and state immunity is <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). The Court in <em>Edelman </em>examined Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD), a federal program funded by the state and federal governments, and administered by state officials. <em>Edelman </em>had to deal with both <em>Parden </em>and <em>Employees. </em>The Court, emphasizing the critical significance of abrogation and the absence of a private right of action, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afr\">the question of waiver or consent under the Eleventh Amendment was found in those eases to turn on <em>whether Congress had intended to abrogate the immunity </em>in question, and whether the state by its participation in the program authorized by Congress had in effect consented to the abrogation of this immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-11\"><em>But in this case the threshold fact of congressional authorization to sue a class of defendants which literally includes states is wholly absent. </em>Thus, respondent is not only precluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>relying on this court\u2019s holding in <em>Employees, </em>but on this court\u2019s holding in <em>Parden </em>and <em>Petty </em>as well, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-4\"><em>Edelman </em>415 U.S. at 672, 94 S.Ct. at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">Thus, in <em>Edelman, </em>a class action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against state administrators, the Court applied an analysis to the AABD which lends support to my view that <em>Parden </em>was not limited by <em>Employees. </em>The Court\u2019s language indicates that its note one in <em>Employees </em>was an overly broad attempt to distinguish <em>Par-den </em>because, unlike the <em>Employees </em>note, <em>Edelman </em>says <em>Parden </em>was founded on Congressional intent \u2014 and power \u2014 to abrogate state immunity by creating a private cause of action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, <em>Edelman </em>uses the same analysis to distinguish <em>Employees </em>which I maintain distinguishes <em>Employees </em>from <em>Parden: </em>that is, <em>Edelman </em>read <em>Employees </em>as a case which focused on the confusion Congress created in the FLSA by first exempting the states, then trying to include part of their workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">As I have stated, there has never been any confusion about the Jones Act\u2019s incorporation of the FELA\u2019s clear language and its binding application to state operated vessels; and FELA has long been held to apply to the states and to abrogate their Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit in federal court. When it is understood that <em>Edelman </em>was concerned only with state participation in a program through which the federal government provided assistance for the state\u2019s operation of a system of public aid, it comes as no surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was held to be a bar to suit in federal court. In grant-in-aid programs, the principle of state court adjudication is clear unless Congress expressly indicates that the program allows suit in federal court. But the <em>Edelman </em>Court\u2019s discussion of waiver places no restriction upon <em>Parden\u2019s </em>holding that FELA abrogates state immunity to suit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\"><em>IV. The Rationales of </em>Garcia &amp; Atas-cadero <em>Support the Jones Act Abrogation of the State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-14\">The recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court in its continuing exegesis of the role of the several states in the federal system are reminiscent of Doctor Doolittle\u2019s two-headed llama, the Pushmi-Pul-lyu.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Since the case before us was argued, the Supreme Court has handed down Garcia<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and Atascadero,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I confront <em>Garcia </em>because of its focus upon the structure of our federal system. I must similarly confront <em>Atascadero </em>because of the sweeping language which the Court used in interpreting the scope of the Eleventh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>Amendment. While it is my opinion that on .the facts before us <em>Parden </em>and <em>Petty </em>establish Texas\u2019 liability to federal suit under the Jones Act because the Supreme Court has never disturbed their holdings, I also believe that, properly understood, <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Atascadero </em>do not detract from my conclusion that the. Jones Act effectively abrogates Texas\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">The significance of <em>Garcia </em>is its focus upon the political process as the best way for the states to protect themselves from unduly broad regulation by the federal government in our federal system. <em>Garcia </em>is an important case not only for what it says, but for the posture in which the decision comes down. It stands for the proposition that states must fight for their sovereignty in the political arena. In essence, the water-mark for state sovereignty was illustrated by <em>National League of Cities,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>concern for the integrity of traditional governmental functions and by <em>Pennhursf </em>s <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> concern for \u201cclear statements\u201d in grant-in-aid programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">Now, however, the Court has handed down <em>Garcia </em>in its repudiation of its decision in <em>National League of Cities. </em>I believe <em>Garcia </em>reaffirms the principles of <em>Parden. </em>When Congress acts pursuant to a plenary power \u2014 one unrestrained within its constitutionally delegated bounds \u2014 the states must be affirmatively exempted through the political process if they are to escape inclusion within a regulatory scheme in an area where national uniformity is important.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">In <em>Garcia, </em>the Supreme Court looked to the political process, not the judicial process, for the states\u2019 power to protect themselves from excessive congressional regulation. This requires an affirmative act on the part of Congress to exclude states from the reach of its plenary power \u2014 in holding otherwise, the majority risks attributing to Congress the. now judicially discredited distinctions between traditional state governmental and nongovernmental functions. <em>Garcia </em>clearly rejected this method of analysis which has been generated by <em>National League of Cities. </em>Accordingly, it is for Congress, influenced by state involvement in the legislative process, to restrain itself in the exercise of its plenary powers to the proper amount of congressional regulation of the states. Any other reading violates <em>Garcia\u2019s </em>clear command that federal judges should not intrude into the political process.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-14\"><em>Garcia, </em>which did not even involve the Eleventh Amendment, cannot be forced into the express reference mold. Its focus upon the political process to protect the states is federalism as reflected by <em>Parden </em>and <em>Petty, </em>not the federalism of <em>National League of Cities.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-15\">The holding of <em>Garcia </em>was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-16\">We perceive nothing in the overtime and minimum-wage requirements of the FLSA, as applied to SAMTA, that is destructive of state sovereignty or violative of any constitutional provision. SAMTA faces nothing more than the same minimum wage and overtime obligations that hundreds of thousands of other employers, public as well as private, have to meet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-17\"><em>Id. </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. at 1020, 83 L.Ed.2d at 1036. The rationale behind the Court\u2019s conclusion that a state governmental agency was subject to the FLSA was that the states must protect themselves by participation in the political process. Indeed, the Court observed that \u201cthe principal and basic limit on the federal commerce power is that inherent in all congressional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>action \u2014 the built-in restraints that our system provides through state participation in federal governmental action. The political process ensures that laws that unduly burden the states will not be promulgated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. at 1020, 83 L.Ed.2d at 1037.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\"><em>Garcia </em>stands for the proposition that states retain sovereign authority \u201conly to the extent that the Constitution has not divested them of their original powers and transferred those powers to the federal government.\u201d <em>Garcia </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. at 1017, 83 L.Ed.2d at 1033. The admiralty power, like that over commerce, was expressly delegated to the national government by the Constitution. <em>Garcia </em>makes clear that federal legislation constitutionally may apply to state activities. In doing so, it restores full force to the Court\u2019s earlier decisions in <em>Parden </em>and <em>Petty. </em>Therefore, the constitutional power rationale that <em>Parden </em>applied to uphold FELA\u2019s application to the states as an employer still stands.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">The Court, supporting its conclusion that \u201cour federalism\u201d requires that the states affirmatively exempt themselves from federal regulation, listed many of the federal regulatory schemes which specifically exempt the states and their subdivisions. Conspicuous by their absence from the Court\u2019s partial catalogue are the two statutes at issue in this case: FELA and the Jones Act. Most important for a correct understanding of <em>Garcia, </em>however, is that the court chose as its illustration those programs which specifically exempted the states from regulation. In matters within its plenary power \u2014 admiralty and commerce \u2014 Congress is not required to expressly incorporate the states within the regulatory scheme. The states are already on notice of Congressional authority in those areas because it results from the states\u2019 own constitutional cession of power over them to the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-17\">In the context of a plenary power the message of <em>Garcia </em>is that Congress intends to act to the full extent of its power \u2014 unless it places some limitation upon its own actions. The fact that Congress in the past may not have exercised its delegated powers to their full extent is not sufficient reason to adopt the express articulation doctrine. <em>Garcia </em>has not mandated such a course, and I do not believe <em>Atas-cadero </em>compels a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-18\"><em>Atascadero </em>is a case which arose under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, an anti-discrimination statute enacted pursuant to the powers granted to Congress by the Fourteenth Amendment. In a sweeping opinion for a divided court, Justice Powell wrote</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a4x-dedup-0\">in determining whether Congress in exercising <em>its Fourteenth Amendment powers </em>has abrogated the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity, we have required <em>an unequivocal expression of Congressional intent to overturn </em>the constitutionally guaranteed immunity of the several states.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number><em>Atascadero, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 105 S.Ct. at 3146, 87 L.Ed.2d at 178, <em>citing Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v.

I believe, however, that <em>Atascadero </em>by the use of the very words refers to the extent of state Eleventh Amendment immunity when considering congressional acts under the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\"><em>Atascadero </em>was a suit seeking to vindicate rights granted to the handicapped under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

The complexity and breadth of such orders is exemplified by <em>Ruiz v.

State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over cases involving the redress of rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and in certain circumstances, the existence of an adequate state remedy for an alleged violation of federal rights may even preclude access to a federal forum. <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 543-44, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1917, 68 L.Ed.2d 420, 433-34 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">Clear statement in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment is imperative, if federal intrusion upon the state\u2019s domain is not to \u201cprevent the making of social experiments that an important part of the community desires, in the insulated chambers afforded by the several States.\u201d <em>Truax v. Corrigan, </em>257 U.S. 312, 343, 42 S.Ct. 124, 133, 66 L.Ed. 254 (1921) (Holmes, J. dissenting).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When however, state experimentation threatens to trench upon areas reserved for the plenary exercise of <em>federal </em>power, I believe the state\u2019s experiment must fail. So it is when state economic regulations are held to be preempted by the federal commerce power of Art. I \u00a7 8; so it must be when a state\u2019s assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity threatens to displace a uniform, federal remedial statute enacted pursuant to the Congress\u2019 plenary authority over admiralty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-8\">Admiralty is a fundamental area marked by the constitution in which the states have surrendered their power to the federal government. The plenary power over admiralty, more extensive even than that over commerce, was one of the fundamental precepts upon which the Republic was founded.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The states\u2019 surrender of sovereignty in this area was present in the plan of the convention from its inception,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and has continued unchallenged and unrestricted to the present day. The states have been on notice of the scope of this federal authority since the founding of the Republic. They relinquished it in order that a fledgling nation might build a <em>national, </em>sea-going trade. It is not for Texas, after more than one hundred forty years as a member of the Union, to assert that its sovereignty over maritime matters is somehow greater than that which was ceded to the national government by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">The Jones Act poses no threat of massive, unanticipated federal intrusion upon the traditional domain of the several states. There was, and is, no need for clear statement on the part of Congress to inform the states of its intention to occupy the field in this area. The entire domain of maritime activities has been occupied by the federal presence since 1789, and exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty appears in the text of the Constitution itself. Art. Ill \u00a7 2. The Jones Act, as an appropriate exercise of the plenary authority of Congress over maritime affairs, provides sufficiently clear notice to the states of the congressional intent. There was no need at the time of the enactment of the Jones Act, at the time of the decision concerning FELA in <em>Parden, </em>or at the present time in view of <em>Employees, Edelman, Garcia, </em>and <em>Atascadero, </em>for Congress specifically to declare that the states were subject to federal court suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>under the Jones Act. To my way of thinking, then, the Jones Act is sufficient to abrogate Texas\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit for injuries that arise out of its operation of a ferry system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">\n<em>Congressional Treatment of Federally-Employed.

As the federal power over admiralty is plenary, the federal government is entitled to do with it as it will. The question is not what Congress has done with its own employees alone, the question is what has it chosen to do with all other maritime employees. Occasionally Congress has provided that federally employed seamen be covered by the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101. But this has not always been so when conditions \u2014 war conditions \u2014 suggest a change to traditional seamen\u2019s remedies.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">How Congress treats federally-employed seamen simply has nothing to do with its determination that state-employed seamen are covered by the Jones Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">It is my view that a substantial and settled body of Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence has established that Congress can abrogate a state\u2019s immunity to suit. In both <em>Parden </em>and <em>Employees, </em>the Court recognized that Congress has the power to bring \u201cthe States to heel, in the sense of lifting their immunity from suit in a federal court.\u201d <em>Employees, </em>411 U.S. at 283, 93 S.Ct. at 1617. While Congress can induce states to waive their immunity in grant-in-aid programs, Congress is not limited to such indirect action. I believe the Supreme Court has clearly held that the national legislature possesses the power to override the Eleventh Amendment directly, without resort to any theory of state consensual waiver, when Congress acts pursuant to a plenary power given to achieve the framers\u2019 goal of uniformity. The Supreme Court has ruled that FELA meets this standard for abrogation of state immunity to suit. In this Jones Act case, involving the same statute, it is not for us to say differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-16\">Welch\u2019s claim as a blue water seafarer should proceed in the Federal Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1363-10\">. The Eleventh Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1363-11\">The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1363-12\">. Much of the confusion in Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence derives from courts' casual use of the terms waiver, consent, and abrogation. Actually, these terms represent distinct concepts and the difference between them is crucial for a correct understanding of the case before us. Waiver or consent concerns a state\u2019s acquiescence, either expressly or impliedly; abrogation deals with congressional action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1363-15\">. The majority concludes that waiver is applicable only to suits brought by private citizens. With this I have no disagreement. The opinion also concludes that a state\u2019s refusal to waive has broader implications than just barring suits in federal court. Regardless of the merits of this analysis, I believe it has no application to the case before us because the Jones Act, passed pursuant to Congress\u2019 plenary admiralty power has been held to include the states.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1364-8\">. Indeed, the Supreme Court in <em>Panama Railroad Co. v. Johnson, </em>264 U.S. 375, 44 S.Ct. 391, 68 L.Ed. 748 (1924), considered the Jones Act\u2019s incorporation of the FELA in an attack upon the Jones Act's constitutionality. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcK\">[c]riticism is made of the statute because it does not set forth the new rules but merely adopts them by a generic reference. But the criticism is without merit. The reference ... is a recognized mode of incorporating one statute or system of statutes into another, and serves to bring into the latter all that is fairly covered by the reference.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">. Today in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1), Congress has vested in federal district courts original and exclusive jurisdiction over \"[a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases other remedies to which they are entitled.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">. The <em>Garnett </em>Court stated: \u201c[t]he Constitution must have referred to a system of law co-extensive with, and operating uniformly in, the whole country. <em>It certainly could not have been the intention to place the rules and limits of maritime law under the disposal and regulation of the several states, as that would have defeated the uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution aimed </em>on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the intercourse of the states with each other or with foreign states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1365-8\">.

Dawson &amp; Co., </em>264 U.S. 219, 224, 44 S.Ct. 302, 68 L.Ed. 646 (1924), the Supreme Court said \"well established is the rule that state statutes may not contravene an applicable act of Congress, or affect the general maritime law____ No such legislation is valid if it contravenes the essential purpose expressed by an act of Congress, or works a material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, or interferes with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations. This limitation, at the least, is essential to the effective operation of the fundamental purposes for which such law was incorporated into our national laws by the Constitution itself.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1365-17\">. As a further demonstration of Congress\u2019 plenary power over admiralty matters, consider the Admiralty Jurisdiction Extension Act. This Act, which extends the reach of the admiralty courts beyond what was commonly accepted as a limit on their power, has been held constitutional as against contentions that it was an unauthorized congressional extension of admiralty and mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>time jurisdiction. <em>See United States v.

As recently as the preceding term, the Supreme Court has cited <em>Parden </em>as a precedent controlling its decisions on Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>See County of Oneida, New York v.

Under this approach, the state waived its immunity from suit in federal court at the same time it surrendered its sovereign immunity and gave Congress the power to legislate under delegated powers. As recognized by Chief Justice Hughes in an early case involving sovereign immunity, \"States of the Union, still possessing attributes of sovereignty, shall be immune from suits, without their consent, save where there has been \u2018a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Monaco v.
