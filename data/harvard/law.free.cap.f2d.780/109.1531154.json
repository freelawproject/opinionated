Although the Act\u2019s definition of \u201csingle-line rate\u201d is not free from ambiguity, <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(b)(1) (1982), its legislative history leaves no doubt that Congress intended to prohibit collective ratemaking for transportation service provided by a single carrier from shipper to consignee. This prohibition applies whether or not other carriers provide the same single-line service at the same rate. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1069, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 27-28 (1980), U.S.Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1980, p. 2283; S.Rep. No. 641, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1980). <em>See also Western Railroads </em>\u2014 Agreement, 358 ICC 662, 667-670 (1978) (interpreting an identical prohibition on collective rate-making for \u201csingle-line rates\u201d in the \u201c4R\u201d Act two years prior to the passage of the Motor Carrier Act); Motor Carrier Rate-making Study Comm\u2019n, Collective Rate-making in the Trucking Industry 499 (1983) (supporting this interpretation of \u201csingle-line rate\u201d after passage of the Act). Petitioner suggests, however, that the prohibition on single-line rates was merely intended to prevent collective ratemaking for rates that were proposed by a single carrier and where no other carrier provides that service at that rate. As we read petitioner\u2019s definition, it would make the prohibition on single-line rates wholly redundant of the provisions of the Act that already allow for \u201cindependent action\u201d by a single carrier. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(b)(3)(B)(ii) (1982). Given the fundamental importance of the Motor Carrier Act\u2019s repeal of antitrust immunity for single-line ratemaking, <em>see </em>S.Rep. No. 641, <em>supra, </em>at 13, petitioner\u2019s interpretation borders on the frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
