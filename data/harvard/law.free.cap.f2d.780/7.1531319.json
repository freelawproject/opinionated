Nole &amp; Sons, Inc. (Nole), against the debtor, Mohawk Frozen Foods, Inc. (Mohawk), was based on a \u201cwilfully exaggerated\u201d mechanic\u2019s lien under New York Lien Law \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 39-a. The United States District Court for the Western District of New York, Neal P. McCurn, J., affirmed a decision of Bankruptcy Judge Leon J. Marketos that held that (1) the lien had not been timely filed and was therefore invalid and (2) the lien had not been \u201cwilfully exaggerated.\u201d The Creditors Committee of the unsecured creditors appeals the latter determination. We affirm the decision on a different ground from that relied on by the courts below, and deny appellee\u2019s request for attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Appellee Nole, a contractor, performed extensive remodeling work on Mohawk\u2019s property, a seafood restaurant, under an oral agreement entered into sometime in 1978. On December 14, 1981, Nole filed a mechanic\u2019s lien in the Oneida County Clerk\u2019s Office for $100,015.99 in unpaid debts out of a total of $218,074.05 in labor and materials Nole had assertedly provided to Mohawk. Nole moved to foreclose the lien in early 1982, but these proceedings were not concluded by February 8, 1983 when a petition for reorganization of Mohawk under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code was filed. In March 1984, Nole sought to enforce the mechanic\u2019s lien in the bankruptcy court by moving for a declaration that the mechanic\u2019s lien was valid and for liquidation of the debtor\u2019s assets to satisfy the lien on a priority basis. The Creditors Committee submitted an answer challenging the validity of Nole\u2019s claim on several grounds, and a counterclaim for damages under sections 39 and 39-a of the New York Lien Law because the lien had been \u201cwilfully exaggerated.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the bankruptcy judge ruled that the lien underlying Nole\u2019s claim had not been filed in the Oneida County Clerk\u2019s Office within the four-month period then applicable under New York Lien Law, \u00a7 10, and was therefore invalid. The effect of this ruling was to relegate Nole\u2019s claim to the status of an unsecured debt. The bankruptcy judge also reduced one of the items in Nole\u2019s claim by $3,000. However, the judge denied the Creditors Committee\u2019s claim that because the amount of the lien had been \u201cwilfully exaggerated\u201d Nole was liable to the debtor for the amount of the exaggeration, plus attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The Creditors Committee appealed the denial of its claim of wilful exaggeration to the district court. Nole tells us that although it took steps to appeal the decision invalidating the lien, it did not follow through because the assets of the bankruptcy estate did not justify further litigation on the issue. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision in part and remanded it for additional findings regarding two challenged items in Nole\u2019s claim. The bankruptcy court again found no wilful exaggeration. The district court affirmed, and the Creditors Committee appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The Creditors Committee argues, as it did to the district court, that the bankruptcy judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous, and that Nole should be found liable to it in the sum of $92,980.95, the amount of Nole\u2019s wilful exaggeration of its lien. Although there is at least a question whether the record supports all of the findings below, we need not reach the issue whether there was wilful exaggeration. Nole correctly argues that damages under section 39-a may not be imposed when a mechanic\u2019s lien has been discharged for reasons other than \u201cwilful exaggeration.\u201d A strict reading of the language of the statute compels this result. Section 39 authorizes the court to declare a lien void and deny recovery if the lienor has wilfully exaggerated the amount claimed. Section 39-a, which must be read in tandem with section 39, <em>Goodman v. Del-Sa-Co. Foods, </em>15 N.Y.2d 191, 198, 257 N.Y.S.2d 142, 205 N.E.2d 288 (1965), permits the court to impose liability on a lienor \u201c[wjhere ... the court shall have declared said lien to be void <em>on account of </em>wilful exaggeration ...\u201d (emphasis added). Nole\u2019s lien was invalidated on independent procedural grounds, and section 39-a is therefore inapplicable. <em>Joe Smith, Inc. v. Otis-Charles Corp., </em>279 App.Div. 1, 107 N.Y.S.2d 233 (1951), aff\u2019d mem., 304 N.Y. 684, 107 N.E.2d 598 (1952). In <em>Smith, </em>the court affirmed the dismissal of a counterclaim under 39-a, stating that once \u201cthe lien was discharged for patent defects appearing on its face ... there remained no lien to be foreclosed or to be declared void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>107 N.Y.S.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">We recognize that this strict interpretation of the statute permits assessment of damages for wilful exaggeration against a lienor who submits an otherwise proper claim, while a more careless lienor may be exempted from the reach of that penalty provision. However, this is apparently a peculiarity of the New York Lien Law. In <em>Smith, </em>the unsuccessful defendant raised similar concerns. Acknowledging that the argument was not without force, the court nonetheless noted that the appellant was seeking to invoke \u201ca highly penal statute.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5n\">One of the well-settled canons of statutory construction is that purely statutory offenses cannot be established by implication. Acts cannot be held to be penal in nature unless there is a clear and unequivocal expression of the legislative intent to make them such____ We cannot believe that the Legislature intended so drastic a remedy to be available to an owner except in the case where the lien is valid in all other respects and the owner must await a determination of an extended trial in a foreclosure action to have the lien declared void and discharged by reason of its exaggeration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL\"><em>Id. </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The New York courts have interpreted sections 39 and 39-a extremely narrowly. In <em>Goodman, </em>supra, the New York Court of Appeals construed the language of section 39-a to permit recovery of damages only for the wilfully exaggerated portions of an otherwise inaccurate claim that had been invalidated under section 39, 15 N.Y.2d at 196, 257 N.Y.S.2d 142, 205 N.E.2d 288. The burden of proving such wilful exaggeration is on the party seeking damages. <em>Id. </em>at 194, 257 N.Y.S.2d 142, 205 N.E.2d 288. Stressing the harshness of the statute, <em>Good,man </em>noted that a diligent search had turned up only one reported case in which section 39-a damages had been granted. <em>Id. </em>at 198, 257 N.Y.S.2d 142, 205 N.E.2d 288. Although cases since then have added to that number, see, e.g., <em>A &amp; E Plumbing, Inc. v. Budoff, </em>66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>A.D.2d 455, 413 N.Y.S.2d 776 (1979), <em>Goodman </em>\u2019s strict construction of the statute has been consistently followed. See, e.g., <em>Howdy Jones Construction Co. v. Parklaw Realty, </em>76 A.D.2d 1018, 429 N.Y.S.2d 768 (1980), aff\u2019d, 53 N.Y.2d 718, 439 N.Y.S.2d 354, 421 N.E.2d 846 (1981). In this case, appellee concededly did extensive work on Mohawk\u2019s restaurant and has already had its lienor claim for part of that work transformed into a general unsecured claim that is apparently worth very little. Applying the statute here and requiring appellee not only to undergo that loss but also to pay over $92,000 or some lesser but substantial sum would seem particularly harsh. Under the circumstances, we feel bound to follow the construction in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We therefore affirm the order of the district court. Appellee\u2019s request for attorneys fees is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">. Sections 39 and 39-a provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">\u00a7 39. <em>Lien wilfully exaggerated is void.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">In any action or proceeding to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien upon a private or public improvement or in which the validity of the lien is an issue, if the court shall find that a lienor has wilfully exaggerated the amount for which he claims a lien as stated in his notice of lien, his lien shall be declared to be void and no recovery shall be had thereon. No such lienor shall have a right to file any other or further lien for the same claim. A second or subsequent lien filed in contravention of this section may be vacated upon application to the court on two days\u2019 notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">\u00a7 39-a. Liability of lienor where lien has been <em>declared void on account of wilful exaggeration.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">Where in any action or proceeding to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien upon a private or public improvement the court shall have declared said lien to be void on account of wilful exaggeration the person filing such notice of lien shall be liable in damages to the owner or contractor. The damages which said owner or contractor shall be entitled to recover, shall include the amount of any premium for a bond given to obtain the discharge of the lien or the interest on any money deposited for the purpose of discharging the lien, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for services in securing the discharge of the lien, and an amount equal to the difference by which the amount claimed to be due or to become due as stated in the notice of lien exceeded the amount actually due or to become due thereon.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
