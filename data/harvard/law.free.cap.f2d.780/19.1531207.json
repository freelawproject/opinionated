The Board affirmed a decision of an administrative law judge (AU) denying benefits for injuries incurred by Ivo Arrar while employed in an occupation covered by the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act), 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903(a) (West Supp.1985). We reverse the decision and order of the Board and remand the case to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"A_\">I. BACKGROUND.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-20\">Claimant Ivo Arrar and co-worker Milon-ja Bozovich were preparing their tools for work on the morning of September 15,1978 at the St. Louis Shipbuilding Company. Bozovich got into a fight with a third employee, Alvin Batts. Batts knocked Bozo-vich unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-21\">Batts and Arrar disagree as to what happened next. According to Batts, when he and Bozovich began to fight, \u201cIvo Arrar hits me, or grabs me on the back, and I turned around, and I hits [sic] him.\u201d According to Arrar, he was standing twenty-five feet away when Batts and Bozovich began to fight. After Batts knocked out Bozovich, he walked toward Arrar. Arrar claims he thought Batts was returning to work. Arrar\u2019s hands were in his pockets. Batts hit Arrar twice causing Arrar\u2019s injuries. Arrar claims he did not fight back.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-22\">Arrar filed for compensation under the Act, claiming that Batts\u2019 blow caused him permanent partial disability from injuries to his teeth and nose and from impairment of his vision and hearing. The AU discounted Arrar\u2019s version of his injury, and concluded the Act barred Arrar\u2019s claim because Arrar was injured through his wilful intent to injure Batts. The Board affirmed the AU\u2019s dismissal of Arrar\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>II. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides that compensation shall be paid to covered employees suffering accidental injury in the course of employment. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903(a). The Act excludes compensation of those injuries incurred solely through the employee\u2019s wilful intent to injure another. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903(b) (West Supp.1985). The Act presumes, however, that an employee\u2019s injury did not occur through such a wilful intent to injure another. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(d) (1982). A contesting employer successfully rebuts this presumption only by producing substantial evidence to the contrary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The AU and the Board determined that Batts\u2019 testimony that Arrar \u201chit\u201d or \u201cgrabbed\u201d him was sufficient evidence to rebut the Act\u2019s statutory presumption in favor of Arrar. Arrar contends that this testimony showed, at most, that he voluntarily entered the fray, but did not constitute substantial evidence that he intended to injure Batts.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We agree. Batts\u2019 ambiguous statement that Arrar \u201chit\u201d or \u201cgrabbed\u201d Batts on the back supports the conclusion that Arrar was attempting to stop the fight between B\u00e1tts and Bozovich as readily as it supports the conclusion that Arrar intended to injure Batts. The testimony therefore sheds no light on Arrar\u2019s subjective intent and certainly cannot constitute substantial evidence that Arrar\u2019s injury arose solely through his wilful intent to injure Batts. The equivocal statement made by Batts fails to overcome the statutory presumption in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision and order of the Board, and remand this case to the Board for a determination of disability and such award, if any, as may be proper in light of that ruling on disability.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-17\">. The ALJ also held that Arrar did not suffer permanent partial disability. The Board did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
