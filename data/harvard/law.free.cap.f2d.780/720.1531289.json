In their suit in the District Court, appellants claimed that Public Law 97-253, title III, \u00a7 301(d), 96 Stat. 791, as amended by Public Law 97-346, \u00a7 3(h), 96 Stat. 1648, violated their Fifth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection of the laws, and that the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management implementing these statutory enactments violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The District Court granted the appellee\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment and denied appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">After a careful consideration of the record, briefs, and the oral arguments of counsel, we affirm the decision of the District Court on the basis of Judge O\u2019Kelley\u2019s comprehensive and well-reasoned opinion which is set forth in the order of December 21, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
