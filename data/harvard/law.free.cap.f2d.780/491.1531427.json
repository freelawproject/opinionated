One of the many units at the plant produces toluene diisocyanate (\u201cTDI\u201d), a material used to produce urethane foam, which in turn is used in the production of furniture, carpet padding, pillows, mattresses and insulation. One of the ingredients used to make TDI is phos-gene, which is composed of chlorine gas and carbon monoxide.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Smith Valve Corporation (\u201cSmith\u201d) manufactures a number of different kinds of valves, including a one-half inch split-body valve made from austinitic stainless strel. The two halves of this split-body valve are held together by four external stainless steel bolts and nuts. Although the plans and specifications of the Lake Charles plant called for the use of one-half inch \u201cmonel\u201d solid body valves in the TDI unit, a Smith stainless steel valve was used as part of an assembly that connected a pipe carrying phosgene liquid to a gauge which measured the pressure of phosgene in the pipe. Monel and stainless steel are corrosive resistant alloys.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">On the morning of June 2, 1982, James Vincent, an operator at Olin\u2019s TDI unit, noticed that the gauge in question had developed a leak. Clegg Barton, a maintenance worker for Olin, was summoned to replace the gauge. Barton eventually attempted to disconnect the gauge, in order to \u201cbleed off\u201d any phosgene that may have remained in the small section of pipe on the gauge side of the valve. As Barton was removing the gauge, the four bolts holding the two halves of the valve suddenly broke. The rupture of the valve permitted phos-gene liquid to escape from the pipe. Because the boiling point of phosgene is approximately 40\u00b0 F., some of the phosgene evaporated into the atmosphere before Olin workers were able to contain the leak.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">At the time of the leak, Francisco Rodriguez, an employee of Hunter Chemicals, Inc. (\u201cHunter\u201d), was making a delivery of industrial soaps on Olin\u2019s premises pursuant to a contract between Hunter and Olin. While filling one of Hunter\u2019s bulk tanks from his tank truck, Rodriguez was exposed to the phosgene gas. He sustained injuries which ultimately resulted in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">Rodriguez\u2019 survivors filed suit in diversity against Olin and Hunter for the wrongful death of Francisco Rodriguez. Olin then filed a cross-claim against Hunter pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(g). Olin claimed that it was entitled to full indemnification based on the indemnity and insurance provisions of its contract with Hunter. Olin, as a third party plaintiff under Fed.R.Civ.P. 14(a), also claimed that it was entitled to full indemnification or contribution from Smith based on the defective design of the split-body valve in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">Although the plaintiffs subsequently settled their claim, trial proceeded as between Smith and Olin on the issue of responsibility for release of the phosgene gas. Experts for both Olin and Smith had previously determined that each of the bolts had experienced \u201cchloride stress corrosion cracking,\u201d a phenomenon that occurred when chloride ions attacked the stainless steel makeup of the bolts, and that this reaction caused the bolts to break. The debate at trial centered on the temperature at which the cracking would occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">According to Olin\u2019s expert, Dr. John Slater, chloride stress corrosion cracking normally occurs only in temperatures of 160\u00b0 F. or higher. Slater testified that cracking is possible in ambient temperatures when a chloride combines with sulphur. Slater further testified that in this instance chloride ions had combined with sulphur ions from the molybdenum disulfide coating, which had been applied to the valve and bolts. According to Slater, the molybdenum disulfide coating had broken down and had released the sulfide ions. Slater stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that he had found sulphur on the fracture surfaces and concluded that in the absence of the molybdenum disulfide the bolts would not have cracked.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Smith\u2019s experts, Dr. Paul Weihrauch and Robert Bell, testified that chloride stress corrosion cracking is possible at ambient temperatures. Bell also testified that it was not possible for the molybdenum disul-fide, as a high temperature coating, to break down and release sulfide ions in the manner suggested by Slater. Smith\u2019s experts proposed that \u201ccorrosion fatigue entrapment,\u201d which occurs when chloride ions become trapped below the surface of a corroded object, caused the bolts to break. Weihrauch added that chloride stress corrosion cracking involving the molybdenum disulfide could not have occurred because he found no sulphur on the fracture surfaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Olin attempted to recall Slater as a rebuttal witness to show that sulphur had been found on the fracture surfaces and that Smith\u2019s corrosion fatigue entrapment and molybdenum disulfide breakdown theories had no scientific basis. The district court determined that all points on which Slater was to testify had been covered and refused to allow the rebuttal testimony. Olin also moved for a directed verdict pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41. The court denied Olin\u2019s motion. The jury returned a verdict and found no liability on Smith\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Subsequently, in Olin\u2019s action against Hunter, which followed the district court\u2019s severance of Olin\u2019s cross-claim from the Rodriguez suit, Olin moved for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 on the basis of the indemnity and insurance provisions of the Olin-Hunter contract. The district court granted Olin\u2019s motion. The court found, as a matter of Louisiana law, that the terms of the agreement were not ambiguous and concluded that all risks of injury to any of Hunter\u2019s employees on Olin\u2019s premises, while engaging in any activity required under the Olin-Hunter contract, shifted from Olin to Hunter.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">On appeal, Olin claims that the trial court erred in refusing to allow its offer of rebuttal testimony and in refusing to direct a verdict in its favor. Hunter, in turn, claims that the court erred in granting Olin\u2019s motion for summary judgment under the terms of the Olin-Hunter contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">OLIN-SMITH</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">It is well settled that \u201cthe trial judge has broad discretion in the matter of the admission or exclusion of expert evidence, and his action is to be sustained unless manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Salem v. United States Lines Co., </em>370 U.S. 31, 35, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 1122, 8 L.Ed.2d 313, 317 (1962); <em>Vallot v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc., </em>641 F.2d 347, 350 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit A); <em>Perkins v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 681, 682 (5th Cir.1979). Moreover, this court has long \u201cobserved that questions as to order of proof are committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>McVey v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>288 F.2d 53, 54, (5th Cir.1961). Thus, the district court\u2019s refusal to allow Slater to testify as a rebuttal witness will not be overturned unless such refusal was an abuse of discretion. <em>See In re Air Crash Disaster Near New Orleans, La., Etc., </em>764 F.2d 1084, 1090 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">As we noted in <em>Morgan v. Commercial Union Assurance Cos., </em>606 F.2d 554, 555 (5th Cir.1979), \u201c[rjebuttal is a term of art, denoting evidence introduced by a <em>plaintiff </em>to meet new facts brought out in his opponent\u2019s case in chief.\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>See also Mersel v. United States, </em>420 F.2d 517, 520 (5th Cir.1970); <em>McVey, </em>288 F.2d at 54. There is no question that Olin intended to proffer evidence designed to address matters raised in Smith\u2019s case in chief. The only question remaining is whether the points raised were \u201cnew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">Olin contends that Smith raised three new matters or theories to which it was entitled to present rebuttal testimony. First, Olin claims that Slater\u2019s testimony was necessary to impeach Weihrauch\u2019s repeated assertions that no sulfides were found on the fracture surfaces of the bolts. According to Olin, the presence or absence of sulfides was the basis of Weihrauch\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>disagreement with Slater\u2019s conclusion. Olin maintains that Slater\u2019s testimony would have shown that Weihrauch\u2019s statements were false, and that the district court\u2019s ruling precluded an opportunity to overcome these damaging \u201cmisstatements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The question is not whether Olin had an opportunity or right to overcome any statements or misstatements but whether Weihrauch\u2019s testimony raised new matters. The record indicates that Slater testified on direct examination that sulphur was found on the fracture surfaces on three related occasions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">Q. What do we have in this exhibit? Slater: ... And so what we have marked here are the various elements that we found actually on that fracture surface.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAzM\">Q: This is on the actual fracture surface itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">Slater: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">Slater: So what we see here is a little peak here which corresponds to silicon, a little peak here which corresponds to sulfur, and a very large peak here which corresponds to chlorine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">Q: What does this exhibit reflect here, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">Slater: Well, this exhibit is a scan ... at this side of the bolt and threads ... this caused a certain amount of interest to try to understand why this sulfur peak was as high as it was on the side of this bolt when the fracture surface was giving anything like the same sort of level of sulfur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">Q: What is this exhibit, Dr. Slater? Slater: This exhibit presents some data that we found in the literature which was looking at stress corrosion cracking of some, some steels that are not normally considered to be susceptible to stress corrosion cracking even in high temperature environments. And this was prompted by our finding that there was a large amount of sulfur present on the site of the bolts that comprised the accident valve, when this was present actually on the fracture surface.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-18\">Olin\u2019s assertion that Slater\u2019s references to the presence of sulfides was \u201cburied\u201d in a long discussion does not comport with the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-19\">Moreover, even if Weihrauch\u2019s statements were untrue and damaging, Olin was not precluded from overcoming Weihrauch\u2019s testimony. Olin had an opportunity on cross examination to impeach Weihrauch on the basis of Slater\u2019s tests, which were in evidence, and to challenge his conclusions on summation. Olin\u2019s suggestion that rebuttal evidence should be allowed where the defendant\u2019s testimony is \u201cblatantly wrong\u201d or where the defendant\u2019s assertions outnumber the plaintiff\u2019s is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-20\">Olin next argues that it was necessary to rebut Weihrauch and Bell\u2019s testimony concerning the breakdown of molybdenum disulfide. According to Olin, Bell\u2019s testimony that it was not possible for molybdenum disulfide coating to break down and release sulfide ions was inaccurate and constituted a new theory. However, the record reveals that Slater explained the molybdenum disulfide breakdown process at length. The fact that Slater\u2019s testimony was elicited on cross examination is irrelevant to whether Bell\u2019s molybdenum disulfide breakdown testimony was new. The jury was presented with both Slater and Bell\u2019s theories of the breakdown process; rebuttal was not necessary on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-21\">Finally, Olin contends that Slater\u2019s rebuttal testimony was necessary to impeach Weihrauch\u2019s testimony that one exception to chloride stress corrosion cracking occurring in temperatures of 160\u00b0 F. or higher was \u201ccorrosion fatigue entrapment\u201d \u2014 a process which, according to Weihrauch, occurs when chlorides become entrapped below the surface scales of a corroded object. Olin asserts that this label constituted a new theory which had not been raised before Smith\u2019s case in chief and which had no scientific basis. Olin adds that Weihrauch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>implied that corrosion fatigue entrapment may have contributed to the cracking in the bolts and that, therefore, rebuttal testimony on this point was critical. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">At oral argument counsel for Smith maintained that \u201ccorrosion fatigue entrapment\u201d is merely an interpretation of the evidence concerning the temperature component aspect of chloride stress corrosion cracking in the bolts. Smith\u2019s counsel concluded that because Slater discussed this evidence on direct, cross and redirect examination, Weihrauch\u2019s corrosion fatigue entrapment \u201cinterpretation\u201d was not new evidence. However, as counsel conceded at oral argument, an expert\u2019s opinion or interpretation of evidence is itself evidence. <em>See </em>F.R.E. 703. It follows that Weihrauch\u2019s use of the term \u201ccorrosion fatigue entrapment,\u201d his explanation of the theory underlying the term, and his interpretation of the evidence in this case as supporting\u2014 or at least as not contradicting \u2014 the corrosion fatigue entrapment hypothesis are certainly evidence. The absence of any such testimony prior to Smith\u2019s case in chief undoubtedly renders Weihrauch\u2019s testimony \u201cnew\u201d for purposes of rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Moreover, even if we were to construe Slater\u2019s testimony and discussion of the evidence as having encompassed corrosion fatigue entrapment, as Smith suggests, Weihrauch\u2019s testimony on this point would still be new. Logic and fairness lead us to conclude that new evidence for purposes of rebuttal does not mean \u201cbrand new.\u201d Rather, evidence is new if, under all the facts and circumstances, the court concludes that the evidence was not fairly and adequately presented to the trier of fact before the defendant\u2019s case in chief. <em>See Everett v. S.H. Parks and Assocs. Inc., </em>697 F.2d 250, 252 (8th Cir.1983) (plaintiff\u2019s evidence \u201cwas not truly relevant until [defendant] presented its defense\u201d); <em>Weiss v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>515 F.2d 449, 459 (2d Cir.1975) (\u201cIt is true that [plaintiff\u2019s expert] was asked a question on cross examination about [defendant\u2019s theory] ... [but] [t]hat did not make his testimony in response a part of plaintiff\u2019s direct case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We also note that Smith appears to suggest that the availability of pretrial discovery to Olin somehow precludes rebuttal evidence in the case at bar. Such a contention, however, ignores the rule that rebuttal evidence is designed to meet facts not raised before the defendant\u2019s case in chief, not facts which <em>could </em>have been raised. <em>See Morgan, </em>606 F.2d at 555. This rule proceeds from the view that a plaintiff\u2019s has the right to adduce whatever evidence is necessary to establish its prima facie case and is under no obligation to anticipate and negate in its own case in chief any facts or theories that may be raised on defense. <em>See Weiss, </em>515 F.2d at 458-59. <em>See also Martin v. Weaver, </em>666 F.2d 1013, 1020 (6th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 962, 102 S.Ct. 2038, 72 L.Ed.2d 485 (1982). We conclude, therefore, that Weihrauch\u2019s testimony on corrosion fatigue entrapment was new, that Olin had no cause or duty to go forward in its case in chief and negate Weihrauch\u2019s theory, and that the district court improperly excluded Olin\u2019s rebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Our conclusion that Slater\u2019s proposed rebuttal testimony was improperly excluded does not necessarily render the judge\u2019s ruling manifestly erroneous, and therefore, reversible as an abuse of judicial discretion. The proposed rebuttal evidence must be central to the plaintiff's prima facie case. <em>See Weiss, </em>515 F.2d at 459. However, we conclude in this instance that Slater\u2019s proposed testimony, which Olin submits was designed to discredit Weihrauch\u2019s corrosion fatigue entrapment theory, was critical to Olin\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Slater testified on direct examination that chloride stress corrosion cracking caused the bolts to break; that chloride stress corrosion cracking does not occur in temperatures under 160\u00b0 F. in the absence of sulfide ions; that sulfides were found on the fracture surfaces; and that the molybdenum disulfide coating on the valve and bolts broke down, released the sulfide ions and, hence, was the cause of the cracking. Weihrauch, on the other hand, gave testimony on corrosion fatigue entrapment, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>plained the theory underlying the term, and proposed corrosion fatigue entrapment as a plausible, alternative theory to Slater\u2019s chloride stress corrosion cracking theory. Moreover, in support of this alternative explanation, Bell and Weihrauch testified that the molybdenum disulfide could not have broken down as Slater suggested and that no sulfides were found on the fracture surfaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In view of the evidence in the record before us, we must conclude that acceptance of Slater\u2019s views on chloride stress corrosion cracking as the better explanation was crucial to Olin\u2019s case in chief and that refusal of rebuttal testimony on this point was manifest error. We note that evidentiary matters in trials involving a \u201cbattle of experts\u201d are often difficult, and, as the learned judge below recognized, often lead to \u201creversible error.\u201d Although the district judge acted within the appropriate bounds of discretion in almost every instance, we conclude that his decision to refuse Olin the opportunity to rebut and discredit Smith\u2019s corrosion fatigue entrapment theory must be reversed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">OLIN-HUNTER</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The district court\u2019s decision to grant Olin\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of the provisions in the Olin-Hunter contract must be sustained if no genuine issue of material fact existed as to Olin\u2019s claim against Hunter. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; <em>Reiser v. Coliseum Properties, Inc., </em>614 F.2d 406, 410 (5th Cir.1980). Hunter contends that the parties only intended to shift risks of liability for injuries resulting from a Hunter employee\u2019s performance of work under the contract and not for injuries resulting (1) from pre-existing defects at the Olin plant site and (2) from activities upon which Olin could be held strictly or absolutely liable. Hunter maintains that the intent of the parties under the contract is a disputed question of fact and, therefore, that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Under Louisiana law, where uncertainty or ambiguity exists as to the provisions of a contract, or where the intent of the parties cannot be ascertained from the language employed, resolution of the ambiguity is a question of fact for the jury, and parol evidence regarding the parties\u2019 intent is admissible. <em>Carter\u2019s Insurance Agency, Inc. v. Franklin, </em>428 So.2d 808 (La.App. 1st Cir.1982), <em>modified on reh\u2019g, </em>428 So.2d 813, 813-14 (La.App. 1st Cir.1983). However, the initial question of whether uncertainty or ambiguity exists is a question of law. <em>See Battig v. Hartford Accident And Indemnity Co., </em>608 F.2d 119, 120 (5th Cir.1979) (\u201cAbsent latent or patent ambiguities, the meaning of a contract is for the court as a matter of law\u201d). Courts are bound to give legal effect to all written contracts where the terms are clear, explicit and lead to no absurd consequences. La.Civ.Code Ann. art. 1945 (West 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">The court below concluded that the Olin-Hunter contract, taken as a whole, was clear, unambiguous and reflected the parties\u2019 intent to require Hunter to protect Olin against all risks and harms to Hunter\u2019s employees, while on Olin\u2019s premises and while performing work under the contract. In construing the Olin-Hunter agreement, the court focused on the phrases \u201call claims, demands ... or suits of any nature whatsoever,\u201d \u201carising out of,\u201d \u201cin connection with,\u201d and \u201cincidental to\u201d contained in the indemnity provision and on the insurance clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Hunter argues that the indemnity agreement cannot be construed to include claims against Olin for injuries arising from preexisting defects at the Olin plant site or from Olin\u2019s activities. Hunter adds that the language \u201carising out of, in connection with or incidental to work performed under the contract,\u201d can only be construed to encompass claims against Olin for injuries arising from a Hunter employee\u2019s activities in the course of performing work under the contract. Hunter contends that this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Mott v. ODECO, </em>577 F.2d 273 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 912, 99 S.Ct. 1226, 59 L.Ed.2d 461 (1978), requires us to reverse the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In <em>Mott </em>we held that use of the phrase \u201cany and all claims ... incident to, arising out of, in connection with, or resulting from the activities of Subcontractor, its employees and agents\u201d was inadequate as a matter of law to include any claim for injuries caused by the negligence of the indemnitee or by pre-existing defects. <em>Id. </em>at 276-78. However, in <em>Mott </em>we only held that the above-quoted phrase was not unambiguous <em>standing alone. </em>We stated specifically that \u201c[wjhile another view of the parties\u2019 intentions would have been permissible, <em>see Day v. ODECO, </em>353 F.Supp. 1350 (E.D.La.1973), we cannot say on the basis of this record that the trial court\u2019s view of the parties\u2019 intention is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">In <em>Day v. Ocean Drilling And Exploration Co. (ODECO), </em>353 F.Supp. 1350 (E.D. La.1973), the court construed an indemnity agreement which provided indemnification for \u201cany and all claims ... incident to, arising out of, in connection with, or resulting from the activities of Subcontractor, its employees and agents ... or in connection with the work to be performed ... under this contract.\u201d <em>Day </em>358 F.Supp. at 1351. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The court determined that the contract, \u201ctaken as a whole, clearly reflects the parties\u2019 intention to require Houma to protect Odeco against all risks of harm to Houma\u2019s employees while on the platform, not merely by assuming this risk itself, <em>but by carrying insurance to cover it.\u201d Id. </em>at 1352-53 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">As in <em>Day, </em>the Olin-Hunter contract requires Hunter to carry insurance to cover the risks it has assumed under the indemnity clause. It follows that the broad indemnity language in the Olin-Hunter contract does not \u201cstand alone,\u201d and supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the agreement, taken as whole, requires Hunter to provide Olin with indemnification for injuries arising from pre-existing defects at the Olin plant site. Moreover, although we agree that the phrase \u201carising out of, in connection with, or incidental to work performed under the contract\u201d can be construed to mean any performance, whether it be by indemnitor or indemnitee, <em>see Daigle v. Lang, </em>377 So.2d 1384, 1391 (La.App. 4th Cir.1979), we conclude that in the context of the whole agreement, including the insurance clause, the court below did not err in determining that the language of the Olin-Hunter agreement encompasses indemnity for injuries arising out of Olin\u2019s activities, which are sustained by a Hunter employee, while on Olin\u2019s premises and while performing work under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Hunter argues that it is inappropriate to use an insurance clause to expand the indemnity obligation under the contract and cites our decision in <em>Seal Offshore, Inc. v. American Standard, Inc., </em>736 F.2d 1078 (5th Cir.1984) in support of its position. However, in <em>Seal Offshore </em>we noted that \u201can insurance provision can ... expansively shift risks.\u201d <em>Seal Offshore, </em>736 F.2d at 1081. In any event, the district court did not refer to the Olin-Hunter insurance clause in order to expand Hunter\u2019s indemnity obligation, but merely to confirm Hunter\u2019s already complete obligation under the indemnity provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Hunter next asserts that indemnification agreements, as a matter of Louisiana public policy, cannot be construed to indemnify a party against claims based on strict or absolute liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hunter notes that it is against Louisiana public policy to enter into a contractual agreement pertaining to wells for oil, gas or water, or for drilling minerals which occur in a solid, liquid, gaseous, or other state, which grants indemnification for sole or concurrent negligent liability or strict liability. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 9:2780 (West Supp. 1985). Hunter reasons that it is also contrary to Louisiana public policy to indemnify for strict (and absolute) liability in the present context. We simply cannot agree. The rule that one cannot indemnify for strict liability in the oil and gas and mineral area was developed in the legislature; any extension of this \u201cpublic policy\u201d into other spheres is one to be undertaken by that body.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Hunter also argues that even if risks of strict and absolute liability may be shifted in indemnification agreements, an explicit provision to that effect must be included in the contract. Hunter correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>points out that contracts of indemnity will not be construed to indemnify an indemnitee against losses resulting from its own negligence, unless such intention is expressed in unequivocal terms. <em>Polozola v. Garlock, Inc., </em>343 So.2d 1,000 (La.1977). Hunter concludes that a similar rule of strict construction ought to be applied with respect to strict and absolute liability and cites the recent decision of <em>Soverign Insurance Co. v. Texas Pipeline Co., </em>470 So.2d 969 (La.App. 1st Cir.), <em>cert. granted, </em>475 So.2d 1097 (La.1985) as authority for its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In <em>Soverign Insurance </em>the court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">[sjince the duty imposed on a person under strict and negligent liabilities is the same, there is no rational reason why the rules of construction applicable to indemnification agreements concerning these types of fault should not also be the same. Indeed, because <em>scienter </em>is not at issue in strict liability, such liability is easier to prove, and there is a greater risk that the person subject to such liability (whether directly or by an indemnification agreement) will be cast in judgment. As such, strict liability is more <em>onerous </em>than negligent liability <em>on the person assuming it. </em>If strict liability is more onerous than negligent liability on the party assuming it, it is less likely such person would knowingly assume \u2018an obligation so extraordinary and harsh.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 974 (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The court's holding is based on its interpretation of the element of fault underlying strict liability and the policy reasons for the strict liability theory of recovery, as set forth in the seminal decision of <em>Loescher v. Parr, </em>324 So.2d 441 (La.1975). In <em>Loescher, </em>Justice Tate, speaking for the court, summarized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">the principle of legal fault [under Articles 2318, 2320, 2321 and 2322] thus already recognized in favor of an injured person himself without fault:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">When harm results from the conduct or defect of a person or thing which creates an unreasonable risk of harm to others, a person legally responsible under these code articles for the supervision, care, or guardianship of the person or thing may be held liable for the damage thus caused, despite the fact that no personal negligent act or inattention on the former\u2019s part is proved. The liability arises from his legal relationship to the person or thing whose conduct or defect creates an unreasonable risk of injuries to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">The <em>fault </em>of the person thus liable is based upon his failure to prevent the person or thing for whom he is responsible from causing such unreasonable risk of injury to others. Thus, the person to whom society allots the supervision, care, or guardianship (custody) of the risk-creating person or thing bears the loss resulting from creation of the risk, rather than some innocent third person harmed as a consequence of his failure to prevent the risk. His fault rests upon his failure to prevent the risk-creating harm and upon his obligation to guard against the condition or activity (by the person or thing for which he is responsible) which creates the unreasonable risk of harm to others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 446 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">We conclude that the <em>Soverign Insurance </em>court\u2019s reliance on Loescher\u2019s analysis of the element of fault underlying the strict liability theory of recovery, as the basis for its holding \u2014 that indemnity agreements will not be construed to include indemnification for strict liability, unless explicitly stated in the contract \u2014 is misplaced. In <em>Hyde v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>697 F.2d 614, 632-35 (5th Cir.1983) this Court held that a provision indemnifying for any injury \u201cthat may arise\u201d encompassed claims based on strict liability. <em>See also Olsen v. Shell Oil Co., </em>595 F.2d 1099 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 979, 100 S.Ct. 480, 62 L.Ed.2d 405 (1979) (indemnity agreement providing that \u2018contractor agrees to ... indemnify ... Shell ... from and against all claims ... incident to, in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>or arising out of, contractor\u2019s negligence in performing the operations under this contract\u2019 held to include indemnification for damages based on strict liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">In rejecting reasoning similar to that urged in <em>Soverign Insurance </em>we stated in <em>Hyde </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">the [district] court\u2019s reasoning is faulty in that the basis for the general rule of not allowing a party to contract against his own negligence is not applicable to strict liability cases in which the owner-custodian may be non-negligent, non-culpable, and even reasonable and careful in his conduct toward others. The basis for the general principle that one should not be able to contract against his own negligence (absent clear specific language to the contrary) is the state\u2019s interest in public safety. This interest rests on the fear that one might be careless of another\u2019s life and limb, if there is no penalty for carelessness. Articles 2322 and 2317 impose liability on the owner-custodian not because of negligence but because of the relationship of the owner-custodian to a thing that is unreasonably dangerous to others. The owner-custodian may not even know of the defect or have any reason to think the thing defective, as in <em>Loescher, </em>a case involving a rotten tree on the owner\u2019s premises. In the case of an owner driving piles on his property causing injury to a neighbor\u2019s premises, the owner is strictly liable for damages, even though the owner and the independent contractor may have gone to great pains to avoid any negligence in the pile-driving. Social policy demands that of two innocent parties the risk of injury should fall on the owner or custodian of the injury-producing thing. Usually, this policy produces a fair result. The costs, especially in an industrial accident, will fall on the party best able to afford to pay the damages and the party in control able to prevent injury. The liable party will take steps to prevent accident. That party will insure against the risk and pass the costs on to the general public in whose interest the policy arose. The policy considerations underlying the presumption that a party cannot contract against his own negligence have no application to this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">We cannot concur with the court in <em>Soverign Insurance </em>that the strict liability fault described in <em>Loescher </em>generates greater societal opprobrium than the fault underlying negligence. On the contrary, we conclude that negligent liability may often be <em>more onerous </em>than strict liability because the negligent defendant is always in a position to prevent the harm or injury; the strict liability defendant is often not in such a position. Because the public policy reasons for prohibiting indemnification for negligence, unless explicitly stated in the indemnity agreement, have no application in a strict or absolute liability context, we disagree with the conclusion reached in <em>Soverign </em>Insurance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold that contracts of indemnity may be construed to include indemnification for strict and absolute liability if the parties intended to cover such liability and their intention is expressed in the agreement as a whole. <em>Cf. Daigle, </em>377 So.2d at 1391. (\u201cAn indemnity clause need not include the magic words of negligence if the factual circumstances are such that no other conclusion reasonably can be reached except that negligence of the indemnitee was intended to be included in the indemnity agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">We hold that the district court correctly concluded that the Olin-Hunter indemnity agreement is unambiguous and evinces a clear intent to require Hunter to indemnify Olin against all claims, by its employees, including claims for injuries based on strict or absolute liability. The district court\u2019s order granting Olin\u2019s motion for summary judgment must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">In sum, we conclude that the district court improperly excluded Olin\u2019s proposed rebuttal testimony relating to Smith\u2019s corrosion fatigue entrapment theory. Because we find that the proposed rebuttal evidence was crucial to Olin\u2019s burden of establishing a prima facie case, we hold that the court\u2019s ruling was manifest error and reverse the court\u2019s Judgment in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">However, we find that the court correctly determined that the Olin-Hunter contract was unambiguous and reflected the parties\u2019 intent to require Hunter to indemnify Olin against all risks and harms to Hunter\u2019s employees, while on Olin\u2019s premises and while performing work under the contract. We hold, therefore, that the district court\u2019s ruling granting summary judgment on the contract in Olin\u2019s favor is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">REVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\">. Because we reverse the district court\u2019s decision to exclude rebuttal testimony, we do not address the court\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict in Olin\u2019s favor under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\">.

In <em>Kent v.

Art. 2317 for creating or maintaining a thing which presents an unreasonable risk of harm. There are some activities in which the risk may be altogether reasonable and still high enough that the party ought not undertake the activity without assuming the consequences. Such activities include pile driving, storage of toxic gas, blasting with explosives, crop dusting with airplanes, and the like, in which the activity can cause injury to others, even when conducted with the greatest prudence and care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apz-dedup-0\">For these particular activities, Louisiana courts have imposed an <em>absolute </em>liability (as contrasted to the strict liability previously discussed), which virtually makes the enterpriser an insurer. The enterpriser, whether or not negligent in any respect, causes the damage, and the injured party recovers simply by proving damage and causation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuG\"><em>Id. </em>at 498 (citations and footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b587-6\">.
