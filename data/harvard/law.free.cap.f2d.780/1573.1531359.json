He contends that the district court committed reversible error when it failed to exclude certain testimony as a sanction for the prosecutor\u2019s failure to comply with a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>covery order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we remand the ease to the district court for a full development of the facts and reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-5\">On September 25, 1985, Ernesto Fernandez was indicted, in four counts, for knowingly and intentionally possessing cocaine, with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1981), for knowingly and intentionally importing cocaine into the United States, from a place outside thereof, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a) (1981), and for conspiracy to commit these offenses, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 963 (1981) respectively. Fernandez was promptly arraigned and pled not guilty to these charges. On October 12, 1984, he filed a motion for a bill of particulars requesting, among other things, the names of \u201call co-conspirators, either named or unnamed, known to the Government.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The magistrate denied the motion \u201cexcept as to the names of the unindicted co-conspirators known to the Government.\u201d Trial was set for November 15, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-12\">Fernandez, however, filed a motion for continuance, complaining that the prosecutor failed to provide him with the names of any unindicted co-conspirators. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-13\">At 10:30 p.m. on November 14, 1984, the day before Fernandez\u2019 trial began, the prosecutor telephoned defense counsel to inform him that a Colombian known only as \u201cMarcos\u201d was considered an unindicted co-conspirator. The following day, during the lunch recess, the prosecutor named \u201cMerquiades\u201d as another unindicted co-conspirator.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the record reflected that the government knew of Marcos and Merquiades from the outset of its investigation, Fernandez moved to exclude any testimony referring to these unindicted co-conspirators as a sanction for failing to comply with the magistrate\u2019s discovery order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court denied the motion, noting that even if Fernandez had the names \u201c500 years ago [he] could not find them in Columbia.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>The jury subsequently found Fernandez guilty on all counts. Thus, on December 20, 1984, the district court sentenced Fernandez to a term of imprisonment of seven years and a five year special parole term. This appeal promptly followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-5\">When a party in a criminal case fails to comply with a discovery order, the district court \u201cmay order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance or prohibit the party from introducing evidence not disclosed, or it may enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(d)(2). A district court\u2019s decision concerning the imposition of a Rule 16(d)(2) sanction for the violation of a discovery order is a matter committed to the court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>United States v. Campagnuolo, </em>592 F.2d 852, 858 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Absent an abuse of discretion, the court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>United States v. Burkhalter, </em>735 F.2d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir.1984). In exercising its discretion, however, the district court must consider several factors, and, if it decides a sanction is in order, \u201cshould impose the least severe sanction that will accomplish the desired result \u2014 prompt and full compliance with the court\u2019s discovery orders.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarcinelli, </em>667 F.2d 5, 7 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Among the factors the court must consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aof-dedup-1\">are the reasons for the Government\u2019s delay in affording the required discovery, the extent of prejudice, if any, the defendant has suffered because of the delay, and the feasibility of curing such prejudice by granting a continuance or, if the jury has been sworn and the trial has begun, a recess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1662-9\"><em>United States v. Euceda-Hemandez, </em>768 F.2d 1307, 1312 (11th Cir.1985) (citations omitted). Finally, the district court should determine and consider whether the prosecutor acted in bad faith in violating the magistrate\u2019s discovery order. <em>See United States v. Soto, </em>711 F.2d 1558, 1563 n. 10 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-10\">Because of the failure of the government to fully advise the district court of its reasons for not complying with the magistrate\u2019s order, the judge reacted in a very understandable fashion in stating that even if Fernandez had the names he could not have found them in Colombia. As subsequent events now reveal, however, the government was actively investigating and pursuing both Marcos and Merquiades and, in fact, arrested Merquiades in the United States approximately one week after the trial of Fernandez was completed. It also appears now that there is a familial relationship between Fernandez and Marcos. Indeed, a full exploration of the facts may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1577\">*1577</page-number>demonstrate that either the government or Fernandez could have easily located these individuals. But the government wanted nothing done to alert these same individuals concerning its ongoing investigation. Such a concern may have been fully justified but it was absolutely mandated that the government advise the district court, possibly <em>in camera </em>or <em>ex parte, </em>and seek relief from the discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-5\">In the interest of fairness and because of the developments subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision not to impose sanctions, we remand this case to the district court to develop a factual record and weigh the necessary factors outlined above to determine what relief, if any, Fernandez is entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-6\">It is clear that the prosecutor violated the magistrate\u2019s discovery order. This violation requires that the district court weigh and consider the factors cited above and take into account the unique circumstances of this case in fashioning the least severe, yet effective, sanction. <em>See Euceda-Her-nandez, </em>768 F.2d at 1312 (even \u201c[t]he presence of a clear violation of a discovery order does not excuse a trial judge from weighing the factors.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-7\">Accordingly, this case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1663-8\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1661-6\">. Fernandez claims that the admission of this testimony deprived him of his \"constitutional rights to due process, a fair trial, the effective assistance of counsel and the effective cross-examination of witnesses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1661-7\">. The prosecutor opposed the motion, arguing that \"the motion first assumes that co-conspirators exist without supporting the basis for such an assumption. Moreover, even if the alleged co-conspirator existed, the disclosure of the identity of a potential government witness should not be required.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1661-8\">. At oral argument, counsel for the government admitted that \"the government does not contend and is not here to contend that its compliance with the court\u2019s order was timely; it was not and the government fully recognizes this at this time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1661-9\">. The government opposed the imposition of any sanctions. The government claimed that its compliance with the magistrate\u2019s order was untimely because earlier disclosure would have compromised its investigation. \"We have been actively, even up to this moment, pursuing the investigation of these two other individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-10\">The government\u2019s justification, however, does not permit it to disobey a discovery order. If the government was unhappy with the magistrate\u2019s ruling and felt that it should not be required to comply with the order, it could have, and should have, appealed the order to the district court. S.D.Fla. Magistrate R. 4(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1661-15\">Any party may appeal from a Magistrate\u2019s order determining a [non-dispositive] motion or matter ... within 4 days after the Magistrate\u2019s order has been filed with the Clerk, unless a different time is prescribed by the Magistrate or District Judge. Such party shall file with the Clerk of Court, and serve on all parties, a written petition for hearing which shall specifically set forth the order, or part thereof, appealed from, a concise statement of the alleged error in the Magistrate\u2019s ruling, and statutory, rule, or case authority in support of the moving party's position. The District Judge shall consider the appeal and shall set aside any portion of the Magistrate\u2019s order found to be clearly erroneous or contrary to law. The District Judge may also reconsider <em>sua sponte </em>any matter determined by a Magistrate under this rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1661-16\">Since the government did not seek review or otherwise contest the magistrate\u2019s order, it was required to provide Fernandez with the names of any known, unindicted co-conspirators.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1661-17\">. The district court\u2019s remark is unfortunate and, in light of subsequent events, incorrect. Government witnesses testified that Fernandez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>was once introduced as Marcos\u2019 cousin and Fernandez, in his brief, refers to Marcos as \u201ca family friend.\u201d Although the government is still unaware of Marcos\u2019 true identity, it is possible that Fernandez could have located Marcos and that Marcos could have aided Fernandez with his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"AmZP\">Merquiades might also have been found. Now known to be Melqu\u00edades Maria Hernandez-Montono, Merquiades was, after the completion of Fernandez\u2019 trial, indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Moreover, even before Merquiades' recent presence in the United States, he could have been located in Colombia. Government witnesses testified at Fernandez\u2019 trial that Merquiades was an employee of D.H.L. Express Courier Service in Barranquilla, Colombia. Fernandez now contends that an investigator would have located Merquiades in Colombia and obtained \"exculpatory\" information.</p>\n<p id=\"A6h\">To bolster his contention, Fernandez filed a motion to supplement the record with Mel-qu\u00edades Maria Hernandez-Montono\u2019s testimony given during Hernandez-Montono\u2019s trial. Fernandez argues that this testimony tends to exculpate him. The government does not agree but conceded, at oral argument, that the testimony would have been \"helpful.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1662-13\">.
