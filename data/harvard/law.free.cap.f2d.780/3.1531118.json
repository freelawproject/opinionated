But we may indulge the appellant by assuming that all parties and the court itself were mindful of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 243, of <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965), of the issues raised in the then as-yet undecided case of <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>766 F.2d 26 (1st Cir.1985), and of opinions in many cases related to <em>Swain </em>which had been decided by inferior federal courts, some of which are currently under review in the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-19\">Because of the narrowness of the issue before us, we see no reason to await further illumination by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-20\">Neither the majority nor minority opinions in <em>Swain, </em>nor any of the opinions of lower court judges of which we are apprised, has ever intimated that a prosecuto-rial <em>single </em>peremptory challenge of a black juror raises a presumption of racial bias by the prosecutor or is in violation of any constitutional, statutory, or judicial rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The <em>mere </em>fact that a single challenged juror <em>is </em>black does not support a presumption that he has been challenged <em>because </em>he is black. The situation where a single black is challenged differs from one where several blacks are challenged. In the case of the unexplained challenge of a single black there is no basis other than suspicion for presuming racial bias. This is true whether among those called for jury service there was only one black or many blacks. However, where several blacks are challenged it is possible to calculate the proportion of blacks challenged to blacks called, and then to see how that compares with the proportion of whites challenged to whites called. A marked discrepancy indicating a much higher percentage of blacks being challenged might furnish a rebut-table presumption of racial bias. The different proportion might demand from the challenger an explanation. <em>See </em>authorities collected in <em>Swain v.
