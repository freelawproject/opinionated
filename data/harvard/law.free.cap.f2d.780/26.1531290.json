We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">On December 14, 1984, the district court reversed the Secretary of Health and Human Services\u2019 denial of Johnson\u2019s claim for supplemental security income and remanded to the Secretary for calculation of benefits. On January 31, 1985, no appeal having been filed by the government, Johnson filed for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA. After the government objected on grounds of timeliness, the district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s petition. Before this court, the government does not contest the timeliness issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">In <em>Feldpausch v. Heckler, </em>763 F.2d 229 (6th Cir.1985), and <em>Massachusetts Union of Public Housing Tenants v. Pierce, </em>755 F.2d 177 (D.C.Cir.1985), petitions for fees filed more than thirty days after judgment, but before the government\u2019s time for appeal had elapsed, were held to be timely. We cited these cases with approval in <em>Keas-ler v. United States, </em>766 F.2d 1227 (8th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">Whether Johnson is entitled to an attorney\u2019s fee and all the issues arising from this request are for the district court to determine in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">We reverse the district court\u2019s order dismissing the petition for fees and remand to the district court for consideration of the issues arising from Johnson\u2019s petition for fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
