Whitney, M.D., W.D. Jordan, M.D., and Fred Shessel, M.D. (\u201cappellants\u201d) appeal from the judgment of the district court upholding the constitutionality of certain provisions of \u00a7 2306 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395u(b)(4), (h)-(j) (West Supp.1985). <em>See Whitney v. Heckler, </em>603 F.Supp. 821 (N.D. Ga.1985). Appellants make two primary arguments on appeal: (1) that the fifteen-month freeze on the fees that non-participating physicians may charge their Medicare patients violates substantive due process,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) that the civil penalties for non-participating physicians who raise their fees to Medicare beneficiaries during the fifteen-month freeze and the various incentives provided for doctors to become participating physicians constitute a bill of attainder prohibited by Art. I, \u00a7 9 of the United States Constitution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-18\">In 1965, Congress enacted the Medicare program as Subchapter XVIII of the Social Security Act. This program is divided into two parts. Part A provides reimbursement for covered hospital and related services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395c-1395i (1982). Part B establishes a voluntary program of supplemental medical insurance benefits for certain medical services, including physicians\u2019 services. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1395j-1395w. This case involves Part B exclusively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-19\">Under Part B, Medicare enrollees obtain benefits in return for the payment of monthly premiums in an amount determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395r. These premiums and contributions from the federal government make up the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, out of which payment is made for Part B benefits. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395t.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-20\">Part B enrollees are generally entitled to receive 80% of the \u201creasonable charge\u201d for medical services. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395Z. This \u201creasonable charge\u201d is computed according to a formula provided by \u00a7 1395u(b). Under this section, a physician\u2019s actual billed charge for each service is compared with what he customarily charges for that service (the \u201ccustomary charge\u201d), and with the charge made for similar services by most doctors in the locality (the \u201cprevailing charge\u201d), and the \u201creasonable charge\u201d is the lowest of these three.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>Prior to the enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, a Part B enrollee could pay for medical services in one of two ways. The beneficiary could pay the physician directly and then request reimbursement from Medicare. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(B)(i). Alternatively, if a physician were willing, the beneficiary could assign to the physician the beneficiary\u2019s right to reimbursement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(B)(ii). The physician, as the beneficiary\u2019s assignee, then collected payment directly from Medicare.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">Under this program, Medicare\u2019s \u201ccustomary\u201d and \u201cprevailing\u201d charge data were updated each year on July 1 based on the prior year\u2019s data. Physicians were also permitted to accept or decline assignment on a claim-by-claim basis, and if a physician chose not to accept assignment, Medicare placed no limitation on the amount that he could charge a Part B enrollee. Patients of physicians not accepting assignment, however, received Medicare reimbursement only for the 80% of Medicare\u2019s \u201creasonable charge,\u201d and the beneficiary was responsible for the difference between that figure and the physician\u2019s actual charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 made several changes in physician reimbursement under Medicare Part B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, \u00a7 2306(a) freezes both the \u201cprevailing\u201d and \u201ccustomary\u201d charge levels for a fifteen-month period beginning July 1, 1984, at levels no higher than the levels that were set for the twelve-month period beginning July 1, 1983. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395u(b)(4) (West Supp.1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition to this freeze, \u00a7 2306(c) requires physicians to decide before October 1 of each year whether they will be \u201cparticipating\u201d or \u201cnon-participating\u201d doctors for that year. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395u(h) (West Supp.1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A \u201cpartici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>pating\u201d physician agrees to accept payment on an assignment basis for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries during the twelve-month period beginning October 1. Thus, a \u201cparticipating\u201d physician\u2019s fees are effectively limited to the \u201creasonable\u201d charge. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(B). A \u201cnon-participating\u201d physician, however, may still continue to accept assignment on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">Section 2306(c) also provides that a nonparticipating physician may not charge a Medicare patient in excess of the physician\u2019s actual charges for the calendar quarter beginning on April 1,1984. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395u(j) (West Supp.1985). There is no restriction on fees charged to patients who do not receive Medicare assistance. This subsection also requires the Secretary to monitor each non-participating physician\u2019s actual charges to Medicare beneficiaries, and if the physician \u201cknowingly and willfully bills ... [beneficiaries] for actual charges in excess of such physician\u2019s actual charges for the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 1984,\u201d the Secretary may bar such physician from participation in the Medicare Program for a period of up to five years and/or impose a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each violation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395u(j)(l), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Finally, \u00a7 2306 also provides several incentives for physicians to become \u201cparticipating\u201d doctors. Under subsections 1395u(h)(2), 1395u(h)(3) and 1395u(j), the Secretary is required to: (1) publish a directory of participating physicians, which is to be made available to Medicare enrollees; (2) maintain a toll-free number for enrollees to obtain the names and specialties of participating physicians; (3) publish a list of the percentage of patients accepted by each physician on an assignment basis; and (4) provide for electronic receipt of claims from participating physicians so that their claims can be processed more rapidly. In addition, subsection 1395u(b)(4)(D) specifies that in determining the customary charges of \u201cnon-participating\u201d physicians for the twelve-month periods beginning October 1, 1985 and October 1, 1986, the Secretary shall not \u201crecognize increases in actual charges for services furnished\u201d during the fifteen-month freeze period. The increase in \u201cparticipating\u201d physicians\u2019 . actual charges, however, will be recognized by the Secretary in computing their customary charge levels once the freeze is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">In September 1984, appellants, who are practicing physicians in the Atlanta, Georgia area, filed suit seeking a temporary restraining order to stay operation of \u00a7 2306 before they had to elect in October 1984 whether to become \u201cparticipating\u201d physicians for the upcoming year. They contended that the temporary freeze on the fees that non-participating physicians could charge Part B enrollees, the possible civil penalties for violation of the freeze, the requirement that the Secretary monitor their billing practices, and the exclusion of non-participating physicians from the lists of doctors made available to Medicare en-rollees violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and constituted a bill of attainder prohibited by Article I, \u00a7 9 of the Constitution. The district court denied both their motion for a temporary restraining order and their request for a stay pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">In October, appellants filed an amended complaint alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that they did not elect to become \u201cparticipating\u201d physicians under the Deficit Reduction Act prior to October 1, 1984, that they planned to raise their fees to their patients covered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>Medicare Part B within the fifteen-month period beginning July 1, 1984, that 50-60% of their patients are Medicare Part B en-rollees, and that 85% of these patients have supplemental health insurance. After a hearing, the district court granted judgment for the Secretary, upholding the constitutionality of \u00a7 2306. <em>See </em>Whitney, 603 F.Supp. at 825-29. First, the district court concluded that \u00a7 2306 was not a deprivation of due process because the legislation is a \u201creasonable\u201d means for Congress to reduce federal spending without shifting the burden of cost reduction to the Medicare beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>at 825-26. The district court also rejected appellants\u2019 contention that the fee freeze and incentive provisions constituted a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment, reasoning that there is no unconstitutional taking of property in the instant case because the regulated action is voluntary \u2014 i.e., appellants can simply decline to treat Medicare patients if they wish to avoid federal regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 826-27. Finally, the court held that \u00a7 2306 is not a bill of attainder because this section cannot reasonably be construed as a legislative determination of guilt and imposition of punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 827-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">II. FIFTH AMENDMENT CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">A. <em>Substantive Due Process Challenge to the Fee Freeze</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">Appellants\u2019 principal contention on appeal is that the fifteen-month freeze on the fees non-participating physicians may charge their Medicare patients deprives them of their property in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellants concede that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>Congress has the power to regulate medical services and charges, Appellants\u2019 Brief at 23-25, but nevertheless insist that in doing so, Congress must provide an administrative mechanism to ensure that all doctors are guaranteed a \u201creasonable\u201d profit. Since Congress has not established such a regulatory board in this case, they argue that their substantive due process rights have been violated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">The test for determining whether economic and social regulation meets substantive due process requirements is well established: \u201c[i]f the laws passed are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process are satisfied____\u201d <em>Nebbia v. New York, </em>291 U.S. 502, 537, 54 S.Ct. 505, 516, 78 L.Ed. 940 (1934); <em>see also North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy v. Snyder\u2019s Drug Stores, Inc., </em>414 U.S. 156, 164-67, 94 S.Ct. 407, 412-14, 38 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973); <em>In re Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 769-70, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 1361-62, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968). The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that the judicial role in analyzing due process challenges to economic and social regulation is a limited one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-8\">The Oklahoma law may exact a needless, wasteful requirement in many cases. But it is for the legislature, not the courts, to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the new require-ment____ It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aut-dedup-0\">The day is gone when this court uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-13\"><em>Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., </em>348 U.S. 483, 487-88, 75 S.Ct. 461, 464-65, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955). <em>See also Ferguson v. Skrupa, </em>372 U.S. 726, 729-32, 83 S.Ct. 1028, 1030-32, 10 L.Ed.2d 93 (1963); <em>Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. Missouri, </em>342 U.S. 421, 423, 72 S.Ct. 405, 407, 96 L.Ed. 469 (1952); <em>Nebbia, </em>291 U.S. at 537-38, 54 S.Ct. at 516. With these principles in mind, we began our analysis of the constitutionality of the temporary fee freeze.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-14\">By enacting \u00a7 2306, Congress intended to accomplish two objectives. First, in order to curtail the increase in the federal deficit, Congress froze the \u201ccustomary\u201d and \u201cprevailing\u201d charges for physician\u2019s services during the fifteen-month period from July 1, 1984 to September 30, 1985. <em>See, e.g., </em>130 Cong.Rec.S. 8373, 8375 (daily ed. June 27, 1984) (Sen. Dole) (\u201cUnder \u00a7 2306, $2.5 billion will be saved by freezing for fifteen months the customary and prevailing charge levels used to determine what medicare will pay for physicians\u2019 services.\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2151, 2156 (hereafter \u201cLegislative History\u201d). In addition, Congress was concerned that non-participating physicians would make up any profits lost as the result of the freeze by raising their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>actual charges to Medicare enrollees. <em>See, e.g., </em>H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 861, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 757, 1314 (1984) (hereafter \u201cH.R. Conf.Rep. No. 98-861\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History at 2002; 130 Cong.Ree.H. 7085, 7086 (daily ed. June 27, 1984) (Rep. Rostenkowski), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History at 2144. In order to prevent nonparticipating physicians from shifting the burden of the freeze to Medicare beneficiaries, Congress placed a ceiling on the amount non-participating physicians could charge their Medicare beneficiaries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As Senator Dole, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-4\">[TJhere has been a great deal of concern about how physicians can be prevented from shifting the burden of such a freeze to beneficiaries. Simply freezing what we pay for physician services provides little protection to program beneficiaries. If a physician does not elect to take assignment, beneficiaries can be held responsible for the full difference between what the program pays and what the physician charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-5\">[T]he conferees spent a great deal of time in discussions with the administration trying to address this concern. As a result, the conferees agreed to a [temporary fee freeze] provision which works in concert with organized medicine\u2019s voluntary freeze.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">130 Cong.Rec. at S. 8375, <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History at 2156. <em>Accord </em>H.R. Conf.Rep. No. 98-861 at 1314, <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History at 2002; 130 Cong. Rec.H. 7085, 7086 (daily ed. June 27, 1984) (Rep. Rostenkowski), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History at 2144.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">The legislative history reveals that the temporary fee freeze provision was carefully drawn in order to accomplish these two objectives \u2014 to reduce the federal deficit without placing the burden of such reduction solely on Medicare beneficiaries. The fee freeze is based on each physician\u2019s charges for similar services in the quarter immediately preceding the freeze (i.e., charges for the quarter beginning April 1, 1984). Thus, the fee ceiling is not arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">Congress also intended this freeze \u201cto work in concert with the efforts \u2014 which are to be commended \u2014 of the American Medical Association and many individual medical societies which have urged their members voluntarily to freeze their fees.\u201d 130 Cong.Ree.H. 7085, 7086 (daily ed. June 27, 1984) (Rep. Rostenkowski), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History at 2144; <em>see also </em>H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 98-861 at 1314 (\u201c[I]n light of the efforts of many medical societies that have urged their members to voluntarily freeze their fees ..., the Conferees believe that this provision will work in concert with those efforts____\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History at 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-13\">Significantly, the fee freeze is a <em>temporary </em>measure based upon what each physician actually charged Medicare beneficiaries during the April 1, 1984 quarter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During the fifteen-month freeze, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to study the issue of medical services provided to Medicare enrollees and to make recommendations for the future \u201cin sufficient detail to serve as the basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>legislative action which Congress can take to assure that any burden of effectively constraining the growth of cost in the Medicare Part B program, which Congress intends to be borne by providers and physicians, is not transferred (in whole or in part) so as to become an additional burden on Part B beneficiaries in the form of increased out-of-pocket costs, reduced services, or reduced access to needed physician care.\u201d Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-369, \u00a7 2306(d), 98 Stat. 494, 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Under these circumstances, we hold that Congress could reasonably determine that a temporary fee freeze, pending the preparation of a more comprehensive program, was necessary in order to prevent Medicare beneficiaries from bearing the burden of the reduction in Medicare expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">In <em>Minnesota Ass\u2019n of Health Care Facilities, Inc. v. Minnesota Department of Public Welfare, </em>742 F.2d 442 (8th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1191, 84 L.Ed.2d 337 (1985), the Eighth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of a similar statute. In that case, Minnesota had enacted a statute limiting the rates which nursing homes participating in the Medicaid program may charge patients who do not receive Medicaid benefits. The Minnesota Association of Health Care Facilities contended that the regulation of the fees its members could receive from private sources violated the requirements of substantive due process. The Eighth Circuit, however, found that the Minnesota statute satisfied these requirements because \u201c[t]he Minnesota legislature could reasonably find that differences in rates for the same nursing home services, depending wholly upon whether or not a resident receives medical assistance, are inimical to the public welfare, and thus it could properly choose to regulate the rates that nursing homes participating in Medicaid charge the residents who do not receive medical assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447. Similarly, Congress determined in the instant case that limiting the increase in Medicare payments without also limiting the total fees that may be charged to Medicare beneficiaries would be harmful to the public welfare because it would place the burden of cost reductions solely upon Medicare beneficiaries.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">Appellants argue, however, that in order to regulate physicians\u2019 fees (i.e., to fix the fees), Congress must establish a regulatory mechanism to set standards in such a way that all physicians can make a \u201creasonable\u201d profit. As stated above, the due process test is whether the law has a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, and is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory. Under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude that the legislative purposes are legitimate\u2014 i.e., to control federal spending in order to alleviate deficit problems, and to promote the public welfare by precluding physicians from shifting the burden of the reductions onto Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 and we conclude that the means chosen by Congress are not unreasonable \u2014 i.e., the fees are fixed at what this physician himself charged in the recent past (the quarter immediately preceding the freeze period), and the freeze is temporary pending a study which can form the basis for more permanent legislation. Under these circumstances, we hold that due process does not require Congress to follow the rate-making procedures suggested by appellants. We are not confronted with the issue of whether due process would require ratemaking or other such procedures in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>case of permanent legislation,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and we express no opinion thereon.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">B. <em>Other Fifth Amendment Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">Appellants raise two other Fifth Amendment challenges that warrant only brief discussion. First, appellants argue that the temporary freeze on their actual charges to Medicare patients constitutes a taking of their property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. This contention, however, lacks merit. It is well established that government price regulation does not constitute a taking of property where the regulated group is not required to participate in the regulated industry. <em>See, e.g., Bowles v. Willingham, </em>321 U.S. 503, 517-18, 64 S.Ct. 641, 648-49, 88 L.Ed. 892 (1944) (rent controls do not constitute prohibited taking because statute did not require landlords to offer their apartments for rent); <em>Minnesota Ass\u2019n of Health Care Facilities, Inc., </em>742 F.2d at 446 (state statute limiting fees nursing homes participating in Medicaid Program may charge to non-Medicaid patients is not taking within meaning of the Fifth Amendment because \u201cthe state does not require that nursing homes admit medical assistance residents and participate in the Medicaid Program\u201d). In the instant case, appellants are not required to treat Medicare patients, and the temporary freeze is therefore not a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">Appellants\u2019 next contention is that the temporary fee freeze and the federal monitoring of non-participating physicians\u2019 billing practices infringe the liberty of contract protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We find this claim to be totally lacking in merit. In order for the challenged provisions to infringe appellants\u2019 liberty of contract, they must bear no rational relationship to any legitimate purpose of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. <em>See, e.g., West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, </em>300 U.S. 379, 391-92, 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>S.Ct. 578, 581-82, 81 L.Ed. 703 (1937). As discussed above, the temporary fee freeze is rationally related to legitimate congressional objectives. Moreover, federal monitoring of the billing practices of non-participating physicians is a reasonable means for determining whether these physicians are complying with the temporary freeze.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">III. BILL OF ATTAINDER CHALLENGE</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">Appellants\u2019 final contention is that the incentives in \u00a7 2306 for physicians to become participating physicians (providing Medicare enrollees with lists of the specialties and phone numbers of participating physicians, more efficient processing of claims and the recognition of increased billing charges to non-Medicare patients in future calculations of participating physicians\u2019 \u201ccustomary\u201d charges) and the statutory enforcement mechanism (civil fines and/or barring non-participating physicians from treating Medicare patients for a period of up to five years) constitute a bill of attainder prohibited by Article I, \u00a7 9 of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">A bill of attainder has been defined as a \u201c \u2018law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 3348, 82 L.Ed.2d 632, 640 (1984) (quoting <em>Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, </em>433 U.S. 425, 468, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 2803, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977)). In determining whether a statute is a bill of attainder, the Supreme Court has cautioned that \u201c[t]he judicial function is \u2018not to destroy the Act if we can, but to construe it, if consistent with the will of Congress, so as to comport with constitutional limitations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Selective Service System, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 104 S.Ct. at 3355, 82 L.Ed.2d at 642 <em>(quoting CSC v. Letter Carriers, </em>413 U.S. 548, 571, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 2893, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973)). Because we find that \u00a7 2306 does not inflict \u201cpunishment\u201d forbidden by Article I, \u00a7 9 of the Constitution, we hold that it is not a constitutionally prohibited bill of attainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-15\">A statute inflicts constitutionally forbidden punishment if (1) the statutory penalty falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment, (2) the statute fails to further any nonpunitive legislative purpose, or (3) the legislative history establishes a congressional intent to punish. <em>See, e.g., Selective Service System, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 104 S.Ct. at 3355, 82 L.Ed.2d at 643; <em>Nixon, </em>433 U.S. at 475-76, 97 S.Ct. at 2806-07. The civil penalty and incentive provisions do not run afoul of the foregoing guideposts. First, the challenged civil penalty and incentive provisions do not fall within the historical meaning of legislative punishment. In upholding the constitutionality of a statute denying federal financial assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 to students who fail to register for the military draft, the Supreme Court reasoned that the \u201cmere denial of a noncontractual governmental benefit\u201d did not approach the penalties traditionally associated with bills of attainder.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Selective </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number><em>Service System, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 104 S.Ct. at 3356, 82 L.Ed.2d at 644; <em>see also Flem-ming v.

No affirmative disability or restraint is imposed, certainly nothing approaching the \u2018infamous punishment\u2019 of imprisonment ____\u201d). Similarly, the challenged provisions in the instant case \u2014 the civil enforcement mechanism and the incentives for doctors to become \u201cparticipating\u201d physicians \u2014 do not impose the punishment historically associated with bills of attainder but rather are simply examples of statutory civil penalties frequently enacted to aid the executive branch in the enforcement of the law. <em>See, e.g., Zwick v. Freeman, </em>373 F.2d 110, 119-20 (2d Cir.) (statute prohibiting licensee from employing, without government approval, any person responsibly connected with anyone found to have committed flagrant or repeated violations of the unfair conduct provisions of Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act is not bill of attainder), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 835, 88 S.Ct. 43, 19 L.Ed.2d 96 (1967); <em>Bearden v. Commissioner, </em>575 F.Supp. 1459, 1462 (D.Utah 1983) (statute prescribing $500 penalty for filing of frivolous tax return does not constitute bill of attainder).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-13\">With respect to the second and third prongs of the test, the legislative history convincingly establishes that \u00a7 2306 was intended to further nonpunitive goals, not to punish nonparticipating physicians. As discussed above, the temporary freeze was intended to prevent Medicare beneficiaries alone from bearing the burden of reduced Medicare expenditures. Moreover, the various incentive provisions of \u00a7 2306 were designed to encourage physicians to participate in the Medicare program and to provide beneficiaries with the information necessary to obtain the services of physicians who would not charge them more than the \u201creasonable\u201d rate recognized by Congress.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Neither the text of \u00a7 2306 nor its legislative history suggests that \u00a7 2306 was intended to \u201cpunish\u201d physicians who elect not to \u201cparticipate\u201d in the Medicare program. Under these circumstances, we hold that \u00a7 2306 does not constitute a bill of attainder prohibited by the Constitution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>IV.

Because appellants have raised a substantial challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 2306, which does not involve a claim for benefits under Part B, we find that we have jurisdiction to hear this case.</p>\n<p id=\"anq-dedup-1\">In addition, appellee contends that appellants\u2019 challenge to the temporary fee freeze may not be ripe for judicial resolution because they have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>not actually raised their rates. We reject this contention. To determine whether an issue is ripe for judicial review, a court must evaluate (1) \"the fitness of the issues for judicial decision\u201d and (2) \"the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u201d <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967). Because this appeal raises a facial attack on the constitutionality of \u00a7 2306 and presents a purely legal question, we will never be in a better position to decide the issue. <em>See, e.g., Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., </em>438 U.S. 59, 81-82, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2634-35, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978); <em>McCoy-Elkhorn Coal Corp. v. EPA, </em>622 F.2d 260, 264 (6th Cir.1980). Moreover, deferring resolution of the constitutionality of \u00a7 2306 will force appellants to choose between complying with the temporary fee freeze and risking sanctions by raising their rates. It is well established that an issue is ripe for judicial review when the challenging party is placed in the dilemma of incurring the disadvantages of complying or risking penalties for noncompliance. <em>See, e.g., Doe v. Bolton, </em>410 U.S. 179, 188, 93 S.Ct. 739, 745, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1974); <em>Epperson v. Arkansas, </em>393 U.S. 97, 100, 89 S.Ct. 266, 268, 21 L.Ed.2d 228 (1968). Hence, we conclude that the ripeness standard has been met in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">. The temporary fee freeze provision simply reflects a general congressional concern that reductions in Medicare expenditures should not be borne solely by Medicare beneficiaries. <em>See, e.g., </em>130 Cong.Rec.S. 8373, 8375 (daily ed. June 27, 1984) (Sen. Dole) (noting that physicians, hospitals, laboratories, health insurers, and employers will bear \u201c[e]ighty-two percent of the health care program savings achieved in this bill\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History at 2156.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">. Appellants contend that one feature of \u00a7 2306 will have a permanent effect. They argue that since the Secretary will not recognize any increases in the actual charges of non-participating physicians in calculating the \u201ccustomary\u201d charge in the future, \u00a7 2306 will permanently affect their charges. We reject this contention. The statute will only affect what the Medicare program will pay in the future, and will have no effect on what non-participating physicians can <em>actually </em>charge to Medicare patients in the future. As appellants concede, Congress has the authority to determine what the Medicare program itself will pay physicians. Appellants' Brief at 19-20. In addition, appellants have offered no evidence concerning the future effects of this provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">. In fact, the argument for the constitutionality of the provision challenged here is stronger because, unlike the Minnesota statute, Congress is only <em>temporarily </em>regulating the fees that may be charged to Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, in <em>Minnesota Ass\u2019n of Health Care Facilities, </em>the legislation fixed the rates charged to persons who were <em>not </em>receiving government medical benefits, whereas the instant regulation fixes the fees <em>only </em>with respect to persons receiving government medical assistance. Of course, we express no opinion concerning the constitutionality of the more far-reaching Minnesota legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">. Congress\u2019 extension of the freeze until March 15, 1986, <em>see supra </em>note 3, does not change the temporary nature of the legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">. ' We note that appellants have offered no evidence in this case that the actual charge permitted is unreasonable or arbitrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">. Appellants argue that they have not voluntarily accepted government regulation of their charges to Medicare patients because they have not sought to \"participate\u201d in the Medicare program. This argument, however, is flawed. Appellants have continued to treat Medicare patients, and two of the appellants have admitted that th\u00e9y occasionally accepted assignments of Medicare reimbursement claims. Record on Appeal at 72. Moreover, the fact that Medicare patients comprise a substantial percentage of their practices does not render their participation \"involuntary.\u201d <em>See Bowles v. Willing-ham, </em>321 U.S. at 517, 64 S.Ct. at 648 (no taking where rent control statute did not require landlord to rent apartments); <em>Minnesota Ass\u2019n of Health Pare Facilities, </em>742 F.2d at 446 (\u201cMAHCF contends that business realities prevent nursing homes from leaving the Medicaid Program voluntarily.

At one point, appellants apparently contend that Congress cannot regulate the amount that non-participating physicians charge their Medicare patients because there is no \"privity\u201d between the government and these doctors. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Brief at 38-44 (citing, <em>inter alia, Greene v.
