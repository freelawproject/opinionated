But it was not clear that any additional knowledge of the defects was acquired by AMF, Inc. after it manufactured this particular machine or by Sears, Roebuck after it lent this machine to the plaintiff on May 13, 1978 and the time when the plaintiff sustained injury on May 21, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">However, there was no evidence that if those defects had not existed and Sears had lent Miss West a defect-free lawnmower the unforeseen metal pipe would have been deflected in its passage from its concealed place in the unmowed high grass to the point where it struck Miss West\u2019s foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">The district judge gave an extended charge, which apparently he had taped for the jury. Therein he gave what may best be characterized as the customary Massachusetts trial judge\u2019s ambulatory charge rambling over the broad areas of duty, standard of care, breach, causation, and damages \u2014 the unfortunately familiar set of passable generalizations not likely to lead to an appellate reversal. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel specifically objected only to the judge\u2019s failure to give requested instruction 23, which, as is proved by its introductory paragraph and its citation of <em>doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 776, 328 N.E.2d 873 (1975), was directed at \u201cdangers of which the manufacturer ... learned <em>after </em>the sale or loan of the product.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">The judge submitted the case to the jury not for a general verdict but for answers to particular questions. We need here recite only that the jury answered \u201cno\u201d to question 6, \u201cWas the manufacturer of the mower negligent in the design of the \u2018starting clip\u2019?\u201d and answered \u201cno\u201d to question 7, \u201cWas the manufacturer of the mower negligent in the design of the rear skirt?\u201d and answered \u201cno\u201d to question 16, \u201cWas negligent design of the mower causally related to plaintiff\u2019s injury?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">Upon the basis of those and other answers, the judge entered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff moved for a new trial. The court denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The appellant\u2019s first contention is that \u201cthe trial court erred by not clearly instructing the jury as to the defendants\u2019 continuing duty to warn the plaintiff of any deficiencies existing in the AMF Model 902031 lawnmower discovered subsequent to the manufacture of the lawnmower but prior to the date of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d That contention is plainly bottomed on the assumption that there was evidence that defects were discovered <em>after </em>this particular machine was manufactured (or in the case of the retailer Sears, after this particular machine was lent to the plaintiff) which were not known to the manufacturer (or Sears) at earlier dates. The plaintiff has not with particularity called our attention to that evidence, if it existed and if it was actually offered in court. Therefore, we hold that there was no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the trial judge\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Insofar as the plaintiff seeks reversal of the judgment because she contends that the evidence requires a finding in her favor, we are of the opinion that she is mistaken. The jury could reasonably have believed that even if the machine were defective in the two respects complained of, these defects were not the cause of the injury she sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">If the switch was carelessly attached to the machine, when it fell off, even though this may have caused the machine to continue operating and led the plaintiff to seek a quick way of stopping it by some method other than the switch, the jury could reasonably have believed that the plaintiff by choosing to drive the machine into thick, unmowed grass where unknown objects might lurk, was herself careless, and that it was her negligence in choosing that course which was the sole, as it used to be said, proximate or legal cause of her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">As to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint that the skirt guard on the machine was defective because it was made of plastic rather than metal, we are of the opinion that the jury could reasonably believe that no matter of what material the skirt guard had been constructed, there was no reason for the designer to plan the skirt guard to protect the person mowing the lawn against the consequences of her having picked up a metal pipe. Lawn mowers are not designed to be hand-operated excavators.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
