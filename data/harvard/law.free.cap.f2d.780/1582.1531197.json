Fairchild, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1669-5\">In this diversity jurisdiction personal injury action arising out of a motor vehicle collision, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice because plaintiffs counsel failed to file a timely pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-6\">This Court is not unmindful of the responsibility of trial courts to actively move cases through the system. Often the reluctance or dilatoriness of counsel substantially impedes this endeavor. In deciding whether a case was properly dismissed with prejudice, which may visit the faults of the recalcitrant lawyer on a client innocent of wrong, however, this Court must review the action under well-established principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-7\">While the district court has broad powers under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to impose sanctions for a party\u2019s failure to abide by court orders, dismissal of an action with prejudice is a \u201csanction of last resort, applicable only in extreme circumstances.\u201d <em>State Exchange Bank v. Hartline, </em>693 F.2d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.1982). A party should not be punished for his attorney\u2019s mistake absent a clear record of delay or willful contempt and a finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice. <em>Hildebrand v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1980). A pattern of willful disobedience is not present in this case. <em>Silas v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., Inc., </em>586 F.2d 382, 385 (5th Cir.1978). A party\u2019s simple negligence in complying with a court\u2019s order does not warrant dismissal. <em>E.E.O.C. v. Troy State University, </em>693 F. 2d 1353, 1357 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-10\">Absent a showing of a \u201cclear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff,\u201d the trial court\u2019s discretion is limited to the application of lesser sanctions designed to achieve compliance with the court\u2019s orders and expedite proceedings. <em>Graves v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Co., </em>528 F.2d 1360, 1361 (5th Cir.1976); <em>Pond v. Braniff Airways, Inc., </em>453 F.2d 347 (5th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-11\">In the instant case, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice without exploring lesser sanctions, particularly against the attorney, that might have progressed the case in compliance with the court\u2019s requirements. The record makes no mention of alternative sanctions. In light of this fact and an absence of a \u201cclear record of delay\u201d and \u201ccontumacious conduct by the plaintiff,\u201d we hold that the dismissal with prejudice was not warranted. Fogarty Van Lines has not shown that it was prejudiced in such a manner as to require dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-12\">The reversal of the dismissal with prejudice does not deprive the district court of the authority to impose lesser sanctions against the plaintiff, or disciplinary action against the attorney, if the Court decides such would be appropriate under the established law and the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-13\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
