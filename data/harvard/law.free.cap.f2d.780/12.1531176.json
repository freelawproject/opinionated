For the reasons stated below, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-25\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b98-26\">Civilian technicians constitute the only full-time staff employed by the Wisconsin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Army National Guard (\u201cGuard\u201d). They administer Guard units, train Guard members, and maintain Guard equipment. Civilian technicians are required to become members of the Guard, and may be called into active duty. They are exempt, however, from certain military duties, and their dismissal and annual evaluation must comply with civilian standards, not military.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Civilian technicians are federal employees under the Labor-Management and Employee Relations Act (\u201cLMERA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7135. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(2); <em>Indiana Air National Guard v. FLRA, </em>712 F.2d 1187 (7th Cir.1983). They have the right \u201cto engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives [they choose].\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7102(2). The LMERA defines \u201cconditions of employment\u201d as \u201cpersonnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(14). Under \u00a7 7106(b)(1), however, the Guard may elect not to negotiate with civilian technicians on the subject of \u201ctechnology, methods, and means of performing work.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 7105(a)(2)(E), civilian technicians may challenge the Guard\u2019s refusal to negotiate on a matter by petitioning the Federal Labor Relations Authority (\u201cFLRA\u201d) for a negotiability determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The Association of Civilian Technicians (\u201cACT\u201d) is the exclusive collective bargaining agent for civilian technicians in the Guard. In the course of negotiating a collective-bargaining agreement with the Guard, the ACT submitted a proposal that would allow civilian technicians under specified conditions to wear standard civilian attire instead of military uniforms while performing their non-military duties. The Guard refused to negotiate on the proposal on the ground that it concerned matters not subject to mandatory negotiation under the LMERA. On February 22, 1983, the ACT petitioned the FLRA for a negotiability determination. The Guard contended that the uniform proposal related to a \u201cmeans\u201d of conducting its operations, and thus came within the \u00a7 7106(b)(1) exception to the general duty to negotiate on proposals affecting working conditions. On August 19, 1984, without holding an evidentia-ry hearing, the FLRA determined that the Guard had properly elected not to negotiate on the proposal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ACT petitions this court for review of the FLRA determination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">The ACT claims the FLRA determination that the Guard may elect, pursuant to section 7106(b)(1), not to negotiate concerning attire requirements for civilian technicians (1) frustrates the purpose of the LMERA, (2) impermissibly departs from FLRA precedent, and (3) is unsupported by substantial evidence. To date four federal appellate circuits have decided these issues in favor of the FLRA under substantially identical circumstances. <em>See American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>775 F.2d 1022 (9th Cir. Oct. 31, 1985); <em>National Ass\u2019n of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>771 F.2d 1449 (11th Cir.1985); <em>American Federation of Government Employees v.

Because we agree with the decisions reached by the Ninth, Eleventh, First, and Second Circuits in those cases, we deny the ACT\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">For the reasons stated above, ACT\u2019s petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"Au0\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\">.

The FLRA found that the requirement that technicians wear the military uniform concerned the Guard\u2019s choice of a \"methods [ ] and means\u201d of performing work within the meaning of \u00a7 7106(b)(1). The FLRA relied upon its decision in <em>Division of Military and Naval Affairs, State of New York, (Albany, New York) and New York Council, Ass\u2019n of Civilian Technicians, </em>8 F.L.R.A. 158 (1984).
