JAKE, </em>an offshore oil platform supply boat, in Texas coastal waters. The former was seized on December 10, the latter on December 19. In connection with the seizure of the <em>EL COBRE, </em>Steven Kalish was charged with and tried in March 1980 for conspiracy to import marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963 and for conspiracy to possess marijuana with an intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Kalish was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">The next month (April 1980) Kalish was tried on the same charges, but these stemmed from the seizure of the <em>MR. JAKE. </em>In addition, Kalish was charged with and tried for the substantive offense of possession of marijuana with an intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). This time Kalish was found guilty on all three charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">Kalish appealed, and we reversed his conviction on the two conspiracy charges from the <em>MR. JAKE </em>trial because these constituted double jeopardy in light of the earlier <em>EL COBRE </em>trial on identical charges. His conviction of the substantive offense was, however, expressly affirmed. <em>United States v. Kalish, </em>690 F.2d 1144 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">In June 1983, Kalish was indicted with several others for a smuggling transaction involving some 48,000 pounds of marijuana alleged to have taken place on December 3-4, 1979 near Jasper, Texas (the Jasper Farm episode). Count 5 of the indictment charged Kalish with possessing marijuana with an intent to distribute and with aiding and abetting such possession in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(6) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, while Count 10 charged him with the importation of marijuana and with aiding and abetting such importation in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Kalish was also indicted on other charges, but those counts were dismissed in a plea bargain agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-17\">As part of the plea bargain, Kalish pled guilty to Counts 5 and 10 of the indictment but reserved his right to appeal on double jeopardy and collateral estoppel grounds. That appeal is presently before us, as is Kalish\u2019s collateral attack via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on his substantive conviction from the <em>MR. JAKE </em>trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-18\">I. The Substantive Conviction From The <em>MR JAKE </em>Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b593-19\">After we affirmed his substantive offense conviction from the <em>MR. JAKE </em>trial, Kalish attacked the judgment collaterally in the district court by way of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the federal habeas statute. The district court denied relief because the subject of his petition had been raised and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>disposed of in the original direct appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Kalish argued in his \u00a7 2255 petition, and argues here, that his <em>MR. JAKE </em>substantive offense conviction was based upon a fact issue \u2014 his participation in a conspiracy \u2014 which the government was collaterally estopped from relitigating. In both the <em>EL COBRE </em>and <em>MR. JAKE </em>trials the government\u2019s principal witness was a Mr. Troutwein. Kalish argues that since the <em>EL COBRE </em>trial necessarily resolved the issue of Troutwein\u2019s credibility in his favor, the district court erred in the <em>MR. JAKE </em>trial in permitting Troutwein to link Kalish to the <em>MR. JAKE </em>episode with virtually the same testimony that Troutwein had given in the <em>EL COBRE </em>trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The question, though, was resolved in our original appeal. We declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">In criminal cases, the government is barred from relitigating a fact issue \u201conly if the jury could not rationally have based its verdict on an issue other than the one the defendant seeks to foreclose ... when a \u2018fact is not <em>necessarily </em>determined in a former trial, the possibility that it may have been does not prevent re-examination of that issue.\u2019 <em>United States v. Lee, </em>622 F.2d 787, 790 (5th Cir.1980)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">... The <em>EL COBRE </em>jury did not necessarily find that Troutwein\u2019s every statement concerning his dealings with Kalish was untrue. Indeed, the jury could have believed everything except Trout-wein\u2019s testimony connecting Kalish to the <em>EL COBRE </em>and this testimony was excluded from the <em>MR. JAKE </em>trial. 690 F.2d at 1155 (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">It is settled in this Circuit that issues raised and disposed of in a previous appeal from an original judgment of conviction are not considered in \u00a7 2255 Motions. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>614 F.2d 80, 82 (5th Cir.1980). The district court, then, did not err in refusing to entertain Kalish\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">II. The Jasper Farm Guilty Plea and Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Kalish challenges his conviction for the offenses of importing, possessing with an intent to distribute, and aiding and abetting the importing and possession of the 48,000 pounds of marijuana in the Jasper Farm episode. Kalish argues that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precluded this indictment and prosecution, since the <em>EL COBRE </em>jury had already acquitted him of charges of membership in a \u201clarger conspiracy.\u201d The crux of Kalish\u2019s argument is that the government did not prove that he actually imported and possessed marijuana, but rather only attempted to prove that he aided and abetted the importation and possession of marijuana, and that the only proof offered of his aiding and abetting was evidence of his participation in the same conspiracy that the <em>EL COBRE </em>jury rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Collateral estoppel is part of the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy. It means that \u201cwhen an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1194, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970). Collateral estoppel precludes a later prosecution only if the jury could not rationally have based its verdict on an issue other than the one the defendant seeks to foreclose. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>622 F.2d 787, 790 (5th Cir.1980). \u201cWhen a \u2018fact is not <em>necessarily </em>determined in a former trial, the possibility that it may have been does not prevent re-examination of that issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id, </em>quoting <em>Adams v. United States, </em>287 F.2d 701, 705 (5th Cir.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">Collateral estoppel may operate in two distinct ways. It may completely bar a subsequent prosecution where one of the facts necessarily determined in the former trial is an essential element to the conviction the government later seeks. Second, although the later prosecution may proceed, collateral estoppel operates to bar the introduction or argumentation of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>facts necessarily established in a prior proceeding. <em>Lee, </em>supra, at 790. The burden is on the defendant to show that the judgment in the original trial necessarily decided a crucial issue in the second trial. <em>United States v. Giarratano, </em>622 F.2d 153, 156 n. 4 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Kalish has failed to carry his burden of showing that the <em>EL COBRE </em>jury necessarily decided a crucial issue in the later Jasper Farm prosecution. In the latter, the government showed \u2014 through stipulated evidence \u2014 that Kalish imported and possessed marijuana, actually as well as constructively, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(6); and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960(a)(1). The <em>EL COBRE </em>jury necessarily determined that Kalish was not a member of the conspiracy charged in that indictment. Kalish, however, has not shown that the <em>EL COBRE </em>jury must have resolved in his favor any of the facts \u2014 essential or otherwise \u2014 stipulated to in the Jasper Farm case. Indeed, we conclude, he could not, since the government did not even attempt to use the facts stipulated in the Jasper Farm guilty plea to prove its <em>EL COBRE </em>case. Hence, Kalish\u2019s collateral estoppel argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">We hold that the district court did not err in dismissing Kalish\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition attacking his <em>MR. JAKE </em>conviction, and likewise hold that Kalish\u2019s Jasper Farm prosecution and conviction were not barred by collateral estoppel. The <em>MR. JAKE </em>and Jasper Farm convictions are accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
