This is also a case which, though terminating in a summary judgment for defendants, 104 F.R.D. 613, has been anything but summary in the quantity of counts pleaded, depositions, affidavits, exhibits, and layers of judicial attention. Accordingly, we shall be brief in indicating the reasons for our affirmance on the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The breach of contract count (Count I) began as an allegation that plaintiff was fired in violation of defendant CACI\u2019s personnel policies, that he was not given a minimum of three years employment as promised, and that his discharge was in breach of an implied covenant of fair dealing. This set of claims has metamorphosed into a present claim that \u201cthe parties entered into an indefinite employment arrangement subject to an understanding that Broussard would not be terminated arbitrarily.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief, p. 17)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Under Maine law, \u201ca contract of employment for an indefinite length of time is terminable at will by either party\u201d, <em>Terrio v. Millinocket Community Hospital, </em>379 A.2d 135, 137 (Me.1977) (emphasis in original), unless the parties \u201cclearly stat[e] their intention\u201d in \u201cexpress terms\u201d that a discharge shall be only for good cause. <em>Larrabee v. Penobscot Frozen Foods, </em>486 A.2d 97, 99-100 (Me.1984). In the latter case the court made clear that a promise, merely implied, not to fire without good cause, was inadequate. <em>Id. </em>at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">In this case the representations made to plaintiff by CACI \u2014 to the effect that CACI would have work in Bath \u201croughly through 1986\u201d, that it was \u201chiring him for a career ... not ... under the body shop technique\u201d, that \u201cthere was [sic] no restraints on what he could or could not do professionally and financially with CACI\u201d, and that \u201cif he did a good job he would have long-term employment\u201d \u2014 do not approach an express undertaking to guarantee that plaintiff could be discharged only for good cause. In the euphoria of initial negotiations, plaintiff\u2019s expectations of tenure may well have been reinforced by these representations, but his expectations could not be held to have been created by these representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">The difference between puffery and promise is preserved by the Maine cases we have cited. Employment negotiations resulting in employment are by definition conducted in an atmosphere of optimism and mutual hope. The air is redolent with expectation of duration on the part of the employee and of satisfactory performance by the employer. But to equate general expressions of hope for a long relationship with an express promise to discharge only for good cause would effectively eliminate Maine\u2019s rule, severe though it may be, that contracts for indefinite employment are, without more, terminable at will.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">So concluding, we need not address the 'questions whether the undertaking was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>whether such a defense was precluded by equitable estoppel. Our silence on these issues, however, does not imply any disagreement with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The count alleging misrepresentation (Count II) also underwent a permutation, beginning with the allegation that CACI falsely represented that it would have work for plaintiff in Bath, Maine, for at least three years, and ending with the claim that CACI \u201cfailed to inform Broussard of the element which could render all the other representations meaningless \u2014 i.e., that he could be arbitrarily terminated without recourse ____\u201d (Appellants\u2019 brief, p. 24)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The sum total of the testimony relied on to create a genuine issue of misrepresentation, extracted from a 300-page appendix which in turn was distilled from many more hundreds of pages of depositions and affidavits, consists of the following statements: CACI\u2019s policy was \u201cplant a garden and then weed it ____ and all the cream surfaces to the top\u201d; \u201cAll it takes to remove someone ... is if his boss wants to and his boss\u2019 boss agrees to it\u201d; and if customers did not like CACI\u2019s employees who dealt with them, they \u2014 the customers \u2014 would have influence in effecting their discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The issue is whether failure to reveal these details of CACI\u2019s discharge at will policy is actionable as a half-truth, <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 529 (1977); or a fraudulent concealment, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 550; <em>Atwood v. Chapman, </em>68 Me. 38 (1877); <em>cf. Horner v. Flynn, </em>334 A.2d 194 (Me.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The district court distinguished <em>Wildes v. Pens Unlimited Co., </em>389 A.2d 837 (Me. 1978), where a putative employer was held liable for concealing from a salesman being' hired the fact that a reorganization of the company which would eliminate the salesman\u2019s position was then under way. The district court noted the absence of any plan to eliminate plaintiff\u2019s position and concluded that \u201c[t]o accept the plaintiffs\u2019 argument of a duty to disclose here would require that every employer who hires at will affirmatively state its right to terminate arbitrarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">We do not say that there may not be extreme situations where the record of arbitrary and irresponsible firing is so egregious that failure to disclose it would constitute fraudulent concealment. But there is no such record here. Plaintiff\u2019s predecessor was discharged not on a superior\u2019s whim but for unsatisfactory performance after several trips by CACI officials had been made to Bath to try to help him. And for CACI, a consulting company de- , pendent on the good will of the government agencies it serves, to be sensitive to customer complaints is not surprising.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At worst the nondisclosure in this record is that of a policy hospitable to firing on the complaint of a customer, cushioned against the whim of one person by the requirement that two supervisors join in the action. In other words, the policy is that of discharge at will, taken seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">The problem is that, if the nondisclosure described here is held to raise a genuine issue of fraudulent concealment, this would be an open-ended invitation to litigation of the issue in almost every case of a discharge at will. We would not know how to draw a line between failure to state the law of at will discharges \u2014 which would not be actionable \u2014 and failure to state how a company applies this law \u2014 which would be actionable. We therefore hold that the statements we have cited do not constitute sufficiently substantial evidence to create a \u201cgenuine\u201d issue of material fact. <em>Hahn v. Sargent, </em>523 F.2d 461, 464 (1st Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">We affirm the judgments on both Counts I and II and, accordingly, do not reach Counts VI and VII, claiming negligent infliction of emotional distress and seeking punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-11\">. According to the author of the note, <em>Protecting At Will Employees Against Wrongful Discharge: The Duty to Terminate Only In Good. Faith, </em>93 Harv.L.Rev. 1816 (1980), two-thirds of the American work force is governed by this rule. <em>Id. </em>at 1816. Under it, \"[e]ven when an employee has reasonable grounds for expecting that some degree of job security was part of the deal, the at will rule often operates to frustrate her expectations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1818. Further, \u201c[c]ourts have generally been reluctant to interfere with the parties\u2019 \u2018freedom to contract\u2019; if an employee fails to bargain for an express contractual protection against wrongful discharge, the court will not intervene whether the contract was terminated \u2018for good cause, for no cause or even for cause morally wrong.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1818-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\">.
