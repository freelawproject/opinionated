We reverse, holding that such interest payments are permissible but not required to provide adequate protection, and remand to the bankruptcy court for additional findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-28\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-29\">In January 1983, Briggs filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>cy Code. At that time General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) held a valid perfected security interest in fifty tandem-axle tractors purchased by Briggs. Lend Lease, a division of National Car Rental System, Inc. (Lend Lease),, held a valid perfected security interest in 100 trailers under a secured lease/purchase agreement with Briggs. Both GMAC and Lend Lease were undersecured, and Briggs claimed no equity in the collateral. GMAC and Lend Lease were prevented from foreclosing on their collateral by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> automatic stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">GMAC and Lend Lease petitioned the bankruptcy court under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d)(1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for relief from the stay and permission to foreclose. The parties subsequently stipulated that Briggs could retain the collateral in exchange, <em>inter alia, </em>for monthly cash payments to compensate the creditors for the equipment\u2019s depreciation as a component of adequate protection. GMAC and Lend Lease also sought adequate protection in the form of interest payments to compensate for their \u201clost opportunity costs.\u201d The creditors\u2019 claims for lost opportunity costs are premised on their inability under the automatic stay to immediately foreclose, liquidate the collateral, and reinvest the liquidation proceeds. Briggs opposed the creditors\u2019 claims for interest and the issue was submitted to the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court found as a matter of law that adequate protection precludes a debtor from being required to pay opportunity costs caused by the automatic stay. <em>See In re Briggs Transportation Co., </em>35 B.R. 210, 216-7 (Bankr.D.Minn.1983). The creditors appealed and the district court reversed. Interpreting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s adequate protection analysis in <em>In re American Mariner Industries, Inc., </em>734 F.2d 426 (9th Cir.1984) <em>(.American Mariner), </em>which was filed after the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, the district court concluded that the undersecured creditors were entitled to interest payments as a matter of law to compensate for the delay in enforcing their foreclosure rights. Briggs appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-14\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-15\">As we noted recently in <em>In re Martin, </em>761 F.2d 472 (8th Cir.1985), adequate pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>tection determinations present a question of fact for the bankruptcy court, and are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>Martin, </em>761 F.2d at 474; <em>see </em>Bankr.R. 7052. However, the issue now before us is a question of law as to what creditor interests are incorporated in the scope of adequate protection and is thus subject to de novo review. <em>See Martin, </em>761 F.2d at 474-75; <em>In re Comer, </em>723 F.2d 737, 739 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">The focus of GMAC\u2019s and Lend Lease\u2019s argument on appeal, similar to the creditor\u2019s position before the Ninth Circuit in <em>American Mariner, </em>is not how to provide adequate protection here but what aggregation of creditor interests are entitled to protection when a bankruptcy court has determined that an automatic stay should be retained rather than lifted. The creditors argue that although periodic cash payments by Briggs may protect them against decline in the collateral\u2019s recoverable value due to the debtor\u2019s continued use and possession of that collateral, those payments do not compensate the creditors for the \u201cbenefit of their bargain\u201d and do not leave the creditors adequately protected as required by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. Briggs contends that adequate protection focuses on the value of the collateral itself, not the whole economic bargain of the credit agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">We turn first to the creditors\u2019 constitutional challenge. Lend Lease argues that section 362(a)\u2019s impairment of the right to foreclose constitutes a \u201ctaking\u201d and that the Fifth Amendment requires fair compensation, relying on <em>Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, </em>295 U.S. 555, 55 S.Ct. 854, 79 L.Ed. 1593 (1935), which held the Bankruptcy Act of 1934, also known as the Frazier-Lemke Act, unconstitutional. However, the FrazierLemke Act in the context of farm mortgages essentially \u201ccompelled the mortgagee to relinquish the property to the mortgagor free of the lien,\u201d <em>Radford, </em>295 U.S. at 599, 55 S.Ct. at 867, thus permanently transforming the parties\u2019 rights regarding the property. The bankruptcy code\u2019s automatic stay, however, causes only a temporary delay of a creditor\u2019s right to enforce its lien on the collateral. In <em>Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust v. Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Co., </em>294 U.S. 648, 55 S.Ct. 595, 79 L.Ed. 1110 (1935), the Supreme Court held that suspension of the right to enforce a lien is within Congress\u2019s constitutional bankruptcy powers. <em>See Continental Illinois, </em>294 U.S. at 675, 55 S.Ct. at 605. Section 362(a)\u2019s temporary stay is thus not a taking of the creditors\u2019 substantive rights in specific property acquired before the petition\u2019s filing as was true in <em>Radford. See Radford, </em>295 U.S. at 590, 55 S.Ct. at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">In the bankruptcy context, adequate protection is a safeguard which is provided to protect the rights of secured creditors, throughout the proceedings, to the extent of the value of their property, and there is no constitutional claim of the creditor to more than thal. <em>Wright v. Union Central Life Insurance Co., </em>311 U.S. 273, 278, 61 S.Ct. 196, 199, 85 L.Ed. 184 (1940). By providing a creditor with a means of protecting its interest through section 362(d)\u2019s adequate protection requirement, the competing interests of the debtor\u2019s need to reorganize and the secured creditor\u2019s entitlement to constitutional protection of its bargained-for property interests are reconciled. <em>See, e.g., In re Jug End in the Berkshires, Inc., </em>46 B.R. 892, 898-99 (Bankr.D.Mass.1985). <em>See also First Bank of Miller, Miller, S.D. v. Wieseler, </em>45 B.R. 871, 874 n. 1 (D.S.D.1985) (citing <em>Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, </em>295 U.S. 555, 55 S.Ct. 854, 79 L.Ed. 1593 (1935); S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 49 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5835); <em>Matter of Alexander, </em>48 B.R. 110, 114-18 (Bankr.W.D.Mo. 1985). In a constitutional sense, this temporary suspension of lien enforcement breaches no essential property interest of the creditor and is not an unlawful taking under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-8\">We turn now to the undersecured creditors\u2019 characterization of section 362\u2019s automatic stay as an \u201cextraordinary remedy.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>Rather, as the report of the Senate Judiciary Committee states, \u201c[t]he automatic stay is one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws.\u201d S.Rep. No. 989 at 54, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5840. It is <em>automatic </em>upon a petition\u2019s filing and may last at least thirty days without affording creditors any protection. 11 U.S.C. section 362(e). Further, a secured creditor may avoid incurring substantial economic penalties due to undue delay in access to its assets by requesting relief from an automatic stay for cause, including the lack of adequate protection of the creditor\u2019s interest in the property. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">Essential to any analysis of the meaning of and policy behind any section of the bankruptcy code is the recognition that a bankruptcy court is a court of equity. Bankruptcy courts do not read statutory words with a computer\u2019s ease, but operate under the overriding consideration that equitable principles govern the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction. <em>In re Williams, </em>7 B.R. 234, 236 (Bankr.M.D.Ga. 1980), (quoting <em>Bank of Marin v. England, </em>385 U.S. 99, 103, 87 S.Ct. 274, 277, 17 L.Ed.2d 197 (1966)). As we noted in <em>Martin:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-6\">Under Chapter 11, the purposes of business reorganization are to \u201crelieve the debtor of its prepetition debts, to free cash flow to meet current operating expenses, and ultimately to permit the debtor \u2018to restructure a business\u2019s finances so that it may continue to operate, provide its employees with jobs, pay its creditors, and produce a return for its stockholders.\u2019 \u201d <em>American Mariner, </em>734 F.2d at 431 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 595 at 220, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 6179). The filing of a Chapter 11 petition operates as an automatic stay, which prevents creditors from enforcing their liens against the property of the bankruptcy estate and removing collateral that may be essential to the reorganization plan. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-9\"><em>Martin, </em>761 F.2d at 475. The automatic stay is clearly designed to afford a debtor a \u201cbreathing spell\u201d free from actions by creditors against the petitioner\u2019s estate. <em>In re Mellor, </em>734 F.2d 1396, 1399 (9th Cir.1984). The stay also shields creditors from each other and is intended to aid in equitably distributing the debtor\u2019s assets in a way that maximizes the interests of all parties. It is interim protection for secured creditors and \u201cdesigned not as a purgative of all creditor ailments but as a palliative of the worst: reorganization, dismissal or liquidation will provide the final relief.\u201d <em>In re Alyucan Interstate Corp., </em>12 B.R. 803, 806 (Bankr.D.Utah 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-10\">In <em>Yamaha Motor Corp. U.S.A. v. Shad-co, Inc., </em>762 F.2d 668 (8th Cir.1985), this court recognized that courts are divided on the issue whether compensation for post-petition interest is within the proper scope of adequate protection during an automatic stay. <em>See Yamaha, </em>762 F.2d at 670. A number of bankruptcy courts have declined to extend adequate protection to require interest payments compensating for lost reinvestment costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Ninth Circuit concluded, however, in <em>American Mariner </em>that adequate protection under section 362(d)(1) requires interest payments as a component of the secured collateral\u2019s underlying value, <em>In re American Mariner Industries, Inc., </em>734 F.2d 426, 435 (9th Cir.1984), reversing a decision of the bankruptcy court initially affirmed by a bankruptcy appellate panel. <em>See In re American Mariner Industries, Inc., </em>10 B.R. 711 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.1981), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>27 B.R. 1004 (Bankr. 9th Cir.1983). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>approach has been followed by other courts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> including the Fourth Circuit in <em>Grundy National Bank v. Tandem Mining Gory., </em>754 F.2d 1436 (4th Cir.1985) (adopting <em>American Mariner </em>analysis without extensive discussion of relevant statutory language or legislative history). Although agreeing that the creditors\u2019 arguments have some appeal from a strictly economic perspective, the bankruptcy court in the case at bar relied on the adequate protection analysis by the bankruptcy appellate panel in <em>In re American Mariner Industries, Inc., </em>27 B.R. 1004 (Bankr. 9th Cir.1983), and by the bankruptcy court in <em>In re South Village, Inc., </em>25 B.R. 987 (Bankr.D.Utah 1982). <em>See In re Briggs, </em>35 B.R. at 212-14. However, the district court\u2019s review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision followed the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>American Mariner, </em>which reversed the decisions discussed in the bankruptcy court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">Since adequate protection is nowhere explicitly defined in the Bankruptcy Code, inferences drawn from the legislative history become important in sorting out exactly what Congress intended should constitute adequate protection in the context of an automatic stay. Many courts before us have developed cogent arguments and mar-shalled ample supporting evidence in favor of both granting and denying post-petition interest to secured creditors as a component of adequate protection. <em>Compare, e.g., American Mariner, </em>734 F.2d 426 (9th Cir.1984) <em>and In re Monroe Park, </em>17 B.R. 934 (D.Del.1982) (granting creditors post-petition interest for claimed opportunity costs) <em>with In re Saypol, </em>31 B.R. 796 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1983) <em>and In re South Village, Inc., </em>25 B.R. 987 (Bankr.D.Utah 1982); (denying creditors post-petition interest for claimed opportunity costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-10\">Despite the disagreement among courts as to the propriety of post-petition interest in the adequate protection context, it is generally acknowledged that, as demonstrated by the non-exclusive examples of section 361,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> adequate protection is the protection of a secured creditor\u2019s \u201cinterest in property\u201d from any decrease in \u201cvalue\u201d atrributable to the stay. <em>See, e.g., In re South Village, </em>25 B.R. at 989. It also is generally accepted that the concept requires the debtor to propose some form of relief that will preserve a secured creditor\u2019s interest in the collateral. <em>See, e.g., In re Harrington &amp; Richardson, Inc., </em>48 B.R. 431, 433 (Bankr.D.Mass.1985) (quoting <em>In re Monroe Park, </em>17 B.R. at 937; 2 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>11 361.01 at 361-5). The creditors here argue that section 361\u2019s references to an \u201cinterest in property\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d are intended to encompass the whole of their economic bargain with the debtor to insure that they receive the equivalent of what they would have received had there been no bankruptcy action filed. An examination of section 361\u2019s legislative history shows, however, that Congress broadly intended that \u201cthe interests of which the court may provide protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>in the ways described in this section [361] include equitable as well as legal interests.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 338 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5963, 6295. Sections 361(1) and 361(2) specifically provide protection for a decrease in the value of the creditor\u2019s interest in such property through section 361(l)\u2019s periodic payments to compensate for depreciation and section 361(2)\u2019s additional or replacement lien to the extent of the decrease in value or actual consumption of the property involved. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 598 at 54, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5840. Sections 361(1) and 361(2) are drafted to address the collateral\u2019s depreciation or decline in value during the pendency of the stay. These provisions are coupled with the grant of other relief as will result in realizing the indubitable equivalent of the creditor\u2019s interest on which the creditors focus here. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 361(3). This statutory scheme indicates that adequate protection is intended to encompass a broad range of creditor interests and does not mandate an interpretation of the creditors\u2019 interest as the whole of the economic bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-4\">At the heart of this search for a way to adequately protect the creditors\u2019 interest in the collateral is the question of what factors constitute the value of that interest. GMAC and Lend Lease argue here that \u201cvalue\u201d refers to \u201ccash value,\u201d that they are entitled to the \u201cbenefit of their bargain,\u201d and that resort to the collateral is an essential component of that bargain struck between borrowers and lenders. A narrowly calibrated conception of adequate protection, however, subject to brittle construction, cannot accommodate the \u201cinfinite number of variations possible in dealings between debtors and creditors.\u201d <em>In re Al-yucan, </em>12 B.R. at 805 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 595 at 339, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 6295). Although the concept of adequate protection is certainly intended to protect a creditor\u2019s interest in the collateral, it is clearly susceptible to differing applications over a wide range of fact situations. As the Ninth Circuit noted in this regard, the House Report states that adequate protection</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-7\">is not intended to be confined strictly to the constitutional protection required, however. The section, and the concept of adequate protection, is based as much on policy grounds as on constitutional grounds. Secured creditors should not be deprived of the benefit of their bargain. <em>There may be situations in bankruptcy where giving a secured creditor an absolute right to his bargain may be impossible or seriously detrimental to the bankruptcy laws. </em>Thus, this section recognizes the availability of alternate means of protecting a secured creditor\u2019s interests. Though the creditor might not receive his bargain in kind, the purpose of the section is to insure that the secured creditor receives in value essentially what he bargained for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-8\"><em>American Mariner, </em>734 F.2d at 431 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 595 at 339, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 6295) (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit further noted in <em>American Mariner, </em>in interpreting the scope of section 361\u2019s emphasis on the \u201cvalue of the protected entity\u2019s interest in the property involved,\u201d that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-9\">The section [361] does not specify how value is to be determined nor does it specify when it is to be determined. <em>These matters are left to case-by-case interpretation and development. </em>It is expected that the courts will apply the concept in light of facts of each case and general equitable principles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-10\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The legislative history also notes that the use in section 361(1) of periodic cash payments to compensate for expected decreases in the value of the creditors\u2019 interest in property may be especially appropriate for adequate protection purposes where, as here, the property in question is depreciating at a relatively fixed rate. S.Rep. No. 989 at 54, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5840 (construing <em>In re Bermec Corp., </em>445 F.2d 367 (2d Cir.1971)). In <em>Bermec, </em>the court approved construing debtor payments of \u201ceconomic depreciation\u201d on the secured creditor\u2019s equipment so as to approximately pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>serve the status quo. <em>See Bermec, </em>445 F.2d at 369. The <em>Bermec </em>court also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aar-dedup-0\">We are conscious of the deep concern of the manufacturing secured creditors lest their security depreciate beyond adequate salvage, but we must balance that with the Congressional mandate to encourage attempts at corporate reorganization where there is a reasonable possibility of success.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\"><em>Bermec, </em>445 F.2d at 369. We can only infer from this express reference to <em>Ber-mec </em>in the legislative history that Congress was aware both of <em>Bermec\u2019s </em>emphasis on the need to balance the equities in each particular case and of <em>Bermec\u2019s </em>recognition that creditors may at times be unable to obtain compensation for their interests in collateral above the lien or salvage value of that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-5\">GMAC and Lend Lease invoke section 361(3) as entitling them to compensation for opportunity costs as the \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d of their foreclosure interest and cite legislative history stating that \u201c[s]ecured creditors should not be deprived of the benefit of their bargain.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 595 at 339, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 6295. However, \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d simply describes what would constitute adequate protection. It does not define the interest to be protected. As the creditors have noted, the phrase was coined by Judge Learned Hand in <em>In re Murel Holding Corp., </em>75 F.2d 941, 942 (2d Cir.1935). However, <em>Murel </em>dealt with confirmation of a plan opposed by creditors, rather than the temporary interim protection of an automatic stay. In describing the meaning of \u201cadequate protection\u201d for purposes of a plan\u2019s confirmation under the Bankruptcy Act of 1889, Judge Hand stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A10\">It is plain that \u201cadequate protection\u201d must be completely compensatory; and that payment ten years hence is not generally the equivalent of payment now. Interest is indeed the common measure of the difference, but a creditor who fears the safety of his principal will scarcely be content with that; he wishes to get his money or at least the property. We see no reason to suppose that the statute was intended to deprive him of that in the interest of junior holders, unless by a substitute of the most indubitable equivalance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-7\"><em>Murel, </em>75 F.2d at 942. \u201cIndubitable equivalence,\u201d the language on which the creditors here rely for compensation of their claimed lost opportunity costs, was designed to broaden, not circumscribe, the range of solutions available to debtors and creditors in determining what interests in a particular case are to be adequately protected. <em>See In Re Shriver, </em>33 B.R. 176, 184 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-8\">As this court noted in <em>Martin, </em>inclusion of the \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d concept in the context of an interim automatic stay was the result of a legislative compromise. <em>Martin, </em>761 F.2d at 476. This legislative history indicates that Congress did intend that a bankruptcy court, in reviewing a debtor\u2019s proposed means of adequately protecting a secured creditors interest, should as nearly as possible under the circumstances provide the creditor with his bargained-for rights. <em>See American Mariner, </em>734 F.2d at 435. However, in determining the exact scope of those bargained-for rights, the boundaries of the indubitable equivalence standard cannot be so rigidly defined as to mandate interest payments for the delay in foreclosing, liquidating, and reinvesting the collateral in every case. Rather, indubitable equivalence must be construed as an alternative means of calculating value in light of a particular case\u2019s facts. <em>In re Colrud, </em>45 B.R. 169, 175 (Bankr.D.Alaska 1984). The bankruptcy code\u2019s design, the legislative compromises from which the statute was constructed, and the developing case law all indicate that the creditor rights to be afforded adequate protection in a given situation depend on a variety of factors the exact character of which will vary from case to case and may, but will not always, include the payment of interest for opportunity costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-9\">Contrary to GMAC and Lend Lease\u2019s contention, creditors have no right to be placed in the same economic position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>as if there had been no bankruptcy filing. Congress has observed \u201c[t]here may be situations in bankruptcy where giving a secured creditor an absolute right to his bargain may be impossible or seriously detrimental to the policy of the bankruptcy laws.\u201d S.Rep. No. 989 at 53, 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5839. Bankruptcy involves a balancing of interests between the debtor and creditors. The effect of the bankruptcy laws is to alter or eliminate a debtor\u2019s obligations to its creditors upon the advent of the debtor\u2019s inability to meet those obligations. These changes are imposed as a matter of law and leave creditors in a very different economic position than before the debtor filed for bankruptcy. A creditor\u2019s interest in the collateral is tied to possible default by the debtor and, like any contractual agreement, is always subject to existing federal law, including the automatic stay provisions under section 362(a). The essence of a creditor\u2019s interest in the collateral is not necessarily foreclosure and reinvestment, but may be the guarantee that, as a secured creditor, it will be paid in full up to the lien value of the collateral. Unsecured creditors often get back little or nothing of what is owed to them despite their original bargain with the debtor for full repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">Contrary to the bankruptcy judge\u2019s views, our analysis here is not affected by apparent conflicts with language in sections 502 and 506 of the Bankruptcy Code, which disallow secured claims for unma-tured post-petition interest. Oversecured creditors are allowed under section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code to claim interest, but only to the extent that they are overse-cured. This provision constitutes an exception to section 502(b)(2), which specifically disallows claims for unmatured interest. We adopt the view advanced in the bankruptcy court\u2019s <em>American Mariner </em>opinion, although later rejected by the Ninth Circuit, that section 502(b)(2) does not serve by negative implication to bar payment of interest to undersecured creditors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>In re American Mariner Industries, Inc., </em>27 B.R. at 1009. Section 506(b) simply provides an alternative to the adequate protection provisions in sections 361 and 362 and does not serve as a limitation thereon. We also find that section 502(b)(2), which disallows claims for unmatured interest, does not preclude payment of interest as time value compensation to secured creditors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In resolving this apparent conflict in the statutory language, it is imperative to recognize</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-8\">that section 506(b) provides only for the allowance of postpetition interest, fees, costs and charges as part of a secured claim. It does not require the current payment of such amounts. Entitlement to current payment of such amounts must be grounded elsewhere, such as in the provision of adequate protection or in underlying agreements which are not affected by the subject bankruptcy case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1433-9\">3 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>11506.05 at 506-40 (emphasis and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-10\">GMAC argues that bankruptcy courts were not intended to have broad discretion to determine what constitutes adequate protection in a given case, urging that such discretion will lead to \u201canomalous results\u201d and increase the cost of secured credit. However, the legislative history indicates that Congress has repeatedly expressed its desire to give bankruptcy courts broad discretion. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 989 at 54, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5840; H.R. Rep. No. 595 at 338-40, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 6295-97. By incorporating flexibility into the code, Congress plainly intended adequate protection issues to be resolved on a case-by-case basis and expected anomalous results. <em>See Martin, </em>761 F.2d at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>Influenced by the clearly articulated policy in the statutory language, legislative history and relevant case law, we believe bankruptcy courts should retain a high degree of flexibility in arriving at adequate protection findings. This court is convinced that the most reasonable approach accommodating the greatest number of interests is to refrain from shaping a rigid rule that compensation for post-petition interest either must or cannot be required as a component of adequate protection in the context of an automatic stay. We also believe that this approach is entirely consistent with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion in <em>American Mariner </em>that interest payments were proper there to afford the creditor in that case adequate protection of its interest in the collateral. As the Ninth Circuit noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1434-4\">In this case we are engaged in precisely the sort of case-by-case interpretation and development intended by Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1434-5\">We recognize that a congressional directive for \u201ccase-by-case interpretation and development\u201d must not be abused. Such judicial interpretation must not overlook the overriding purpose of the automatic stay, namely to give the debt- or \u201ca breathing spell from his creditors ... [to permit] the debtor to attempt a repayment or reorganization plan, or simply to be relieved of the financial pressures that drove him into bankruptcy.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 595 at 340, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 6296-97. Nor can we ignore the purposes of business reorganization under Chapter 11 to initially relieve the debtor of its prepetition debts, to free cash flow to meet current operating expenses, and ultimately to permit the debtor \u201cto restructure a business\u2019s finances so that it may continue to operate, provide its employees with jobs, pay its creditors, and produce a return for its stockholders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 6179.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1434-8\"><em>American Mariner, </em>734 F.2d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-9\">Courts both before and after the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>American Mariner </em>have adopted explicitly or implicitly a case-by-case approach even while extending the scope of adequate protection to compensate a secured creditor for post-petition interest. They repeatedly recognize that adequate protection is a flexible concept which requires a court to make decisions on a case-by-case basis, after full consideration of the particular characteristics of each proceeding to the extent that \u201ccompensation for unpaid accruing interest charges during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings is not necessary in all cases.\u201d <em>In re Monroe Park, </em>17 B.R. at 940 (quoting <em>In re BBT, </em>11 B.R. 224, 232 (Bankr.D.Nev.1981)); <em>In re Mary Hartley Builder, Inc., </em>44 B.R. at 156; <em>see also First Bank of Miller, </em>45 B.R. at 875 (value of creditor\u2019s bargain should be determined on a case-by-case basis, in light of equitable principles and the facts of the case, citing <em>American Mariner ); In re Sun Valley Ranches, Inc., </em>43 B.R. 641, 644 (Bankr.D.Idaho 1984) <em>(\u201cAmerican Mariner </em>does <em>not </em>require that adequate protection take the form of cash payments; that is simply one option available to the debtor.\u201d (emphasis in text)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-11\">Flexibility was legislated into the Bankruptcy Code by the very fact that the term \u201cadequate protection\u201d resists precise definition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This reflects congressional recognition that myriad factors are taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>into account by the parties in entering into a security agreement and a wide spectrum of circumstances may exist at the time a debtor files a petition. Even in <em>Murel, </em>Judge Hand\u2019s indubitable equivalence language grew out of the court\u2019s cognizance of that case\u2019s particular facts, including its conclusion that the proposed plan had little chance of success and that the ability of the debtor\u2019s income-producing asset, an apartment building, to satisfy accruing claims against the debtor was declining. <em>See Murel, </em>75 F.2d at 942. Although the court\u2019s encouragement of reorganization must not operate to the detriment of a secured creditor\u2019s interests, final reconstruction of the creditor\u2019s bargain to determine just what interests of the creditor should be afforded protection during the pendency of the automatic stay is a balancing act best left to the discretion of the bankruptcy judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">Such a balancing act may, but will not always, be resolved in favor of post-petition interest payments to the creditor. Whether a debtor\u2019s proposal does or does not include interest payments for the present value of the creditor\u2019s foreclosure rights will depend on such factors as the nature of the collateral and the proposed use of the collateral in the interim. <em>See Martin, </em>761 F.2d at 476-77; <em>In re Smithfield Estates, Inc., </em>48 B.R. 910, 915 (Bankr.D.R.I. 1985); <em>see also In re Polzin, </em>49 B.R. 370, 372 (Bankr.D.Minn.1985) (where debtor offered interest payments to an undersecured creditor not entitled to post-petition interest under section 506(b) as part of adequate protection, court notes that proffered interest is acceptable under reasoning in <em>American Mariner </em>to compensate for loss of the collateral\u2019s use during the stay).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-6\">We recognize that a rule which directs courts to approach adequate protection analyses on a case-by-case basis provides minimal guidance for future reconstruction by courts of a secured creditor\u2019s bargain for adequate protection purposes. However, the developing case law applying the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 has already devised a broad variety of equitable considerations which provide a guide for future cases. Obviously, situations involving a greatly oversecured claim will be quite different from cases such as this involving undersecured claims, and a value determination for automatic stay purposes is not necessarily the same as value determined for another purpose, such as confirming a plan. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a); <em>see also LaJolla Mortgage Fund v. Rancho el Cajon Associates, </em>18 B.R. 283, 287-9 (Bankr.S.D.CalN.1982). What constitutes the bargain whose benefit should be protected on the creditor\u2019s behalf turns on factors which reveal the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations. This may include, but is not limited to, the quality of the collateral or the length of the stay. <em>See, e.g., In re Nixon Machinery, </em>9 B.R. 316, 318 (Bankr. E.D.Tenn.1981). It may turn on whether the collateral\u2019s lien value is demonstrated to be appreciating, depreciating or remaining relatively stable. <em>Compare, e.g., Appeal of California Gulf Partnership, </em>48 B.R. 959, 965 (E.D.La.1984) <em>with In re Shriver, </em>33 B.R. 176, 185-6 (Bankr.N.D. Ohio 1983). <em>See also 2 Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 361.01[1].</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">Similarly, a court might look to whether taxes and other payments designed to keep the collateral free of statutory liens are being paid or will be paid by a debtor in determining whether a secured creditor is entitled to compensation for delay in foreclosure caused by the stay. <em>See In re Aegean Fare, Inc., </em>34 B.R. 965, 969-70 (Bankr.D.Mass.1983). And, while protection of lost opportunity costs for going concern values may not be required in cases with a high chance of success, liquidation values, including lost opportunity costs, might be deemed protectable where the chance of reorganization is slight. <em>See In re C.F. Simonin\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>28 B.R. 707, 711-12 (Bankr.E.D.N.C.1983). We emphasize that our list here is not exclusive, but merely indicative^of the particular risk and reliance factors shown in the nature and history of the credit transaction which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>a court may take into account in making adequate protection determinations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">As noted above, adequate protection determinations made by a bankruptcy court are questions of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>See Martin, </em>761 F.2d at 474; <em>see also </em>Bankr.R. 8013. Guidance as to the clearly erroneous standard\u2019s application in the adequate protection context may be found in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision, <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N. C., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). As the Fifth Circuit recently noted in the context of a bankruptcy court appeal, the Supreme Court held in <em>Anderson </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azf\">an appellate court must review a finding of fact under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, even when the lower court\u2019s findings of fact \u201cdo not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\"><em>Richmond Leasing Co. v. Capital Bank, N.A., </em>762 F.2d 1303, 1308 (5th Cir.1985), <em>quoting Anderson, </em>105 S.Ct. at 511-12 (emphasis and footnote deleted). Unless a reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, <em>Anderson, </em>105 S.Ct. at 511, a bankruptcy court\u2019s findings regarding post-petition interest as a component of adequate protection in a particular case must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-11\">We agree with the Ninth Circuit that the policies behind sections 361 and 362 permit maximum flexibility in structuring a debtor\u2019s proposal for adequate protection. <em>See American Mariner, </em>734 F.2d at 435. We do not agree with the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>American Mariner </em>that in every instance in which a secured creditor is prevented from enforcing its foreclosure rights against the collateral during the pendency of the automatic stay the debtor and its unsecured creditors receive a windfall at the secured creditor\u2019s expense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>It is, after all, not the debtor itself but Congress that determined that creditors should be stayed from proceeding against the collateral upon the filing of a petition in bankruptcy. The result of this carefully conceived mechanism is temporary maintenance of the status quo as of the period immediately before filing, not a permanent bar to liquidation and reinvestment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-12\">After careful consideration of the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s language and legislative history and of underlying policy considerations, we cannot hold as a matter of law that a creditor is always entitled to compensation for the delay in enforcing its foreclosure rights during the interim period between filing of a petition and confirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>tion of a plan. Although the concept of adequate protection under sections 361 and 362 requires the court to protect the creditor\u2019s allowed secured claim by compensating for any loss of value of the collateral, what constitutes adequate protection in a particular case is a question whose resolution is best left to the knowledge and expertise of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">The order of the district court is reversed. It appears that the bankruptcy court below declined to include compensation for lost opportunity costs in the scope of the creditor interests to be protected because it considered itself precluded from such a result as a matter of law. We therefore remand to the bankruptcy court for determination of whether, in light of this opinion and under the facts of this case, the debtor\u2019s offer of periodic payments alone adequately protects the interests of the undersecured creditors.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1426-17\">.

As was noted by the court in <em>In re Colrud, </em>45 B.R. 169 (Bankr.D.Alaska 1984), many recent articles have analyzed the code\u2019s approach in the context of adequate protection and automatic stays. <em>See, e.g., </em>Baird &amp; Jackson, <em>Corporate Reorganizations and the Treatment of Diverse Ownership Interests: A Comment on Adequate Protection of Secured Creditors in Bankruptcy, </em>51 U.Chi.L.Rev. 97 (1984); Jackson, <em>Bankruptcy, Non-Bankruptcy Entitlements, and the Creditor\u2019s Bargain, </em>91 Yale L.J. 857 (1982); Nimmer, <em>Secured Creditors and the Automatic Stay: Variable Bargain Models of Fairness, </em>68 Minn.L.Rev. 1 (1983); Note, <em>Compensation for Time Value as Part of Adequate Protection During the Automatic Stay in Bankruptcy, </em>50 U.Chi.L.Rev. 305 (1983). As in <em>Colrud, </em>these articles are cited here to illustrate that though it is agreed that secured creditors should receive adequate protection of their interest in the collateral during an automatic stay, the suggestions as to what protection is adequate are varied. <em>Colrud, </em>45 B.R. at 175 n. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1436-8\">. One proposed model for examining adequate protection issues that focuses on a range of factors in adjusting the conflicting rights of creditors and debtors to the same property is set out in Nimmer, <em>supra </em>note 10. Nimmer also points out that at least one court has identified other code sections as providing \"non-financial antidotes for delay\u201d which may make it unnecessary for debtors to compensate a creditor\u2019s opportunity costs. <em>See </em>Nimmer, <em>supra </em>note 10, at 14 (quoting <em>In re South Village, </em>25 B.R. at 1000-02).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1436-9\">. The dissent reads <em>American Mariner </em>to hold that an undersecured creditor is adequately protected only if interest compensating for the delay in foreclosing and liquidating the collateral is granted in every case. The \"case by case\u201d language in <em>American Mariner </em>is narrowly construed by the dissent to refer only to how and when interest should be paid. We reject this analysis, not on the basis that we read <em>American Mariner </em>differently, which we do, but because, as <em>American Mariner </em>acknowledged, it was the directive of Congress that \"value\u201d under \u00a7 361 must be subject to case by case interpretation and development. <em>See American Mariner, </em>734 F.2d at 431. In <em>American Mariner, </em>the Ninth Circuit recognized that each case must turn on its own facts when it found that \"the case-by-case development, guided by equitable principles as Congress envisioned, must recognize and protect the value of a creditor\u2019s interest when, as here, that value is demonstrated to exist and is measurably threatened.\u201d <em>American Mariner, </em>734 F.2d at 432. The dissent's charge that our opinion provides no guidance to bankruptcy judges misreads our all too lengthy discussion of many of the factors involved in adequate protection determinations. <em>See supra, </em>at pp. 1347-49.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1437-6\">JOHN R.

It attempts to chart a course between those courts which have held as a matter of law that compensation may not be allowed, <em>see, e.g., In Re Aegean Fare, Inc., </em>34 B.R. 965 (Bankr.Mass.1983); <em>In Re South Village, Inc., </em>25 B.R. 987 (Bankr.Utah 1982); <em>In Re Alyucan Interstate Corp., </em>12 B.R. 803 (Bankr.Utah 1981); and those courts which hold that as a matter of law it must be considered, but leave to the bankruptcy court in what manner. <em>See, e.g., In Re American Mariner Industries, </em>734 F.2d 426 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Grundy National Bank v. Tandem Mining Corp., </em>754 F.2d 1436 (4th Cir.1985). I believe that the preferable course is that set down by the Ninth Circuit in <em>American Mariner Industries. </em>This approach gives more certainty to the function of the bankruptcy court, and is more consistent with congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">The Ninth Circuit held in <em>American Mariner </em>that a secured creditor \u201cis entitled to compensation for the delay in enforcing its rights during the interim between the petition and confirmation of the plan.\u201d 734 F.2d at 435. It rejected the creditor\u2019s contention, however, that the compensation must take the form of monthly interest payments at the market rate on the liquidation value of the collateral. The court concluded that while this was one method of providing adequate protection, it was not the only one available to the debtor. <em>Id. </em>While the debtor should have maximum flexibility, the court acknowledged, the \u201cresult should as nearly as possible under the circumstances provide the creditor with the value of his bargained for rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-12\"><em>American Mariner </em>holds that a court should utilize a case by case approach in determining adequate protection and the value of the creditor\u2019s interest in the property involved. Nevertheless, it makes clear that the creditor is entitled as a matter of law to compensation for the delay in enforcing its rights. It is only after making this legal determination that the court considers, on a case by case basis, the method of adequately protecting that to which the creditor is entitled. To the contrary, the court today leaves both the question of entitlement and the determination of the proper method of protection to the bankruptcy court. The weakness of the court\u2019s position is that it sets free the bankruptcy court without any guidance whatsoever on the entitlement issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>Nothing is gained by repeating in detail the analysis in <em>American Mariner. </em>The Ninth Circuit carefully considered the statutes before us and their legislative history. It recognized that the policy behind these statutes is to give the debtor a breathing spell and chance to restructure a business so that it may continue to operate. At the same time, the court emphasized that sections 361 and 362 \u201cinclude exceptional provisions specifically intended by Congress to benefit secured creditors at the expense of the debtor.\u201d 734 F.2d at 431. It concluded that courts \u2014 on the case by case basis Congress envisioned \u2014 \u201cmust recognize and protect the value of a creditor\u2019s interest when, as here, that value is demonstrated to exist and is measurably threatened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432. It further concluded that Congress understood the term \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d to represent a \u201cstrict approach to adequate protection in the context of the cram down provisions\u201d in \u00a7 1129 and this was convincing that \u201cCongress intended to adopt or at least encourage the same approach to adequate protection in sections 361 and 362.\u201d 734 F.2d at 434. It correctly reasoned that those courts holding as a matter of law that adequate protection extended only to the value of the collateral accorded insufficient weight to the language of the statute and the congressional goal of affording the secured creditor the benefit of its bargain. <em>Id. </em>at 434-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">We deal not with insignificant distinctions. The inevitable result of leaving the bankruptcy courts entirely free to determine the issue as they chose is likely to be uniform denial of these rights. The overwhelming response of the bankruptcy courts facing this issue bears strong evidence to this conclusion. The strength of the <em>American Mariner </em>approach is to direct that, as a matter of law, the creditor\u2019s entitlement to interest be considered and that the method of doing so be left to a case by case determination giving consideration to timing and applicable rate of interest. 734 F.2d at 435. I would follow <em>American Mariner </em>and I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">.
