The district court, concluding that Local 560 was a \u201ccaptive labor organization,\u201d enjoined certain defendants from any future contacts with Local 560, and removed the current members of the Local 560 Executive Board, replacing the Executive Board with a temporary trusteeship until free elections could be held. The district court\u2019s opinion appears at 581 F.Supp. 279 (D.N.J. 1984). The district court stayed its injunction pending appeal to this Court. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">On March 9, 1982, the government filed its civil complaint naming as defendants twelve individuals, Local 560, and Local 560\u2019s Welfare Fund and Severance Pay Plan. The government alleged that five of the named defendants: Anthony Provenza-no, Nunzio Provenzano, Steven Andretta, Thomas Andretta and Gabriel Briguglio, were members of an ongoing criminal confederation \u2014 the Provenzano Group<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 which, through acts of extortion and murder, effectively acquired an interest in, and control of, Local 560, an enterprise within the meaning of RICO, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government also charged these defendants, as the Provenzano Group, with unlawfully participating, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of Local 560\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and with conspiring to violate the above two provisions of RICO (\u00a7\u00a7 1962(b) and (c)) in contravention of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Finally, the government charged the remaining seven individual defendants: Salvatore Provenzano, Joseph Sheridan, Josephine Provenzano, J.W. Dildine, Thomas Reynolds, Michael Sciarra, and Stanley Jar-onko, who, at the time the suit was brought, constituted the Executive Board of Local 560, with aiding and abetting the Provenzano Group in violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(b) and (d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">As stated above, the government avers that the Provenzano Group, aided and abetted by past and present members of the Executive Board of Local 560, violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(b) by acquiring an interest in and control of Local 560 through a pattern of racketeering activity. The Provenzano Group\u2019s racketeering activity, the government argues, consisted of various acts of murder and extortion, the extortion element consisting of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">the wrongful use of actual and threatened force, violence and fear of physical and economic injury in order to create within Local 560 a climate of intimidation which induced the members thereof to consent to the surrender of certain valuable property in the form of their union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>rights as guaranteed by the provisions of Sections 157 and 411 of Title 29 of the United States Code [the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 and the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">App. at 174A. Specifically, paragraph 12(a) of the Complaint alleged that The Provenzano Group extorted the membership\u2019s rights to vote, speak, and assemble freely by systematic acts of intimidation, including, as the district court summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZu\">(1) the June 1961 murder of Anthony Castellitto; (2) the August 1961 appointment of Salvatore Provenzano to the position of Trustee formerly occupied by Castellitto; (3) the September 1961 appointment of Salvatore Briguglio \u2014 the alleged murderer of Castellitto \u2014 to the position of Business Agent; (4) the February 1963 appointment of Nunzio Proven-zano to the position of Business Agent following his January 1963 conviction for extortion; (5) the May 1963 murder of Walter Glockner; (6) the 1964 appointment of Robert A. Luizzi to the position of Business Agent in spite of a record of criminal convictions; (7) the May 1967 appointment of Luizzi to the position of Trustee; (8) the February 1969 appointment of Salvatore Briguglio to position of Business Agent following completion of a term of imprisonment for extortion; (9) the April 1969 appointment of Nunzio Provenzano to the position of clerk following completion of a term of imprisonment for extortion; (10) the 1970 appointment of Nunzio Provenzano to the position of Business Agent; (11) the 1971 appointment of Thomas Reynolds, Sr. to the position of Business Agent in spite of a record of criminal activity; (12) the 1972 appointment of Nunzio Provenzano to the position of Fund Trustee; (13) the 1972 appointment of Salvatore Briguglio to the position of Fund Trustee; (14) the allowance of frequent visitations by Armand Faugno and Thomas Andretta to the offices of Local 560; (15) the January 1963 appointment of Nunzio Provenzano to the position of Secretary-Treasurer; (16) the 1973 appointment of Reynolds to the position of Fund Trustee; (17) the 1974 resumption of duties as Business Agent by Salvatore Briguglio following completion of a term of imprisonment for counterfeiting; (18) the 1974 appointment of Luizzi to the position of Fund Trustee; (19) the November 1975 appointments of Anthony and Nunzio Pro-venzano to the positions of Secretary-Treasurer and President, respectively, in spite of a record of convictions for extortion; (20) the February 1977 appointment of Reynolds to the position of Trustee; (21) the July 1978 appointment of Josephine Provenzano to the position of Secretary-Treasurer following Anthony Pro-venzano\u2019s conviction for the Castellitto murder; (22) the July 1981 appointment of Salvatore Provenzano to the position of President following Nunzio Provenza-no\u2019s forced resignation as a condition of bail on a labor racketeering conviction; (23) the Executive Board\u2019s failure to recover monies wrongfully converted by Anthony Provenzano; (24) the retention of Marvin Zalk as Fund Administrator in spite of payments accepted by him from an insurance company representative during the 1950\u2019s; (25) the retention of Ralph Torraco as the Fund\u2019s independent certified public accountant in spite of his federal indictment for systematically ov-erbilling the Fund; (26) the extortion of contributions to the defense funds of the Provenzanos and Michael Sciarra from union members; (27) the 1981 appointment of Luizzi to the position of Business Agent; and (28) associations by some of the defendants with Frank \u201cFunzi\u201d Tieri and Matteo Alfredo Ianniello, reputed to be organized crime members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">App. at 10-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">In addition to committing acts of murder and extortion for the purpose of dominating Local 560, the individual members of the Provenzano Group, according to the government\u2019s complaint, allegedly committed several other illegal acts in its participation in the conduct of the affairs of the Local 560 enterprise in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c). The predicate illegal acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>which comprised the Provenzano Group\u2019s \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d under \u00a7 1962(c) as alleged in the government\u2019s Complaint were summarized by the district court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">(1) the extortion of $17,000 from Walter Dorn and his company (Dorn Transport, Inc. of Rensselaer, New York), in return for \u201clabor peace\u201d; (2) the wrongful conversion by defendant Anthony Provenza-no, aided and abetted by successive defendant members of the Local 560 Executive Board, of approximately $223,785 in Local 560 funds \u201cby means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, and pursuant to a scheme and artifice to defraud ...;\u201d (3) the wrongful receipt by Provenzano Group members of payments, loans and other things of- value from certain employers (Interocean Services, Inc. and DiJub Leasing, Inc.) in exchange for \u201clabor peace\u201d; (4) the unlawful receipt by defendant Anthony Provenzano, aided and abetted by Salvatore Briguglio, of certain fees, kickbacks, gifts or things of value in the form of certain Florida real estate because of, and with intent to be influenced with respect to, his actions and decisions relating to the Benefit Fund; and (5) the wrongful receipt by defendant Nunzio Provenzano, together with Irving Cotier and others, as associates of the Provenzano Group, of \u201clabor peace\u201d payments by certain employers, specifically Pacific Intermountain Express Company, Mason and Dixon Lines, Inc., T.I.M.E. \u2014 DC, Inc. and Helms Express.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">App. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In its demand for relief, the government sought only injunctive and equitable remedies. The government asked that the district court (1) enjoin Anthony Provenzano, Nunzio Provenzano, Stephen Andretta, Thomas Andretta, and Gabriel Briguglio (the members of the Provenzano Group) from having any dealings, directly or indirectly, with any officer or employee of the Local 560 enterprise or any other labor organization or employee benefit plan; (2) enjoin Salvatore Provenzano, Joseph Sheridan, Josephine Provenzano, J.W. Dildine, Thomas Reynolds, Sr., Michael Sciarra, and Stanley Jaronko (the members of the Executive Board) from acting in any official capacity for or on behalf of Local 560 or its funds; (3) appoint one or more trustees to discharge all duties and responsibilities of the Executive Board of Local 560 until such time as free elections can be held; and (4) after the membership participation in a free election, permanently enjoin all individual defendants from having any future dealings of any nature whatsoever, directly or indirectly, with any officer, agent, representative, or employee of Local 560 or any other labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Before trial, the government entered into consent orders with defendants Anthony Provenzano, Nunzio Provenzano, and Thomas Andretta. The consent orders bar these three defendants from, among other things, (1) associating with any enterprise (within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961) which seeks to dominate, control, or otherwise influence the affairs of any labor organization or any employee benefit plan and (2) acting as an officer, organizer, administrator, or representative for any labor organization or any employee benefit plan. In exchange, the government agreed to \u201cnot pursue' any further civil claims against the defendant[s] based upon the transactions which are specifically enumerated in the Verified Complaint____\u201d App. at 164A. Accordingly, pursuant to these consent orders, Anthony Provenzano, Nun-zio Provenzano, and Thomas Andretta were removed as defendants prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">On November 1, 1982, prior to trial, the district court denied Local 560\u2019s 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss paragraph 12(a) of the government\u2019s complaint for failure to state a cause of action. <em>United States v. Local 560, </em>550 F.Supp. 511 (D.N.J.1982). Paragraph 12(a), as previously noted, charged the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board with extorting members\u2019 rights to vote, speak, and assemble. The district court held that the extortion of intangible rights guaranteed to union members by the LMRDA\u2019s Bill of Rights, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>constituted a violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, and thus, would properly serve as a predicate act under RICO. The district court also rejected Local 560\u2019s argument that the LMRDA remedies are the exclusive remedies available in combatting the extortion of member\u2019s rights under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">On January 25, 1983, the bench trial of this cause commenced. The trial lasted until May 17, 1983, comprising 51 days of testimony. On March 16, 1984, the district court entered its final order, granting the government\u2019s requested injunctive relief in all respects. At the same time, the district court withheld the appointment of a trustee because it stayed its order pending appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 62. All of the defendants except alleged Provenzano Group members Stephen Andretta and Gabriel Briguglio filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The district court\u2019s analysis of the defendants\u2019 RICO Act violations in the instant case differed from the analysis on which the government\u2019s Complaint was based. The government\u2019s complaint referred to Local 560 as the \u201centerprise\u201d for both its section 1962(b) and (c) counts.' Thus, the government alleged in its complaint that the individual associates of the Provenzano Group violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) by participating in the conduct of the affairs of the <em>Local 560 enterprise </em>through a pattern of racketeering activity. Although the district court made findings consonant with this theory, it also held that the individual members of the Provenzano Group violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) by unlawfully participating in the conduct of the affairs of the <em>Provenzano Group </em>(not Local 560), which the district court held was the \u201centerprise\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In addition, although the government initially alleged separate and distinct predicate criminal offenses under sections 1962(b) and 1962(c), the district court held that there were several predicate offenses committed by the Provenzano Group members which served as the underlying predicate acts for both the section 1962(b) and section 1962(c) counts. Specifically, the district court, while attributing other predicate acts to either 1962(b) or 1962(c), <em>see, e.g., </em>n. 6, <em>infra, </em>held that the following crimes, among others, constituted predicate acts under <em>both </em>of the above subsections of the RICO Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">(1) <em>Dorn: </em>Between approximately January 1, 1952 and June 1, 1959, Anthony Provenzano (leader of the Provenzano Group), while an official of Local 560, extorted payoffs from Walter Dorn and his company, Dorn Transport, Inc., in exchange for \u201clabor peace.\u201d Anthony Provenzano was subsequently convicted on one count of Hobbs Act extortion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957 for his part in the Dorn labor peace payoffs. App. at 24, 69.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">(2) <em>Castellitto: </em>In 1961, Anthony Pro-venzano recruited Harold Konigsberg and Salvatore Briguglio to kill Anthony Castellitto, who was a popular member of Local 560 and who posed a threat to Anthony Provenzano\u2019s control of the union. On June 6, 1961, Konigsberg, Bri-guglio, Salvatore Sinno, and others, committed the murder. Salvatore Briguglio was killed while under indictment for the Castellitto murder, and on June 21, 1978, Anthony Provenzano was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the murder of Castellitto. App. at 24-25, 30, 70-71.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">(3) <em>Braun: </em>Between November 30, 1961 and December 12,1961, Nunzio Provenzano and Salvatore Briguglio attempted to extort labor peace payments (the Braun Payoff Demand case) from the Braun Company in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 560 and \u00a7 1294 (Conspiracy and attempted grand larceny). Nunzi\u00f3 Provenzano and Salvatore Briguglio were convicted and incarcerated for approximately <em>2\u00bd </em>years in New York. App. at 25-26, 29, 69.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-12\">(4) <em>Seatrain: </em>Between December of 1969 and June of 1977, Anthony Proven-zano, Stephen Andretta, Thomas Andret-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>ta, and Gabriel Briguglio unlawfully received \u201clabor peace\u201d payoffs from Inter-ocean Services, Inc. and Di-Jub Leasing Inc. (Seatrain Labor Peace Payoffs) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(b). Anthony Provenzano and Thomas Andretta each received 20 years imprisonment for their part in the Seatrain payoffs, and Stephen Andretta and Gabriel Briguglio received 10 and 7 years imprisonment, respectively. App. at 22-23, 25, 28, 77.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">(5) <em>Romano: </em>Between 1974 and 1977, Anthony Provenzano, aided and abetted by Salvatore Briguglio and Stephen An-dretta, received kickbacks in connection with loans made by the union\u2019s Passaic and Bergen Funds to Thomas and Frank Romano in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1954. App. at 77-82.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">(6) <em>City-Man: </em>Between January of 1971 and July of 1980, Nunzio Provenza-no, Irving Cotier, and other individuals unlawfully received labor peace payoffs (the City-Man payoffs) from Pacific In-termountain Express Company, Mason and Dixon Lines, Inc. T.I.M.E. \u2014 DC, Inc., and Helms Express in violation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(b). On May 5,1981, Nunzio Provenzano was convicted on RICO charges stemming from these City-Man labor peace payoffs and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. App. at 26, 82-83.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Although the district court concluded that the crimes recounted above constituted predicate acts for purposes of both sections 1962(b) and 1962(c), the district court also held that the Provenzano Group\u2019s extortion of the LMRDA rights of union members \u2014 which was the only predicate act aided and abetted by the Local 560 Executive Board defendants \u2014 was a predicate act only for purposes of section 1962(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The district court held that the extortion of the membership\u2019s democratic rights in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, was accomplished by fostering a general climate of intimidation within Local 560. The district court stated that the failure to develop any political opposition to the leadership of Local 560 during the past 20 years demonstrated this climate of intimidation. The district court identified several discrete actions taken by the Pro-venzano Group and the Executive Board of Local 560 which helped nurture this climate of intimidation, and which resulted in numerous instances of extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">The actions taken by the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board, as found by the district court, included (1) the repeated appointments of convicted criminals and persons reputed to be involved in criminal activity to positions of trust and responsibility within Local 560; (2) the expenditure of Local 560 assets in the form of increased salary and pension benefits to Anthony Provenzano, who has committed three criminal offenses while a member of Local 560\u2019s Executive Board; (3) permitting the presence of convicted criminals and reputed criminals in the offices of Local 560; and (4) the failure of the Executive Board to counter perceptions on the part of Local 560\u2019s membership that it was unwise for the members to voice dissatisfaction with Executive Board policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">We address first the issue which concerns both the Provenzano Group defendants and the Executive Board defendants: namely, whether the district court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>found a violation of section 1962(b) of the RICO Act. The district court held that the Provenzano Group members, aided and abetted by the Executive Board, acquired an interest in and control Of Local 560 through a pattern of racketeering activity. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(b) n. 2 supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Central to the district court\u2019s section 1962(b) analysis is its finding that the Pro-venzano Group and the Executive Board extorted the membership\u2019s LMRDA rights to democratic participation in their union\u2019s affairs. LMRDA rights apply to every member of a labor organization. These rights include the right to nominate Union leaders; to vote in union elections; to meet and assemble freely with other members; and to express any views, arguments, or opinions at union meetings. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(1) &amp; (2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">(a)(1) Equal rights. \u2014 Every member of a labor organization shall have equal rights and privileges within such organization to nominate candidates, to vote in elections or referendums of the labor organization, to attend membership meetings, and to participate in the deliberations and voting upon the business of such meetings, subject to reasonable rules and regulations in such organization\u2019s constitution and bylaws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">(2) Freedom of speech and assembly.\u2014 Every member of any labor organizations shall have the right to meet and assemble freely with other members; and to express any views, arguments, or opinions; and to express at meetings of the labor organization his views, upon candidates in an election of the labor organization or upon any business properly before the meeting, subject to the organization\u2019s established and reasonable rules pertaining to the conduct of meetings: <em>Provided, </em>That nothing herein shall be construed to impair the right of a labor organization to adopt and enforce reasonable rules as to the responsibility of every member toward the organization as an institution and to his refraining from conduct that would interfere with its performance of its legal or contractual obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Indeed, it is upon these predicate acts of extortion that the district court based its finding of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">As a threshold matter, there are certain evidentiary questions which this court must resolve that bear upon the extortion of LMRDA rights. At trial, the government, in attempting to prove that the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board of Local 560 extorted the LMRDA rights of union members, submitted various proofs to establish that many union members were fearful of exercising their statutory right to participate in the affairs of Local 560. As part of these proofs, the government sought to admit into evidence numerous newspaper and magazine articles,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> spanning a twenty-year period, which reported the criminal activities of Provenzano Group members. The government argued that these articles were relevant and admissible, not to demonstrate the truth of the statements in the articles, but to demonstrate the perceived reputation of Provenzano Group members in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">The government further maintained that it was proper for the district court to infer that these articles were read by Local 560\u2019s membership and that the reputation of the Provenzano Group members intimidated the membership into surrendering their LMRDA rights. The district court, adopting the government\u2019s position, admitted the newspaper and magazine articles into evidence,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> holding that \u201cit may be a fair infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ence that the members kept abreast of certain events and that having read these articles they feared violence or economic retaliation if they exercised their LMRDA rights.\u201d App. at 1400.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The defendants argue that the district court improperly admitted these newspaper accounts into evidence for reputational purposes. Specifically, the defendants maintain that the government did not establish a sufficient foundation to allow in this evidence: namely, that the government did not introduce evidence, along with these articles, to indicate that members of Local 560 actually read the articles in question, and as a result of reading the articles, had developed a fear of the leadership of Local 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The district court, in admitting the evidence, relied principally on <em>Webb v. Fuller Brush Co., </em>378 F.2d 500 (3d Cir.1967). In <em>Webb, </em>the plaintiffs brought a products liability tort suit for injuries sustained from using a facial hormone cream sold to the plaintiffs by the defendant. At trial, the plaintiffs sought to introduce articles discussing the dangers of certain hormones. The trial court disallowed the evidence. This Court reversed, holding that, since the defendant had a duty to warn of the dangers of the face cream if it knew <em>or should have known </em>that the product could be injurious, the articles were admissible for the purpose of proving whether the defendant should have alerted the plaintiffs to possible hazards. Although, in <em>Webb, </em>this court did not discuss the foundation necessary for the introduction of the articles, presumably, the plaintiffs there demonstrated that the articles were in a publication that the defendant, at the very least, <em>should </em>have been reading.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In the instant case, unlike in <em>Webb, </em>in order for the articles to be admitted into evidence it must have been demonstrated, not that the members of Local 560 <em>should </em>have read the articles in question, but that members of Local 560 <em>actually </em>read these articles. The government at trial, however, did not develop this necessary foundation. Indeed, only one Local 560 member testified that he had ever read anything in the papers about the Provenzano Group and Local 560. August Muller, a Local 560 member who had been assaulted by Executive Board member Stanley Jaronko, stated that \u201c[i]n the papers it said that there was an argument involved the prior night, and the man [Glockner] was dead the next morning ... I don\u2019t want anything to happen to me \u2014 \u201d App. at 7668. We hold that this isolated reference to a single newspaper article afforded an insufficient foundation for the admission into evidence of several articles covering a period of twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Another evidentiary question involving the extortion of membership rights concerned the testimony of Raymond Wren. Wren, a Special Agent of the Department of Labor, testified at trial as to the reputation for violence and economic retribution of several former and current members of the Executive Board of Local 560. Wren based his testimony on interviews he had with 15 former and current members of Local 560. The defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in admitting Wren\u2019s testimony because Wren did not base his testimony on a random sample of the Local 560 members, but rather interviewed only members whom he knew to be opponents of the Provenzano Group and the current Executive Board of Local 560. The government, on the other hand, argues that the validity of Wren\u2019s \u201csample\u201d goes only to the weight of his testimony, and not to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>We recognize that, in modern, complex litigation, investigative and research surveys may be properly admitted into evidence for a variety of purposes. Indeed, in <em>United States v. 88 Cases, etc., </em>187 F.2d 967 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 U.S. 861, 72 S.Ct. 88, 96 L.Ed. 647 (1951), this Court held that a scientific survey of 3539 individuals was admissible as evidence. We concluded that the survey was not hearsay because it was used, not to prove the truthfulness of the numerous responses, but rather to prove the reaction of the general public. We further held that \u201c[t]he technical adequacy of the surveys was a matter of the weight to be attached to them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Here, however, we have a different situation. Contrasted with the random sampling of individuals in <em>88 cases, </em>in this case, no attempt was made to establish a scientific basis for the selection of individuals interviewed. Indeed, Wren, himself, admitted that his \u201csurvey\u201d did not comport with accepted survey techniques. App. at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In the instant case, Wren\u2019s testimony was introduced to prove the reputation of past and present members of the Executive Board as perceived by the membership of Local 560. However, as we have noted, Wren did not engage in a scientific, random survey of Local 560\u2019s membership. Instead, as Wren conceded at trial, he approached only those past and present members of Local 560 whom he knew to be hostile to the leadership of Local 560.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Such an approach, by its very nature, is suspect because of its biased and selective character. Wren\u2019s one-sided sampling did no more than represent the opinion of a few, known opponents of the Local 560 membership. Although the membership in general may have subscribed to the same opinions as those expressed by Wren\u2019s 15 interviewees, Wren\u2019s survey technique was not designed to, nor did it, record the impressions of the membership at large. <em>See Pittsburgh Press Club v. United States, </em>579 F.2d 751, 758 (3d Cir.1978) (\u201cA proper universe must be examined and a <em>representative </em>sample must be chosen\u201d for a survey to be trustworthy.) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">While, in normal course, a research survey conducted in accordance with accepted standards of sampling may be admitted into evidence to be then tested for its weight, where a survey is offered that has met no such standards and, indeed, where that survey is conceded to have been deliberately partisan in its limited sampling, the prejudicial effect of such a flawed survey substantially outweighs any probative value it may have. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. In such an instance, admissibility must be denied and weight cannot be attributed to testimony of this nature. Because Wren\u2019s testimony was predicated on such a flawed survey, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in admitting Wren\u2019s testimony into evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Thus far, we have held that the district court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence: (1) the newspaper and magazine articles and (2) Wren\u2019s testimony. Both of these evidentiary submissions were offered to prove that the rank and file of Local 560 was fearful of their union leadership. The government\u2019s contention is that, by establishing a climate of fear within Local 560, the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board of Local 560 were able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>extort the membership\u2019s LMRDA rights in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The question remains, however, whether the admission of this evidence by the district court was fatal to the government\u2019s charges, or whether the district court, in erring, committed error which was harmless. As this court held in <em>DeLaval Turbine, Inc. v. West India Industries, Inc., </em>502 F.2d 259, 263-64 (3d Cir.1974), \u201c[i]t is well settled that in a non-jury case, an appellate court will not reverse on the basis of an erroneous admission of evidence unless (1) there is insufficient evidence other than the challenged evidence to support the district court\u2019s conclusion, or (2) the district court is induced by the challenged evidence to make an essential finding that it would not have made otherwise.\u201d Accordingly, in the instant case, we must determine whether there exists sufficient evidence in the record (apart from the newspaper and magazine articles and Wren\u2019s testimony) to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the rights of Local 560\u2019s rank and file were extorted.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">It was on the basis of several sources that the district court concluded that the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board extorted the LMRDA rights of a substantial segment of Local 560\u2019s membership. Of these sources, one of the most prominent was the testimony of Professor Clyde Summers.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Professor Summers, who has specialized in labor law since 1943, testified as an expert witness for the government. According to Professor Summers, a significant proportion of Local 560\u2019s rank and file were induced by fear of the Provenzano Group to surrender their membership rights. Summers\u2019 conclusion that the membership did not feel free to criticize openly the policies and practices of the Local 560 leadership (and, thus, were fearful of exercising their union democratic rights) was based primarily on the observation that, throughout the history of Local 560, incidents which should have raised criticism of Local 560\u2019s leadership among its membership, did not. Among the incidents which Summers\u2019 believed should have spurred membership reaction were: the murder of Walter Glockner the morning after his public display of opposition at a union meeting; the many convictions of union officials on union-related offenses; the failure of the Executive Board to take any action when an official was indicted; the appointment and reappointment of persons who had been convicted of union related offenses; the payment of salary increases to Anthony Provenzano; the appointment of Anthony\u2019s daughter, Josephine Provenzano, to the office of Secretary-Treasurer of the union following Anthony\u2019s incarceration; and the proposal to pay Anthony Provenzano a one-half salary pension despite his conviction for the murder of Anthony Castellitto. As Professor Summers testified, \u201c[I]t is beyond belief that 10,000 members would sit by and watch these things done and never utter a peep\u201d, unless a substantial number of the membership were fearful for their lives or their jobs. App. at 1608.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The district court accepted Summers\u2019 testimony as convincing, and we agree. There seems to be no other plausible explanation for the silence of Local 560\u2019s membership in the face of repeated outrageous events. The district court, placing an emphasis on Summers\u2019 testimony, found that the silence was due to the repressive atmosphere of Local 560, an atmosphere created and maintained by the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board. We cannot characterize such a finding as clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">In addition to the testimony of Professor Summers, the district court, in determining that the membership\u2019s rights had been extorted, also relied on the testimony of August Muller. Muller, an employee of Mais-lin Brothers Trucking Company and a member of Local 560, testified at trial that, at a general membership meeting in 1983, he heard Salvatore Provenzano state that Maislin would soon be out of business because the International Brotherhood of Teamsters would insist that Maislin repay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>certain monies which Teamster employees had loaned the company. After hearing Salvatore Provenzano\u2019s warning, Muller testified that Local 560 Business Agent Stanley Jaronko went to the Maislin terminal to hold a meeting and speak to the drivers. At this meeting, Muller challenged Jaronko about the statements Salvatore Provenzano had made earlier at the general membership\u2019s meeting. The exchange between Muller and Jaronko became increasingly heated, and Jaronko ultimately struck Muller, sending him into a wall. It was after this altercation that Muller recalled the shooting death of Walter Glockner, which occurred the morning after Glockner had voiced opposition to Local 560\u2019s leadership at a general meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">At trial, Muller was called to testify about the incident. The district court observed that: \u201cThroughout his direct and cross-examination, Muller\u2019s demeanor evinced the precise attributes of a man in the <em>grip of extreme fear or even sheer terror </em>because of what he was being compelled to say publicly.\u201d App. at 89 (emphasis added). Professor Summers\u2019 testimony indicated that Muller\u2019s feelings and fears were shared by a large percentage of Muller\u2019s compatriots. App. at 1608. As the district court noted, Muller\u2019s testimony dramatically illustrated the climate of fear within Local 560 and served to support and reinforce Professor Summers\u2019 conclusion that the membership\u2019s LMRDA rights to democratic participation in Local 560 were extorted through intimidation and fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Accordingly, we believe that the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board had extorted the LMRDA rights of a substantial number of Local 560 members. This finding, predicated on Professor Summers\u2019 and Muller\u2019s testimony, does not depend on the evidence erroneously admitted, namely the newspaper articles and Wren\u2019s survey. Hence, under the <em>DeLa-val, supra, </em>standard, even though the district court may have erred in admitting these two categories of evidence, that error was harmless and the district court\u2019s finding, based on evidence independent of the challenged evidence, must be sustained. <em>See also Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">The district court not only found by a preponderance of the evidence<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Provenzano Group and the Executive Board extorted the membership\u2019s LMRDA rights, but also concluded that such extor-tions constituted predicate acts for purposes of section 1962(b) of the RICO Act, 18 U.S.C. 1962(b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Local 560, </em>550 F.Supp. 511 (D.N.J.1982). Section 1962(b) makes it unlawful for any person to maintain an interest in, or control of, any enterprise through a pattern of \u201cracketeering activity.\u201d Section 1961(1) of the RICO Act, in relevant part, defines \u201cracketeering activity\u201d as \u201cany act which is indictable under ... section 1951 [of title 18: the Hobbs Act] (relating to interference with commerce, robbery, or extortion)____\u201d Thus, in the instant case, the question is whether the extortion of the membership\u2019s LMRDA rights constitutes a Hobbs Act violation so as to satisfy the predicate act requirement of section 1962(b) of the RICO Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">The Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> prohibits the obstruction or interference with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>commerce by use of threats or extortion. This court has held that the primary elements of a Hobbs Act violation are that (1) that the defendants induce their victims to part with property; (2) that the defendants do so through the use of fear; and (3) that, in so doing, the defendants adversely affect interstate commerce.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>451 F.2d 49, 59 (3d Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 936, 92 S.Ct. 949, 30 L.Ed.2d 812 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The defendants initially argue that the membership\u2019s LMRDA rights are intangible property rights, and as such, cannot be the basis for a claim of extortion under the Hobbs Act. Defendants maintain that only the extortion of tangible property (i.e. physical items or possessions) can be cognizable as a Hobbs Act violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">However, the language of the Hobbs Act makes no such distinction between tangible and intangible property. Section 1951(b)(2) broadly defines \u201cextortion\u201d as \u201cthe obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force____\u201d Moreover, other circuits which have considered this question are unanimous in extending the Hobbs Act to protect intangible, as well as tangible, property. <em>See United States v. Zemek, </em>634 F.2d 1159 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 916, 101 S.Ct. 1359, 67 L.Ed.2d 341 (1981) (right to solicit business accounts); <em>United States v. Santoni, </em>585 F.2d 667 (4th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 910, 99 S.Ct. 1221, 59 L.Ed.2d 459 (1979) (right to make business decisions free from outside pressure wrongfully imposed); <em>United States v. Nadaline, </em>471 F.2d 340 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 951, 93 S.Ct. 1924, 36 L.Ed.2d 414 (1973) (right to solicit business accounts); <em>United States v. Tropiano, </em>418 F.2d 1069 (2d Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1021, 90 S.Ct. 1262, 25 L.Ed.2d 530 (1970) (right to solicit business accounts).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">Moreover, at least one court has expressly addressed the question of whether rights incident to union membership are protectible property interests. In <em>Dusing v. Nuzzo, </em>177 Misc. 35, 29 N.Y.S.2d 882 (Sup.Ct. Ulster County), <em>modified on other grounds and aff\u2019d, </em>263 A.D. 59, 31 N.Y.S.2d 849 (1941), the court held that such rights are \u201cas real and as needful of equitable protection, surely, as money or chattels.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-14\">The right to membership in a union is empty if the corresponding right to an election guaranteed with equal solemnity in the fundamental law of the union is denied. If a member has a \u201cproperty right\u201d in his position on the roster, I think he has an equally enforceable property right in the election of men who will represent him in dealing with his economic security and collective bargaining where that right exists by virtue of express contract in the language of a union constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">29 N.Y.S.2d at 884. This holding is significant because the Hobbs Act\u2019s definition of extortion was closely modelled on that in the New York statute and Congress intended that extortion as used in the Hobbs Act reflect the common understanding of the states. <em>See United States v. Enmons, </em>410 U.S. 396, 406 n. 16, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 1013 n. 16, 35 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973). Thus, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>elude that the membership\u2019s intangible property right to democratic participation in the affairs of their union is properly considered extortable \u201cproperty\u201d for purposes of the Hobbs Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The defendants argue, alternatively, that section 530<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 530, is the exclusive criminal sanction for violating a union member\u2019s rights, and that, therefore, the district court erred in concluding that the extortion of membership LMRDA rights could also constitute a Hobbs Act violation. The defendants maintain that the government may not apply the Hobbs Act in the present RICO context because Section 530 of the LMRDA, which was enacted subsequent to the Hobbs Act and which punishes the same proscribed behavior as the Hobbs Act, preempts the Hobbs Act in this case. <em>See generally Morton v. Mancari, </em>417 U.S. 535, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974) (in certain instances a specific statute governs over a more general one).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The government counters that section 530 does not limit the applicability of the Hobbs Act to the facts of the present case because section 530 and the Hobbs Act were designed to prohibit different types of conduct. We are satisfied that, because the underlying purpose and design of section 530 is different from that of the Hobbs Act, section 530 does not supercede the use of the Hobbs Act in the instant case. While the Hobbs Act, as evidenced by its explicit and unambiguous language, was designed to combat extortion, section 530 of the LMRDA makes no mention of \u201cextortion\u201d and rather appears to focus on prohibiting physical assaults on members in connection with a union\u2019s internal affairs and in the exercise of their statutory rights. In this regard, we note that Senator Morse, in opposing the passage of section 530, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">Generally speaking, the effect of these provisions is to make assault and battery a Federal crime, but only when it occurs in a union. I have already referred above to the inappropriateness of provisions of this type for the enforcement of the rights of union members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">105 Cong.Rec. 16,389 (1959). The limited reach of section 530 is also demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>by the language of the LMRDA which states that the Act was enacted as <em>\u201cfurther and supplementary </em>legislation that will afford necessary protection of the rights and interests of employees and the public generally.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Section 530, in relevant part, prohibits \u201cthe use of force or violence, or threat of the use of force or violence, to restrain, coerce, or intimidate ... any member of a labor organization for the purpose of interfering with or preventing the exercise of any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of this chapter____\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 530. Although this language of section 530 is broad, and conceivably could cover extortionate conduct, we observe that those cases which have construed section 530 have all involved some form of assault and battery. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>624 F.2d 75 (9th Cir.1980) (defendant hired individual to assault union member); <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>545 F.2d 619 (8th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 933, 97 S.Ct. 1555, 51 L.Ed.2d 777 (1977) (defendant fired three shots at truck carrying three union members); <em>United States v. Bertucci, </em>333 F.2d 292 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 839, 85 S.Ct. 75, 13 L.Ed.2d 45 (1964) (fight involving union members); <em>United States v. Roganovich, </em>318 F.2d 167 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 911, 84 S.Ct. 206, 11 L.Ed.2d 150 (1963) (fight involving union members).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In contrast, cases brought under the Hobbs Act frequently involve schemes to extort through the creation of indirect fear. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hedman, </em>630 F.2d 1184, 1194 (7th Cir.1980) (extortion found although victim \u201chappy\u201d to make payments and relations between victim and extorters was \u201ccordial\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 965, 101 S.Ct. 1481, 67 L.Ed.2d 614 (1981); <em>United States v. Sander, </em>615 F.2d 215 (5th Cir.) (Hobbs Act covers fear of economic loss and \u201csubtle extortions\u201d; government need not show that fear was direct consequence of threat or that victim personally feared extorter), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 835, 101 S.Ct. 108, 66 L.Ed.2d 41 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Here, of course, the extortion of rights which the government\u2019s complaint charged was achieved, not so much by direct physical assault (as is proscribed by section 530), but by more sophisticated and indirect physical and economic threats. It was intimidation and fear, as found by the district court, that caused the members of Local 560 to surrender their LMRDA democratic rights. The Hobbs Act, much more so than section 530, is designed to combat extortion, whether such extortion involves LMRDA rights or more tangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">In the preceding sections of Part III of this opinion, where we discussed the Hobbs Act as a predicate act under \u00a7 1962(b), we held that the district court did not err when it concluded that both the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board had extorted the rights of Local 560\u2019s members and that the acts of extortion came within section 1962(b) of RICO. In so concluding, the district court held that the Executive Board had aided and abetted the extortionate acts. Specifically, the district court held that the Executive Board defendants aided in extorting member\u2019s rights by (1) making certain appointments and reappointments to union offices; (2) failing to remove certain appointees from office; (3) spending union assets for Anthony Provenzano; (4) permitting access to local 560\u2019s offices by known or reputed criminals; and (5) being recklessly indifferent to the above-mentioned systematic misconduct of fellow incumbent officers. App. at 96-97, 148-150. These actions by the Executive Board defendants \u2014 particularly the appointment of known criminals to union office and the expenditure of union assets for Anthony Provenzano \u2014 aided and abetted the Proven-zano Group in establishing the climate of fear and intimidation found to exist within Local 560 by the district court. These actions, in turn, coerced a substantial portion of the membership into relinquishing their LMRDA rights. The district court concluded that, because of the offenses committed by the Executive Board, the members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that board had to be removed from office to \u201cprevent and restrain\u201d future violations of section 1962 of the RICO Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The defendants argue that the district court misapplied the law of aiding and abetting to the actions of the Executive Board. The defendants maintain that, while the Executive Board may have violated certain fiduciary standards, the Board\u2019s actions did not constitute criminal aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">However, the district court did, in fact, rely on the appropriate test for establishing liability under the aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. In <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>658 F.2d 181, 189 n. 17 (3d Cir.1981), this Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">In order to convict a defendant of aiding and abetting the commission of a crime, the Government must prove two essential elements: (1) that the substantive crime has been committed; and (2) that the defendant charged with aiding and abetting that crime knew of the commission of the substantive offense and acted with the intent to facilitate it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkoM\">We conclude, as did the district court, app. at 140, that, although the present case is civil in character, the criminal standard for aiding and abetting applies. Applying the <em>Dixon </em>two-part test, the district court examined the surrounding circumstances and found not only that the substantive crimes had been committed, but that the Executive Board defendants knew of their commission and demonstrated the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The defendants, citing the district court\u2019s discussion of the elevated duty of care owed to union members by their officers, argue that the district court found liability based on the Executive Board\u2019s violation of fiduciary responsibility rather than on the Executive Board\u2019s criminal intent. We do not, however, agree with the defendants\u2019 reading of the district court\u2019s opinion. The district court addressed the ethical duty that union officers owe membership for the purpose of examining the extortion of LMRDA rights in the correct light. As the district court noted, \u201cthe knowledge and volitional act requirements of Dixon\u2019s second element have different meanings in various contexts.\u201d App. at 140. Thus, the district court simply recognized that, if an individual fails to act when he has an affirmative duty to do so, negative inferences concerning his intent can be drawn from this inaction. Moreover, it has long been settled that it is permissible to infer from circumstantial evidence the existence of intent. <em>United States v. Bur-rell, </em>496 F.2d 609, 610 (3d Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The defendants further argue that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that the Executive Board\u2019s (1) repeated appointments; (2) failure to remove appointees from office; (3) expenditure of union assets for Anthony Provenzano; and (4) allowance of access to Local 560 offices by known or reputed criminals, aided the Pro-venzano Group in extorting the membership\u2019s rights. We disagree. Our reading of the record discloses ample evidence supporting the district court\u2019s subsidiary findings as well as its ultimate finding of aiding and abetting. Indeed, in our view, the evidence of Local 560\u2019s history of appointments of individuals with criminal convictions to positions of responsibility within the union, not to mention the expenditure of union funds for the personal benefit of Anthony Provenzano, more than adequately support the district court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">With regard to the repeated appointments to union office by the Executive Board of known or reputed criminals, the following chronology by the district court is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">(a) During September of 1961, Anthony Provenzano and other members of the Local 560 Executive Board (which then included Salvatore Provenzano) appointed Salvatore Briguglio to the position of Business Agent \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that Anthony Provenzano then knew that Salvatore Briguglio had murdered Anthony Castellitto, and notwithstanding the fact that rumors to that effect were circulating among the membership at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>(b) On or about February 1, 1963, Anthony Provenzano and the other Executive Board members (including Salvatore Pro-venzano) appointed Nunzio Provenzano to the position of Business Agent \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that three days earlier, on January 29, 1963, Nunzio Pro-venzano had been convicted (together with Salvatore Briguglio) of an offense involving a payoff demand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">(c) In 1964, Anthony Provenzano and the other Executive Board members (including Salvatore Provenzano) appointed Robert A.

The fact, however, that these appointments were in technical compliance with the federal law concerning union officer eligibility<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>, does not mean that the appointments did not serve to intimidate the rank and file, and thus extort LMRDA rights in violation of the Hobbs Act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Indeed, the district court found that the history of Provenzano Group appointments to union office did cause a substantial portion of Local 560\u2019s membership to surrender their right to democratic participation in the affairs of the union. Since the district court\u2019s findings \u2014 both subsidiary and ultimate \u2014 are well supported by the record, we decline to disturb them.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-16\">The district court also held that the Executive Board\u2019s expenditure of Local 560 assets (in the form of accrued salary and pension payments) for the benefit of An<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>thony Provenzano, who had three times committed offenses while in office, helped (aided and abetted) in extorting the membership\u2019s LMRDA rights. With regard to the payment of accrued salary, the record indicates that on December 20, 1962, approximately one month after Anthony Pro-venzano had been indicted in the Eastern Fr\u00e9ightways case, defendant Michael Sciar-ra made a successful motion at a membership meeting to increase Anthony Proven-zano\u2019s yearly salary from $20,800 to $45,-800. One week earlier Provenzano had won re-election as Local 560 President and had previously been appointed an International vice-president under Jimmy Hoffa, who was then President of the Teamsters International union. Seiarra stated that he made the motion because Provenzano needed the money for his legal expenses. Within two months, on February 14, 1963, Stephen Andretta made a second motion to increase Provenzano\u2019s salary. This time, Provenzano\u2019s annual salary was increased from $45,800 to $95,000. Andretta stated that he made the motion because he felt that Provenzano should be paid as much as Hoffa, who was then making $100,000 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On March 13, 1963, Anthony Provenzano told the membership that he was \u201cnot taking a penny of the increases offered me by the membership\u201d and would not do anything to \u201cimpoverish\u201d the union. In mid-1966, Anthony Provenzano was incarcerated and on July 21, 1966, the membership, upon the motion of Michael Seiarra, voted to reduce the salary for the office of the President from $95,000 to $20,800 \u2014 effective upon the appointment of Salvatore Pro-venzano as President on May 6, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On January 30, 1969, Anthony Provenza-no, who was still in prison, told his attorney to mail a letter to Local 560 requesting that it issue a check to him in the amount of $25,000 \u201con account of back salary due and owing to him.\u201d In response, the Executive Board, after consultation with attorneys and accountants, paid to Provenzano approximately $25,000 a year from 1969 through 1976, a total of about $197,850. These payments represented all but approximately $48,785 of the money which Anthony Provenzano would have received as a result of these salary increases. The payments were stopped by the Local in 1976 because the officers believed that the union could not afford to continue the outlays. The only year that Anthony Proven-zano was in office during the time he received payments was 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">With respect to these salary payments, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">Local 560 received no benefit in exchange for the payment of these funds to Anthony Provenzano. Contrary to his representation to the membership on March 13, 1963, the payments ... did in fact \u2018impoverish\u2019 the Local. His ability to extract these payments from Local 560 provides further evidence of the strength and domination of the Proven-zano Group and its exploitation of Local 560 for its own purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">App. at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Anthony Provenzano, however, not only received accrued salary from Local 560, but also received a pension bonus. On November 9, 1976, when Anthony Provenzano had returned to the union as Secretary-Treasurer following his prison sentence in the Dorn case (and his five year ineligibility period arising out of his conviction), it came to the Local\u2019s attention that, because of a break in his union service, Anthony Proven-zano would not receive a pension from the Teamsters. The Local then voted to pay Anthony one-half his weekly salary at the time of retirement as a pension benefit. Payment of his one-half salary began in 1979 and continued through 1981, when it was voluntarily terminated pending the outcome of this litigation. Regarding these pension benefits, the district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">In his testimony, Salvatore Provenzano stated that he had \u201cno idea\u201d how Local 560 would benefit from the payment of this one-half pension. Trustee Michael Seiarra also knows of no benefit to Local 560 which flows from these payments other than to keep \u201cthe members hap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>py \u2014 they voted for it.\u201d The ability of the Provenzano Group to exact these payments is clearly demonstrative of its strength, influence and continuing ability to control and exploit Local 560 for its own purposes \u2014 at the expense of the membership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">App. at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The district court found that neither the salary increases nor the pension payments were in the best interests of Local 560 or its membership, but rather that these payments were solely for the personal benefit of Anthony Provenzano. The district court also found that the Executive Board, by failing to take the position that the payments were not in the union\u2019s interest <footnotemark>22</footnotemark>, intentionally aided and abetted in the Provenzano Group\u2019s further extortion of membership rights.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We hold that the district court\u2019s findings concerning payments made to Anthony Provenzano were not clearly erroneous and the district court did not err when it concluded that these payments represented an additional Hobbs Act extortion by the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Finally, the defendants argue that certain members of Local 560\u2019s Executive Board, namely Joseph Sheridan and Josephine Provenzano (who were appointed in 1978) and Michael Sciarra and Stanley Jar-onko (who were appointed in 1981), were not members of the Executive Board when many of the Hobbs Act extortions occurred. As a result, the defendants maintain that these Executive Board members did not aid and abet<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the necessary two predicate offenses under the RICO Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">However, the record does not support this contention. Rather, the evidence discloses that Michael Sciara and Stanley Jar-onko, the most recent members of the Executive Board, aided and abetted in at least two predicate Hobbs Act extortions. For example, Anthony Provenzano\u2019s pension payments, which represented a Hobbs Act extortion, extended through 1981. Each Executive Board member, by not objecting to these payments which did not benefit the union, necessarily aided and abetted in the extortion. During that time period, both Sciara and Jaronko were on the Executive Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">In addition, in 1981, the Executive Board appointed Robert Luizzi to the position of Business Agent \u2014 notwithstanding Luizzi's criminal record. The district court held that Luizzi\u2019s appointment, and similar ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>pointments, also constituted part and parcel of the extortion of membership rights under the Hobbs Act. Further, in 1981, the Executive Board refused to remove Nunzio Provenzano from office, despite the fact that he had been convicted in the City-Man case. As noted, during this period, the four members of the Executive Board who the defendants claim did not aid and abet the extortionate activities found by the district court, were active members of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Thus, each individual Executive Board member has aided and abetted in at least two predicate acts, and accordingly, each such member is, in his or her own right, culpable for the extortion of the membership\u2019s rights. <em>See United States v. Stubin, </em>446 F.2d 457, 463 (3rd Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Having thus far determined that the district court did not err in concluding that the membership\u2019s rights to democratic participation in Local 560 were extorted by the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board in violation of \u00a7 1962(b) of the RICO Act, the question remains whether the Pro-venzano Group was properly characterized by the district court as a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of 1962(b) and an \u201centerprise\u201d for purposes of section 1962(c) of the RICO Act. As stated earlier, section 1962(b) of the RICO Act prohibits any \u201cperson\u201d from acquiring an interest in and control of any \u201centerprise\u201d through a pattern of racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(b).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Section 1962(c) makes it unlawful for any \u201cperson\u201d to conduct or participate in the affairs of an \u201centerprise\u201d through a pattern of racketeering activity. Referring to Section 1962(b), the district court determined that the Provenzano Group was a \u201cperson\u201d, and that Local 560 was the \u201centerprise\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in which the Provenzano Group acquired an interest. The district court, then referring to section 1962(c), held that the named Provenzano Group defendants\u2014 as individuals \u2014 were \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of that section, and that the Proven-zano Group, as a separate entity, represented an \u201centerprise\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">The defendants, relying primarily on <em>Haroco, Inc. v. American National Bank and Trust Co., </em>747 F.2d 384 (7th Cir.1984), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3291, 87 L.Ed.2d 437 (1985) (per curiam opinion),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> argue that the Provenzano Group cannot be properly characterized as a \u201cperson\u201d under section 1962(b) of the RICO Act. Section 1961(3) of the RICO Act defines \u201cperson\u201d as \u201cany individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(3). The defendants cite to dicta in the Seventh Circuit\u2019s <em>Haroco </em>opinion, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ana-dedup-0\">Where persons associate \u201cin fact\u201d for criminal purposes, <em>see [United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 583 [101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528, 69 L.Ed.2d 246] (1981)], each person may be held liable under RICO for his, her or its participation in conducting the affairs of the association in fact through a pattern of racketeering activity. But the nebulous association in fact does not itself fall within the RICO definition of \u201cperson\u201d____ In the association in fact situation, each participant in the enterprise may be a \u201cperson\u201d liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>under RICO, but the association itself cannot be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In the instant case, however, the district court did not treat the Provenzano Group as a \u201cnebulous association in fact\u201d. Rather, the district court, as the government suggests, regarded the Provenzano Group as representing a conspiracy of seven identifiable, culpable individuals. As we read and understand the district court\u2019s discussion, the term \u201cProvenzano Group\u201d was utilized by the district court as simply a convenient appellation for the collective defendants and was not meant to represent, in itself, a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of 1962(b). Indeed, the individual conspirators in question were included as named defendants in the government\u2019s complaint and were identified by name in the district court opinion. Moreover, the district court held that <em>\u201cthe culpability of the individual associates of the Provenzano Group under \u00a7 1962(b) </em>... has been established by their own conduct.\u201d App. at 147 (emphasis added). Thus, while the district court might have been more explicit in its holding, it is the individual Provenzano Group defendants who are the \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of 1962(b) and not the Proven-zano Group as a separate entity.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The district court also held, and the defendants hotly contested, that the Proven-zano Group is an \u201centerprise\u201d for purposes of section 1962(c) of the RICO Act. Section 1961(4) of the RICO Act broadly defines an \u201centerprise\u201d as including \u201cany individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In <em>United States v. Riccobene, </em>709 F.2d 214, 221 (3rd Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 849, 104 S.Ct. 157, 78 L.Ed.2d 145 (1984) this Court limited the definition of \u201centerprise\u201d, holding that, to establish an enterprise as defined by section 1961(4), the government must demonstrate \u201cevidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit. In addition, the enterprise must be shown to have an existence \u2018separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted) <em>See also United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">In the instant case, the district court applied the <em>Riccobene </em>standard and found that the individuals forming the Provenza-no Group as well as the Provenzano Group itself have \u201cmaintained an ongoing organizational structure in the form of a hiera-rachy and protocol during approximately the past thirty-five years.\u201d App. at 62. The court then held the Provenzano Group to be an \u201centerprise\u201d for purposes of its analysis under section 1962(c), and concluded that the individual Provenzano Group associates had conducted the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">The defendants take issue with this holding on two separate grounds: 1) that the district court changed the theory of the government, which originally regarded Local 560 as the section 1962(c) enterprise, and 2) that the court was clearly erroneous in finding that the Provenzano Group had continued vitality. We find no merit in either contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">First, although the district court\u2019s analysis may have taken a somewhat different tack than that originally presented in the government\u2019s complaint, the district court correctly found that the defendants were on notice of this alternative theory and that it was fully litigated with the implied consent of the defendants. App. at 61 n. 15. Moreover, the complaint itself specifically charges that the Provenzano Group defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ants \u201cassociated together in fact as an enterprise (the Provenzano Group) within the meaning of Section 1961 of Title 18 of the United States Code.\u201d App. at 188. The question of whether the Provenzano Group was an \u201centerprise\u201d was therefore properly before the district court, and it was not prejudicial to the defendants for the court to base its holding in part on this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The defendants further argue, however, that even if this theory was properly before the district court, the court\u2019s finding was irrelevant to the relief sought and granted with respect to Local 560; the only relevant question, argue defendants, was whether the individual Provenzano defendants conducted the affairs of <em>Local 560 </em>through a pattern of racketeering activity such as to justify the relief granted. Irrespective of the labels applied, however, the district court\u2019s findings amply supported a holding under section 1962(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Therefore, to the extent it may be deemed necessary to our holding, we reject the assertion that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that the Pro-venzano Group is an ongoing enterprise within the meaning of section 1961(4). As noted below, ample evidence supported this factual conclusion. However, we find it unnecessary to rely on this finding, because the district court\u2019s findings of individual liability and vicarious liability for acts of co-conspirators fully support its ultimate holding that the individual Proven-zano Group associates (\u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of RICO) violated both section 1962(b) and (c). Moreover, while it was not necessary for the district court to regard the Provenzano Group to be a formal \u201centerprise\u201d under section 1961(4), the district court in so holding did not err, particularly since it concluded that the individual defendants are part of a continuing criminal association justifying the relief granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The district court, in reaching its conclusion, relied heavily on\u2019 the testimony, of Salvatore Sinno.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Sinno, an early associate of Anthony Provenzano and a member of the Provenzano Group, is one of only two Provenzano Group members to turn state\u2019s evidence. Sinno, who assisted in the murder of Anthony Castellitto, was one of the chief witnesses against Anthony Provenzano and others at the Castellitto murder trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Sinno testified at the instant trial about the formation of the Provenzano Group in the late 40\u2019s and that Group\u2019s niche within the Genovese crime family of New York\u2014 headed for a time by \u201cLucky\u201d Luciano. According to Sinno, Anthony Provenzano was a \u201cmade member\u201d (\u201cbutton man\u201d or \u201csoldier\u201d) of the Genovese organization in addition to being the leader of the Proven-zano Group. Members of the Provenzano Group in the early 1960s included Nunzio Provenzano, Sinno, and Salvatore Brigug-lio. Sinno stated that the Genovese family permitted the Provenzano Group during this time to participate in certain criminal activities (such as illegal gambling and labor racketeering) but prohibited the Group from engaging in other crimes (such as narcotics, prostitution, and counterfeiting).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Sinno\u2019s testimony indicates that, from the early 1940\u2019s to 1961 (when Sinno disassociated himself from the Provenzano Group), the Provenzano Group was a continuing criminal organization which was affiliated with an even larger criminal confederation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The district court also regarded the many criminal convictions of Provenzano group members over the past thirty years \u2014(convictions, which also represented RICO predicate acts for purposes of sections 1962(b) and (c)) \u2014 as a strong indication that the Provenzano Group is still an ongoing criminal organization. These offenses, which include the Dorn labor peace payoffs, the Castellitto murder, the Sea-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>train labor peace payoffs, the Roman loan kickbacks, and the City-Man labor peace payoffs, <em>see supra </em>at 273-74,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> all implicate the same core of individuals, and illustrate the insular nature of the Proven-zano Group. The defendants maintain that these crimes do not represent evidence of an \u201centerprise\u201d but rather should be regarded as \u201cdisparate events, spread over two decades, and involving numerous people.\u201d However, considering these crimes in conjunction with Sinno\u2019s testimony, as we observed earlier, we cannot say that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that the Provenzano Group was an \u201centerprise\u201d under section 1962(c), even though such a finding was unnecessary in light of the district court\u2019s contemporaneous finding that the Provenzano Group defendants were individually culpable under that section. We observe that the district court also took note of the fact that, over the 30 year history of the Provenzano Group, only two associates (Sinno and Pi-cardo) have defected. To the district court, this indicated an impressive degree of \u201cinternal discipline, loyalty, and perserverance.\u201d App. at 105.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Against this backdrop of continued criminal activity, it is difficult to accept the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>defendants\u2019 argument that the Provenzano Group is now defunct. The defendants point out that of the original Provenzano Group:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">(1) Anthony Provenzano is now incarcerated for life. They also emphasized that Anthony Provenzano had also entered into a consent judgment in this case which effectively barred him from labor related activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">(2) Salvatore Briguglio is dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">(3) Nunzio Provenzano is currently serving a 10 year prison term, to be followed by a period of statutory disability. Nun-zio Provenzano is a signatory to the same consent judgment which his brother, Anthony Provenzano, entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">(4) Thomas Andretta is currently serving a 20 year prison term, and is a party to the consent judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">(5) Stephen Andretta, recently paroled from a prison term, cannot immediately hold union office as he is subject to the statutory disability period of the LMRDA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">(6) Gabriel Briguglio, currently on parole, is also subject to the statutory disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Nevertheless, the record clearly demonstrates that even incarceration, much less ineligibility to hold union office, does not prevent members of the Provenzano Group from committing acts of extortion. For example, during periods in which Anthony Provenzano was either incarcerated or subject to statutory disability, he sought and received his increased salary and pension payments, received the Romano Loan kickbacks,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and received his Seatrain labor peace payoffs. Indeed, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>held that even during his terms of incarceration, Anthony Provenzano was able to influence Union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Having held that the Provenzano Group was an \u201centerprise\u201d for purposes of section 1962(c), the district court went on to hold that the Provenzano Group individual defendants violated that section by conducting or participating in the affairs of the Provenzano Group enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. App. at 146. Apart from their argument that the Provenzano Group is not an ongoing enterprise, <em>see supra </em>Part IV.B., the defendants do not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that the individual Provenzano Group defendants conducted the affairs of the Provenzano Group through a pattern of racketeering activity. As we have taken pains to point out, while this finding is supported by the record, and is not clearly erroneous, it nevertheless does not advance the RICO claim charged by the government. However, the district court did make individualized findings of guilt on the part of each Provenzano Group defendant. These findings fully support liability under the government\u2019s original theory \u2014 to wit, that the relevant \u201centerprise\u201d was Local 560. However it structured its analysis, there is no question that the district court found, in substance, that the individual Provenzano Group defendants violated section 1962(c) by conducting the affairs of Local 560 through a pattern of racketeering \u2014 particularly in view of its related holding pursuant to section 1962(b). Further, it is not disputed that Local 560 is an enterprise under section 1961(4). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the Proven-zano Group defendants violated section 1962(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">The district court not only held that the Provenzano Group individuals<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and the Executive Board members violated section 1962(b), <em>see supra </em>Part III, but it further found that both the Provenzano Group individuals and the Executive Board members conspired to violate 1962(b), in contravention of section 1962(d).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The district court held, in part, that section 1962(d) contained a state of mind requirement, separate and apart from the state of mind required for the commission of the predicate offenses, and that the Group and Board individual defendants satisfied the section 1962(d) state of mind requirement. App. at 139-140. Moreover, the district court held that under section 1962(d), the government need not demonstrate that the defendants performed an \u201covert act\u201d (in addition to the two requisite RICO predicate offenses) in furtherance of the conspiracy. App. at 138. <em>See also United States v. Barton, </em>647 F.2d 224 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 857, 102 S.Ct. 307, 70 L.Ed.2d 152 (1981). In this appeal, the defendants do not contest these conclusions. We therefore affirm the holding of the district court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>specting the section 1962(d) conspiracy-charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The district court, to remedy the abuses of the Provenzano Group and the Executive Board, and to ensure that the Local 560 members will be able to exercise fully their democratic rights, ordered that the Executive Board be removed from office and replaced with a temporary trustee. The defendants argue that the district court had no power to remove the Executive Board or to establish a trusteeship. The government responds that such an equitable remedy was well within the discretion and power of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Section 1964(a)<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> of the RICO Act enables the district court, in its discretion, to employ a wide range of civil remedies. In relevant part, section 1964(a) empowers district courts to preyent violations of section 1962 \u201cby issuing appropriate orders, including, but not limited to: ordering any person to divest himself of any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise; [and] imposing reasonable restrictions on the future activities or investments of any person____\u201d Clearly, the district court\u2019s injunction in the instant case fell within its broad remedial powers of \u201cdivestiture\u201d and \u201creasonable restrictions\u201d provided for under section 1964. Indeed, the House Report which accompanied the proposed RICO Act stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\">[Section 1964(a) ] contains broad provisions to allow for reform of corrupted organizations. Although certain remedies are set out, the list is not meant to be exhaustive, and the only limit on remedies is that they accomplish the aim set out of removing the corrupting influence and make due provision for the rights of innocent persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">H.R.Rep. No. 91-1549, 91st Cong. 2nd Sess. 2, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4007, 4034. Moreover, we take careful note of the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction in <em>Sedima v. Imrex Co. Inc., supra,</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>regarding the interpretation of the RICO Act. The Court in <em>Sedima </em>held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoE\">RICO is to be read broadly. This is the lesson not only of Congress\u2019 self-consciously expansive language and overall approach, <em>see United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 586-87 [101 S.Ct. 2524, 2530, 69 L.Ed.2d 246] (1981), but also of its express admonition that RICO is to \u201cbe liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes,\u201d Pub.L. 91-452, \u00a7 904(a), 84 Stat. 947.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">105 S.Ct. at 3286.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">The defendants, relying on <em>United States v. Rubin, </em>559 F.2d 975 (5th Cir.1977), argue that removal of the Executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Board members was, in essence, a forfeiture, which can only be imposed under the criminal remedy provision of RICO-section 1963(a).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> However, in <em>Rubin, </em>the court did not hold that the removal of union officers is impermissible under section 1964. Indeed, the court stated that under section 1964 (unlike section 1963) defendants may be enjoined from <em>reacquiring </em>union office. Logic dictates that if section 1964 grants the district court the authority to bar an individual from <em>reacquiring </em>office \u2014 it must also grant the district court the authority to remove an individual from office. Thus, in many ways, section 1964 is a more powerful provision than its criminal counterpart, section 1963. This is largely explained by the fact that, under section 1963, the forfeiture sanction attaches automatically, while under section 1964, the injunctive powers are left to the equitable discretion of the district court.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The order of the district court dated March 16, 1984 will be affirmed in all respects. The stay pending appeal ordered by the district court in paragraph 7 <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> of its March 16, 1984 order is dissolved. The case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">.

Since the Provenzano Group, aided and abetted by the Executive Board, extorted LMRDA rights of Local 560\u2019s membership for the purpose of \"acquiring an interest in and control of\u2019 the Local 560 enterprise, the extortion of membership rights was properly designated as a section 1962(b) act.</p>\n<p id=\"aws-dedup-0\">The district court held, as well, that certain crimes committed by the Provenzano Group were predicate acts only for purposes of section 1962(c). For example, the district court noted that the Middlesex County Loansharking Transaction committed in March of 1967 by Thomas Andretta and Armand Faugno in violation of New Jersey law and the Skil Tool Theft committed in 1968 by Thomas Andretta and Frederick Salvatore Furino in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659, were racketeering activities relevant only to section 1962(c) of the RICO Act.

The district court did not admit into evidence all of the articles submitted by the government. The district court, for example, disallowed articles that did not contain specific references to Local 560 or Provenzano Group members, and also excluded articles from Philadelphia papers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>on the basis that there was an insufficient number of Local 560 members who lived within the general circulation area of those papers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\">. The government also argues that United States v.

Wren obtained these names of members or former members of Local 560 mainly from the Department of Labor personnel who had been involved in the investigation of the Local 560 1962 election, and in supervising the 1965 election. All the individuals selected for interviews by Wren had been political opponents of the Provenzano Ticket in the 1960's.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">. The government relies on language which appears in <em>United States v. Lewin, </em>467 F.2d 1132, 1140 (7th Cir.1972) for the proposition that \u201c[s]ystematic inquiry by a person coming from outside will often be a better source of knowledge than the casual opportunities of a neighbor or a friend.\u201d (quoting III Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 692 at 22 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). However, the text in Wigmore, although not quoted in <em>Lewin, </em>continues: \"the only reason for distrust exists when the inquirer ... seeks evidence of one purport only.\u201d In the instant case, Wren sought evidence of only one purport.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">. We agree with the district court that the appropriate burden of proof for the government in a civil action under the RICO Act (where remedies are sought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964) is the \"preponderance of the evidence\u201d standard and not, as the defendants contend, the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d or \"clear and convincing evidence\u201d standard. App. at 124-27. In holding that \"preponderance\u201d was the proper standard, the district court utilized the three-part balancing test articulated in <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 754, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1395, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The <em>Kramer </em>Court, in determining whether a particular standard of proof in a particular proceeding satisfies due process, evaluated three factors: (1) the private interests affected by the proceeding; (2) the risk of error created by the state\u2019s chosen procedure; and (3) the countervailing government interest supporting use of the challenged procedure. In the instant case, the district court chose the \"preponderance\u201d standard in the instant case because (1) the defendants faced neither the prospect of criminal sanction nor the imposition of significant liberty deprivations and (2) the nature of the relief sought was equitable and remedial in nature, not punitive. In adopting the \"preponderance\u201d standard, the district court joined the majority of courts which have addressed this issue. <em>See e.g. United States v. Cappetto, </em>502 F.2d 1351, 1358 (7th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 925, 95 S.Ct. 1121, 43 L.Ed.2d 395 (1975); <em>Farmers Bank of Delaware v. Bell Mortgage Corp., </em>452 F.Supp. 1278, 1280 (D.Del.1978); <em>Heinold Commodities, Inc. v. McCarty, </em>513 F.Supp. 311, 313 (N.D.Ill.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"Ahh\">Subsequent to the filing of the district court's opinion, the Supreme Court decided two cases which bear directly on this issue and which add further support for adopting the \"preponderance\u201d standard in civil actions brought under the RICO Act. In <em>Herman &amp; MacLean v. Hud-dleston, </em>459 U.S. 375, 103 S.Ct. 683, 74 L.Ed.2d 548 (1983), the Supreme Court held that the normal civil standard of proof applies in civil fraud actions brought under section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). The language in <em>Huddleston </em>mandates the \"preponderance\u201d standard in all but a few civil cases. The <em>Huddleston </em>Court, in surveying this area of the law, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOz\">Thus, we have required proof by clear and convincing evidence where particularly im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>portant individual interests or rights are at stake. <em>See, e.g., Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745 [102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599], (1982) (proceeding to terminate parental rights); <em>Addington v. Texas, supra </em>(involuntary commitment proceeding); <em>Woodby v. INS, </em>385 U.S. 276 (285-86) [87 S.Ct. 483, 487-88, 17 L.Ed.2d 362], (1966) (deportation). By contrast, imposition of even severe civil sanctions that do not implicate such interests has been permitted after proof by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Regan, </em>232 U.S. 37, 48-49 [34 S.Ct. 213, 217, 58 L.Ed. 494], (1914) (proof by a preponderance of the evidence suffices in civil suits involving proof of acts that expose a party to a criminal prosecution). Thus, in interpreting a statutory provision in <em>Steadman v. SEC, supra, </em>we upheld use of the preponderance standard in SEC administrative proceedings concerning alleged violations of the antifraud provisions. The sanctions imposed in the proceedings included an order permanently barring an individual from practicing his profession. And in <em>SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., </em>320 U.S. [345] at 355 [64 S.Ct. at 120 at 125 (1943)], we held that a preponderance of the evidence suffices to establish fraud under \u00a7 17(a) of the 1933 Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acf\"><em>Id. </em>at 389-90, 103 S.Ct. at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-0\">Even more on point is the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Sedima v. Imrex Co., Inc. </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985), where the Court held that proof of racketeering-type activity was not required to establish a RICO predicate act. Although the Court in <em>Sedi-ma </em>did not reach the burden of proof issue, it nevertheless held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afo\">We are not at all convinced that the predicate acts must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a proceeding under \u00a7 1964(C). In a number of settings, conduct that can be punished as criminal only upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt will support civil sanctions under a preponderance standard. There is no indication that Congress sought to depart from this general principle here. That the offending conduct is described by reference to criminal statutes does not mean that its occurrence must be established by criminal standards or that the consequences of a finding of liability in a private civil action are identical to the consequences of a criminal conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"alg-dedup-0\">105 S.Ct. at 3282-83 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ASV\">Reviewing the Supreme Court opinions in <em>Santosky, Huddleston, </em>and <em>Sedima, </em>we are satisfied that the preponderance standard applies in civil RICO litigation. While we recognize that the defendants in such actions have significant interests at stake (i.e., financial, occupational, and reputational), these interests are not sufficiently compelling to trigger a more stringent burden of procf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b366-17\">.

They maintain that, since the district court inferentially found that Local 560\u2019s elections since 1968 have been illegal, the Attorney General could not pursue a RICO claim because the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 481-483, provides the exclusive remedy by which an election can be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-18\">This argument has little merit. Contrary to the defendants\u2019 contention, the government initiated this suit, not to invalidate any particular election, but to eliminate entirely the union\u2019s racketeering element. The RICO Act and sections 481 through 483 of the LMRDA were designed to combat entirely different offenses, and as such, the LMRDA cannot be pre-emptive. Moreover, we note that RICO was enacted in 1970, eleven years after the LMRDA, and was intended, in part, to supplement the protections already afforded union members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b366-19\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-20\">Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b367-11\">.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AsA\">Put simply, the actions of Local 560 affected interstate commerce because Local 560 entered into collective bargaining agreements with businesses directly engaged in interstate commerce. Thus, when membership rights to democratic participation in that union were extorted, the actions of Local 560 were affected, which, in turn, resulted in affecting interstate commerce through businesses involved in interstate commerce. Accordingly, the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the extortion of membership rights affected, in some minimal way, interstate commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\">.

In <em>Boffa, </em>this court held that the RICO predicate act of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, may encompass a scheme to deprive union members of the right to the \"honest and faithful\u201d services of union officials as provided in section 501 of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501, but may <em>not </em>encompass a scheme to deprive employees of rights created by section 7 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. In <em>Boffa, </em>we rejected the argument that a violation of union rights under section 7 of the NLRA may be characterized as a RICO predicate act because of the \"remedial nature of the [NLRA] and the primacy of the National Labor Relations Board in resolving unfair labor practice disputes.\u201d 688 F.2d at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">However, Boffa\u2019s conclusion with regard to section 7 of the NLRA is inapposite here since the NLRB does <em>not </em>have primary jurisdiction over the democratic rights created by section 411 of the LMRDA \u2014 the rights at issue in the present case.

Any person who willfully violates this section shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiC_\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 530.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b368-14\">. If the defendants\u2019 argument were to succeed, the government would have failed to prove that the Executive Board violated \u00a7 1962(b) because, the defendants allege, \u00a7 530, the preemptive section, is not a predicate act under RICO. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1). In such a case, of course, the Executive Board could not have aided and abetted the Provenzano Group in a violation of the RICO Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">As the text reveals, we decline to accept this argument. Rather, we hold that in the present context, the Hobbs Act is not displaced by \u00a7 530, and hence, the Hobbs Act violations found by the district court satisfy the predicate act requirement of \u00a7 1962(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">. At the time these appointments were made, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 barred individuals convicted of certain felonies from holding union office for a five year period. Section 504 of the LMRDA was amended in 1984 to, in part, extend the disability from five years to thirteen years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\">. The defendants\u2019 argument that the Executive Board cannot be held culpable for the appointments so long as the appointments were in compliance with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 504, is misguided. Indeed, it was Congress' intent that the LMRDA should in no way limit the responsibilities which union officers have under other federal laws. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a) provides, in relevant part, that \u201cnothing in the [LMRDA] shall reduce or limit the responsibilities of any labor organization or any officer____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b372-18\">. We also find unpersuasive the defendants\u2019 contention that the Executive Board members were not aware of the criminal backgrounds of Luizzi or Reynolds at the time of their appointments. Both individuals had fairly extensive criminal histories and, in light of the entire record, the district court\u2019s finding that the Executive Board was aware of the criminal background of both individuals cannot be regarded as clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\">. The district court found that the payments made to Anthony Provenzano were not in the interest of the union. The defendants argue that the district court should not have second-guessed the Local concerning a matter upon which the membership voted. We find this argument unpersuasive in light of the district court\u2019s findings of intimidation and fear leading to coerced judgments on the part of Local members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">. Under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(a), the officers of a union have an affirmative obligation to hold union money \"solely for the benefit of the organization.\u2019\u2019 The Executive Board\u2019s failure to take affirmative action to suspend these payments was circumstantial evidence that the Executive Board intended to aid the Provenzano Group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\">. The district court also held that (1) the Executive Board\u2019s failure to remove both Salvatore Briguglio as business agent in December 1975 (after FBI agents recovered ammunition from his file cabinet during a search for guns at the union offices) and Nunzio Provenzano as President in May 1981 (after he was convicted in the City-Man case but before he was sentenced) and (2) the Executive Board\u2019s toleration of known and reputed criminals visiting union offices, also intensified the climate of intimidation in Local 560 and constituted separate Hobbs Act extortions. We agree that the purpose and effect of these actions was to extort the membership\u2019s rights through intimidation and fear. Moreover, we note that fear can be invoked in subtle and indirect ways. <em>See e.g. United States v. Zito, </em>467 F.2d 1401, 1405 (2nd Cir.1972) (the mere mention of the name of a known criminal can instill fear).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b374-15\">. We conclude that under RICO, an individual need not himself commit two requisite predicate offenses, as long as that same individual aids and abets the commission of the predicate offenses. Indeed, there is no authority to suggest that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a) does not apply to RICO. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a), whoever \"aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures [the commission of an offense against the United States] is punishable as a principal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\">. In <em>Hirsch v. Enright, </em>751 F.2d 628, 633-34 (3d Cir.1984), this court held that for purposes of a single violation of \u00a7 1962(b), the same entity cannot be both a \"person\u201d and an \"enterprise.\" In so holding, <em>Hirsch </em>recognized that the district court in this case had not committed that error. Accordingly, <em>Hirsch </em>distinguished the <em>Hirsch </em>situation from the reasoning and holding of the district court in <em>United States v. Local 560, </em>581 F.Supp. 279 (D.N.J.1984). <em>See Hirsch, </em>751 F.2d at 634.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b375-15\">. The defendants do not dispute that Local 560 is properly an \"enterprise\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b375-16\">. The Supreme Court, subsequent to argument in the present appeal, affirmed the Seventh Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Haroco, Inc. v. American National Bank and Trust Co., </em>747 F.2d 384 (7th Cir.1984), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3291, 87 L.Ed.2d 437 (1985), without addressing the question of what constitutes a \"person\u201d for purposes of the RICO Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\">. As noted, the government argued that the Provenzano Group itself could be a person, Brief for Appellee at 37-38, and the district court so held. App. at 133. We cannot say that the district court\u2019s holding was in error, although in light of our discussion respecting the individual Provenzano Group defendants, we need not rely on that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">. Contrary to the defendants\u2019 position, we find that Sinno\u2019s testimony was properly admissible against the current Executive Board members despite the fact that the current Executive Board members were not appointed until after 1961 (when Sinno left the Provenzano Group). The Executive Board members are bound by the prior acts and statements made by their co-conspirators, so long as the statements and acts were designed to further the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Sarno, </em>456 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir.1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b378-4\">. The defendants also argue that the district court relied on predicate acts of racketeering that were time-barred by the ten-year provision contained in section 1961(5) of the RICO Act. RICO prohibits a person from engaging in a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(b). A \"pattern of racketeering activity\" under section 1961(5) of the RICO Act, requires \"at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.\" The defendants maintain that this limitations period limits predicate acts to only those offenses which occurred ten years (plus time for incarceration) prior to the most recent predicate act (in the instant case, the extortion of membership rights in 1982). Under the defendants' theory, RICO provides for a ten-year (plus incarceration) maximum time period from the date of the most recent predicate act, in which to find all the other predicate acts. The defendants, therefore, would exclude many of the early predicate acts (such as the 1961 murder of Anthony Castellito).</p>\n<p id=\"A2Q\">However, the plain language of section 1961(5) does not demand such a limited ten-year maximum time period for predicate acts. Of course, if there are only two (the minimum number) predicate acts, these acts must be within 10 years of each other. If there are more than two, however, the RICO Act does not require that they all fall within the same ten-year period. Rather, section 1961(5) requires only that the last predicate act occur within ten years (plus time for incarceration) of the commission of \"a prior act.\u201d If the defendants' position were correct, then section 1961(5) would require the last predicate act to occur within ten years of the commission of <em>\u201cthe most recent </em>act\u201d, rather than <em>\u201ca prior act.\u201d </em>Even a cursory review of the extortionate acts found by the district court which impacted on the rights of Local 560\u2019s members (which occurred as recently as 1981 with respect to pension payments and appointments to union office) reveals the inherent flaw in the defendants\u2019 argument. <em>See </em>sections III A and B, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not rely on time-barred predicate acts.</p>\n<p id=\"AJSU\">The defendants also argue that the government\u2019s case should be barred under the laches doctrine. However, despite the fact that it is the defendants\u2019 burden to prove laches, <em>see Minnesota Mining v. Berwick Industries, Inc., </em>532 F.2d 330, 334 (3d Cir.1976), they have made no showing, beyond a conclusory declaration, that (1) the government inexcusably delayed in bringing this civil RICO action, and (2) the defendants were prejudiced by the delay. <em>See Churma v. United States Steel Corp., </em>514 F.2d 589, 593 (3d Cir.1975). We therefore reject this argument as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\">. The district court also found that the deposition of Andrew Reynolds demonstrated the \"continued vitality and viability of the Provenza-no Group.\u201d App. at 66. On August 17, 1982, Andrew Reynolds, then a Business Agent for Local 560, was deposed. At this deposition, Reynolds invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege in refusing to answer, among other things, (1) whether he knew Matthew Ianniello (an alleged member of the Genovese Crime Family); (2) whether Ianniello and the Genovese Family control Local 560 through Reynolds and others, and (3) whether he knew Funzi Tieri (a reputed organized crime figure). At trial, the district cotirt, after admitting Reynold\u2019s deposition into evidence, drew an adverse inference from Rey-nold\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Baxter v. Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976), finding that Reynolds was a member of the Provenzano Group. App. at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"AiE\">We find, however, that, even assuming Rey-nold's testimony was properly admitted into evidence, it was inappropriate for the district court to have drawn an adverse inference from Rey-nold\u2019s failure to respond. In <em>Baxter, </em>the Supreme Court held that in a civil case the finder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>of fact may draw an adverse inference from a party's invocation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Court recognized, however, that there must be sufficient independent evidence \u2014 besides the mere invocation of the privilege \u2014 upon which to base the negative inference. <em>See also National Acceptance Co. of America v. Bathalter, </em>705 F.2d 924 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"ADq4\">In the instant case, we find that there is not a sufficient evidentiary foundation which can support the district court\u2019s negative inference. The district court based its inference solely on the fact that (1) Reynolds was observed meeting with Nunzio Provenzano and Bobby Manna and with Nunzio Provenzano and Matthew Ianniello and (2) Reynolds was appointed as a Business Agent by the Local 560 Executive Board. These facts, without more, cannot support the district court\u2019s inference. We note as well that there exists no testimony which, directly or indirectly, links Reynolds with the other members of the Provenzano Group. On such a record, we believe that the district court erred in finding Reynolds to be a member of the Provenzano Group and thus inferring the continued vitality of the Provenzano Group from Reynold\u2019s invocation of his constitutionally guaranteed privilege. At the same time, however, we find that the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Provenza-no Group is an ongoing and viable organization is sufficiently supported by Sinno\u2019s testimony and the evidence of criminal convictions. Thus, while the district court erred in drawing an inference from Reynold\u2019s testimony, that error was harmless in light of the independent evidence supporting the district court\u2019s conclusion. <em>See DeLaval Turbine, Inc. v. West India Industries, Inc., </em>502 F.2d 259 (3d Cir.1974), discussed in text, <em>supra, </em>at 278.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b379-15\">. The district court found that Anthony Pro-venzano received kickbacks from Thomas Romano in exchange for helping Romano receive certain real estate loans. The kickbacks took the form of the below-market sale of two houses in Florida by Romano and his associates to Anthony Provenzano. The district court found that the first house, sold on November 1, 1974, was sold for $22,000 under market value, and the second house, sold on July 7, 1977, was undervalued $42,500. App. at 78-81.</p>\n<p id=\"afy-dedup-1\">At trial, both sides presented expert witnesses to testify as to the market value of the two houses in question at the time of the sale. The defendants argue that the district court\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous because, in reaching it, the district court relied entirely on the government\u2019s expert witness and discounted the testimony of the defendants\u2019 expert. Our reading of the record reveals, however, that the district court did not adopt wholesale the testimony of the government's expert witness. With regard to the first transaction the district court held: \u201cEliminating certain contested aspects of each appraiser\u2019s report, and averaging the remaining minor differences I find that the approximate value of 531 Palm Drive on the purchase date as $174,000 [the sales price was $152,000]. App. at 80. Respecting the second purchase, the district court concluded: \u201cAgain using the most credible portion of both appraisers' reports, I find that this property was in fact worth $222,500 at that time, a \u2018benefit\u2019 for Anthony Provenzano of 42,-500.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUj\">Moreover, we note that even if the district court decided to discount entirely the credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of the defendants\u2019 appraiser, such a credibility decision, except under extreme circumstances, should not be disturbed on review by an appellate court. <em>See Anderson v.

As we previously observed, the <em>Provenzano Group defendants </em>were found by the district court to have violated section 1962(b), (c), and (d), having violated 1962(d) by conspiring to violate both section 1962(b) and 1962(c). App. at 6-7. However, the district court did not find that the <em>Executive Board defendants </em>violated \u00a7 1962(c), or conspired to violate that section under \u00a7 1962(d). Nor did the government make such allegations. App. at 174. Rather, the government alleged, and the district court found, that the Executive Board defendants violated \u00a7 1962(b), and conspired to violate \u00a7 1962(b), in contravention of \u00a7 1962(d). App. at 148, 174-75, 185. Thus, the district court\u2019s March 16, 1984 order reciting that the <em>Executive Board members </em>violated \u00a7\u00a7 1962(b), (c), and (d), App. at 157, misstated the record with respect to the \u00a7 1962(c) violation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(a), the civil remedies provision of RICO, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of section 1962 of this chapter by issuing appropriate orders, including, but not limited to: ordering any person to divest himself of any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise; imposing reasonable restrictions on the future activities or investments of any person, including, but not limited to, prohibiting any person from engaging in the same type of endeavor as the enterprise engaged in, the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce; or ordering dissolution or reorganization of any enterprise, making due provision for the rights of innocent persons.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b381-10\">.

Finally, the defendants argue that, by appointing a trustee to be in charge of Local 560, the district court forced the membership, which had not violated the RICO Act, to forfeit its interest in the union. Defendants maintain that it is impermissible to punish a party under section 1964(a) if that party has not been found to have violated the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AxT\">The membership of Local 560, however, is not being punished by the district court\u2019s injunction. The district court concluded, and, by this opinion, we have affirmed that conclusion, that the membership no longer controls the union. By appointing a temporary trustee, the district court was therefore protecting rather than forfeiting the members' rights. Moreover, as we have observed, the power to appoint a Trustee falls within the broad equitable powers granted to district courts under section 1964(a). <em>See generally, Lewis v.
