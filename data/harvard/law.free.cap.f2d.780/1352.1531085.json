Costello seeks review of the decision of the Railroad Retirement Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying her widow\u2019s annuity benefits pursuant to the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (\u201cAct\u201d or \u201cRailroad Retirement Act\u201d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 231-231v. We find that the Board erroneously interpreted the Act, and, accordingly, we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-15\">On October 6, 1981, Costello filed a joint application for a widow\u2019s annuity and a child\u2019s annuity under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(d)(l)(ii) and (iii),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> respectively. On the application, she stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that: 1) her husband, Thomas, a railroad employee for over thirty years, died on September 17, 1981; 2) she was fifty-seven years of age; 3) she had in her care the employee\u2019s child, Patrick, who was sixteen; and 4) neither she nor the child was disabled. Although the Bureau of Retirement Claims awarded the child\u2019s annuity, it denied her claim for a widow\u2019s annuity. The appeals referee affirmed the denial of widow\u2019s benefits. The Board affirmed and adopted the decision of the appeals referee. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-16\">The parties agree that 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(d)(l)(ii) is the applicable section of the Act. This section entitles a widow of a deceased railroad employee to annuity payments if she has in her care a child of the employee under age eighteen who is also entitled to an annuity. Section 231a(d)(l) directs the Board to refer to section 231c to determine the amount of the annuity payment. Section 231c(f)(l) provides that the amount of the Railroad Retirement annuity \u201cshall be in an amount equal to the amount * * * of the mother\u2019s insurance benefit * * to which * * * she would have been entitled under the Social Security Act.\u201d The Social Security Act has its own distinct entitlements section, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(g)(1). This section entitles a person in Costello\u2019s situation to an annuity if she, \u201cat the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>of filing such application has in her care a child of such individual entitled to a child\u2019s insurance benefit.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(s)(l) discusses when a child is entitled to insurance benefits. Prior to 1981, no dispute would have arisen, as under section 402(s)(l) a child was entitled to social security benefits if under age eighteen, the same age specified under the Railroad Retirement Act. In 1981, however, Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub.L. No. 97-35, \u00a7 2205, 95 Stat. 357 (\u201cOmnibus Act\u201d), which amended section 402(s)(l) to allow social security benefits only to children under age sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">It is not disputed that Costello and the child are entitled to annuities under the Railroad Retirement Act. The Board stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-5\">[t]he eligibility provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act were not affected by the amendment of the Social Security Act; therefore, the entitlement requirements for a widow or widower under section 2(d)(l)(ii) remain unchanged, and such individuals are entitled to a benefit as long as they have a minor child of the employee under age 18 in their care and custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">Decision of the Appeals Referee at 3. The Board then found that although, under the Railroad Retirement Act, Costello was entitled to widow\u2019s benefits, under the Social Security Act as amended, she would not be entitled to benefits, and that therefore her railroad retirement award would be zero. The Board held, in effect, that a railroad retirement annuity applicant must meet the entitlement requirements of the Social Security Act as well as those of the Railroad Retirement Act itself. Costello argues on appeal that since she is entitled to widow\u2019s benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act, she should be awarded benefits as if she had met the Social Security Act\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-7\">This Court\u2019s standard of review in such cases is to determine \u201cwhether the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, is not arbitrary, and has a reasonable basis in law.\u201d <em>Williams v. U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, </em>585 F.2d 341, 343 (8th Cir.1978). Because the facts are not in issue, the question here is whether the Board\u2019s decision had a reasonable basis in law. Congress has given the Board responsibility for administering the Act, and the Board\u2019s interpretation of the Act is entitled to deference. <em>See E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Collins, </em>432 U.S. 46, 54-55, 97 S.Ct. 2229, 2234, 53 L.Ed.2d 100 (1977) (SEC interpretation). In this case, however, the Board interpreted both the Railroad Retirement Act and the Social Security Act, and considered their interrelationship. Thus, the Board was dealing with matters not totally within its area of expertise. Additionally, as we stated in <em>Cunningham v. Toan, </em>728 F.2d 1101, 1105 (8th Cir.1984), \u201can agency\u2019s interpretations are not conclusive and courts are not bound by them.\u201d The Supreme Court stated that \u201c[although an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute under which it operates is entitled to some deference, \u2018this deference is constrained by our obligation to honor the clear meaning of a statute, as revealed by its language, purpose and history.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </em>442 U.S. 397, 411, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2369, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979) (quoting <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. 551, 566 n. 20, 99 S.Ct. 790, 800 n. 20, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979)). We think the Board\u2019s analysis was insufficient. A more thorough analysis reveals that neither the language, purpose, nor history of either the Railroad Retirement Act or the Social Security Act reveals a congressional intent to require a railroad employee\u2019s widow to meet the more restrictive entitlement requirements of the Social Security Act as well as the entitlement requirements specifically provided by the Railroad Retirement Act. We therefore find that the Board\u2019s decision did not have a reasonable basis in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-9\">The plain language of section 231a of the Railroad Retirement Act entitles a widow with a child under the age of eighteen to a widow\u2019s annuity. The Board concedes this. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>Although section 231c of this Act specifically requires referral to the Social Security Act to compute the amount of the award, no section of the Act requires use of the Social Security Act initially to determine whether entitlement exists. Thus, determination of the amount of an annuity has two distinct steps. The threshold question is whether a claimant is entitled to an annuity. For this first question, one refers to the entitlement section of the appropriate act. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a (Railroad Retirement Act); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(f)(1) (Social Security Act). If, under either act, entitlement exists, the second step is to refer to the social security regulations to determine the amount of benefits. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 231c(f)(l), 231c(g)(l); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.342 (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Board pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-5\">When the meaning of a statute may be determined from the language in which it is framed, the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms. <em>Caminetti v. United States, </em>242 U.S. 470 [37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442] (1917). Further, if the meaning of a particular section is clear standing alone, no other section or part of the act may be applied to create doubt. <em>United States v. Bat-chelder, </em>581 F.2d 626 (C.A. 7, 1978) <em>[rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>442 U.S. 114, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979)]; <em>Preterm Inc. v. Dukakis, </em>591 F.2d 121 (C.A. 1, 1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">Brief of Respondent at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">Here, the Board is not merely relying on a different section of the Railroad Retirement Act as an interpretive aid, it is relying on an entirely different act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-11\">Although, in the Board\u2019s words, \u201cthe court need look no further than the literal meaning of the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, we believe that a number of points show that the plain language of the provision expresses Congress\u2019s intent. If Congress had intended to change the entitlement requirements of the Railroad Retirement widow\u2019s annuity, it not only could, but would have done so. Section 231a(d)(l)(ii) is not an obscure provision, but is one out of only five provisions entitling survivors of railroad employees to annuities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Congress enacted the Omnibus Act, amending the Social Security Act to decrease the maximum age of a minor from eighteen to sixteen, it could have similarly amended the Railroad Retirement Act. It did, in fact, specifically amend other subsections of the Railroad Retirement Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as other portions of the subsection in question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-12\">When Congress integrated the Railroad Retirement Act and the Social Security Act, it did so only for particular purposes, and then used specific language to accomplish those purposes. The Board directed this Court\u2019s attention to several provisions which it claims, construed together, \u201c[compel] the conclusion that Congress believed the necessity for reference to appropriate provisions of the Social Security Act in arriving at tier I amounts so clear that an explicit requirement was superfluous.\u201d Brief of Respondent at 18. Each of these provisions, however, explicitly refers to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>Social Security Act. <em>See, e.g., </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 231b(a)(l), 231b(m), 231c(f)(l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">Congress specifically considered and provided for the possibility that it would amend the entitlement provisions of the Social Security Act without amending similar Railroad Retirement Act provisions. Section 23 lr of the Railroad Retirement Act provides for \u201c[a]utomatic benefit eligibility requirement adjustments.\u201d It states that if Congress amends the Social Security Act to reduce eligibility requirements or to add classes of eligible beneficiaries, such changes shall be automatically applicable to section 231a railroad retirement annuity claimants. This provision demonstrates that Congress not only considered the question before us, but also determined that automatic adjustments are appropriate only when eligibility requirements are to be liberalized. It clearly shows that Congress \"requires express amendment of the Act\u2019s provisions, or at least express authorization for automatic amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">It is not unreasonable for Congress to provide benefits through the Railroad Retirement Act which are not available through the Social Security Act. As the Board acknowledges, the Omnibus Act did not affect 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(d)(l)(iii). Therefore, while children of deceased railroad employees are able to collect annuities as minors until they reach the age of eighteen, children of other deceased employees are only entitled to annuity payments until they reach sixteen. Additionally, the Railroad Retirement system has traditionally required higher tax rates of its employers and employees than has the Social Security system \u2014 typically twice as high.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Congress was well aware of these high tax rates. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 93-1163, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5702, 5708.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-9\">It would not be logical to assume that Congress meant to offer benefits with one hand, and to grab them back with the other. The plain language of the Railroad Retirement Act entitles Costello to a widow\u2019s annuity under section 231a, and there is nothing in the purpose or history of the Act to gainsay this clear intent, rather, the opposite. If Congress intends a contrary result, it can amend the Act to make its intention clear. Accordingly, we must reverse and remand with directions to award to Costello a widow\u2019s annuity for the time period which began with her initial application for the annuity and which ended when Patrick reached age eighteen.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1439-10\">. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_p\">(d) Survivors eligible for annuities</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-11\">(1) The following described survivors of a deceased employee who will have completed ten years of service and will have had a current connection with the railroad industry at the time of his death shall, subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (g) and (h) of this section, be entitled to annuities, if they have filed application therefor, in the amounts provided under section 231c of this title\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-13\">(ii) a widow (as defined in section 216(c) and (k) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(c) and (k) ]) of such a deceased employee who has not remarried and who (A) is not entitled to an annuity under paragraph (i), and (B) at the time of filing an application for an annuity under this paragraph, will have in her care a child of such deceased employee, which child is entitled to an annuity under paragraph (iii) (other than an annuity payable to a child who has attained age 18 and is not under a disability):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-18\">(iii) a child (as defined in section 216(e) and (k) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(e) and (k)]) of such a deceased employee who (A) will be less than eighteen years of age * * *.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.342 (1985) provides that \u201c[y]our mother\u2019s or father\u2019s monthly benefit is equal to 75 percent of the insured person\u2019s primary insurance amount.\u201d The fact that the amount does not vary with the age of the child demonstrates that once it is established that the child qualifies for an annuity, that is, is a \"minor,\u201d the specific age of the child is not of particular importance.
