DOYLE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico. The court below concluded that Employers Insurance of Wau-sau was liable to the American Bank of Commerce on a \u201cBankers\u2019 Special Bond\u201d in the amount of $233,000. The insurance company appeals. We affirm in part but find that the case must be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">This case arose out of a series of transactions among the Snow Mountain Lumber Company (\u201cSnow Mountain\u201d), the American Bank of Commerce (\u201cABC\u201d), and Wells Fargo Business Credit Corporation (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d). Employers Insurance of Wausau (\u201cEmployers\u201d) is ABC\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Wells Fargo was shown to have made loans to Snow Mountain in exchange for a security interest in Snow Mountain\u2019s accounts receivable. The loan agreement provided that when Snow Mountain invoiced a customer it would forward a copy of the invoice to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo would then lend Snow Mountain 85% of the amount invoiced. The loan agreement provided that when Snow Mountain collected on its invoices it would deposit the funds in a special account (the \u201cagency account\u201d) at ABC. Under the terms of an agreement to which Wells Fargo, Snow Mountain, and ABC were parties (the \u201cspecial deposit agreement\u201d), funds deposited in that account were to be paid to the order of Wells Fargo at the close of every business day. Wells Fargo held a security interest in the funds deposited in the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">Difficulties appeared when Snow Mountain began to experience financial problems in 1981. During the fourth quarter of that year Snow Mountain transferred $189,-348.93 from the agency account to its own operating account. Snow Mountain\u2019s financial legerdemain was insufficient to free it from its financial troubles.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">Snow Mountain filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy on June 15, 1982. Following the filing of the petition for bankruptcy, Snow Mountain transferred an additional $224,848.10 from its agency account to its operating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-16\">Wells Fargo became aware of Snow Mountain\u2019s violation of the terms of the special deposit agreement in June of 1982. Later that month Wells Fargo sent ABC a copy of the special deposit agreement and notified ABC of a potential claim based on ABC\u2019s duties as a party to the special deposit agreement. Wells Fargo sent a formal demand letter to ABC on July 8, 1982, claiming damages as a result of a claimed breach of ABC\u2019s duties under the special deposit agreement. ABC notified Employers of this potential claim on October 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-17\">Wells Fargo filed suit against ABC in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico on December 30, 1982. ABC impleaded Employers as a third-party defendant on July 19, 1983. Trial was carried out on January 9, 1984 before Judge Juan Burciaga. The plaintiff Wells Fargo announced that it had reached a settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>with defendant ABC; thus, only the third-party claim remained to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">ABC\u2019s claim against Employers was based on a Bankers\u2019 Special Bond issued by Employers. ABC claimed that the loss caused by Snow Mountain\u2019s actions, for which ABC had settled with Wells Fargo, was within the \u201cOn Premises\u201d coverage of the bond. The \u201cOn Premises\u201d coverage insured ABC against losses resulting from false pretenses, larceny, theft, and embezzlement. Employers defended that ABC could not collect under the bond because no covered loss had taken place, the notice of loss from ABC to Employers was untimely, and the loss was excluded from coverage by the bond\u2019s explicit exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">After a trial without a jury, Judge Burci-aga held for ABC in all respects. He entered a judgment against Employers for $233,000, plus litigation expenses in both ABC\u2019s action against Employers and a related action against ABC then pending in bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Employers appeals, raising as error the district court\u2019s conclusions with respect to false pretenses, larceny, theft, embezzlement, timeliness of notice of loss, and the applicability of the bond\u2019s exclusions. These conclusions cleared any fog which had covered the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Employers\u2019 first argument is that the transfers of funds between Snow Mountain\u2019s agency account and its general operating account were not the result of larceny, theft or false pretenses. The district court rejected Employers\u2019 argument and concluded that Snow Mountain\u2019s conduct in persuading ABC to make the transfers in question constituted larceny, theft and false pretenses under New Mexico law.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">At the outset, we note that it is our policy \u201cto accord extraordinary force on appeal to the \u2018... views and findings of a federal district judge ... involving the interpretation and application of the law of the state of the federal trial judge\u2019s residence ... where there are no decisions on point or none which provide clear precedent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. West Jordan City, </em>714 F.2d 1017,1020 (10th Cir.1983), quoting <em>Joyce v. Davis, </em>539 F.2d 1262, 1264-65 (10th Cir.1976) (citations omitted). When we review the district court\u2019s decision with the appropriate degree of deference we find ourselves in agreement with the lower court\u2019s conclusion that the funds transfers from the agency account to Snow Mountain\u2019s operating account were the result of conduct on Snow Mountain\u2019s part constituting larceny, theft and false pretenses under New Mexico law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision that ABC\u2019s liability to Wells Fargo constituted a loss covered by the \u201cOn Premises\u201d portion of the Bankers\u2019 Special Bond.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">Employers\u2019 next argument is that ABC failed to comply with the Bond\u2019s requirement that it promptly notify Employers of any losses covered by the policy, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>therefore ABC should not recover under the bond. We find this argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">In New Mexico, \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the notice and proof of loss requirements of an insurance policy is all that is required for an insured to collect under the policy. <em>Robinson v. Palatin Insurance Co., </em>11 N.M. 162, 66 P. 535, 536 (1901). The facts of this case reveal that ABC did substantially comply with the notice requirements of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">ABC first realized that it might be liable to Wells Fargo for improper transfers from Snow Mountain\u2019s agency account in the summer of 1982. ABC referred the matter to Peter Brouillire, general counsel for the bank\u2019s parent holding company, in August, 1982. Mr. Brouillire and the holding company\u2019s accountants immediately investigated the matter. The accountants filed a report on September 30, 1982, indicating that there had beesr-s\u00fabst\u00e1ntial transfers from the agency account that might make ABC liable to Wells Fargo for mishandling the account. On October 1, 1982 \u2014 the day after the report confirmed ABC\u2019s potential liability to Wells Fargo \u2014 ABC filed a notice of loss with Employers. We agree with the district court that ABC\u2019s conduct, as outlined above, constituted substantial compliance with the notice requirements of the Bankers\u2019 Special Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Employers also contends that ABC failed to comply with the bond\u2019s requirement that ABC provide Employers with \u201cfull particulars\u201d of an alleged loss within six months of the time ABC discovered the loss. Once again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">ABC could not know the \u201cfull particulars\u201d of the loss in this case until the existence and amount of its liability to Wells Fargo had been finally settled. Thus, the \u201cfull particulars\u201d of the loss became known to ABC when it settled Wells Fargo\u2019s claim against it on the eve of the trial. Since ABC and Employers immediately thereafter went to trial on the insurance claims involved in this case, we find it difficult to see how Employers can contend that it was not aware of the \u201cfull particulars\u201d of ABC\u2019s loss until more than six months after ABC knew of them. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that ABC complied with the proof of loss requirements of the Bankers\u2019 Special Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">Employers\u2019 third argument is that the loss occasioned by Snow Mountain\u2019s transfers from the agency account to the operating account was excluded from the bond\u2019s coverage. The bond excludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-11\">Loss resulting from payments made or withdrawals from a depositor\u2019s account involving funds erroneously credited to such account ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">Employers argues that the transfers from the agency account were \u201cerroneously\u201d credited to the operating account because ABC had agreed not to allow Snow Mountain to make such transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">The trial court was of the opinion that the exclusion had no application to the claim of ABC under the bond. Both parties agree that there are no cases interpreting this language. From this we are moved to conclude that under the proper standard of deference to the district judge\u2019s determination of the law of the jurisdiction where he sits, <em>see Williams, </em>714 F.2d at 1020, the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue must be affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">Despite our affirmance of the district court\u2019s rulings on all issues of law presented, we must remand this, case to the district court for a re-examination of the judgment ordered. The district court, in its findings of fact, found that ABC had settled with Wells Fargo for $230,000, yet the judgment awards ABC $233,000. This judgment casts shadows on the conclusion. If this is a typographical error, it should be corrected. If not, the evidence leading to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>this conclusion should be explained. Also, it appears that the bond contains a $25,000 deductible in the \u201cOn Premises\u201d coverage, and a $25,000 deductible in the litigation expenses coverage. These deductibles were not mentioned in the court\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Hence they must be considered in determining the amount of ABC\u2019s award, else ABC\u2019s recovery from its insurer will be more than it contracted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-8\">. We note that N.M.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 30-16-18, contained in the \u201cLarceny\u201d article of the New Mexico criminal code, makes it illegal improperly to remove or dispose of property subject to a security interest. The district court did not expressly rely on this statute in holding that Snow Mountain\u2019s conduct constituted larceny; we find, however, that the statute provides substantial support for the district court\u2019s conclusion of law on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">We also observe that the district court found that Snow Mountain held the funds in the agency account as trustee for Wells Fargo. Although there is no New Mexico law on point, we note that in other jurisdictions misappropriation of funds held in trust constitutes either theft, <em>see </em>S.D.Comp.Laws \u00a7 22-30A-10, or larceny, <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>410 F.2d 1036, 1039 (D.C. Cir.1969); <em>St. Lawrence County Nat\u2019l. Bank v. American Motorists Ins. Co., </em>21 A.D.2d 702, 249 N.Y.S.2d 543 (1964). We believe that this provides additional support for the lower court\u2019s conclusion that ABC\u2019s loss resulted from conduct covered by the Bankers' Special Bond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b960-14\">. We do not mean to imply that ABC\u2019s handling of the transfers in question was without flaws. The record shows that ABC\u2019s handling of the Special Deposit Agreement and of Snow Mountain\u2019s transfers between the agency account and its operating account was quite slipshod. Nevertheless, since the \u201cOn Premises\u201d coverage in the Bankers\u2019 Special Bond provides that losses due to larceny, theft or false pretenses are covered regardless of whether ABC\u2019s conduct in connection with such losses was negligent, we must find that ABC is entitled to recovery under the bond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b961-8\">. Indeed, because we have concluded that the district court\u2019s conclusion as to false pretenses, larceny and theft was correct, Employers\u2019 argument that the transfer of funds was \"erroneous\u2019\u2019 breaks down. The transfers were the result of dishonesty and not mere error, so the exclusion by its own terms cannot apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
