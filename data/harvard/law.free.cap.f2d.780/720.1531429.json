They allege that they and their deceased mother, Florence Walker, were deprived of due process of law in state court proceedings concerning the conservatorship of Florence Walker and probate of her will. They also contend that the twenty-first amendment to the Iowa Constitution violates the Federal Constitution because it denies them the right to vote for state judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-32\">We have carefully reviewed the record and we find appellant\u2019s arguments frivolous and without merit. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>8th Cir.R. 12(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
