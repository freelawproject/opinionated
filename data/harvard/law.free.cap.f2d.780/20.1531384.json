We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">We mention briefly only a single issue argued by the parties. That issue is whether punitive damages are available as a remedy to an ERISA violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">The district court examined that issue and concluded it was \u201chighly doubtful\u201d this court would approve an award of punitive damages in an ERISA action. <em>Hollenbeck v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>605 F.Supp. 421, 435 (E.D.Mo.1984); <em>see Dependahl v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>653 F.2d 1208, 1216 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 968 and 1084, 102 S.Ct. 512 and 641, 70 L.Ed.2d 384 and 619 (1981). The district court went on, however, to state that even if punitive damages were generally available none could properly be awarded in this case because in its view Falstaff\u2019s actions were neither malicious nor in wanton disregard of the beneficiaries\u2019 rights to receive insurance benefits. <em>Hollenbeck, </em>605 F.Supp. at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">The district court\u2019s finding on the issue of punitive damages is a finding of fact. As such, it may only be overturned on appeal if found to be \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>see also Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511-13, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); <em>Jennings v. Dumas Public School District, </em>763 F.2d 28, 32 (8th Cir.1985). We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude that the district court\u2019s finding of no malice or wanton disregard is not clearly erroneous. Since this conclusion precludes the recovery of punitive damages under any circumstances, we have no need to and expressly decline to reach the underlying question of whether punitive damages may ever be recovered in an ERISA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-16\">We have examined all other contentions advanced by the parties and conclude they are without merit. Thus, we affirm the well-reasoned decision of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir.R. 14.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
