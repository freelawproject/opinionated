We affirm the decisions of the Board because we agree that an award of attorney fees in this case is not warranted in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-25\">Petitioner was an air traffic control specialist with the Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), at Standiford Field in Louisville, Kentucky. On August 3, 1981 the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) voted to strike. Petitioner attended the strike vote and was absent without leave from work that day. On August 4, 1981<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he contacted Congressman Gene Snyder (of petitioner\u2019s district) and informed him that, along with others, he wanted to return to work but was afraid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>to cross the picket line. The next day Snyder telephoned Tim Cole, a congressional aide with the DOT\u2019s Office of Congressional Relations and told him of the group\u2019s desire to return to work. Cole requested a list of names from Snyder and indicated that the group could be reinstated after a security check was performed to verify strike non-participation. Petitioner\u2019s deadline for returning to work, in accordance with the President\u2019s amnesty period, was August 6, 1981. On August 7, 1981 petitioner delivered the list of names to Snyder who subsequently relayed the information to Cole. On the same day, Snyder also informed Jim Berry, Tower Chief at Standi-ford Field and the agency's deciding official in this case, that the group wanted to return to work. Snyder did not, however, inform Berry of his contacts with Cole in the DOT\u2019s Washington office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">On August 10, 1981 Berry issued petitioner a proposed notice of removal because he failed to (1) meet his August 6 return-to-work deadline and (2) contact the agency to explain his absence. During his oral reply to Berry, petitioner informed him of the contacts with Snyder but did not specifically state that an agreement existed between Snyder and Cole (or the agency).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">Petitioner\u2019s removal became final on August 30,1981. On appeal to the MSPB, the presiding official reversed the agency\u2019s decision to remove Wise. The basis of the presiding official\u2019s determination was a letter from Congressman Snyder to the chief appeals officer of the Board\u2019s Atlanta Regional Office describing Snyder\u2019s efforts on behalf of petitioner and the other controllers. On the strength of Snyder\u2019s representations, the presiding official found that, although Wise- had initially participated in the strike, he had attempted through his contacts with the DOT to meet his deadline and return to work. Petitioner\u2019s subsequent motion for attorney fees, as a prevailing party, was denied in an addendum decision. The full Board de-dined review although it agreed that Wise was the prevailing party. The only question before us is whether an award of attorney fees to him \u201cis warranted in the interest of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">Petitioner contends that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice because (1) the FAA \u201cknew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding\u201d and (2) he is \u201csubstantially innocent of the charges\u201d brought by the FAA. The first argument is premised on the fact that the deciding official was aware that Snyder was working with the DOT to arrange for his return to work and should have further investigated the matter. In addition, petitioner urges that he was substantially innocent of the charges brought against him because the evidence before the Board clearly showed that he did not participate in the PATCO strike and in fact attempted to return to work prior to the strike deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-10\">Respondent asserts that the agency neither knew nor should have known that it would not prevail on the merits because petitioner failed to provide the agency with sufficient information that would trigger the agency\u2019s duty to investigate further the merits of the removal action. Similarly, respondent contends that petitioner was not substantially innocent of the charges brought against him because the agency had a reasonable basis for the removal action since petitioner both participated in the strike and withheld important exculpatory evidence from the agency\u2019s deciding official.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) (1982), states that the MSPB <em>\u201cmay </em>require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by any employee ... if the employee ... is the prevailing party and the Board ... determines that payment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>warranted in the interest of justice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See also </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.-37(a) (1985). It is established that there are two prerequisites that must be fulfilled before the Board will award attorney fees. <em>Sterner v. Department of the Army, </em>711 F.2d 1563, 1566 (Fed.Cir.1983). Petitioner must show that he was the prevailing party and that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">The MSPB has set forth the following guidelines to aid in determining whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-6\">1. Where the agency engaged in a \u201cprohibited personnel practice\u201d (\u00a7 7701(g)(1));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-7\">2. Where the agency\u2019s action was \u201cclearly without merit\u201d (\u00a7 7701(g)(1)), or was \u201cwholly unfounded,\u201d or the employee is \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d of the charges brought by the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-9\">3. Where the agency initiated the action against the employee in \u201cbad faith,\u201d including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-10\">a. Where the agency\u2019s action was brought to \u201charass\u201d the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-12\">b. Where the agency\u2019s action was brought to \u201cexert improper pressure on the employee to act in certain ways\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-14\">4. Where the agency committed a \u201cgross procedural error\u201d which \u201cprolonged the proceeding\u201d or \u201cseverely prejudiced\u201d the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-16\">5. Where the agency \u201cknew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits\u201d when it brought the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-17\"><em>Allen v. United States Postal Service, </em>2 MSPB 582, 593, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 434 (1980) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-19\">The MSPB, in <em>Allen, </em>emphasized that the list was not exhaustive, but illustrative and \u201cshould serve primarily as directional markers toward \u2018the interest of justice\u2019 \u2014 a determination which, at best, can only be approximate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioner backs up his request for attorney fees by focusing on category 2 and category 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-20\">The whole theory behind category 2\u2019s \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d concept is that an individual who is substantially innocent of the charges brought against him, and nevertheless has a case brought against him, but is ultimately vindicated by the Board, is entitled to attorney fees in the interest of justice. In <em>Allen, </em>the MSPB conducted a thorough review of the legislative history of the \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d concept as embodied in the Civil Service Reform Act and discerned that the Congress was troubled with the inherent injustice of dragging an innocent individual through expensive and time-consuming legal proceedings. <em>Allen, 2 </em>MSPB at 598, 2 M.S.P.R. at 430.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-21\">Category 5 suggests that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice if the agency \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that it would not prevail on the merits. Under this category, the Board must \u201cappraise the agency\u2019s decision to carry through the action against the employee. If the agency was <em>negligent </em>in its conduct of the investigation then the agency \u2018knew or should have known\u2019 not to take the action.\u201d <em>Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>746 F.2d 1454, 1457 (Fed.Cir.1984) (emphasis added). However, \u201c[t]he fact that the presiding official [of the MSPB] later found that the charge was not supported by a preponderance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>evidence does not establish that it was negligently brought or was clearly without merit.\u201d <em>Batchelder v. Department of the Treasury, </em>12 MSPB 227, 228, 14 M.S.P.R. 37, 39 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Of course, the Board has considerable discretion in determining whether an award is warranted in the interest of justice. This court can only set aside Board decisions that are arbitrary, capricious, contrary to the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (1982). <em>See, e.g., Sterner, </em>711 F.2d at 1568.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">The presiding official specifically found here that petitioner participated in the PATCO strike and failed to report to his scheduled shift during the amnesty period. That official also found, however, that petitioner did attempt to return to work prior to the amnesty deadline through contacts with Congressman Snyder and the DOT. In any case, it is undisputed that the critical information contained in the letter from Snyder to the chief appeals officer of the Board\u2019s Regional Office \u2014 upon which the presiding official based his conclusion reversing the decision of the deciding official to remove petitioner \u2014 was known to petitioner at the time of his appearance before the agency\u2019s deciding official. Petitioner deliberately withheld this information from the deciding official and only released it after his appeal to the MSPB, <em>i.e., </em>at his hearing before the Board\u2019s presiding official.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">It is implicit in the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act and the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Allen </em>that the \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d standard is not satisfied by an individual such as petitioner who (1) knows that he is substantially innocent of the charges brought against him, (2) can prove his substantial innocence, and (3) deliberately does not communicate all the facts to the deciding official which would lead the deciding official to rule against the removal action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such an individual brings the consequences of the agency\u2019s legal proceedings upon himself and is in no way an innocent victim who is entitled to the award of attorney fees in the interest of justice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">As for petitioner\u2019s argument that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits, we do not find arbitrary or capricious the presiding official\u2019s conclusion that it was not unreasonable for the deciding official to remove petitioner based on the charges and the information available to him <em>at that time. </em>Although the deciding official was aware of the fact that petitioner had a conversation with Snyder, he did not know that Snyder had an \u201cagreement\u201d with Cole or even a conversation with him \u2014 information that petitioner should have communicated to the deciding official. If Wise, in this instance, had brought to the attention of Berry (the agency\u2019s deciding official) the arrangement between Congressman Snyder and DOT\u2019s Cole, it is highly likely that the agency would not have effected the removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">Furthermore, petitioner\u2019s reliance upon <em>Steger v. Defense Invest. Service, </em>717 F.2d 1402 (D.C.Cir.1983), for the proposition that the deciding official was negligent in failing to investigate exonerating evidence is misplaced. In <em>Steger, </em>the employee \u2014 at his oral reply before the deciding official\u2014 presented eleven written and signed statements that completely rebutted the charges contained in the two affidavits upon which his removal was based. In this case, however, petitioner deliberately withheld significant evidence from the deciding official. The agency decision not to investigate further the merits of the charge was not negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>gent because petitioner failed to present DOT with the appropriate information which could have triggered a further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">In sum, we hold that the decision of the Board denying petitioner\u2019s request for attorney fees is not arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. Attorney fees are not warranted in the interest of justice when the administrative process is deliberately and improperly drawn out by the actions of the prevailing party himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1083-18\">.
