Boomgarden appeals from the district court\u2019s decision affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, which lifted the automatic stay as to the creditor, Five Avco Financial Services, Inc. (Avco).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-18\">\n<em>Procedural History:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-19\">Leslie Boomgarden and his wife Barbara own the beneficial interest in Land Trust 9471 of the First Bank of Oak Park. This land trust secures the Boomgardens\u2019 principal residence at 1931 Dean Street in Des Plaines, Illinois. Avco made loans to Boomgarden, and it accepted an assignment of the beneficial interest as collateral. The Boomgardens previously had a purchase money mortgage on their home from Clyde Savings and Loan Association, which Avco subsequently acquired from Clyde. In July 1984, when Boomgarden was nine months late in making payments on the loan secured by the land trust, Avco scheduled a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) sale of the beneficial interest. Barbara Boomgarden filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on July 10, 1984, three days before the sale. This filing triggered the automatic stay provision of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a), and thus prevented Avco from holding the sale. On September 5, 1984, Bankruptcy Judge McCormick lifted the stay. Barbara Boom-garden never attempted to appeal or vacate this order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Avco planned a second UCC sale of the beneficial interest for October 10, 1984, but Leslie Boomgarden filed a Chapter 13 petition on October 5, 1984, thus invoking the automatic stay again. When Avco presented an emergency motion to modify the stay on October 9, 1984, Judge McCormick again cancelled the sale and set a hearing for November 7,1984. At this hearing, the bankruptcy court lifted the stay against Avco, and it refused Boomgarden\u2019s request for an \u201cevidentiary hearing\u201d on Avco\u2019s motion. Two months later, on January 5, 1985, Boomgarden\u2019s Chapter 13 plan was confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Boomgarden appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order to the district court, and on April 26, 1985, Judge Moran affirmed the court\u2019s decision to lift the automatic stay. He subsequently denied Boomgarden\u2019s motion for a rehearing on May 21, 1985, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Because \u201conly final orders by the district courts in bankruptcy cases are appealable to the courts of appeals,\u201d <em>In re Fox, </em>762 F.2d 54, 55 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Goldblatt Bros., Inc., </em>758 F.2d 1248, 1249 (7th Cir.1985); <em>In re Riggsby, </em>745 F.2d 1153, 1155 (7th Cir.1984); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b), we must first determine whether we properly have jurisdiction of this case. <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976); <em>In re Cash Currency Exchange, Inc., </em>762 F.2d 542, 545 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">This court and others have held that a district court\u2019s decision on an appeal from a bankruptcy court\u2019s interlocutory order generally is not a final order for purposes of further appellate review under section 1293(b). <em>In re Riggsby, </em>745 F.2d at 1154; <em>In re Tidewater Group, Inc., </em>734 F.2d 794 (11th Cir.1984); <em>In re Comer, </em>716 F.2d 168 (3d Cir.1983). And a district court\u2019s decision on an appeal from a bankruptcy court\u2019s final order will be reviewed only if it also is final. <em>Riggsby, </em>745 F.2d at 1155. Thus, an order by the district court remanding the case to the bankruptcy court for further significant proceedings will not be automatically and immediately appeala-ble to this court, provided the order may be effectively reviewed on appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s \u201cfinal final\u201d decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">\u201cA \u2018final decision\u2019 generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945). While the courts do not treat the finality requirement lightly, they recognize some special exceptions to the requirement, generally so as to avoid causing serious harm by delaying the appeal. <em>See, e.g., Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., </em>379 U.S. 148, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964) (\u201cdanger of denying justice by delay\u201d outweighed \u201cinconvenience and costs of piecemeal reviews.\u201d); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) (collateral order doctrine); <em>Forgay v. Conrad, </em>47 U.S. (6 How.) 201, 12 L.Ed. 404 (1848) <em>(For-gay-Conrad </em>rule, order treated as final if it directs delivery of property and irreparable harm would result if appeal delayed).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Under the recently enacted Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub.L.No. 98-353, 98 Stat. 333 (July 10, 1984), Boomgarden was allowed to appeal the bankruptcy judge\u2019s lifting of the automatic stay provided the lifting was a final decision by the bankruptcy judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157(b)(2)(B) and 158(a), added in 1984; <em>In re UNR Industries, Inc., </em>725 F.2d 1111, 1116 (7th Cir.1984). Even if it was not a final decision by the bankruptcy judge, the district court could still review it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a), which gives the court discretion to hear interlocutory appeals from the bankruptcy court. Yet the district court\u2019s decision would not necessarily be a final order for purposes of a subsequent appeal to this court. <em>See In re Tidewater Group, Inc., </em>734 F.2d 794 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">We believe that the bankruptcy court\u2019s lifting of the automatic stay here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>which permitted Avco to proceed with its UCC sale of the beneficial interest covering Boomgarden\u2019s real estate, is a final order. While the proceedings before the bankruptcy court were summary in nature, the district court did not remand the case to the bankruptcy judge for significant further proceedings. <em>See In re Fox, </em>762 F.2d 54, 55 (7th Cir.1985) (remand not final unless only a ministerial task remains to be done).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In holding that we properly have jurisdiction of this case, we adopt the reasoning of the court in <em>In re American Mariner Industries, </em>734 F.2d 426, 429 (9th Cir.1984). <em>See also In re Regency Woods Apartments, </em>686 F.2d 899, 902 (11th Cir.1984). In <em>In re American Mariner Industries, </em>the court questioned whether a decision which affirms an order that denies relief from an automatic stay is final for the purpose of appellate jurisdiction. After examining the provisions of the bankruptcy case for expedited and ex parte proceedings in complaints for relief from the automatic stay, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(e), the court concluded that Congress intended the courts to adjudicate conclusively and expeditiously, apart from the bankruptcy proceedings as available, complaints for relief from the automatic stay. Therefore, the court held that decisions of the bankruptcy courts granting or denying relief from the automatic stay under section 362(d) are final decisions. <em>In re American Mariner Industries, </em>734 F.2d at 429. We similarly hold that the bankruptcy court\u2019s lifting of the automatic stay as to Boomgarden\u2019s beneficial interest was a final decision for the purposes of appellate review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b) (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">A second threshold issue involves this court\u2019s standard of review. We must accept the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re X-Cel, Inc., </em>776 F.2d 130, 131 (7th Cir.1985); <em>In re Hellums, </em>772 F.2d 379, 381 (7th Cir.1985); <em>In re Kimzey, </em>761 F.2d 421, 423 (7th Cir.1985); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). We can, however, apply <em>de novo </em>review to conclusions of law of any lower court. <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 287, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1789, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982); <em>In re Tynan, </em>773 F.2d 177, 178 (7th Cir.1985); <em>In re Evanston Motor Co., </em>735 F.2d 1029, 1031 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Because 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d) commits the decision of whether to lift the stay to the discretion of the bankruptcy judge, his decision may be overturned only upon a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>In re Holtkamp, </em>669 F.2d 505, 507 (7th Cir.1982). In reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s lifting of the stay, we thus need to consider the two major issues on appeal: (1) whether Boomgarden\u2019s due process rights were violated by the bankruptcy judge\u2019s purported failure to provide appellant with an adequate hearing prior to lifting the automatic stay; and (2) whether the decision of the bankruptcy court was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">It is well-recognized that procedural due process requires adequate notice and a hearing before an individual may be deprived of his or her property. <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 558, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2975, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). <em>See also Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972) (action challenging replevin statutes); <em>Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337, 339, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 1821, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969) (state prejudgment garnishment procedure held unconstitutional). Due process considerations also apply in the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction. <em>In re Smith Corset </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number><em>Shops, </em>696 F.2d 971, 976 (1st Cir.1982) (citing <em>Bank of Marin v. England, </em>385 U.S. 99, 102, 87 S.Ct. 274, 276, 17 L.Ed.2d 197 (1966)). <em>See also Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust, </em>339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). In bankruptcy proceedings, both debtors and creditors have a constitutional right to be heard on their claims, and \u201cthe denial of that right to them [is] the denial of due process which is never harmless error.\u201d <em>Republic National Bank v. Crippen, </em>224 F.2d 565, 566 (5th Cir.1955) (quoting <em>Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company, </em>227 U.S. 88, 91, 33 S.Ct. 185, 186, 57 L.Ed. 431 (1913)). At the November 7, 1984, hearing, the bankruptcy court denied Boomgarden the opportunity to have his \u201cPetition for a Declaration of the Rights of the Debtor\u201d set down for an evidentiary hearing. The district court held that Boomgarden was given adequate opportunity to present his case. Boomgarden now claims that the bankruptcy court\u2019s refusal failed to afford him his due process right for a full, fair, and adequate hearing before the automatic stay could be lifted. Avco replies first that where an automatic stay is modified, neither 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d) nor \u00a7 362(e) require that a bankruptcy court first hold a <em>preliminary </em>hearing. And second, Avco asserts that the district court was correct in holding that the type of hearing requested by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d) depends on the particular circumstances of each case. Since the provisions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362 <em>et seq. </em>apply to Chapter 13 proceedings, <em>In re Zellmer, </em>6 B.R. 497, 499 (N.D.Ill.1980), we need to determine whether these statutes aid Boomgarden\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Once Avco attempted to lift the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d), the hearing requirements of \u00a7 362(e)' became effective immediately. Since an analysis of \u00a7 362(d) involves the substantive question of the merits of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, we shall reserve discussion of this section, until Part IV, <em>infra. </em>Boomgarden contends that once a creditor moves to lift a stay, \u00a7 362(e) requires a preliminary hearing within thirty days after the request or the stay is automatically lifted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">The statute on its face seems to give bankruptcy courts the option of holding either a preliminary or a final hearing: \u201cA hearing under this subsection may be a preliminary hearing, or may be consolidated with the final hearing under subsection (d) of this section.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(e). Boomgarden urges that Congress never intended that the bankruptcy court should have the discretion of choosing whether to have a final hearing but cites no cases in support of his contention. His interpretation flies in the face of contrary authority which states that \u00a7 362(e) permits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">\u201cthe court the option of either holding a prompt final hearing which would have to be concluded and the order entered within thirty days of the filing of the request or treating the first hearing as a preliminary hearing. If the later option is chosen, the court may continue the stay only if a finding is made that there is a reasonable likelihood that the party opposing relief will prevail at the final hearing____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">2 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>pp. 302-56, 57 (15th ed. 1985). We hold that the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>behind enacting subsection (e) is persuasive in interpreting the amended provision. The rationale behind \u00a7 362(e) was to provide more protection for secured creditors. It permitted a court to make a preliminary ruling after a preliminary hearing, after which a court could continue the stay only if there was a reasonable likelihood that the party opposing relief from the stay would prevail at a final hearing. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 344 (1983), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 5787. We disagree with Boomgar-den\u2019s assertion that the choice of whether to consolidate the preliminary and final hearings into one hearing lies with the parties. Rather, the bankruptcy court here apparently considered the November 7, 1984, hearing as a final hearing in Avco\u2019s motion to lift the stay, thus asserting its statutory option. We agree with the district court that \u201c[t]he November 7, 1984, hearing was far from the initial and only proceeding in this case.\u201d It was actually the third hearing afforded Boomgarden.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Moreover, we accept the district court\u2019s interpretation of what type of hearing is required under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d). The statutory definition of the \u201cafter notice and hearing\u201d provision of \u00a7 362(d) is found in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(1)(A), which states that the provision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">\u201cmeans after such notice as is appropriate in the particular circumstance, and after such opportunity for a hearing as is appropriate in the particular circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(1)(A). The record of the proceedings at the bankruptcy court adds support to Avco\u2019s claim that Boomgarden was afforded his full and fair opportunity to be heard. The court heard arguments from both parties on September 5, October 9, and November 7, 1984, when it covered all of the important substantive provisions of \u00a7 362(d). <em>See </em>Part IV <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The district court reviewed the facts and concluded that Boomgarden's due process rights were not violated. We agree that under the circumstances, Boomgarden had an adequate opportunity to present his arguments at a full and fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Before we pass on the merits of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, we must first determine our proper scope of review. Boomgarden contends that the bankruptcy court failed to decide correctly the issue of lifting the stay based upon the pleadings and representations of counsel in court. He first claims that his situation is an exceptional case or particular circumstance which should prompt this court to consider questions not \u201cpressed nor passed upon\u201d by the bankruptcy court below. <em>Hormel v. Helvering, </em>312 U.S. 552, 557, 61 S.Ct. 719, 721, 85 L.Ed. 1037 (1971). Second, he asserts that the district court \u201copened the door\u201d to appellate review when it addressed the merits of its order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And third, he summarily maintains that \u201cthe case was decided on the merits, that it was reviewed on the merits, and that it can be decided on the merits at the Court of Appeals.\u201d Avco responds by merely stating that Boomgar-den has failed to demonstrate why this case meets the exceptional standards in <em>Hormel, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Boomgarden moved for a rehearing of the district court\u2019s lifting of the automatic stay. In the earlier proceedings, the parties failed to focus on the merits of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. Instead, the substance of the court\u2019s decision was dealt with superficially by the parties in reference to the dispute over the adequacy of the hearing. In its memorandum and order of May 21, 1985, the district court alleged that the decision on the merits was not properly raised on appeal, stating, \u201cWhile not conceding the adequacy of the hearing issue, appellant now attempts to challenge the substance of the bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision.\u201d In both of its memoranda, the district court reviewed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, ultimately holding that the bankruptcy court sufficiently developed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>and reviewed the record before making its November 7, 1984, decision. While \u201c[i]t is well settled that a litigant may not seek reversal by this [cjourt on a ground not presented to the district court for consideration,\u201d <em>Davis v. Ball Memorial Hospital Association, Inc., </em>753 F.2d 1410, 1419 (7th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>King v. Stevenson, </em>445 F.2d 565, 570-71 (7th Cir.1971)), the district court did address the merits of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, and thus we may properly review <em>de novo </em>the conclusions of law of both courts. <em>Pullman-Standard, </em>456 U.S. at 287, 102 S.Ct. at 1789; <em>In re Tynan, </em>773 F.2d at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Bankruptcy courts impose automatic stays to preserve the remainder of the debtor\u2019s estate as well as to provide an equitable liquidation procedure for the creditors. <em>In re Holtkamp, </em>669 F.2d at 508. These stays may be modified according to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An automatic stay may be lifted for cause, including a lack of adequate protection of a creditor\u2019s security interest. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d)(1). In addition, a stay may be vacated if the debtor has no equity in the property and if the property is not necessary to reorganize effectively the debtor\u2019s estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d)(2). Moreover, in the instant case, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(g),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Avco had the burden of proving the lack of Boomgarden\u2019s equity in the property, while Boomgarden had the burden of proof on all other issues. <em>See In re Simmons, </em>23 B.R. 364, 366 (N.D.Ill.1982); <em>In re Chatman, </em>23 B.R. 176 (N.D.Ill.1982). If Boomgarden failed to introduce competent evidence to show that Avco was adequately protected in its interest in the Boomgarden property, the stay should have been lifted. <em>In re Monroe Park, </em>17 B.R. 934, 940 (C.D.Del.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">The district court carefully reviewed the proceedings below. It held that in the October 9, 1984, hearing, Boomgarden failed to address (1) whether Avco\u2019s interest in the property was not adequately protected; (2) whether the property was necessary to an effective reorganization; and (3) whether Avco proved that Boom-garden lacked equity in the property. Furthermore, in its review of the November 7, 1984, hearing, the court held that the bankruptcy judge lifted the stay because Boom-garden had failed to meet its burden of proving that Avco\u2019s interest in the property was adequately protected. We now turn to a consideration of the issues under \u00a7 362(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-13\">A. <em>Adequate Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">At the November 7,1984, hearing, Boom-garden claimed that Avco was adequately protected by Boomgarden\u2019s willingness to make payments. The bankruptcy court noted that Boomgarden had a limited disposable income, faced substantial overdue and unpaid debts, had no equity in the property, at least in a bankruptcy sense, and was not paying any insurance or real estate taxes. The court determined that it was highly improbable that Boomgarden could \u201ccatch up on his arrearage\u201d with his limited income, and it found that Avco was not adequately protected. Now, on appeal, Boomgarden argues in a conclusory fash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ion that Avco is adequately protected since a Chapter 13 plan was subsequently confirmed. But this plan was confirmed <em>after </em>the bankruptcy court\u2019s hearing, and it thus has no bearing on the merits of that court\u2019s decision. \u201cWhile a common misperception is that adequate protection is lacking if the value of the collateral is substantially less than the claim,\u201d <em>In re Ausherman, </em>34 B.R. 393, 394 (N.D.Ill.1983),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we agree with the district court\u2019s holding that on the basis of the evidence presented at the November 7, 1984, hearing, the bankruptcy judge correctly concluded that Avco\u2019s interest in the property was not adequately protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">B. <em>Lack of Equity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">At the November 7,1984, hearing, Boom-garden failed to demonstrate that he had any equity in the property. This was Avco\u2019s burden to prove. <em>In re Bruce, </em>40 B. R. 884, 888 (W.D.Va.1984). Boomgarden now claims that equity is not needed in all cases to establish adequate protection. This may be so in cases where certain other factors are present. <em>In the Matter of Schaller, </em>27 B.R. 959, 962 (W.D.Wis.1983). But because none of these factors are met, <em>see, e.g., In re Alyucan Interstate Corp., </em>12 B.R. 803, 809 (D.Utah 1981) (equity cushion); <em>In re Trident, </em>19 B.R. 956, 958 (E.D.Pa.1982) (payments under plan tendered), and because Boomgarden failed to rebut Avco\u2019s proof of a lack of equity, <em>see supra </em>note 7, the bankruptcy court\u2019s holding will stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">C. <em>Effective Reorganization</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">The final element that Boomgarden was required to prove in conjunction with the adequate protection factor was that his property was necessary to an effective reorganization. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d)(2). One of the primary reasons for filing a Chapter 13 petition is to preserve a residence from foreclosure. <em>In re Bruce, </em>40 B.R. at 888. This undoubtedly is an important policy aspect of the Chapter 13 schedule. The district court held that the bankruptcy judge correctly found that Boomgarden failed to sustain proof of this issue. On appeal, Boomgarden has presented no arguments which would require overruling the district court\u2019s conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">Boomgarden has failed to convince this court that he was denied due process of law and that the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision was incorrectly decided on the merits. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order lifting the automatic stay is</p>\n<p id=\"b750-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-11\">.
