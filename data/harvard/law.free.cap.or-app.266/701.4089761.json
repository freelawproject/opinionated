We reject without written discussion all of defendant\u2019s contentions except for his argument that the trial court erred in imposing attorney fees. With respect to that assertion, the state concedes that, \u201cbecause the record contains no information that defendant could repay attorney fees, * * * the trial court erred by requiring him to pay them.\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State v. Pendergrapht, </em>251 Or App 630, 284 P3d 573 (2012) (holding that it is error to impose attorney fees where the record does not support the defendant\u2019s ability to pay those fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Attorney fee award reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
