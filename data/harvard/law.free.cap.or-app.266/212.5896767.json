We reverse and remand with respect to that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Less than a year after defendant\u2019s trial, we held that a defendant charged with first-degree sexual abuse is entitled to a jury instruction that the state must prove that the defendant knowingly used forcible compulsion in committing the crime. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>241 Or App 681, 688, 251 P3d 240 (2011), <em>rev dismissed as improvidently allowed, </em>354 Or 62 (2013) (\u201cAccordingly, a culpable mental state applies to the forcible compulsion element of those crimes, [including first-degree sexual abuse,] and the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted with the requisite mental state with respect to that element.\u201d). More recently, we concluded that a trial court\u2019s failure to give that jury instruction constituted plain error. <em>State v. Gray, </em>261 Or App 121, 130, 322 P3d 1094 (2014). We conclude that the same is true here, and, for the reasons stated in <em>Gray, </em>261 Or App at 131-32, we exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Conviction for first-degree sexual abuse reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\"> ORS 163.427(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree when that person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">\u201c(a) Subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\u201c(A) The victim is less than 14 years of age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">\u201c(B) The victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the actor[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-12\"> Defendant raises three other assignments of error, which we reject without discussion.
