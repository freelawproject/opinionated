For the reasons below, we agree with defendant and, accordingly, reverse and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Defendant called 9-1-1 and told the dispatcher to send a coroner and a police officer to a house on Barcelona Way. When emergency responders and deputy sheriffs arrived, they found the victim, defendant\u2019s mother, lying in her kitchen with a pool of blood around her head and a phone cord around her neck. Defendant remained outside the house with Deputy DuPont, who requested during their conversation that defendant go to the sheriffs office and talk to Detective Rau, the main detective assigned to the investigation. Defendant agreed but told DuPont, while looking at the house, that he \u201cwasn\u2019t talking about that.\u201d DuPont took defendant to the sheriffs office, where they talked for approximately 30 minutes until detectives Rau and Hays entered the interview room.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Rau informed defendant that they intended to apply for a warrant or to get consent to search the house and asked for defendant\u2019s consent. Defendant first replied that the house was not his. However, in response to questions, defendant said that he had been staying at the victim\u2019s house for the past several nights, and Rau said that he thought that defendant had the authority to consent to a search. Defendant reviewed and decided to sign a consent form for a search of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Rau then gave defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings and asked whether defendant wanted to talk. Defendant stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>that he did not want to talk and invoked his right to counsel. Defendant was then arrested and taken to a holding cell. Rau and Hays later returned to the holding cell, and Rau told defendant that they were going to charge him with murder. Defendant was later charged by indictment with intentional murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">At trial, defense counsel elicited testimony from Hays on cross-examination that he had not recorded the interactions with defendant at the sheriffs office but that technology had been available to do both audio and video recordings. During redirect, the prosecutor indicated that she had a matter for the court. With the jury out of the courtroom, the prosecutor argued that defendant\u2019s questioning of Hays had opened the door for the state to ask Hays why he had not recorded defendant at the sheriffs office, because the jury had been left with the impression, and the defense could argue, that Hays \u201cwillfully neglected\u201d to record defendant or that the detectives \u201ccouldn\u2019t do their job.\u201d Defense counsel responded that he had not opened the door and that the focus of his questioning was on the accuracy of what Hays remembered about defendant\u2019s reaction when he was told that he was being booked for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The trial court concluded that defense counsel had opened the door to an explanation by Hays regarding the lack of a recording but told counsel that it was going to limit the state\u2019s redirect on that subject to one question: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you videotape or record your conversation with the defendant when you went in to tell him he was under arrest?\u201d The court warned defense counsel that, if he argued to the jurors in closing argument that the detectives had the means but failed to use them to record defendant, it would allow the state to reopen its case and present evidence that defendant had invoked his right to remain silent. The court then directed Hays to state the response that he would be giving to that question. Apparently satisfied with that response, the court brought the jury back into the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The prosecutor then asked Hays why he had not recorded his interactions with defendant, eliciting an answer that the reason he had not done so was because defendant had invoked his right to remain silent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u201cQ Detective Hays, why didn\u2019t you use any of the videotape or other audio recording devices to record your interactions with the defendant at the Sheriffs Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">\u201cA [Defendant] declined to talk to us, so the interview never went any further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201cQ And when you went back in to inform him that he was under arrest, why didn\u2019t you record that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201cA When we went and had contact with him at the holding cell, it was to let him know that he was then going to be taken down to the jail and booked on the charge. It was simply a statement to let him know what was going on. We were not questioning him in any way. We were not trying to elicit an answer from him. We simply were letting him know what was happening next, and we were not expecting him to then ask us a question, or give any response whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201cWe also do not use recording devices to record people without their knowledge. I wouldn\u2019t go up and start talking to a subject with a recorder going without them knowing it was going on. So, we never had any intent of getting information from him, so there was no reason for us to record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Defendant did not object to the way the questioning occurred during redirect.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">As part of her closing argument, the prosecutor used a PowerPoint presentation, which corresponded with her oral argument to the jury. The prosecutor began her argument by outlining the elements of the offense and pointing out which elements were in dispute. The prosecutor then argued that the operative question in this case was \u201cdid the State prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant murdered [the victim?]\u201d At that point, the prosecutor displayed a PowerPoint slide that had defendant\u2019s photograph in the center of the slide with the word \u201cGUILTY\u201d in large red capital letters underneath it. That slide also included four phrases. The first phrase (\u201cOnly he has motive\u201d) was located directly above defendant\u2019s photograph at the twelve o\u2019clock position, with an arrow pointing down from that phrase to defendant\u2019s photograph. To each side of the photograph, the slide listed two other phrases (\u201cHis DNA on the murder weapon,\u201d and \u201cHis actions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>words at the scene of the crime\u201d), each with arrows pointing from the phrase to defendant\u2019s photograph. Finally, below defendant\u2019s photograph and the word \u201cGUILTY\u201d was the phrase, \u201cHis refusal to speak at the police station.\u201d Like the other phrases on the slide, an arrow pointed from that phrase to defendant\u2019s picture. However, the positioning of the phrase, \u201cHis refusal to speak at the police station,\u201d was such that the arrow not only pointed to defendant\u2019s picture, but also pointed directly to the word \u201cGUILTY\u201d that was located under the picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">As this \u201cGUILTY\u201d slide was on display, the prosecutor referenced it by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">\u201cI submit to you that the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant and nobody else, the defendant is the one who killed [the victim]. There are a lot of reasons why I group them into four main categories, and I\u2019ll discuss each in more depth as we turn through the evidence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The prosecutor then orally listed each category of evidence that she argued proved that defendant was guilty of murder, which corresponded with the phrases on the \u201cGUILTY\u201d slide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">\u201cNumber one, he and only he has the motivation to have killed this woman. He and only he, and the evidence shows that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">\u201cNumber two, his actions and words at the scene of the crime. The evidence surrounding his actions and words at the scene of the crime prove that he killed [the victim].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">\u201cNumber three, his refusal to speak at the police station with the detectives investigating this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">At that point, defense counsel objected, and the trial court sustained that objection. The prosecutor asked to approach, to which the court replied, \u201cYou may continue.\u201d The prosecutor continued by listing the fourth category of evidence, defendant\u2019s DNA on the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The prosecutor then proceeded to walk through each category of evidence individually. Beginning with the first category (\u201cOnly he has motive\u201d), the prosecutor displayed a version of the \u201cGUILTY\u201d slide that only contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>that phrase and the arrow pointing to defendant\u2019s photograph with the word \u201cGUILTY\u201d below it. She then displayed slides with bullet points summarizing the evidence of defendant\u2019s motive. After she was finished with that category of evidence, she followed the same process with the other categories, except that the other three phrases on the initial \u201cGUILTY\u201d slide were added back onto the slide as she reached each category.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In conjunction with the state\u2019s argument concerning the second category of evidence (defendant\u2019s actions and words at the scene), the prosecutor mentioned that defendant never asked the deputy \u201ca single question about his mother,\u201d which was also a factual highlight listed on a frame of the PowerPoint presentation. Defendant objected and moved to strike the comment, and the court sustained the objection and struck the state\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">When discussing the third category of evidence, which the prosecutor displayed on the PowerPoint presentation as \u201cHis refusal to speak at the police station,\u201d the prosecutor showed the jury a slide containing the following bulleted factual points, which the prosecutor argued in turn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u201cBrought in to Sheriffs Office for questioning</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201cHappily talking about skateboarding</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">\u201cDetectives come in -&gt; he is all about business</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">\u201cWon\u2019t even discuss how long has been in this house</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">\u201cRefuses to speak about what happened!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">Among other things, the prosecutor recounted that defendant\u2019s affect changed when Hays and Rau went into the interview room and told the jury that he would not \u201ceven discuss how long he\u2019s been in the residence\u201d and was not \u201cforthcoming\u201d with the detectives. Defendant objected, but the prosecutor went on to say that the \u201cfree flow of information\u201d stopped when Hays and Rau were asking defendant questions. Defendant objected again. The trial court overruled both objections. Shortly thereafter, defendant also objected to the PowerPoint presentation, and the trial court overruled that objection as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>All told, in three separate frames of the PowerPoint presentation, the jury saw \u201cHis refusal to speak at the police station\u201d with an arrow pointing to \u201cGUILTY.\u201d It is not apparent from the record how long each of the \u201cGUILTY\u201d frames remained visible to the jury, but it appears that the frame with the bulleted factual points concerning defendant\u2019s refusal to speak at the police station, including the last bullet point, \u201cRefuses to speak about what happened,\u201d was before the jury while the prosecutor argued all of the factual points listed on the frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">At the conclusion of the state\u2019s closing argument, the trial court invited closing argument from defendant. Defendant proceeded to argue, among other things, that the investigation was faulty. Defendant contended that detectives should have talked to the victim\u2019s former husband, defendant\u2019s father, because he was likely to know about the victim\u2019s social contacts and other information that could have been helpful, and to associates at the senior center that the victim frequented. Defendant also faulted the detectives for looking at only \u201cone week\u2019s worth of telephone records,\u201d incompletely analyzing the victim\u2019s computer, failing to review the victim\u2019s financial records, and otherwise undertaking an investigation that was too brief. Defendant also argued that the victim was depressed and it was \u201ca reasonable possibility\u201d that she had committed suicide while defendant was outside working on a bicycle. After defendant\u2019s closing, the court immediately invited rebuttal from the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Upon conclusion of closing arguments and after the jury was instructed and had retired to deliberate, defendant moved for a mistrial. He contended that the state\u2019s PowerPoint presentation and repetitive arguments about his refusal to speak to the detectives amounted to unconstitutional comment on his invocation of the right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The trial court denied the motion, noting that defendant had opened the door to the admission of the fact that he had not talked to the detectives. Defendant maintained his objection to the admission of that evidence, but argued that, even if it was admissible, there was a difference between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201cgetting that into evidence, and then arguing later that that means the defendant is guilty, which is clearly unconstitutional.\u201d The trial court disagreed with defense counsel that the prosecutor was arguing that defendant\u2019s silence indicated his guilt and reiterated that it was denying the motion. The jury found defendant guilty of murder, and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s ruling on his objection to the state\u2019s PowerPoint presentation, which he contends impermissibly commented on his right to remain silent. Whether a prosecutor improperly comments on a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent is a question of law that we review for legal error. <em>State v. Ragland, </em>210 Or App 182, 187, 149 P3d 1254 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Defendant argues that, even if his cross-examination of Hays opened the door to the admission of the fact that he had invoked his right to remain silent, the state was not allowed to argue that his silence was evidence of his guilt. Accordingly, he contends that the trial court erred when it overruled his objection to the state\u2019s PowerPoint presentation and that, because that error was prejudicial to his right to a fair trial, we must reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In response, the state concedes that \u201ccomponents of the PowerPoint presentation placed unnecessary emphasis on defendant\u2019s invocation\u201d but argues that defendant\u2019s claim on appeal fails because he \u201cdid not object to particular slides when shown,\u201d and therefore \u201cit is impossible to determine whether the slides were visible to jurors for more time than the flip of a switch.\u201d At oral argument before us, the state also argued that, despite the fact that some of the PowerPoint slides focused on defendant\u2019s refusal to speak to the police, the focus of the prosecutor\u2019s <em>oral </em>argument to the jury was on the change in defendant\u2019s behavior, not on the fact that he had invoked his right to remain silent. We agree with defendant that the trial court committed reversible error when it overruled his objection to the state\u2019s PowerPoint presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>A criminal defendant has a right to remain silent under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution, <em>State v. Wederski, </em>230 Or 57, 62, 368 P2d 393 (1962), and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 US 609, 615, 85 S Ct 1229, 14 L Ed 2d 106 (1965).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Oregon Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe Oregon Constitution does not permit a prosecutor to draw the jury\u2019s attention to a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent.\u201d <em>State v. Larson, </em>325 Or 15, 22, 933 P2d 958 (1997). Similarly, the United States Supreme Court has held that the federal constitution prohibits the prosecution from commenting on a defendant\u2019s invocation of his or her right to remain silent. <em>Griffin, </em>380 US at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In this case, the state concedes that portions of the PowerPoint presentation \u201cplaced unnecessary emphasis on defendant\u2019s invocation.\u201d We agree. The prosecution\u2019s PowerPoint presentation contained multiple slides that referenced defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent, including the three slides with the phrase, \u201cHis refusal to speak at the police station,\u201d and the one slide that states, \u201cRefuses to speak about what happened.\u201d The state does not argue that those references were permissible because defendant had earlier opened the door to evidence of his silence during his cross-examination of Hays. However, because it appears that the trial court may have ruled on defendant\u2019s objection to the PowerPoint presentation on that basis, we consider whether doing so was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">We have recognized that, while it is ordinarily improper for a prosecutor to comment on a defendant\u2019s silence, a \u201cprosecutor has the right * * * to reply to argument made by opposing counsel, and, in doing so, statements may be made which otherwise would be improper.\u201d <em>State v. Guritz, </em>134 Or App 262, 270, 894 P2d 1235, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 560 (1995); <em>see also State v. Miranda, </em>309 Or 121, 128, 786 P2d 155, <em>cert den, </em>498 US 879 (1990) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s own inquiry on direct examination into the contents of otherwise inadmissible statements opens the door to further inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>on cross-examination relating to those same statements.\u201d). However, a prosecutor\u2019s right to reply is limited and confines the prosecutor\u2019s response to evidence or argument that rebuts the impression created by the defendant. <em>See, e.g., Guritz, </em>134 Or App at 270 (concluding that the prosecutor was permitted to respond to defense counsel\u2019s comments about the inadequacy of the detective\u2019s investigation by telling the jury that the defendant had cut short the interview by invoking his right to remain silent).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Thus, even if a defendant opens the door to evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence, a prosecutor cannot argue that the defendant is guilty because he or she invoked the right to remain silent. <em>See United States v. Gant, </em>17 F3d 935, 941 (7th Cir 1994) (\u201c[T]he government may use [a] defendant\u2019s silence for the limited purpose of impeaching his testimony; it may not argue that the defendant\u2019s silence is inconsistent with his claim of innocence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Martinez-Larraga, </em>517 F3d 258, 268 (5th Cir 2008) (acknowledging that that circuit, as well as other courts, have continued to recognize the \u201copen the door\u201d exception to the rule against the prosecution commenting on a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence, \u201cwhile likewise recognizing that it does not permit the prosecution to argue that the jury should infer * * * [the defendant\u2019s] guilt directly from his post-arrest silence\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in <em>Martinez-Larraga)); State v. Hargrove, </em>48 Kan App 2d 522, 540, 293 P3d 787, 800 (2013) (\u201cThe exception allows a surgical rebuttal confined to countering a cultivated and deceptive depiction of the evidence rather than a wide open use of the defendant\u2019s silence to prove guilt \u2014 the vice <em>Doyle </em>[v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 US 610, 96 S Ct 2240, 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976)] intended to eliminate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In this case, assuming, without deciding, that defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Hays opened the door to evidence of his silence, the prosecutor was allowed only to use that evidence to rebut any misimpressions created by defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecutor could not argue that defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>refusal to speak to the police was evidence of his guilt\u2014 which is exactly what she did in her PowerPoint presentation. Therefore, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s silence in the PowerPoint presentation were improper and were not justified under the \u201copen the door\u201d exception to the rule against comments on a defendant\u2019s silence. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it overruled defendant\u2019s objection to the state\u2019s PowerPoint presentation. We next consider whether, as defendant contends, that was reversible error requiring a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The Oregon Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[t]here is no doubt that it is usually reversible error to admit evidence of the exercise by a defendant of the rights which the constitution gives him if it is done in a context whereupon inferences prejudicial to the defendant are likely to be drawn by the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Smallwood, </em>277 Or 503, 505-06, 561 P2d 600, <em>cert den, </em>434 US 849 (1977). Thus, \u201c[a] reference by a prosecutor or a witness to the fact that a defendant exercised a constitutional right, such as the right to remain silent, \u2018may prejudice the defendant\u2019s ability to have a fair trial if the jury is likely to infer that the defendant exercised the right because he or she was guilty of the charged offense.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Osorno, </em>264 Or App 742, 748, 333 P3d 1163 (2014) (quoting <em>State v. Veatch, </em>223 Or App 444, 455-56, 196 P3d 45 (2008)); <em>cf. Ragland, </em>210 Or App at 190 (explaining that \u201c[a] question or comment made in passing that touches on a defendant\u2019s exercise of Fifth Amendment rights does not necessarily require reversal\u201d in the absence of a prejudicial inference).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We have no trouble concluding that the jury in this case was likely to draw a prejudicial inference from the prosecutor\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s invocation in her PowerPoint presentation. The prosecutor\u2019s PowerPoint presentation expressly urged the jury to decide that defendant\u2019s refusal to speak to the police was one of the four reasons that he was guilty of murdering the victim. The state argues that we should not conclude that defendant was prejudiced because we cannot determine how long the \u201cGUILTY\u201d PowerPoint slides were in front of the jury. The record, however, demonstrates that the prosecutor used the PowerPoint presentation in conjunction with her oral argument, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tracked what was on the slides, and that at least three slides implied that defendant was guilty because he \u201crefus[ed] to speak at the police station.\u201d Those repeated references to defendant\u2019s silence and guilt during closing argument were not subtle, isolated, or fleeting. For the same reason, we reject the state\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s oral statements to the jury somehow detracted from the direct implication in the PowerPoint slides that defendant\u2019s refusal to speak indicated that he was guilty. We conclude that it is highly likely that the jury drew an adverse inference that defendant\u2019s refusal to speak to the detectives was evidence of his guilt. <em>Cf. State v. McClatchey, 259 </em>Or App 531, 541, 314 P3d 721 (2013) (concluding that the jury was unlikely to draw adverse inferences regarding the defendant\u2019s guilt from the officer\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s statement that he \u201c\u2018didn\u2019t want to say anything,\u201d\u2019 because, among other things, the reference to the defendant\u2019s statement was \u201cisolated\u201d and neither the prosecutor nor any witness referred to it again). Accordingly, the trial court erred when it failed to sustain defendant\u2019s objection to the PowerPoint presentation. Because defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was prejudiced, we reverse and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-9\"> We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s eighth assignment of error to the denial of his motion to suppress.
