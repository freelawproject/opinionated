Defendant appeals from a supplemental judgment in which the trial court imposed restitution totaling $2,674.76 for expenses incurred by the victim. On appeal, defendant contends that the state\u2019s evidence as to five items of restitution was insufficient to establish \u201ceconomic damages,\u201d as defined in ORS 31.710(2), and therefore provided an inadequate basis for a restitution award under ORS 137.106. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by any evidence in the record, and we review the court\u2019s legal conclusions for errors of law. <em>State v. Jordan, </em>249 Or App 93, 96, 274 P3d 289, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 103 (2012). If the trial court did not make express findings on a disputed point of fact, we presume that the court implicitly found the facts consistent with the judgment it entered. <em>See State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993) (\u201cIf findings of historical fact are not made on all pertinent issues and there is evidence from which such facts could be decided more than one way, we will presume that the facts were decided in a manner consistent with the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion.\u201d). Accordingly, we state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s explicit and implicit factual findings, which the record supports.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The victim obtained a permanent SPO against defendant, with whom she had no prior relationship, in 2010 after defendant \u201csought her out through her place of work and had waited for her outside of work.\u201d The SPO prohibited defendant from having contact with the victim, including by coming into her visual or physical presence or by waiting outside her home, property, work, or school. On July 2, 2012, defendant returned to the victim\u2019s place of work, where he approached her and asked in a \u201cdeep tone of voice\u201d if she \u201cmissed him.\u201d The victim reported the incident to police and reported that defendant also had come to her place of work on July 1, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The victim sought medical attention for \u201cmassive panic attacks\u201d that began about a week after defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>July 2012 SPO violations. She saw a physician nine times for treatment of those panic attacks and was prescribed medications as a result. According to the victim, her doctor explained that her panic attacks were the result of her having reached \u201ca breaking point\u201d at which she \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle it anymore.\u201d The victim missed 18 days of work, several of which were to attend her doctor\u2019s appointments. The victim also obtained counseling and group therapy. Her counselor recommended, as part of treatment, that she collect police reports about defendant\u2019s conduct from another city.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The victim also missed one day of work to facilitate having her locks changed at home. She testified at the restitution hearing that defendant had \u201cfound out [her] home address and [she] needed to change [her] locks,\u201d explaining further that she needed to have dead bolts installed. The victim also testified that she had rented a temporary residence \u201cuntil [she] could get [her] locks changed and make [her] home safe.\u201d She explained that she had been unable to stay with friends because \u201c[t]hey were fearful of the situation as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The victim also changed her phone number. In explanation of that action, she testified that she had received one phone call from defendant shortly after he visited her at work. On that call she could hear \u201cheavy breathing\u201d and defendant \u201ckept trying to ask [her] if [she] was okay\u201d and said that \u201che was sorry.\u201d She testified that \u201cdistrict attorneys, everybody had told me I might as well [change my phone number] because my personal information was let out.\u201d She also had received several \u201chang-up calls,\u201d which stopped once she changed her number.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Defendant was charged with four counts of violating a court\u2019s SPO and, as noted above, was convicted of two counts pursuant to a plea agreement. After hearing the victim testify to the facts described above and reviewing other evidence in the record, the trial court determined that the victim\u2019s expenses were the result of defendant\u2019s criminal activities and imposed $2,674.76 in restitution in a supplemental judgment:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>\u201cBut [the time taken off of work] seems to be related to this particular case because but for [defendant\u2019s] contact [the victim] wouldn\u2019t be having to do all the things that she testified that she had to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">\u201cAnd it\u2019s not our place to say that getting police reports are not * * * necessarily related to this case. But for [defendant\u2019s] conduct [the victim] felt she needed to get those police reports and do some things and put some things together for crime victim\u2019s comp and all those sorts of things that she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">\u201cSo I\u2019m certainly not going to second guess what she thought she needed to do. And I do find that it\u2019s related to the conduct of the defendant. So I would be granting those wages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">\u201cI am going to grant the $100 to change her number over. ***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">\u201cBut the actions of the defendant caused her to change phones and that\u2019s for certain, so I would be granting that $100 there, but not the [monthly fee for the new phone]. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">\u201cBut for defendant\u2019s conduct [the victim] wouldn\u2019t have thought that she needed to change her locks. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">\u201c*** So there was the $400 to stay at a safe house during the court proceedings. Again, it\u2019s not the Court\u2019s job to decide whether or not it was \u2014 I don\u2019t want to use the word proper, but if it was \u2014 well, I\u2019ll use it because I can\u2019t think of a better word right now \u2014 whether it was proper or not for her to stay at a safe house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">\u201cThe issue, I think, for the Court to decide is was her need to go to a safe house related to the defendant\u2019s conduct. We kind of take the victim as we find them as you might say, so I do find that it\u2019s related to defendant\u2019s conduct, [I] would order that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-14\">\u201cAnd the copies for the police reports, this $37, that\u2019s\u2014 she felt that she needed the police reports for various reasons and that\u2019s appropriate and I\u2019ll order that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>The only issue before us on appeal is whether the trial court erred by awarding restitution for certain expenses the victim incurred after the SPO violations. We begin our analysis by setting out the relevant statutes. ORS 137.106(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\">\u201cWhen a person is convicted of a crime *** that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, at the time of sentencing or within 90 days after entry of the judgment, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. * * * If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall enter a judgment or supplemental judgment requiring that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">For the purposes of that statute, \u201ceconomic damages\u201d is defined by ORS 31.710(2)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">\u201c\u2018Economic damages\u2019 means objectively verifiable monetary losses including but not limited to reasonable charges necessarily incurred for medical, hospital, nursing and rehabilitative services and other health care services, burial and memorial expenses, loss of income and past * * * impairment of earning capacity, reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for substitute domestic services, recurring loss to an estate, damage to reputation that is economically verifiable, reasonable and necessarily incurred costs due to loss of use of property and reasonable costs incurred for repair or for replacement of damaged property, whichever is less.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">In short, there are three prerequisites to an order of restitution: (1) criminal activities, (2) economic damages, and (3) a causal relationship between the two. <em>State v. Carson, </em>238 Or App 188, 192, 243 P3d 73 (2010) (citing <em>State v. Stephens, </em>183 Or App 392, 395, 52 P3d 1086 (2002)). \u201cCriminal activities\u201d means \u201cany offense with respect to which the defendant is convicted or any other criminal conduct admitted by the defendant.\u201d ORS 137.103(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>On appeal, defendant objects to five specific items of restitution: (1) the cost of changing the victim\u2019s phone number; (2) the cost of changing locks on the victim\u2019s home; (3) the cost of the victim renting a temporary residence; (4) the victim\u2019s lost wages from one day\u2019s work when she facilitated changing her locks; and (5) the cost of obtaining police records from a different incident in a different city. Defendant makes two main arguments. First, he argues that the contested costs did not constitute \u201ceconomic damages\u201d within the meaning of the restitution statutes. Defendant contends that the contested costs \u201cwere made in order to provide security against <em>future </em>crimes, not the crimes for which defendant was convicted,\u201d and therefore were not \u201creasonably and necessarily incurred.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Second, defendant argues that there is no \u201ccausal connection\u201d because \u201cthere is <em>no evidence </em>to connect the criminal acts at issue to the contested expenses.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As presented in this case, both of those arguments turn on one central question: whether defendant\u2019s criminal activity was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the expenses the victim incurred. <em>See State v. Ceballos, </em>235 Or App 208, 215, 230 P3d 954, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 669 (2010) (\u201cBut for the defendant\u2019s criminally negligent homicide of the decedent, [the victim] would not have been subjected to those expenses. [The victim] therefore * * * incurred economic damages.\u201d); <em>State v. Bullock, </em>135 Or App 303, 307, 899 P2d 709 (1995) (\u201cFor purposes of restitution, causation is met by applying a \u2018but for\u2019 standard.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Although defendant\u2019s criminal activities must be a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the victim\u2019s economic damages, the damages need not be the <em>direct </em>result of defendant\u2019s criminal activity. <em>Stephens, </em>183 Or App at 396; <em>see also Bullock, </em>135 Or App at 307 (concluding that contested expenses were not \u201ctoo remote to be considered the results of defendant\u2019s crime\u201d because \u201cemotional and psychological problems that required the victim\u2019s removal from the home were a natural consequence of defendant\u2019s criminal activities\u201d). For example, in <em>State v. Doty, </em>60 Or App 297, 653 P2d 276 (1982), a defendant was originally indicted for a burglary in which the victim claimed the loss of items that had a value of more than $3,000. The defendant eventually pleaded guilty to theft of items that had a value of less than $200, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>trial court imposed restitution of $2,000, based on the value of all the items stolen from the house. Although the defendant had admitted to kicking in the victim\u2019s door and stealing several items, he claimed that someone else must have taken the rest. We upheld the restitution award, explaining that the entire loss resulted from the defendant\u2019s criminal activities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">\u201cDefendant does not seriously dispute the loss of the missing items but denies having taken the jewelry himself. However, regardless of whether defendant actually stole the jewelry, the entire loss \u2018resulted\u2019 from his \u2018criminal activities,\u2019 including the admitted kicking in of the victim\u2019s door, because it at least created free access to the home for the hypothetical subsequent theft.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Similarly, in this case, we conclude that the record includes some evidence from which the trial court could find that the disputed expenses resulted from defendant\u2019s criminal activities. Defendant argues that he \u201cnever admitted to and was not convicted of calling [the victim] on her phone or going to [the victim\u2019s] home. In fact, the state did not present any evidence that defendant knew where [the victim] lived.\u201d Accordingly, defendant concludes, \u201cthe expenses for changing [the victim\u2019s] phone number and her house locks, including the costs for renting a temporary residence and taking time off work to facilitate changing the locks, were unrelated.\u201d That argument fails for two reasons. First, it is premised on an inaccurate description of the record. In fact, the state did present evidence that defendant knew where the victim lived. The victim testified at the restitution hearing that defendant \u201cfound out my home address\u201d and that the \u201cdistrict attorneys\u201d notified her that her \u201cpersonal information was let out.\u201d Second, defendant frames the analysis too narrowly. The pertinent inquiry is not whether defendant was convicted of calling the victim or going to her home, but rather whether the victim\u2019s need to change her phone number and locks <em>resulted </em>from the criminal activities on which defendant\u2019s convictions were based. The record includes evidence supporting that causal connection. It is undisputed that defendant\u2019s violations of the SPO caused the victim to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>suffer severe panic attacks and fear of defendant, and the victim testified that she changed her locks <em>because </em>defendant had learned her home address. Moreover, the record also supports an inference that the safety measures the victim took helped her manage the psychological trauma caused by defendant\u2019s crimes. In sum, the record establishes that defendant\u2019s criminal activity was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the expenses that the victim incurred. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in imposing restitution for the costs the victim incurred for changing her phone number and locks, including the costs of a temporary residence and lost time from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">In arguing to the contrary, defendant relies in part on <em>State v. Steckler, </em>236 Or App 524, 237 P3d 882 (2010), suggesting that it holds that expenses associated with preventing future crimes are necessarily unrelated to the crimes for which a defendant already has been convicted. But the <em>Steckler </em>holding is not so broad. In that case, a defendant was convicted of robbing two Rite Aid pharmacies. Under federal law, the pharmacies were required to submit forms to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) describing the security measures that the pharmacies were taking to prevent future thefts. One of the pharmacies\u2019 managers indicated that Rite Aid planned to install a surveillance system in that pharmacy; based on his conversations with other Rite Aid personnel, the manager \u201cbelieved that doing so would be the most cost-effective security measure that would satisfy the DEA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526. The trial court ordered restitution that included the expense of installing a surveillance system in that pharmacy. <em>Id. </em>at 527. We reversed that aspect of the restitution award. However, we did not do so because security measures taken to prevent future crimes are <em>per se </em>unrecoverable. Indeed, <em>Steckler </em>does not address under what circumstances restitution awards may include expenses related to the implementation of security measures which, necessarily, relate at least in part to the prevention of future crimes. Rather, we reversed because the state had proved only that the DEA required Rite Aid to complete a form stating what safety measures it planned to take; the state did not prove that the DEA had required the pharmacy \u201cto take any particular measures at all,\u201d much less install <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>a surveillance system. <em>Id. </em>at 529. Accordingly, we rejected the state\u2019s argument that the pharmacy would not have purchased the system but for the defendant\u2019s crime. Thus, <em>Steckler </em>differs from this case on a critical point \u2014 here, the record does include evidence that the victim would not have taken security measures but for defendant\u2019s repeated criminal violations of the SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Defendant also contends that the cost to obtain a police report from a different city \u201cdid not result from the acts at issue\u201d and therefore \u201cwas not causally connected to permit restitution for that expense.\u201d We disagree. The victim sought treatment for panic attacks brought on by defendant\u2019s criminal activities. The victim\u2019s counselor recommended, as part of treatment for those panic attacks, that \u201cit might be a good idea\u201d to collect a police report about defendant\u2019s conduct in another city. The testimony about the counselor\u2019s recommendation may not be weighty, but it is \u201csome evidence\u201d from which the trial court could have found that the expense resulted from defendant\u2019s criminal activities, and that is sufficient for purposes of our review. <em>Cf. Jordan, </em>249 Or App at 100 (affirming restitution award on the basis that \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record showed the necessity of naturopathic treatments and organic foods to treat a brain injury the victim suffered as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">To summarize, because evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the victim\u2019s economic damages resulted from defendant\u2019s criminal activities, we conclude that the trial court did not err in imposing restitution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\"> The trial court imposed restitution for several additional items that defendant does not challenge. Por purposes of this appeal, we focus our discussion on the challenged items.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> The statutory definition of \u201ceconomic damages\u201d also includes \u201cfuture impairment of earning capacity.\u201d ORS 31.710(2)(a). However, that aspect of the definition does not apply to restitution awarded under ORS 137.106(1). ORS 137.103(2)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
