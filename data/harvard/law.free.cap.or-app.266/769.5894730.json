J.</author>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">This case involves a dispute between the City of Astoria and the Clatsop County District Attorney<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> over the control of the prosecution of misdemeanor driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII) offenses committed within the city. The trial court denied the city\u2019s motion to dismiss the district attorney\u2019s complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and entered a judgment declaring the rights of the parties. Both parties appeal. The city assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of the city\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction because the district attorney had failed to join all necessary parties, as required by ORS 28.110. The city also contends that the trial court erred in ruling that \u201cthe district attorney is mandated to appear and prosecute criminal cases in the Astoria Municipal Court\u201d and \u201chas exclusive authority to control and direct the prosecution of DUIIs filed in the Astoria Municipal Court with authority to allow the city attorney to conduct those prosecutions.\u201d The district attorney cross-appeals, agreeing with the city that the trial court erred in declaring that the district attorney is required to \u201cattend and prosecute\u201d cases in the municipal court. We conclude that the trial court correctly denied the city\u2019s motion to dismiss; however, we agree with the city on the merits. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment in part and remand with instructions to enter judgment omitting those parts of the judgment challenged by the city and declaring the parties\u2019 rights in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The pertinent facts are undisputed. Plaintiff Joshua Marquis is the elected District Attorney of Clatsop County, Oregon; he has served in that position since 1994. Defendant City of Astoria is a home-rule city within Clatsop County; it was created in 1856 by a legislative charter from the territorial government and presently operates under a home-rule charter adopted in 1997. Among other things, the city charter authorizes the appointment of a municipal judge, Astoria City Charter \u00a7 3.6; provides that the municipal court \u201chas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>original jurisdiction over every offense that an ordinance of the City makes punishable,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5.3(5); and allows the city council to transfer functions of the municipal court to an appropriate state court, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5.3(8).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Astoria City Code section 6.005 adopts the provisions of the Oregon Vehicle Code, ORS chapters 801 to 826, and provides that \u201ca violation of a provision of those chapters is an offense against the city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\">Astoria Police Department Policy 323 directs Astoria police officers to cite most misdemeanor DUII offenses to Astoria Municipal Court for prosecution by the Astoria City Attorney. Specifically, the policy requires officers to cite to the municipal court \u201call violations of the Astoria Code, including violations of the Oregon Revised Statutes as adopted by the City, [a] 11 traffic infractions, all misdemeanor traffic crimes and all misdemeanor crimes with the exceptions noted below.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The district attorney first offered, and then directed, that all citations for state-law-based DUII offenses made by the Astoria Police Department be filed in Clatsop County Circuit Court for prosecution by the district attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The city did not yield to the district attorney\u2019s demand, and the district attorney filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. The complaint alleged facts surrounding the city\u2019s refusal to relinquish control of the prosecution of DUII cases arising within the city and requested a declaration that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-5\">\u201cas the public prosecutor of Clatsop County, [the district attorney] has the exclusive authority to direct and control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>the prosecution of all driving under the influence of intoxicants charges that arise within the [district attorney\u2019s] jurisdiction, including those driving under the influence of intoxicants charges, or any state-law criminal charges arising out of the same criminal episode, that originate within the City of Astoria.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">The city moved to dismiss the complaint, contending that (1) the district attorney is not the real party in interest, (2) the complaint failed to allege a justiciable controversy, and (3) the complaint failed to join necessary parties under ORS 28.110 \u2014 namely \u201cother cities that would be affected by the declarations requested in the complaint.\u201d The court denied the city\u2019s motion to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The parties proceeded to trial, after which the court issued a letter opinion concluding, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">\u201cIt is this court\u2019s opinion [that] the district attorney controls and directs prosecutions of DUIIs in all the courts in his county, and in this case, the City of Astoria. This would include all DUIIs filed under state statute or city ordinance. Further it is this court\u2019s opinion that the district attorney under ORS 221.339(5) can allow the prosecutions [to] be handled by the city attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">After skirmishes between the parties over the proposed form of judgment, the trial court ultimately entered a judgment declaring, as relevant to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">\u201c2. That under ORS 221.339, the Astoria Municipal Court has concurrent jurisdiction with Clatsop County Circuit Court over misdemeanors triable in the municipal court, including misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">\u201c3. That ORS 8.650 authorizes the District Attorney to attend and prosecute offenses of state statute and city ordinance if the circuit [court] could have had jurisdiction of the crimes chargeable under the city ordinance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-12\">\u201c4. That ORS 8.660 mandates that the District Attorney attend all courts in Clatsop County, including Astoria Municipal Court, and requires the District Attorney to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>conduct on behalf of the state all prosecutions of criminal cases;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-3\">\u201c5. That the District Attorney controls and directs prosecutions of DUIIs in all courts in Clatsop County, and, in this case the Astoria Municipal Court. This includes all DUIIs filed under state statute or city ordinance. Further the District Attorney may allow the prosecutions [to] be handled by the city attorney [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">(Some formatting altered.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Because it is jurisdictional, we first must address the city\u2019s contention \u2014 in its second assignment of error\u2014 that the trial court erred in denying the city\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction because the district attorney had failed to join all necessary parties under ORS 28.110. <em>See, e.g., Vance v. Ford, </em>187 Or App 412, 425, 67 P3d 412 (2003) (\u201cFailure to join a necessary party in a declaratory judgment action deprives the court of authority to render a judgment that binds that party; it is considered a jurisdictional defect.\u201d (Citing <em>Wright v. Hazen Investments, Inc., </em>293 Or 259, 264, 648 P2d 360 (1982).)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no dispute as to the relevant facts. We review for legal error the trial court\u2019s conclusion under ORS 28.110 on the joinder of necessary parties. <em>Sergeant\u2019s Towing, Inc. v. City of Portland, </em>173 Or App 359, 364-67, 22 P3d 237, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 558 (2001) (so reviewing). As explained below, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the city\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">ORS 28.110 provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">\u201cWhen declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The city\u2019s argument that ORS 28.110 has not been satisfied in this case is cursory. It argues that dismissal was required because \u201c[t]his judgment and its rationale will have an effect on which agency controls, and what government pays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>for, prosecutions in Clatsop County and across the state.\u201d It relies solely on <em>Smith v. Truck Insurance Exchange, Inc., </em>242 Or App 202, 255 P3d 615 (2011), and contends that the court erred in not dismissing the action because \u201c[r]elitigating this claim for other municipal courts creates a risk of a city-by-city procedural patchwork statewide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Noting that other cities in Clatsop County that have municipal courts already permit the district attorney to prosecute DUII offenses committed in those cities, the district attorney responds that \u201c[t]he declaration sought in this case involves <em>only </em>the district attorney\u2019s authority to direct and control the prosecution of DUIIs committed in the City of Astoria.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Thus, in its view, \u201c[t]he dispute is solely between the Clatsop County District Attorney and the City of Astoria\u201d and no other municipalities, either inside or outside of Clatsop County, have a direct interest in the outcome of the litigation for purposes of necessary-party status under ORS 28.110. We agree with the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\"><em>Sergeant\u2019s Towing </em>is instructive. In that case, four towing companies that contracted with the City of Portland to tow and store vehicles for the city brought a declaratory judgment action to determine whether they were required to pay a certain city fee. One of the issues on appeal was whether the trial court had erred in not dismissing the action under ORS 28.110 for failure to join as parties the other 30 towing companies that had towing contracts with the city. 173 Or App at 364. We concluded that the trial court had not erred, reasoning that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">\u201cdeclaration that the city could not collect the $15 fee from plaintiffs certainly could benefit the other 30 companies, because the city presumably would treat the declaration as one that applied to the collection of the fee from all towing companies, not just plaintiffs. However, a contrary declaration would not necessarily affect the other companies, <em>because they would not be bound by it and would be free to litigate the issue themselves if they chose!</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 364-65 (emphasis added). We held that the joinder principle under ORS 28.110 \u201crequires joinder <em>of </em>parties whose interests would be prejudiced by a declaratory ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>that is adverse to their interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366. In <em>Sergeant\u2019s Towing, </em>that principle was not established because, as we explained, a \u201cruling adverse to plaintiffs on their obligation to pay the $15 release fee might have an effect on any later proceeding by any of the other towing companies that sought to challenge payment of the fee, but it would not necessarily prevent the absent companies from establishing that they are not required to pay the fee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\">We also noted that in <em>Deras v. Myers, </em>272 Or 47, 535 P2d 541 (1975), where the plaintiff was a state legislative candidate who had sought a declaration that certain state statutes restricting political campaign expenditures were unconstitutional, the Supreme Court had not, on its own motion, dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds although \u201c[o]ther political candidates and citizens had interests equivalent to those of the plaintiff, and those interests could have been affected by the declaration in <em>Deras </em>in the same way that the interest of the absent towing companies could be affected by the declaration in this case.\u201d <em>Sergeant\u2019s Towing, </em>173 Or App at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The same is true here. The district attorney sought to have determined his own <em>authority </em>\u2014 vis-a-vis <em>that of the City of Astoria </em>\u2014 to direct and control the prosecution of state-law-based DUII offenses (and state-law criminal charges arising out of the same criminal episode) arising in that city.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That was the only dispute to be resolved by the declaratory-judgment action. As in <em>Deras, </em>the fact that resolution of the declaratory-judgment action may turn on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>interpretation of state statutes or the Oregon Constitution does not grant every entity that might be affected by that precedent in the future a direct interest in the present litigation such that they become necessary parties to the action under ORS 28.110. Thus, although other municipalities in the state might have an abstract interest in this litigation, they \u2014 like the towing companies in <em>Sergeant\u2019s </em>Towing\u2014 would not be bound by the court\u2019s declaration and \u201cwould be free to litigate the issue themselves if they chose.\u201d 173 Or App at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">The city argues that <em>Smith </em>counsels otherwise; however, that case is inapposite. In <em>Smith, </em>we held that the holder of an insurance policy was a necessary party in an action by a putative third-party beneficiary against an insurance company seeking a declaration that the putative beneficiary was covered by the policy. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that MD&amp;D [the policy holder], as a party to a contract of insurance, has an interest that would be affected by a declaration that a putative intended beneficiary is or is not covered under the policy. If, for example, defendants [the insurance companies] were to prevail on the declaratory judgment claim, MD&amp;D would be exposed to risk of liability to plaintiff for having loaned her an uninsured vehicle. Moreover, it is equally axiomatic that, in MD&amp;D\u2019s absence, a declaration in this case that the [vehicle] was not covered or that plaintiff was not a covered \u2019 occupant would expose defendants to the risk of successive litigation by MD&amp;D and an inconsistent adjudication in such an action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">242 Or App at 215. Thus, unlike the other municipalities here, the policy holder in <em>Smith </em>had more than an abstract interest in the litigation. As we recently reiterated in <em>State ex rel Dewberry v. Kulongoski, </em>220 Or App 345, 358, 187 P3d 220 (2008), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>346 Or 260, 210 P3d 884 (2009), the jurisdictional requirement of ORS 28.110 is designed, in part, \u201cto <em>protect the certainty of the judgment itself </em>from the effect of inconsistent adjudications resulting from subsequent or collateral litigation involving absent interested parties.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.) There is no risk of that here. In sum, the trial court did not err in denying the city\u2019s motion to dismiss on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>the ground that the complaint failed to join all necessary parties under ORS 28.110.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\">We turn to the heart of this dispute. In its first assignment of error, the city essentially challenges the declarations contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the declaratory judgment. Like the parties, we understand those paragraphs to have established that, under ORS 8.650, ORS 8.660, and ORS 221.339, the district attorney has authority to control and direct the prosecution of all misdemeanor DUII offenses in Clatsop County, including offenses under the Astoria City Code, and that the district attorney is required to attend and prosecute criminal offenses in Astoria Municipal Court, although the district attorney may <em>allow </em>them to be handled by the Astoria City Attorney. The city contends that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of ORS 8.650, ORS 8.660, and ORS 221.339 is incompatible with the history and context of those provisions and, therefore, that the trial court erred in entering declaratory judgment for the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">On appeal, the district attorney, predictably, contends that the trial court correctly declared that the district attorney has the authority to control and direct the prosecution of state-law-based misdemeanor DUII offenses committed in the City of Astoria.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Notably, the district attorney does not dispute (nor could it) that jurisdiction of such offenses \u201cwould be proper in either court, and both the district attorney and city attorney have statutory authority to undertake such prosecutions.\u201d Rather, relying on Article VII (Original), section 17, of the Oregon Constitution, ORS 8.650, and ORS 8.660(1), the district attorney argues that, in those circumstances, \u201cthe authority of the city attorney to prosecute offenses must yield to the authority of the district attorney to be the public prosecutor for all state-law offenses committed within his jurisdiction.\u201d As explained below, there is no legal support for that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The origins of ORS 8.650 and ORS 8.660 \u2014 the statutes that now govern the prosecutorial authority of the district attorney \u2014 go back as far as the Deady Code. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>provision that was eventually codified as ORS 8.650 originally provided, \u201cThe district attorney in each district, is the public prosecutor therein.\u201d General Laws of Oregon, Civ Code, ch XIII, title I, \u00a7 942, p 384 (Deady ed 1845-1864). The statute that was eventually codified as ORS 8.660 provided, \u201cHe [the district attorney] shall attend the terms of all courts having jurisdiction of public offences within his district, and conduct, on behalf of the state, all prosecutions for such offences therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">At the time, district attorneys were elected by districts, and districts were comprised of one or more counties. Article VII (Original), section 17, of the Oregon Constitution provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">\u201cThere shall be elected by districts comprised of one, or more counties, a sufficient number of prosecuting Attorneys, who shall be the law officers of the State, and of the counties within their respective districts, and shall perform such duties pertaining to the administration of Law, and general police as the Legislative Assembly may direct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In 1910, Article VII was amended and, as so amended, omits any reference to section 17. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art VII (Amended). However, the original provisions of Article VII \u201cremain in force notwithstanding the amendment * * *, except in so far as they have been modified by legislation subsequent to the adoption of the amendment.\u201d <em>State ex rel. v. Farrell, </em>175 Or 87, 91-92, 151 P2d 636 (1944) (citing <em>State v. Farnham, </em>114 Or 32, 43, 234 P 806 (1925); <em>Gibson v. Kay, </em>68 Or 589, 593, 137 P 864 (1914); <em>State ex rel. v. Duniway, </em>63 Or 555, 560, 128 P 853 (1912)).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Subsequent to the adoption of Article VII (Amended), the legislature established that district attorneys are to be elected by county instead of by district. Or Laws 1913, ch 343, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, as part of the general 1953 revision and recodification of Oregon statutes, the word \u201ccounty\u201d was substituted for \u201cdistrict\u201d in both ORS 8.650 and ORS 8.660, thus making clear that the district attorney\u2019s authority did not extend beyond the county. <em>Reviser\u2019s Notes and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number><em>Annotations to Chapters 1-170 of the Oregon Revised Statutes </em>28 (1953) (stating that the change was made \u201cbecause district attorneys no longer are elected by districts\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, ORS 8.650 (1953) read as follows: \u201cThe district attorney in each <em>county </em>is the public prosecutor therein.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And, ORS 8.660 (1953) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-3\">\u201cThe district attorney shall attend the terms of all courts having jurisdiction of public offenses within his <em>county, </em>and conduct, on behalf of the state, all prosecutions for such offenses therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">(Emphasis added.) Those provisions remained part of Oregon law without significant change until 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In 1971, ORS 8.650 was amended to give district attorneys authority to prosecute violations of city charters and ordinances <em>if </em>the district court of the county also had jurisdiction over the offenses. Or Laws 1971, ch 633, \u00a7 14. It remains in essentially that form today,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">\u201cThe district attorney in each county is the public prosecutor therein <em>and has the authority to appear and prosecute violations of the charter and ordinances of any city provided the circuit court for the county has jurisdiction with respect to violations of the charter and ordinances of each such city. </em>In cities of a population of more than 300,000 the district attorney shall be responsible for the prosecution of all city ordinance violations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">ORS 8.650 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">ORS 8.660 was amended in 1975, and again in 1981, to limit the district attorney\u2019s prosecutorial authority with respect to certain traffic, boating, and other infractions. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1975, ch 451, \u00a7 170; Or Laws 1981, ch 626, \u00a7 1; Or Laws 1981, ch 692, \u00a7 6a. In 1999, the statute was amended again as part of the enactment of Senate Bill (SB) 20 (1999), a comprehensive bill standardizing the procedures used for processing traffic infractions and other noncriminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>offenses and renaming those offenses \u201cviolations.\u201d <em>See State v. Swanson, </em>237 Or App 508, 512 n 1, 240 P3d 63 (2010), <em>aff'd, </em>351 Or 286, 266 P3d 45 (2011) (so explaining). It provided, as it does today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-4\">\u201c(1) The district attorney shall attend the terms of all courts having jurisdiction of public offenses within the district attorney\u2019s county, and, <em>except as otherwise provided in this section, </em>conduct, on behalf of the state, all prosecutions for such offenses therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">\u201c(2) A district attorney <em>shall not conduct prosecutions under this section when:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">\u201c(a) A city attorney is prosecuting a violation under ORS chapter 153; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">\u201c(b) The district attorney is prohibited from appearing in a violation proceeding under the provisions of ORS 153.076.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">ORS 8.660 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">At the same time, and as part of the same bill, the legislature enacted ORS 221.339, governing the prosecutorial authority of city attorneys and the jurisdiction of municipal courts. Or Laws 1999, ch 1051, \u00a7 40. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">\u201c(1) A municipal court has concurrent jurisdiction with circuit courts and justice courts over all violations committed or triable in the city where the court is located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-11\">\u201c(2) <em>Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, municipal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with circuit courts and justice courts over misdemeanors committed or triable in the city. </em>Municipal courts may exercise the jurisdiction conveyed by this section without a charter provision or ordinance authorizing that exercise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-12\">\u201c(3) Municipal courts have no jurisdiction over felonies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-13\">\u201c(4) A city may limit the exercise of jurisdiction over misdemeanors by a municipal court under this section by the adoption of a charter provision or ordinance, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>that municipal courts must retain concurrent jurisdiction with circuit courts over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-3\">\u201c(a) Misdemeanors created by the city\u2019s own charter or by ordinances adopted by the city, as provided in ORS 3.132; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-4\">\u201c(b) Traffic crimes as defined by ORS 801.545.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">\u201c(5) Subject to the powers and duties of the Attorney General under ORS 180.060, <em>the city attorney has authority to prosecute a violation of any offense created by statute that is subject to the jurisdiction of a municipal court, including any appeal, if the offense is committed or triable in the city.

In support of that argument, the district attorney first contends that, by carving out those two narrow exceptions, the legislature implied that \u201cthe district attorney <em>can </em>exercise his prosecutorial authority in all other concurrent jurisdiction situations.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We reject that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>It does not follow from the limitation on the district attorney\u2019s prosecutorial authority with respect to violations specified in ORS 8.660(2) that the legislature intended the district attorney\u2019s authority to be otherwise unfettered. ORS 8.660(2) reflects the legislature\u2019s preference for <em>violations </em>to be prosecuted by the city attorney; in that arena, the legislature has provided a clear pecking order: if the city attorney chooses to prosecute, the district attorney has no authority. However, that does not, as the district attorney contends, imply the converse \u2014 that in all other contexts in which there is concurrent jurisdiction, the city attorney\u2019s authority to prosecute is subordinate to that of the district attorney\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">ORS 8.660(2) must be considered in its statutory context. That context includes ORS 221.339, which, as noted, was enacted as part of the same bill as the most recent amendments to ORS 8.660(2), upon which the district attorney relies. <em>See, e.g., State v. McDowell, </em>352 Or 27, 31-32, 279 P3d 198 (2012) (considering, as significant context, statute enacted as part of the same bill but codified separately); <em>State v. Klein, </em>352 Or 302, 309, 283 P3d 350 (2012) (stating that a statute\u2019s context includes \u201crelated statutes\u201d). That statute grants municipal courts \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction with circuit courts and justice courts over misdemeanors committed or triable in the city,\u201d ORS 221.339(2), and specifies that the city attorney has authority to prosecute those crimes \u2014 that is, \u201cviolation of any offense created by statute that is subject to the jurisdiction of a municipal court * * * <em>if the offense is committed or triable in the city,\u201d </em>ORS 221.339(5) (emphasis added). Significantly, it further provides that the city attorney\u2019s authority in that regard is subject only to the \u201cpowers and duties of the Attorney General\u201d \u2014 it says nothing about making that authority subordinate to the authority of a <em>district attorney </em>\u2014 and that \u201c[t]he city attorney shall have <em>all powers of a district attorney in prosecutions under this subsection.\u201d </em>ORS 221.339(5) (emphasis added). Thus, ORS 221.339(5) establishes that the city attorney has authority to prosecute the offenses at issue in this case that is equivalent to that of the district attorney under ORS 8.660.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The legislative history of SB 20 presented by the parties supports that understanding. As the city points out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>at a work session on the bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 3, 1999, Bradd Swank of the Oregon Judicial Department, who was a member of the workgroup that developed the legislation, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-3\">\u201cNow, when you first hear that and you think that a city court has jurisdiction over misdemeanors, you think, naturally, that a city court is going to be hearing misdemeanors. <em>Well they may not be. And the reason they may not be is because what\u2019s left in the statute and what is unchanged by Senate Bill 20 is the discretion of the citing officer to decide where that officer is going to send that case. </em>Are they going to cite it into circuit court? Are they going to cite it into municipal court, justice court, if they\u2019ve got a justice court? And the reason it\u2019s a hot political issue is because, by deciding where workload goes, you not only have effect on the budgets of the courts that you\u2019re doing, but an effect on the revenues. A court that gets violations and infractions gets the money side of the chart. A court that gets misdemeanors gets the costs of jury trials, gets the costs of indigent defense, gets those costs * * *. When the work-group worked on this issue, they decided that it was a hot enough political potato \u2014 and it\u2019s been around * * * as long as there\u2019ve been state courts, about arguing how the workload issue is controlled and who controls <em>it </em>\u2014 the <em>workgroup decided that the best way to address this, was to make it mirror as closely as possible the current law and not do much with it and say this is what the current law is. </em>This bill isn\u2019t going to change this, so by arguing one way or another, if the bill dies, you\u2019re in the same position you are as if it passes in relation to this issue. * * * And [the League of Oregon Cities] wanted some minor language changes to make it clear <em>that section 40 wasn\u2019t attempting to change current law, </em>that the jurisdiction remained concurrent between the circuit court and the municipal court on those things that they couldn\u2019t remove jurisdiction for by ordinance and those were the misdemeanors created by their own city charter and the traffic offenses. And of course they always retain jurisdiction over violations. And we made some minor language changes * * * But it\u2019s an issue you should know about and is likely going to get asked on the floor. <em>It doesn\u2019t change the fact that under this bill, as under current law, it will be the officer writing the ticket who still gets to decide where the workload goes. And we haven\u2019t changed that.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 20, Mar 3, 1999, Tape 58, Side B (statement of Bradd Swank) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Testimony, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 20, Mar 3, 1999, Ex H (statement of Bradd Swank).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">As noted, section 40 of SB 20 was the provision that enacted ORS 221.339. Swank\u2019s testimony indicates that the legislature understood that provision to leave intact concurrent jurisdiction between the circuit and municipal courts over misdemeanors committed in the city and, consequently, the concurrent prosecutorial authority of the district attorney and the city attorney \u2014 that is, neither would be subordinate to the other.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Instead, \u201cit will be the officer writing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>ticket who still gets to decide where the workload goes.\u201d The district attorney does not point to anything in the history of SB 20 that would indicate a contrary intention on the part of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\">Instead, the district attorney reasons, \u201cIf a city attorney\u2019s authority to prosecute was <em>generally superior </em>to a district attorney\u2019s authority to prosecute when the two were in conflict, there would have been no need for the legislature to carve out the limited exception that it did for violation prosecutions in ORS 8.660(2).\u201d (Emphasis added.) The flaw in that argument is that it assumes that one official\u2019s authority must be superior to the other\u2019s authority, even though the legislature granted the circuit and municipal courts \u201cconcurrent\u201d jurisdiction over those offenses. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>472 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u201cconcurrent\u201d to mean, in law, <em>\u201cjoint and equal in authority </em>: taking cognizance of or having authority over the same subject matters : operating on the same objects\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>928 (9th ed 2009) (\u201cconcurrent jurisdiction\u201d is \u201c [jurisdiction that might be exercised simultaneously by more than one court over the same subject matter and within the same territory, a litigant having the right to choose the court in which to file the action\u201d (boldface omitted)). The only <em>legal </em>principle that the district attorney invokes in support of that proposition is the prohibition against former jeopardy. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 12; ORS 131.515. The district attorney argues that, because of former-jeopardy concerns, \u201cthere must be some tie-breaker for deciding which attorney \u2014 the district attorney or the city attorney \u2014 may prosecute an offense when the two are in conflict\u201d; however, the district attorney does not explain why that is so.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although former jeopardy might prevent the state from prosecuting in circuit court an offense for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>which a defendant had previously been prosecuted in municipal court (and vice versa), <em>but cf. State v. Ogle, </em>46 Or App 109, 610 P2d 1242 (1980) <em>appeal dismissed, </em>291 Or 364, <em>cert den, </em>454 US 1054 (1981) (former jeopardy did not bar driving-while-suspended prosecution in circuit court after DUII prosecution in municipal court arising from same criminal transaction), that circumstance does not lead to the conclusion that the legislature must have intended for the district attorney to control where a case is filed or prosecuted. Rather, as discussed above, it appears that the legislature deliberately chose <em>not </em>to resolve that particular conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\">The district attorney also contends that ORS 221.339(5) \u2014 which, in its view, \u201cdefine[s]\u201d the city attorney\u2019s authority <em>in terms </em>of the district attorney\u2019s authority\u2014 supports its position that the district attorney\u2019s power is superior: \u201cIt would be odd, indeed, for the legislature to describe the scope of one office holder\u2019s authority only by referencing the power of another office (an office with a well-defined history both in Oregon and elsewhere) and then have the established office be subservient to the ill-defined office.\u201d However, even accepting the district attorney\u2019s characterization of subsection (5), again, that reasoning is dependent on the premise \u2014 which we have already rejected \u2014 that one must necessarily be superior to the other. The district attorney emphasizes that it is only the district attorney \u2014 not the city attorney \u2014 who has been described by the legislature as the \u201cpublic prosecutor\u201d and that the district attorney\u2019s authority is significantly broader than the city attorney\u2019s in all other respects; however, neither of those circumstances compel the legal conclusion that the district attorney has superior prosecutorial authority over crimes for which the legislature has clearly granted \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction\u201d to state and municipal courts. In sum, the district attorney\u2019s arguments have little persuasive force as a matter of law and, if anything, are best directed to the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">On cross-appeal, the district attorney contends that the trial court erred in declaring, in paragraph 4 of the judgment, that ORS 8.660 requires the district attorney to attend and prosecute criminal cases in Astoria Municipal Court. As noted earlier, the district and the city are in agreement that the court erred in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in declaring the parties\u2019 rights as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the declaratory judgment and reverse and remand with instructions to omit those parts of the judgment and, in accordance with our opinion, to declare the converse of the declaration that the district attorney sought in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\">Reversed in part and remanded with instructions to enter judgment omitting the declarations in paragraphs 4 and 5 and declaring the rights of the parties in accordance with this opinion; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-6\"> As reflected in the caption of the case, both the Clatsop County District Attorney and Joshua Marquis (the individual presently holding that position) are named plaintiffs in this case. <em>For </em>readability, we refer to plaintiffs collectively as \u201cthe district attorney\u201d unless the context requires otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-7\"> Astoria Municipal Court is one of five municipal courts in Clatsop County.

The policy further provides that people cited for multiple offenses are to be cited to the court that has jurisdiction over the most serious offense charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b792-9\"> By agreement, state-law-based misdemeanor DUII offenses committed in the other four Clatsop County municipalities that operate municipal courts are presently prosecuted by the district attorney in circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b793-13\"> Plaintiff also requested \u201csupplemental\u201d relief under ORS 28.080, which, the trial court denied as \u201cbeyond the statutory authority of this Court.\u201d That aspect of the court\u2019s judgment is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b794-9\"> The statutes referenced in the court\u2019s judgment \u2014 ORS 221.339, ORS 8.650, and ORS 8.660 \u2014 are set out below. 266 Or App at 780-82.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b794-10\"> The city does not renew its other arguments for dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b796-5\"> The allegations in the complaint focused solely on the City of Astoria\u2019s refusal to relinquish to the district attorney control of the prosecution of DUII cases that arise within the city. The district attorney\u2019s request for supplemental relief was similarly focused: It sought to enjoin the City of Astoria from citing individuals charged with DUII into Astoria Municipal Court, enjoin the City of Astoria from prosecuting individuals charged with DUII in Astoria Municipal Court, and direct the City of Astoria to dismiss future DUII cases filed in Astoria Municipal Court and refer those cases to the district attorney\u2019s office for prosecution in Clatsop County Circuit Court. Thus, although the district attorney\u2019s demand for relief was worded more <em>broadly </em>\u2014 viz., for a declaration as to the exclusive authority of the district attorney to direct and control the prosecution of <em>all </em>DUII charges arising within the district attorney\u2019s jurisdiction, <em>including </em>those originating in the City of Astoria \u2014 taken in context, we agree with the district attorney that the complaint, in substance, requests only a declaration of the district attorney\u2019s authority as it pertains to the prosecution of state-law-based DUII offenses committed in the City of Astoria, and nothing more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b798-6\"> As mentioned, the district attorney also cross-appeals, agreeing with the city that the trial court erred in declaring that the district attorney must attend and prosecute those cases in Astoria Municipal Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\"> That provision is now codified at ORS 8.610 (\u201cA district attorney for each county shall be elected by the electors of the county!.]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b800-10\"> The change in wording became law by authority of ORS 174.510 (amended 1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b800-11\"> In 1995, the reference to district court in ORS 8.650 was changed to circuit court to reflect that, effective January 15, 1998, the jurisdiction and authority of the district courts was transferred to the circuit courts.

In <em>Ogle, </em>we affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, on former-jeopardy grounds, a felony driving-while-suspended charge in circuit court after he had been prosecuted in municipal court for DUII (brought under state law) arising from the same criminal transaction. We determined that the circuit-court prosecution was not barred by former jeopardy because, although each was aware of the other prosecution, neither the city attorney nor the district attorney was in the position to seek consolidation of the charges.

The district attorney argues that <em>Ogle </em>is not dispositive because, at the time, the district attorney did not have authority to prosecute traffic infractions, <em>see </em>ORS 8.660 (1979); ORS 484.030 (1979) (limiting district attorney authority to prosecute traffic infractions committed in the city), and DUII was a traffic infraction, <em>see former </em>ORS 487.540 (1979). Although ORS 8.660 still prohibits the district attorney from prosecuting violations (formerly enumerated \u201cinfractions\u201d) if the city attorney chooses to prosecute, because DUII is now at least a misdemeanor, <em>see </em>ORS 813.010(4), and may not be treated as a violation, <em>see </em>ORS 161.566(4), the district attorney contends that <em>Ogle </em>is inapposite. Apparently, however, the record in <em>Ogle </em>does not bear that out. As we related in our opinion in <em>Ogle, </em>\u201cthe state agree [d] *** that all the charges could have been tried in the circuit court.\u201d 46 Or App at 112.
