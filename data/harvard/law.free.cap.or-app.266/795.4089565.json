The EAB affirmed the administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ) denial of claimant\u2019s late request for a hearing concerning his right to extended unemployment insurance benefits that he had already received. Claimant, who is a native Cantonese speaker, contends that the Employment Department (department) failed to follow its policy on assisting claimants with limited English language proficiency. He contends that those circumstances met the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard for late hearing requests in OAR 471-040-0010(1). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Agency findings of fact, unless challenged, are assumed to be correct on review. <em>Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and </em>Industries, 322 Or 132, 134, 903 P2d 351 (1995). The unchallenged findings of the EAB in this case are as follows: Claimant\u2019s native language was Cantonese. Although he had lived and worked in the United States for approximately thirty years, he spoke broken English. He could \u201clisten pretty good\u201d in English, but reading English was a \u201cproblem.\u201d He sometimes had his wife assist him with English communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Claimant filed an initial claim for unemployment insurance benefits in February 2009. When payment on his claim for regular benefits was exhausted, he filed for, and was paid, extended benefits. However, the department later determined that he was not entitled to those extended benefits. In March 2011, claimant received a written decision from the department to that effect, in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Within the time period allowed for a hearing request, claimant took the 2011 decision to a local office of the department, where a department employee explained to him that he could request a hearing on the decision. Claimant therefore understood that he had been denied extended benefits and that he could request a hearing on the denial, but he did not comprehend the full legal effect of the decision, namely, that he would have to repay the extended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>benefits that he had received. Claimant filled out a hearing request form but never filed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Ten months later, in 2012, claimant received a notice from the department stating that he had to repay the extended unemployment insurance benefits that he had received. Once he received the repayment notice, claimant filed a late request for a hearing on the department\u2019s March 2011 decision that he was ineligible for the extended benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The administrative record reveals the following procedural history. Claimant appeared at two hearings regarding whether he had good cause for the lateness of his 2012 hearing request; the second hearing was scheduled so that claimant could have an interpreter. Claimant represented himself at both hearings. He did not introduce a copy of the department\u2019s \u201climited English proficient\u201d (LEP) policies as an exhibit. A representative of the department appeared and testified, but no party presented testimony from the department\u2019s employee in its Albany office who had spoken with claimant about the March 2011 decision. The ALJ determined that claimant had not shown good cause to extend the time he had to request a hearing to challenge the department\u2019s March 2011 decision that he was ineligible for the extended benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Claimant appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the EAB. Before the EAB, claimant focused on the terms of OAR 471-040-0010(2), specifically, whether the department had failed to follow its policies regarding claimants who are LEP by failing \u201cto communicate orally or in writing in a language that could be understood\u201d by him \u201cupon gaining knowledge\u201d that he \u201cneeded or was entitled to such assistance.\u201d The EAB affirmed, although it concluded that claimant had limited English proficiency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The term \u201climited English proficient person\u201d is defined, for purposes of the department\u2019s contested case proceedings, as \u201ca person who, by reason of place of birth, national origin, or culture, speaks a language other than English and does not speak English at all or with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>adequate ability to communicate effectively in the proceedings.\u201d OAR 471-040-0007(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The EAB concluded that claimant had failed to demonstrate the department\u2019s violation of its policy for providing services to persons who are LEP:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-5\">\u201cClaimant failed to show the Department had, much less failed to follow, an LEP policy requiring its representatives to explain to claimant he would \u2018not be able to challenge any future attempt to collect\u2019 unless he appealed its decision, or knew claimant \u2018needed or was entitled\u2019 to translation, interpretive, or other LEP services it failed to provide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The EAB found that claimant \u201cdid not assert or show he asked the Department in March 2011 \u2018to communicate orally or in writing\u2019 in Cantonese.\u201d Rather, the EAB observed, \u201chis testimony as to the advice he sought and was given\u201d in the Albany office \u201cwas very vague.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The EAB also noted that many claimants, both those who are native English speakers and those who are not, do not understand that a failure to appeal a notice of ineligibility for benefits received will have an adverse legal consequence: the ineligibility determination will become final and binding and the claimant will have to repay the benefits received. The EAB then concluded that \u201cit does not appear claimant was prevented from meeting the 20-day deadline by his failure to understand the deadline existed.\u201d Rather, the EAB concluded that, like many other claimants, claimant was operating under a misunderstanding of the legal effect of the March 2011 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">On review, claimant and the department dispute whether claimant met his burden to establish good cause for an extension of time to request a hearing. We review the EAB\u2019s final order to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence in the record. ORS 183.482(8)(c). We also review an agency\u2019s interpretation of law for legal error. ORS 183.482(8)(a). We accord an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own administrative rule deference; we will affirm \u201cif the interpretation is plausible and is not inconsistent with the wording of the rule itself, with the rule\u2019s context, or with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>some other source of law.\u201d <em>Stroeder v. OMAP, </em>178 Or App 374, 380, 37 P3d 1012 (2001); <em>accord Crystal Communications, Inc. v. Dept. of Rev., 353 </em>Or 300, 311, 297 P3d 1256 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">Under ORS 657.875, the period for a claimant to request a hearing to challenge a determination regarding unemployment insurance benefits \u201cmay be extended, upon a showing of good cause therefor.\u201d The department\u2019s rule that governs whether a claimant can show \u201cgood cause\u201d for extension of the period for requesting a hearing provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201c(1) \u2018Good cause\u2019 exists when an action, delay, or failure to act arises from an excusable mistake or from factors beyond an applicant\u2019s reasonable control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">\u201c(b) Good cause does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-9\">\u201c(B) Not understanding the implications of a decision or notice when it is received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-10\">\u201c(2) Notwithstanding section (1) of this rule, good cause for failing to file a timely request for hearing shall exist when the appellant provides satisfactory evidence that the Employment Department failed to follow its own policies with respect to providing service to a limited English proficient person, including the failure to communicate orally or in writing in a language that could be understood by the limited English proficient person upon gaining knowledge that the person needed or was entitled to such assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">OAR 471-040-0010. Under the plain meaning of the text of OAR 471-040-0010(2), a claimant has the burden to prove the facts necessary to meet the requirements for the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception based on the department\u2019s failure to follow its own LEP policies. However, the EAB explained in its decision in this case that OAR 471-040-0010(2) \u201cdoes not require a causal connection between the Department\u2019s failure to follow its LEP policies and the missed filing deadline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">On review, the department acknowledges that it does have an LEP policy and has appended its applicable policy to its brief. Under a section entitled \u201cStaff Responsibilities,\u201d the policy provides that departmental staff will be trained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>and should try to determine whether a customer needs language assistance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\">\u201cTraining</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">\u201cNew staff will complete an online Universal Access training within the first 30 days of their employment. Instructional information offered is to acquaint new employees to the federal LEP Policy Guidelines, ADA laws and accessing contracted language services provided to staff. Certification will be issued upon completion of the online training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">\u201cCustomer Interaction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">\u201cEmployment Department staff should make every attempt to determine whether a customer is in need of interpretive services. Staff should contact a qualified bilingual staff member if available to assist. If qualified staff are not available, use the \u2018Language Line Identification Cards\u2019 to determine the language spoken. The Language Line can then be used for interpretive services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">(Boldface in original.) Under a section entitled \u201cManagement Responsibilities,\u201d the department\u2019s LEP policy in part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">\u201cWritten Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-10\">\u201cAll written communication mailed to LEP customers regarding agency services and programs such as Business &amp; Employment Services, Child Care, Office of Human Resources, Tax, Workforce <em>&amp; </em>Economic Research, and Unemployment Insurance \u2014 including benefits information, adjudication, or hearings decisions \u2014 will include a multi-language service insert offering language services at no cost to the LEP customer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">(Boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">The parties\u2019 specific dispute concerns whether claimant met the proof requirements in OAR 471-040-0010(2). Claimant argues that the EAB\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. He contends that the evidence instead established that the department knew that he needed language assistance, asserting that the department (1) knew that he did not understand the decision and asked the department\u2019s office in Albany for help in understanding it and (2) knew that he was not a native or skilled English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>speaker when he spoke in limited, broken English with a department employee about the March 2011 decision (as evidenced by the ALJ having rescheduled the hearing so that he could have an interpreter). Nevertheless, he asserts that, despite his LEP status and his limited English skills when he orally communicates, the department indisputably failed to determine whether he needed interpretive services and failed to communicate with him in Cantonese. Claimant argues that he left the department\u2019s office in Albany understanding that \u201che was not going to receive any more benefits, but for reasons which were obscure to him.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">The department first responds that claimant\u2019s challenge fails because he did not prove in the first place that the department had an LEP policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reject that argument because the department\u2019s own rule concerning good cause, OAR 471-040-0010(2), indicates that the department has an LEP policy, which it acknowledges, as noted earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Rather, whether claimant established good cause for his late hearing request turns on whether the department followed its LEP policies to provide language assistance \u201cupon gaining knowledge\u201d that he \u201cneeded or was entitled to such assistance,\u201d as provided in OAR 471-040-0010(2). That is because the only possible findings on this record are that (1) claimant is an LEP person, as the EAB determined, and (2) the department failed \u201cto communicate orally or in writing\u201d with claimant in his native Cantonese.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">On that key issue, the parties differ regarding what \u201cknowledge\u201d claimant was required to prove under the department\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d rule and, accordingly, whether claimant met his burden of proof given the evidence in the record. In determining the meaning of an administrative rule, we \u201cdetermine the meaning of the words used, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>giving effect to the intent of the enacting body.\u201d <em>Abu-Adas v. Employment Dept., </em>325 Or 480, 485, 940 P2d 1219 (1997). We normally do so by considering \u201cthe text of the rule and its context, including other portions of the rule and related laws, and the rule\u2019s adoption history.\u201d <em>Brand Energy Services, LLC v. OR-OSHA, </em>261 Or App 210, 214, 323 P3d 356 (2014). In this case, although the parties both contend that we should interpret the rule simply by considering the text of OAR 471-040-0010(2), we consider the text of the rule in context, specifically, in context with the department\u2019s LEP policy and federal law requiring the department to provide access to LEP persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The department contends that OAR 471-040-0010(2) should be understood to require a claimant to prove that the department knew both (1) that the claimant was a limited English language person and (2) that the claimant was \u201cin need of interpretive services in a particular language.\u201d To prove the latter, the department asserts that claimant had to, but failed to, prove that he \u201cexpressed a language preference or asked the department to communicate with him in Chinese.\u201d In light of the rule\u2019s text and context, we decline to accept the interpretation of the knowledge requirement that the department advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The text of the rule itself does not support the department\u2019s interpretation. By its terms, OAR 471-040-0010(2) requires a claimant to prove that the department \u201cfailed to follow its own policies with respect to providing service to a limited English proficient person.\u201d The department\u2019s rule also provides that a sufficient showing includes proof of the department\u2019s \u201cfailure to communicate orally or in writing in a language that could be understood by the limited English proficient person upon gaining knowledge that the person needed or was entitled to such assistance.\u201d The rule does not state that a claimant must prove that the department knew that the claimant was an LEP person. Rather, under the plain meaning of the text, a claimant who is an LEP person can prove a failure to follow the LEP policy by proving that the department gained \u201cknowledge\u201d that the claimant \u201cneeded or was entitled to\u201d oral or written language assistance. In other words, whether the claimant is an LEP person is separate from whether the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>gained knowledge that the claimant \u201cneeded or was entitled\u201d to assistance. Thus, the department\u2019s proffered interpretation appears to be inconsistent with the wording of the rule itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">As for the department\u2019s position that a claimant must prove that he or she expressed a language preference or asked the department to communicate in a particular language, we again disagree that the department posits a plausible interpretation. The department\u2019s interpretation does not comport with the text of the rule, which does not require proof of any request on the part of the claimant or customer. Instead, the rule indicates that it is department policy to provide language assistance \u201cupon gaining knowledge\u201d that the claimant or customer needs or is entitled to such assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The ordinary meaning of the transitive verb \u201cgain\u201d is \u201cto get or attain to possession\u201d or to \u201ccause to be obtained or given.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>928 (unabridged ed 2002). Thus, to \u201cgain\u201d something, such as knowledge, suggests, at least in some usages, some activity on the part of the actor to get or attain that thing. The ordinary meaning of \u201cknowledge\u201d includes \u201cthe fact or condition of being cognizant, conscious, or aware of something,\u201d such as knowledge \u201cof what she had had to endure\u201d or the knowledge \u201cthat it was really important.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1252. Although the department could \u201cgain knowledge\u201d of a customer\u2019s need for language assistance by way of a customer\u2019s request that the department communicate in a particular foreign language, the department\u2019s rule is not couched in such specific, limited terms and suggests instead that the department may get the knowledge or cause such knowledge to be obtained in other ways, such as by engaging in communication with the customer and observing limited English proficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Context supports our analysis of the text of OAR 471-040-0010(2). The department\u2019s proffered interpretation contradicts the terms of its LEP policy, which is referenced in the rule and therefore provides context for understanding the rule. The LEP policy states that \u201c[department staff should make every attempt to determine whether a customer is in need of interpretive services.\u201d The LEP policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>thus does not require customers to ask for an interpreter, nor does it require department employees to determine whether a customer is an LEP person. The policy simply requires the department\u2019s employees to determine whether the customer needs interpretive services.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The department\u2019s LEP policy also requires a multilanguage insert \u201coffering language services at no cost.\u201d That written-communication provision does not depend on customer or claimant request. That part of the LEP policy is further evidence that the department does not require customers or claimants to request specific language assistance in order for the department to fail to follow its LEP policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Moreover, states have an obligation to provide meaningful access to their unemployment insurance programs for individuals with limited English proficiency. <em>See </em>Section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, codified at 42 USC \u00a7 2000d (\u201cNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d); <em>Lau v. Nichols, </em>414 US 563, 568-69, 94 S Ct 786, 39 LEd 2d 1 (1974) (holding that prohibited national origin discrimination under Title VI includes failing to provide LEP individuals with meaningful access to recipient programs). A \u201cprogram or activity\u201d or \u201cprogram\u201d in 42 USC section 2000d refers to \u201call of the operations of,\u201d among other things, \u201ca department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State\u201d or \u201cthe entity of such State * * * government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State * * * government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State * * * government.\u201d 42 USC \u00a7 2000d-4a(l). The unemployment compensation program is a longstanding federal-state program; Oregon enacted its unemployment compensation law in 1935. <em>Puget Sound B. &amp; D. Co. v. S. U. C. C., </em>168 Or 614, 620, 126 P2d 37 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The department, therefore, has an obligation to provide LEP individuals with access to its unemployment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>compensation program. The department recognizes that obligation, as evidenced by the department\u2019s LEP policy. The department\u2019s LEP policy states that federal laws, including Title VI and Executive Order 13166, 65 Fed Reg 50121 (Aug 11, 2000), were applied to the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">We thus do not view the department\u2019s LEP policy provision regarding \u201cCustomer Interaction\u201d and its wording that \u201c [department staff should make every attempt to determine whether a customer is in need of interpretive services\u201d and \u201cshould contact a qualified bilingual staff member if available to assist\u201d as merely precatory. Rather, we consider the department\u2019s rule that good cause for a late hearing request will exist when an LEP person has not been given language assistance in violation of the department\u2019s LEP policies in the context of the department\u2019s obligation under federal law to provide persons with limited English proficiency meaningful access to the unemployment insurance program. In that light, and given the LEP policy itself and ordinary meanings of the words \u201cgain\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d used within the rule, we conclude that the phrase \u201cgaining knowledge that the person needed or was entitled to such [language] assistance\u201d in OAR 471-040-0010(2) refers to the department\u2019s knowledge or awareness, obtained by any means, that the person needed or was entitled to oral or written language assistance. We remand for reconsideration under the correct understanding of OAR 471-040-0010(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\"> We reject the department\u2019s argument on review that no evidence in the record establishes that claimant was an LEP person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\"> At his hearing before the ALJ, claimant testified that \u201cI do not quite fully understand how the system work from the beginning to the end and I thought that because my benefit had ended, so I thought that I should not continue to file to the government and the time of the offices.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\"> Given that a claimant need not prove causation, we reject the department\u2019s argument that claimant was required to prove that the LEP policy required the kind of information in his native Cantonese language that the EAB ruled would have prompted him to decide to request a hearing, namely, an explanation of the legal consequences of the March 2011 ineligibility decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\"> The March 2011 decision that claimant sought to challenge late had no such multi-language insert, as the administrative record reveals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
