ORS 183.482(8)(c); <em>Campbell v. Employment Dept., </em>245 Or App 573, 579, 263 P3d 1122 (2011) (explaining that the standard of review provided in ORS 183.482(8)(c) \u201crequires that the board\u2019s findings of fact be supported by substantial evidence and that its conclusions be supported by substantial reason, <em>i.e., </em>its conclusions must reasonably follow from the facts found\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We agree with claimant that the board\u2019s order in this case is not supported by substantial reason; accordingly, we reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">On September 21, 2012, the Employment Department issued an administrative decision denying claimant unemployment benefits on the basis that he voluntarily left work without good cause. ORS 657.176(2)(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Claimant requested a hearing, which was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) on October 15, 2012. The ALJ subsequently issued an order also concluding that claimant was disqualified from receiving benefits because he voluntarily quit work without good cause. Claimant filed a timely application for review by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The board affirmed the department and the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits; however, the board concluded that claimant was disqualified from receiving benefits, not because he voluntarily quit work, but because \u201c [t] he employer discharged claimant for misconduct,\u201d citing ORS 657.176(2)(a) and OAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>471-030-0038(3)(a) (defining misconduct). Notwithstanding that conclusion, the board\u2019s analysis focused solely on the facts supporting a determination that claimant had voluntarily quit work without good cause; it did not address any factual basis for concluding that claimant had been discharged for misconduct. It necessarily follows that the board\u2019s conclusion does not \u201creasonably follow from the facts found,\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>245 Or App at 579, and, hence, lacks substantial reason. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for reconsideration on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"> Neither the Employment Department nor employer appears on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> ORS 657.176(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">\u201cAn individual shall be disqualified from the receipt of benefits * <em>'* * </em>if the authorized representative designated by the director finds that the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab5\">\u201c(a) Has been discharged for misconduct connected with work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-12\">\u201c(c) Voluntarily left work without good cause [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
