At issue on review is the board\u2019s conclusion that claimant, a flight attendant, suffered a compensable injury arising from an incident aboard one of employer\u2019s aircraft. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s findings that (1) claimant suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d during the course of her employment and (2) that injury \u201crequired medical services,\u201d specifically a \u201ctest of pressure with hyperbaric oxygen.\u201d We, therefore, affirm the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The facts are not disputed. Claimant was working a Horizon Air flight from Bozeman, Montana, to Seattle, Washington. Five to 10 minutes into the flight, claimant could not take a normal breath. Moments later, the pilot notified the flight attendants that the plane was failing to fully pressurize as it ascended. Claimant felt like she was going to pass out. Another flight attendant, Johnston, also felt light-headed. Claimant sat down on the floor and asked for oxygen. Claimant and Johnston took breaths from an oxygen tank. The captain lowered the flight altitude, and there were no further pressurization problems during the flight. For the remainder of the flight, however, claimant continued to have trouble with breathing, dizziness, and nausea. Passengers were never informed of the cabin-pressurization problem. Most of the passengers seemed \u201cokay\u201d during the flight, although claimant saw three passengers who were nauseous and one who actually vomited. Johnston saw one passenger who looked \u201csickly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Upon arrival in Seattle, claimant, who was scheduled to work a flight to Canada, instead returned home to Portland (as a passenger). Claimant\u2019s husband picked her up at the Portland airport because she did not feel able to drive. Claimant\u2019s symptoms continued to worsen. According to her husband, claimant seemed \u201clethargic\u201d and complained of headaches, faintness, and difficulty walking and breathing. When the couple arrived home in Forest Grove, claimant got in her own vehicle and drove to the Tuality Forest Grove Hospital. After being evaluated there, claimant was driven by ambulance to Providence Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Dr. Meghashyam examined claimant at Providence. Meghashyam asked about the incident aboard the flight and conducted a number of tests on claimant. Meghashyam testified that claimant \u201cexecuted most of the commands well,\u201d but also noted that claimant was somewhat unsteady and had difficulty walking in a straight line. During the past-pointing test, which required claimant to reach out and touch a particular object, Meghashyam observed that claimant\u2019s hand would \u201cgo a little bit past [the object] and then come back.\u201d Meghashyam determined that claimant\u2019s symptoms may have been caused by the \u201cchanges in cabin pressure\u201d that claimant described. Meghashyam consulted with the Divers Alert Network at Duke University and Travis Air Force Base to arrive at a treatment plan. Meghashyam determined that, based on claimant\u2019s symptoms and the \u201cchange in ambient pressure\u201d that claimant had experienced, the standard of care would be a \u201ctest of pressure\u201d by way of hyperbaric treatment. In total, claimant received five treatments in a hyperbaric chamber during a five-day hospital stay. Afterward, claimant felt significantly better but still complained of vertigo, short-term memory loss, and nausea. Claimant\u2019s \u201cdischarge diagnosis\u201d was recorded by Dr. Barone as \u201c[decompression illness secondary to being in a depressurized plane at approximately 10,000 feet.\u201d Claimant\u2019s coworker, Johnston, never sought medical treatment following the pressurization incident. He did, however, report \u201cfeeling spacey\u201d even after arriving in Seattle and decided to call in sick for his next scheduled day of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Claimant was subsequently treated by Dr. Braddock and Dr. Donahue, who diagnosed claimant with confusion, vertigo, and hypoxia. At employer\u2019s request, Dr. Burton examined claimant. Burton, who is board certified in occupational medicine and medical toxicology, also examined the incident report completed by the pilot. That report stated that the cabin pressure warning light came on as the plane reached approximately 12,000 feet. When the plane reached 18,000 feet, the \u201ccabin altitude\u201d was indicated at 14,000 feet for approximately five minutes. The cabin altitude decreased as the plane descended. The cabin pressure warning light turned off approximately 15 to 20 minutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>after it had come on. Burton concluded that the data failed to substantiate that a \u201cdecompression event\u201d occurred on the flight. Burton concluded that claimant\u2019s symptoms were \u201cpsychogenic\u201d in origin and unrelated to any workplace activity. He stated further that it was not plausible that claimant experienced hypoxia at a cabin altitude of 14,000 feet lasting 15 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Employer denied the claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld employer\u2019s denial on the basis that \u201cclaimant did not actually sustain any medical condition\u201d from the flight. In reaching that conclusion, the ALJ found it particularly important that none of the doctors who examined claimant was able to testify that it was medically probable that the pressurization incident caused claimant to suffer from a specifically diagnosable medical condition. The ALJ noted, for example, that Meghashyam had testified that it was merely \u201cpossible,\u201d rather than \u201cprobable,\u201d that claimant had suffered decompression illness arising from an injurious work event. As the ALJ explained, claimant did not suffer a compensable injury because the \u201cpersuasive medical evidence\u201d established that, \u201cat the \u2018cabin altitude\u2019 air pressure to which claimant was exposed, for the duration that she was exposed, there was no possibility that she or another healthy person in her position would develop hypoxia, decompression illness, cerebral edema, or any other medical condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The board reversed, concluding that, under the circumstances, claimant was not required to prove that her exposure to low pressure resulted in a specifically diagnosable medical condition. The board relied heavily on <em>K-Mart v. Evenson, </em>167 Or App 46, 1 P3d 477, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 191 (2000) (holding that a compensable injury was established where the claimant was exposed to HIV at the workplace, requiring testing and prophylactic treatment). Pertinent portions of the board\u2019s ruling are excerpted below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\u201cDr. Meghashyam, who is board-certified in hyperbaric medicine, concluded that claimant\u2019s exposure to abnormal cabin pressurization and resulting symptoms required medical services, specifically a \u2018test of pressure with hyperbaric oxygen.\u2019 We find that sufficient, under [K-Mart], to establish a compensable injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u201cIn reaching that conclusion, we recognize that Dr. Burton opined that the incomplete cabin pressurization did not require medical services. That opinion was premised on his belief that \u2018altitude pressure of 14,000 feet [was] not capable of causing injury or harm\u2019 in \u2018a healthy person.\u2019 Dr. Meghashyam, however, persuasively explained that there was no such bright line cutoff for incurring an injury due to a change in ambient pressure, but rather that responses to such pressure changes were \u2018variable.\u2019 As an expert in hyperbaric medicine ***, we defer to Dr. Meghashyam\u2019s opinion over that of Dr. Burton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\u201cWe disagree with the employer\u2019s assertion that Dr. Meghashyam\u2019s opinion as to whether claimant\u2019s workplace exposure required medical services was only based on \u2018possibility,\u2019 as opposed to \u2018probability.\u2019 Although Dr. Meghashyam initially signed a concurrence letter stating that she could not say that it was \u2018medically probable that the [work] event was injurious,\u2019 she explained in her deposition that she signed that letter based on her understanding that \u2018medically probable\u2019 was to be defined as \u2018most definitely.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201cMoreover, it is not dispositive that Dr. Meghashyam also stated that \u2018decompression sickness may [have been] one of the causes of [claimant\u2019s] symptoms.\u2019 In an initial injury claim, claimant is not required to establish a particular diagnosis, such as \u2018decompression sickness.\u2019 Dr. Meghashyam stated that, regardless of a precise diagnosis, claimant\u2019s workplace exposure to the change in ambient pressure, resulting symptoms, and responses to clinical tests, necessitated a \u2018standard of care\u2019 treatment with hyperbaric oxygen. We find that sufficient to establish that it was medically probable that claimant\u2019s workplace exposure required medical services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">(Citations omitted; second, third, and fourth brackets in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">On appeal, employer makes two assignments of error. First, it contends that the board erred in \u201cconcluding that claimant could carry her burden of proving the compensability of her claim with a medical opinion stated in terms of \u2018possibility\u2019 rather than \u2018probability.\u2019\u201d Second, it contends that the board erred in \u201cfinding [that] the medical opinion of Dr. Meghashyam persuasively demonstrated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>claimant suffered a compensable injury when contrasted with the countervailing medical evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">We review the board\u2019s decision for legal error and substantial evidence. ORS 183.482(8)(a), (c); <em>Jackson County v. Wehren, </em>186 Or App 555, 557, 63 P3d 1233 (2003). \u201cSubstantial evidence supports a finding when the record, viewed as a whole, permits a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d <em>Jackson County, </em>186 Or App at 557; ORS 183.482 (8) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The thrust of employer\u2019s first assignment is that, at most, the evidence showed that the pressurization incident could have been the cause of claimant\u2019s symptoms. That, according to employer, is not a sufficient quantum of certainty, because claimant was required to prove that it was \u201cmedically probable\u201d that her symptoms were the result of the cabin\u2019s incomplete pressurization. We agree with employer\u2019s characterization of the record; Meghashyam believed only that claimant\u2019s symptoms \u201cmay\u201d have been caused by her exposure to low cabin pressure. For the reasons explained below, however, we conclude that Meghashyam\u2019s testimony supports the board\u2019s conclusion that the hyperbaric chamber treatments were required medical services arising out of a workplace injury and, thus, compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">We begin with the relevant statute. Under ORS 656.005(7)(a), a \u201ccompensable injury\u201d is \u201can accidental injury * * * arising out of and in the course of employment requiring medical services or resulting in disability or death [.]\u201d Thus, to establish a compensable injury a claimant must prove (1) that he or she suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d in the course of her employment and (2) that that injury either resulted in a disability or death, or was at least severe enough to \u201crequir[e] medical services.\u201d The statute does not provide a definition of the term \u201cinjury,\u201d so we have given that term its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>K-Mart, </em>167 Or App at 50. Generally, \u201cinjury\u201d means \u201churt, damage, or loss sustained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary, </em>1164 (unabridged ed 1993)). <em>Webster\u2019s </em>also explains that injury has \u201cthe most comprehensive\u201d meaning of all the listed synonyms \u2014 hurt, damage, harm, and mischief \u2014 and may describe \u201can act or result involving an impairment or destruction of right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>health, freedom, soundness, or loss of something of value.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">In <em>K-Mart, </em>we also discussed when an injury \u201crequires\u201d medical services. In the course of that discussion, we rejected the notion that medical services are required only when \u201cdirected towards the cure of any existing, identifiable disease [.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50. Rather, we recognized that required services might include \u201cdiagnostic\u201d procedures or \u201cprophylactic treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50-51. In <em>K-Mart, </em>for example, the claimant was exposed to blood and feces while assisting a customer who was HIV positive. <em>Id. </em>at 48. Although she did not contract any illness, claimant received prophylactic treatment and was tested for HIV and Hepatitis A and B. <em>Id. </em>Both the claimant\u2019s emergency-room physician and her treating physician agreed that \u201cthe exposure required both testing and prophylactic treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. On that basis, we concluded that the claimant\u2019s exposure to \u201cserious, even life-threatening, pathogens\u201d was compensable because that exposure \u201crequired medical services.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Similarly, in <em>Finch v. Stayton Canning Co., </em>93 Or App 168, 170, 796 P2d 544 (1988), the claimant received diagnostic medical services for his wrist pain. A doctor diagnosed the claimant with carpal tunnel syndrome, but determined that the condition was \u201cmedically stationary and not disabling and did not recommend surgical treatment.\u201d We reasoned that, because the statute \u201cmakes no distinction between diagnosis and treatment,\u201d claimant had met her burden of proof by demonstrating that \u201cmedical services [were] required to determine what [was] wrong with her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173; <em>see also Collins v. Hygenic Corp. of Oregon, </em>86 Or App 484, 488, 739 P2d 1073 (1987) (diagnostic medical services were compensable even though they produced no \u201cobjective evidence of [claimant\u2019s] symptoms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Employer attempts to distinguish this case from <em>K-Mart </em>by arguing that, unlike contact with bodily fluids from a person with HIV, there is no evidence that \u201ca cabin altitude of 14,000 feet could be injurious.\u201d The first prong of the compensable injury analysis, however, requires only that a claimant establish that she suffered an injury in the course of her employment. There is ample evidence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>which a reasonable person could conclude that claimant sustained a \u201churt, damage, or loss\u201d as a result of the cabin failing to fully pressurize. Claimant testified that she had difficulty breathing, felt dizzy, and became nauseous. Those symptoms were severe enough that claimant sat down on the floor and requested oxygen. We also note that claimant\u2019s coworker had a similar, although less severe, reaction to the pressurization failure. Thus, claimant\u2019s symptoms represent an \u201cinjury\u201d in the sense that they \u201churt\u201d claimant and, indisputably, occurred while claimant was at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The real question in this case, therefore, is whether that injury \u201crequir[ed] medical services.\u201d Employer cites several cases for the proposition that, in order to prove that medical services were required, claimant had to demonstrate that it is \u201cmedically probable\u201d that her workplace exposure was the cause of \u201cher symptoms and the need for treatment.\u201d <em>See Queen v. SAIF, </em>61 Or App 702, 658 P2d 563 (1983); <em>Gormley v. SAIF, </em>52 Or App 1055, 630 P2d 407 (1981). Those cases are inapposite because, in both <em>Queen </em>and <em>Gormley, </em>the claimants sought medical treatment for a disability. Neither case involved a claim for medical services that were necessary in order to diagnose a claimant\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Here, the hyperbaric treatments that Meghashyam prescribed had a diagnostic purpose. Meghashyam explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\u201cIf a patient experienced change in ambient pressure and had symptoms associated with that, since we don\u2019t have a diagnostic gold standard to either confirm decompression sickness or refute it, then the standard of care, if the symptoms are significantly distressing to the patient or if the symptoms are neurological, the standard of care would be to treat her with a test of pressure, where we do a [hyperbaric oxygen treatment] and see how the patient does, and check for improvement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Later in her deposition, Meghashyam reiterated that there is no diagnostic tool that can easily confirm or refute a diagnosis of decompression sickness. In other words, Meghashyam testified that the treatment she prescribed was necessary precisely because it would help confirm or refute her initial diagnosis that claimant was possibly suffering from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>decompression sickness. Relying on Meghashyam\u2019s explanation, the board concluded that claimant had established that the hyperbaric treatments were necessary. That conclusion is consistent with our opinions in both <em>Finch </em>and <em>Collins, </em>which held that a claimant may prove that medical services are necessary by showing that they will help diagnose his or her symptoms. We, therefore, reject employer\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In its second assignment of error, employer challenges the board\u2019s decision to defer to Meghashyam\u2019s medical opinion over the opinions of other experts. Ordinarily, the question of how to resolve competing expert medical opinions is within the discretion of the board. <em>Armstrong v. Asten-Hill Co., </em>90 Or App 200, 206, 752 P2d 312 (1988) (\u201c[I]f there are doctors on both sides of a medical issue, whichever way the [b]oard finds the facts will probably have substantial evidentiary support.\u201d). In reviewing a medical expert\u2019s opinion, \u201cwe do not substitute our judgment for that of the board; rather, we determine whether the board\u2019s evaluation of that evidence was reasonable.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Pepperling, </em>237 Or App 79, 85, 238 P3d 1013 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Here, the board concluded that claimant\u2019s injury was compensable based on Meghashyam\u2019s opinion that \u201cclaimant\u2019s exposure to abnormal cabin pressurization and resulting symptoms required medical services, specifically a \u2018test of pressure with hyperbaric oxygen.\u2019\u201d Meghashyam\u2019s opinion was based on claimant\u2019s exposure to a \u201cchange in ambient pressure,\u201d claimant\u2019s reported symptoms, and the results of certain tests that she asked claimant to perform during the examination. Employer relies heavily on the opinion of Burton who observed that a \u201cdecompression incident\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not occur and that claimant\u2019s symptoms were likely \u201cpsychogenic in origin and unrelated to any workplace activities.\u201d Burton also opined that, because claimant was exposed to a cabin pressure of 14,000 feet for only 15 minutes, \u201c[i]t is not plausible that she experienced any hypoxia, neurologic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>dysfunction, or any other symptoms * * * caused by the circumstances of this flight.\u201d Meghashyam agreed that there is little evidence of healthy people developing decompression sickness after being exposed to an altitude of only 14,000 feet. She also testified, however, that she could not ignore claimant\u2019s symptoms and that, because different people may react differently to changes in air pressure, it is possible for someone to experience decompression sickness from exposure to an altitude of 14,000 feet. Meghashyam\u2019s testimony is supported by an \u201cAltitude-Induced Decompression Sickness\u201d fact sheet produced by the Federal Aviation Administration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Based on the record, we cannot say that it was unreasonable for the board to accept Meghashyam\u2019s medical opinion rather than Burton\u2019s. One could reasonably conclude that a test of pressure with hyperbaric oxygen was necessary based on claimant\u2019s exposure to a change in pressure, her symptoms, the results of Meghashyam\u2019s examination, and the relative difficulty of diagnosing decompression sickness. We, therefore, affirm the board\u2019s order concluding that claimant suffered a compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-6\"> Employer\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cdecompression incident\u201d is potentially confusing. By using that term, Burton meant to convey that the airplane cabin did not suddenly lose pressure at a high altitude. It is undisputed, however, that claimant did experience a change in ambient pressure as the airplane climbed in altitude and the cabin failed to fully pressurize.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\"> Meghashyam cited a portion of the fact sheet that explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFY9\">\u201c[t]here is no specific altitude that can be considered an absolute altitude exposure threshold, below which it can be assured that no one will develop altitude [decompression sickness (DCS)]. However, there is very little evidence of altitude DCS occurring among healthy individuals at altitudes below 18,000 ft. who have not been SCUBA (Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus) diving.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
