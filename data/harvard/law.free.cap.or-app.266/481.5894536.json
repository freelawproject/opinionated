The evidence at trial was that defendant sexually abused L, his 13-year-old niece, after smoking marijuana with her. Defendant raises five assignments of error on appeal. We reject, without further discussion, defendant\u2019s third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error, and write only to address his first and second assignments. In those assignments of error, defendant contends that the trial court plainly erred in failing to strike, as impermissible vouching, the testimony of two witnesses that L\u2019s upset demeanor and crying when recounting the sexual abuse to them was \u201cnot fake.\u201d We conclude that any error was not plain and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Because defendant was convicted, we summarize the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Barboe, </em>253 Or App 367, 369, 290 P3d 833 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 714 (2013). In early 2009, L, who was then 13 years old, lived with her father, his fianc\u00e9e (Bornman), and Bornman\u2019s daughter, M, who is the same age as L. Defendant was L\u2019s uncle; he was married to the sister of L\u2019s father. At that time, defendant lived with his wife and their three children in an apartment in Beaverton, located within 1,000 feet of a school. L was close to defendant and his family, having stayed with them on a number of occasions before her father became involved with Bornman in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">By early 2009, L was sexually active and a marijuana user. Her father and Bornman were reluctant to leave L unattended when they were away from home. In March 2009, during L\u2019s spring break, father and Bornman sent L to stay at defendant\u2019s apartment while they were at work. L\u2019s father and Bornman did not know, as L later testified, that L had smoked marijuana with defendant at his apartment four or five times before then.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">One morning, during the spring break stay, defendant invited L to smoke marijuana with him in his bedroom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>L did so and became intoxicated. L testified that defendant then \u201cstarted grabbing me really rough * * * pushed me on the bed * * * [was] massaging me really, really rough * * * [and] grabbing my shoulders and my butt.\u201d Defendant took L\u2019s clothes off and then had sexual intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">L later disclosed the sexual abuse to M, two other friends, and her boyfriend, Fuller. She told her father and Bornman about the abuse in October 2010. That disclosure was precipitated by another stay with defendant and his family (who by then had moved to L\u2019s paternal grandfather\u2019s house) during a weekend trip by father and Bornman. Before that trip and on their return, L complained about not being able to stay at home, but instead having to stay with defendant. According to Bornman\u2019s trial testimony, L appeared to be genuinely upset when Bornman and father returned from the trip. Bornman asked L what was wrong, and L disclosed and described the abuse by defendant. L then told her father about the abuse. That same day, L, her father, and Bornman went to the City of Tigard police station, where L reported the abuse to Officer Rivera. Rivera referred the matter to the Washington County Sheriffs Department, where it was investigated by Detective Rookhuyzen. Defendant was indicted for the crimes in March 2011, and the case went to trial in July of that year. During the trial, a number of witnesses described L\u2019s recounting of the sexual abuse and her demeanor while doing so, including (in order of testimony) Rivera, Rookhuyzen, Bornman, M, Fuller, and L\u2019s father. The demeanor testimony at issue was solicited by both the prosecution and the defense. Later in the trial, defense counsel asked defendant\u2019s daughter and wife about L\u2019s demeanor in family gatherings that occurred between March 2009 and October 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Under questioning by the prosecutor, Rivera testified about L\u2019s emotional state during his interview of her, the same day L disclosed the sexual abuse to Bornman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">\u201cQ. And during that time did you have a chance to observe whether or not she had any emotions one way or the other as she\u2019s talking about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">\u201cA. She spoke quietly, but she was sitting with her parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u201cA. I didn\u2019t observe much more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">\u201cQ. Okay. So she wasn\u2019t hysterically upset or crying, but she was soft spoken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Next up, Rookhuyzen spoke of interviewing L that evening. He testified that, under his direction, L had recorded a \u201cpretext [telephone] call\u201d to defendant at that time. The prosecutor asked whether, during the call, L \u201cwas nervous or was calm or do you remember anything about how she appeared to you, her demeanor?\u201d Rookhuyzen responded, \u201cShe seemed pretty calm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Bornman then testified that, upon father\u2019s and her return from a weekend trip in October 2010, L told Bornman about the sexual abuse by defendant following their use of marijuana. The prosecutor then asked about L\u2019s demeanor when she spoke with Bornman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. And how was she \u2014 what would you say her demeanor was? And when I use the word demeanor, I mean emotionally how was she acting when she was telling you these things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">\u201cA. She was upset. She started crying. And her biggest fear with all of this was she loves her family. She loves her cousins. She loves her\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">\u201cA. \u2014aunt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-13\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: She\u2019s testifying to what\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-14\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: I can ask the question in a different way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-16\">\u201cQ. (By [PROSECUTOR]) Did she tell you what her fears were when she was crying and telling you about the abuse that the defendant had done to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-17\">\u201cA. Her fears were that it was going to break up the family and she wasn\u2019t going to be able to see her cousins or her aunt again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u201cQ. Tell us how it\u2019s been on [L] since that point in time until today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">\u201cA. [L\u2019s] not been allowed to see her cousins. She hasn\u2019t talked to her aunt. She has no involvement with that family at this point. She\u2019s not allowed to talk to any of them, and that\u2019s devastating to her. She cries about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cQ. And with your assistance kind of by her side, did she tell her father about what had happened with [defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">\u201cA. She did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\u201cQ. And emotionally what was her demeanor when she was talking to her father about what had happened to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">\u201cA. She was crying. She was very upset, worried about what was going to happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">\u201cQ. And when you say crying, I guess I would like a little bit more of a description from you. Do you mean, like, she had tears coming out of her eyes and a stuffy nose because she\u2019s crying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">\u201cA. She was crying to the point it was hard for her to talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-13\">\u201cQ. And have you ever seen someone fake being upset, you know, just someone in your life\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-15\">\u201cQ. \u2014fake being upset? I\u2019m sorry to ask, but how old are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-16\">\u201cA. 42.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-17\">\u201cQ. Okay, all right. So in your 42 years of living have you ever come across people that have faked tears or faked being emotional about things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-18\">\u201cA. As an EMT on a consistent basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-19\">\u201cQ. Okay, all right. Tell me about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-20\">\u201cA. We have patients that are drug seekers or patients who \u2014 I\u2019ve had patients who don\u2019t want to go to jail. Being female and being an EMT, they tend to want to play on our emotions. So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-21\">\u201cQ. So you\u2019re a frequent target of fakers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u201cA. Frequent, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">\u201cQ. How long have you been an EMT?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">\u201cA. Eight years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cQ. And when you say EMT, that\u2019s emergency medical technician?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">\u201cQ. You\u2019re in the ambulance, and you\u2019re the one that responds as a first responder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">\u201cQ. Having had a chance to observe [L\u2019s] emotions when she was talking to you in that 10-minute conversation, and then when she was talking to her father about what happened did it appear to you as though she was faking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">\u201cA. This was not fake.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">Defense counsel then cross-examined Bornman about \u201ccrying and fake crying\u201d during L\u2019s conversations with Bornman and L\u2019s father:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-13\">\u201cQ. And you \u2014 [the prosecutor] was talking to you about levels of upset and tears and crying and fake crying. Was [L] \u2014 before you left that weekend was she crying about going to her grandfather\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-14\">\u201cA. She was not. She was just upset that she couldn\u2019t\u2014 that she had to go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-15\">\u201cQ. How would you characterize her upset?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-16\">\u201cA. Angry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-17\">\u201cQ. So she was mad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-19\">\u201cQ. Okay. And she expressed that anger and \u2014 before you left and frustration that she wasn\u2019t going to be allowed to stay at home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-20\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-21\">\u201cQ. Okay. And in fact, at the time you had chalked it up to just her wanting to stay home and spend time with her boyfriend, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-22\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201cQ. And you came home, and [L] was still upset that\u2014 and expressed it in ways that she was frustrated and didn\u2019t understand why she wasn\u2019t allowed to stay home, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cA. Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Born man\u2019s daughter, M, then testified that L disclosed the sexual abuse to her in 2009. When asked by the prosecutor whether L seemed \u201chappy or sad or upset or what,\u201d M replied that, \u201cShe just seemed kind of nervous and scared and just really upset.\u201d Fuller, the next witness, testified that L told him about the abuse in the fall of 2010, \u201cSo she finally after \u2014 she was getting teary eyed, and it was hard for her to say it, but finally she was able to come out with it, and she told me what happened.\u201d The prosecutor then asked Fuller about L\u2019s demeanor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. I want to talk to you about demeanor. Do you know what I mean when I use that word, demeanor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">\u201cQ. I mean the way someone is acting or the way they appear, like emotions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">\u201cA. Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">\u201cQ. Sometimes people can act nervous or excited or happy or sad or upset. Do you remember how [L] was acting, what her demeanor was when you guys were having this conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-12\">\u201cA. Yeah. She was extremely upset. She was just very teary. She was practically <em>crying. </em>So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-13\">\u201cQ. Okay. And have you ever seen someone fake being upset?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-14\">\u201cA. I mean, I\u2019m sure I have, but I can\u2019t bring up an exact\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-15\">\u201cQ. Okay. I mean, maybe right now you can\u2019t think of a specific time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-16\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-17\">\u201cQ. Do you know what I mean when I say, like, someone is faking being upset, like they\u2019re making it look like they\u2019re upset but they\u2019re not really?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">\u201cQ. You know kind of what that means? When [L] was talking to you and she seemed upset to you did it look to you like she was faking it or did it look to you like she wasn\u2019t faking it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201cA. Not at all. I did not think she was faking it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Later in the trial, the prosecutor asked father what L was like \u201c [e] motionally\u201d when she described the abuse to him. He replied that L \u201cwas fairly quiet, distraught * * * may be a good word that I would describe her as.\u201d Still later, defense counsel asked defendant\u2019s aunt about \u201cthe way [L] was acting \u2014 *** her demeanor\u201d and whether L \u201cseem[ed] *** reserved *** [concerned [or] *** [s]tandoffish\u201d during a birthday party at defendant\u2019s home in May 2010. Defense counsel asked defendant\u2019s wife similar questions, whether L was \u201cacting afraid\u201d or \u201cacting scared\u201d of defendant after the spring of 2009. Both witnesses disclaimed any such behavior by L.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in allowing \u2014 or more precisely, in failing to strike\u2014 the testimony of Bornman and Fuller, at the time that it was given, that L was not \u201cfaking\u201d her agitation when she described the abuse to them. Defendant argues that testimony about the genuineness of L\u2019s emotional expressions was not demeanor testimony, but instead was impermissible vouching for the credibility of the complainant, and that the trial judge plainly erred in failing to immediately strike that testimony. The state counters that any error in failing to strike the testimony was not plain because the testimony was not obviously a comment on L\u2019s credibility and because defense counsel might plausibly have had tactical reasons to not object to the testimony to which the court owed deference. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s inquiries of Bornman and Fuller about whether L was \u201cfaking\u201d her displayed emotions during their conversations with her. Because the court did not expressly allow the testimony in the face of an objection, defendant cannot claim that the court erred in allowing that testimony to be given. Instead, defendant contends that the court plainly erred in failing to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>sua sponte, </em>strike the testimony that L was not faking her emotional reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Pursuant to ORAP 5.45, the court considers only claims of error that are \u201cpreserved in the lower court *** provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d As explained in <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990), an error is plain if (1) the error is one of law; (2) the error is \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) the error appears on the record, meaning that \u201c[wje need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it.\u201d In deciding whether to exercise our discretion to correct an unpreserved error, we apply the nonexclusive factors articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 823 P2d 956 (1991). Those include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 382 n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In defendant\u2019s view, the trial court\u2019s failure to, <em>sua sponte, </em>strike the \u201cnot faking it\u201d testimony was plain error. He asserts that we should exercise our discretion to correct that error because the testimony went to the heart of the state\u2019s case, buttressing the credibility of the complainant, and likely affected the verdicts against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We begin by analyzing whether the testimony in question was impermissible vouching. The core principle is simple enough: \u201c[I]n Oregon a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth.\u201d <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983). That rule applies \u201cwhether the witness is testifying about the credibility of the other witness in relation to the latter\u2019s testimony at trial or is testifying about the credibility of the other witness in relation to statements made by the latter on some other occasion or for some reason unrelated to the current litigation.\u201d <em>State v. Kellar, </em>315 Or 273, 285, 844 P2d 195 (1993). Examples of testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>that is impermissible as a direct opinion on the honesty or credibility of another witness include (1) testimony by the victim\u2019s mother that she \u201c\u2018never doubted [the victim] for a second,\u201d\u2019 <em>State v. Vargas-Samado, </em>223 Or App 15, 17, 195 P3d 464 (2008); (2) testimony that \u201c\u2018there is no lying going on about what [the complainant\u2019s] telling us in this evaluation,\u201d\u2019 <em>State v. Hollywood, </em>250 Or App 675, 677, 282 P3d 944 (2012); and (3) testimony that the witness \u201c\u2018didn\u2019t think that [the defendant] was being very honest and upfront,\u201d\u2019 <em>State v. Lowell, </em>249 Or App 364, 366, 277 P3d 588, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012). By contrast, testimony about the physical appearance of a speaker, or testimony that is solely descriptive of the manner in which a communication is made \u2014 so-called demeanor evidence \u2014 is admissible and is not vouching evidence. <em>See, e.g., Alcazar v. Hill, </em>195 Or App 502, 510, 98 P3d 1121 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 488 (2005) (witness description of a police officer witness as \u201c\u2018100 percent kind, total gentleman, very friendly\u2019\u201d was a description of demeanor and not impermissible vouching); <em>cf. State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 362, 234 P3d 117 (2010) (stating that \u201cobservations of [a complainant\u2019s] physical characteristics and demeanor ordinarily would not be, in and of themselves, impermissible vouching\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">On the other hand, \u201cstatements that fall short of *** overt vouching also may be impermissible.\u201d <em>Lupoli, </em>348 Or at 357. In <em>State v. Remme, </em>173 Or App 546, 558, 23 P3d 374 (2001), we distinguished cases in which an expert witness assists the jury in evaluating the credibility of a witness by testifying on \u201can unusual phenomenon bearing on credibility\u201d from those cases in which a witness inappropriately \u201c\u2018connects the dots\u2019 explicitly by eliciting testimony relating that phenomenon\u2019s specific application to a particular witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Compare State v. Preuitt, </em>255 Or App 215, 223, 296 P3d 648, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 868 (2013) (permissible for a witness to testify to \u201cgeneral information regarding circumstances that indicate that a [general class of witnesses] is or is not suggestible\u201d), <em>with State v. Watts, </em>209 Or App 560, 562-63, 314 P3d 991 (2013) (police officer testimony that the defendant gave a \u201cdeceptive answer\u201d because he paused before responding was an improper comment on credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>We have concluded that it is plain error for a trial court to not strike explicit vouching testimony <em>sua sponte.

McQuisten, </em>97 Or App 517, 519-20, 776 P2d 1304 (1989) (concluding that trial court \u201chad a duty, <em>sua sponte, </em>not to allow testimony\u201d from police officer that \u201cit is pretty hard for [a sexual assault victim] to fabricate those feelings\u201d and that the complainant was showing \u201cvery true emotions and signs\u201d of sexual abuse, because \u201cthe jury could reasonably have drawn the inference that the officer believed the story of the complaining witness, bolstering her credibility in its estimation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">We summarized that line of cases in <em>State v.

Charboneau, </em>323 Or 38, 47, 913 P2d 308 (1996). Often, it creates a \u2018risk that the jury will not make its own credibility determination, which it is fully capable of doing, but will instead defer\u2019 to an expert\u2019s opinion on that point. <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 141, 218 P3d 104 (2009).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">(Some citations omitted; brackets in <em>Corkill.) </em>Thus, it is less evident that a trial judge plainly errs in not striking evidence that is not either \u201ctrue vouching\u201d evidence or indirect evidence of vouching by expert evidence related to a particular witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Finally, any error by the trial court in failing to strike vouching testimony is not \u201cplain\u201d if the testimony is subject to a \u201ccompeting inference\u201d that defense counsel had a \u201cplausible\u201d reason to not object to the evidence. <em>See State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 169-70, 130 P3d 780 (2006) (no plain error if the evidence is subject to a \u201ccompeting inference!]\u201d that the defendant had a strategic purpose in not objecting to the evidence); <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 512, 228 P3d 688 (2010) (\u201c[T]he inference [of a strategic reason for not objecting] that the state posits is not plausible.\u201d); <em>see also State v. Salas-Juarez, </em>264 Or App 57, 63-66, 329 P3d 805 (2014) (no plain error in failing to strike police officer testimony that another witness \u201c\u2018appeared to be truthful\u2019\u201d because the officer\u2019s testimony included factual statements supporting the defendant\u2019s theory that another person had stabbed the victim); <em>State v. Ramirez-Estrada, </em>260 Or App 312, 313, 317 P3d 322 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 317 (2014) (error not plain in failing to strike nurse\u2019s testimony that complainant was \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse\u201d where inferable that defense counsel wanted to emphasize the insufficient basis for that conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Applying those principles here, we conclude that it was not plain error for the trial court to fail to strike, <em>sua sponte, </em>Bornman\u2019s testimony that L\u2019s emotions were \u201cnot fake\u201d for two reasons. First, for the most part, the testimony was about L\u2019s demeanor \u2014 Bornman\u2019s impressions of L\u2019s physical appearance. As noted, that type of evidence is admissible and not vouching evidence under <em>Alcazar. </em>Admittedly, Bornman testified about the genuineness or credibility of L\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>expressed emotions. But any testimony about the expressed emotions of another \u2014 that, for example, a person seems sad, happy, or distraught \u2014 necessarily implies an assessment that the expression is genuine; otherwise the testimony would be that the person was not expressing that particular emotion. Bornman\u2019s <em>explicit </em>testimony about the genuineness of L\u2019s distress is not far removed from the <em>implicit </em>assertion of legitimacy in any demeanor testimony about emotional appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">More importantly, Bornman\u2019s testimony was not directed to whether she believed L was telling the truth about the sexual abuse. Instead, Bornman testified that L was genuinely upset that her disclosure of the abuse \u201cwas going to break up the family and she wasn\u2019t going to be able to see her cousins or her aunt again,\u201d and that L was \u201cvery upset, worried about what was going to happen.\u201d But that evidence did not \u201cconnect the dots\u201d and link L\u2019s emotive conduct to the occurrence of the sexual abuse or the truthfulness of L\u2019s testimony about the abuse. It was not akin to the impermissible vouching in <em>McQuisten, </em>where the evidence was that the complainant was showing \u201cvery true emotions and signs\u201d <em>of sexual abuse. </em>97 Or App at 519. Thus, Bornman\u2019s testimony was one step removed from direct testimony of L\u2019s truthfulness about the sexual abuse and did not supplant the jury\u2019s assessment of L\u2019s credibility in recounting the sexual abuse to Bornman.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Both of those aspects of Bornman\u2019s testimony distinguish that evidence from the \u201ctrue vouching\u201d testimony that we identified in <em>Corkill </em>that a trial court has the obligation to strike <em>sua sponte. </em>We need not, and do not, decide whether an objection to this part of her testimony should have been sustained had it been made. <em>See </em>OEC 701 (lay opinion evidence limited to those opinions \u201c[hjelpful to * * * the determination of a fact at issue\u201d). We merely conclude that the evidence was not so apparently excludable as vouching testimony that the trial judge plainly erred in failing, in the absence of an objection, to strike the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In addition, in our view, there was a reasonable inference that the trial court could have drawn that defense counsel had a plausible reason not to object to the \u201cdid it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>appear to you as though she was faking\u201d question, so that the court\u2019s obligation to intervene in the examination of the witness was not clear. That is, it is readily inferable that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to that question or to move to strike the answer was intentional. At the beginning of the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of Bornman about L\u2019s demeanor, defense counsel objected to Bornman\u2019s volunteered answer about the reasons for or legitimacy of L\u2019s distress (\u201cAnd her biggest fear with all of this was she loves her family. She loves her cousins. She loves her *** aunt.\u201d). There was no motion to strike that answer. But to an observing judge, it was apparent that defense counsel was vigilant and sensitive to the relevancy of testimony about L\u2019s motivation for her expressed emotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">After the question was rephrased and answered differently, the prosecutor then began a series of questions about Bornman\u2019s experience in distinguishing fake from real emotions (\u201cAnd have you ever seen someone fake being upset ***?\u201d). There are eight questions along this \u201cfakery line,\u201d none of which was objected to by defense counsel, before the question about L\u2019s emotional genuineness is asked. The only relevance of those questions is to buttress the credibility of Bornman\u2019s answer to the obviously imminent question about whether L was \u201cfaking\u201d it. Given those eight opportunities to object, the trial judge could readily conclude that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the \u201cdid it appear to you as though she was faking\u201d question was not inadvertent or happenstance, but intentional and purposeful.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">That plausible purpose could have been this: Defense counsel could have wanted to establish that L was upset about the repercussions of her disclosure of the abuse or her inability to stay home and visit with her boyfriend, and <em>not upset about disclosing the actual abuse itself, </em>in order to help establish that the abuse did not happen. The previous witnesses established that L had calmly discussed the abuse with others that same day. Rivera testified that L was not \u201chysterically upset or crying, but * * * was soft spoken\u201d when L disclosed the abuse to him. Rookhuyzen stated that L was \u201cpretty calm\u201d when she discussed the abuse with defendant. The trial court could have inferred that defense counsel wanted to reinforce that L was not visibly upset about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>abuse, but instead was genuinely upset about other things, and, for that reason, acquiesced in the prosecutor\u2019s inquiries of Bornman.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">And, in fact, that is what defense counsel proceeded to do. He cross-examined Bornman about the \u201ccrying and fake crying\u201d to establish that L was \u201cstill upset that \u2014 and expressed it in ways that she was frustrated and didn\u2019t understand why she wasn\u2019t allowed to stay home.\u201d Indeed, defense counsel in his closing argument to the jury emphasized that \u201cthe reaction, the emotional reaction was in response to \u2014 or contemporaneous with she was upset about not being able to see her cousins. It wasn\u2019t contemporaneous with describing th[e] actions of March 2009.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">For much the same reason, it was not plain error for the trial court to not strike Fuller\u2019s answer to the question \u201cdid it look to you like [L] was faking it or did it look to you like she wasn\u2019t faking it.\u201d While Fuller did associate L\u2019s \u201cpractically crying\u201d demeanor with the sexual abuse disclosure, by the time of that question, the trial judge nonetheless could infer that both the prosecutor and defense counsel regarded the evidence as permissible demeanor testimony and relevant to their respective theories of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In sum, because the evidence in question was not clearly vouching for L\u2019s credibility in accusing defendant of sexual abuse, but was more akin to permissible testimony about L\u2019s demeanor, and because there were plausible reasons that the evidence could support the defense of the case, the trial court did not plainly err in failing to strike the testimony <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
