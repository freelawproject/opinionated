In a single assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress evidence because officers were trespassing at the time they secured defendant\u2019s consent to enter his apartment. We agree with defendant that the officers were trespassing when they obtained his consent to enter and search his apartment, and we vacate and remand for the trial court to consider whether the officers exploited the trespass to obtain defendant\u2019s consent and the evidence sought to be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress for legal error. <em>State v. Mitchele, </em>240 Or App 86, 88, 251 P3d 760 (2010). We are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if there is sufficient evidence in the record to support them. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). Consistent with that standard, the facts are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In 2011, Portland police received a complaint of a suspected marijuana-growing operation at a house on Southeast Taggart Street. From the street, the house appears to be a one-story home with a front door and garage. On the right-hand side of the house is a small, waist-high chain link fence with a gate. There was nothing to indicate that there was any residence in the back of the house, and any normal visitor to the house without special knowledge would go to the front door and knock.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">However, the Portland police had previously investigated a marijuana-growing operation at that same address in 2008 and had learned that defendant lived in the basement and that the door to his living quarters was located in the backyard. As part of the 2008 investigation, Officer McGuire and another officer had gone to the house and knocked on the front door. The officers were met at the front door by defendant\u2019s mother, Hamblin, who gave the officers consent to enter and search the home. After searching the main part of the house, McGuire asked for permission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>search the basement, where defendant lives.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no access to <em>the </em>basement from inside Hamblin\u2019s house; it is only accessible by a lockable exterior door located at the back of the house. Accordingly, the door at the back of the house is the \u201cfront door\u201d of defendant\u2019s residence; however, the basement door does not have a separate address, door bell, or mailbox.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Initially, Hamblin refused to consent to a search of the basement, but then acquiesced after McGuire told her that he would obtain a search warrant. Before leading the officers to the basement, Hamblin phoned defendant and said something to the effect of \u201cthey\u2019re coming down.\u201d She then led the officers through the house and the garage to the fenced backyard where they met defendant at the basement door. During their search of the basement in 2008, the officers discovered an illegal marijuana-growing operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Three years later, when the police received the 2011 complaint of a suspected growing operation at the same house, the investigating officer, Officer Manzella, read McGuire\u2019s 2008 police report. McGuire\u2019s report stated that he had learned that the only way to get access to defendant\u2019s residence was to walk along the side of the house to the backyard. Manzella and McGuire decided to conduct a \u201cknock-and-talk\u201d to investigate defendant and the suspected growing operation at the house. McGuire shared the information that he had learned about the layout of the house in 2008 with Manzella. Thus, based on McGuire\u2019s knowledge, the officers knew that the only way to get into the basement was to go into the backyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">When Manzella and McGuire arrived at the house in 2011, they went directly to the backyard to knock on defendant\u2019s apartment door. To get to the door, the officers walked on a path alongside the house, through the closed gate, and into the fenced backyard. The screen door to defendant\u2019s apartment entrance was closed, but the main door was ajar. Manzella knocked on the screen door without identifying himself as a police officer. Defendant said, \u201cCome in.\u201d From where defendant was sitting in the apartment, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>could not see the officers at the door. Manzella testified that, once the officers were inside, defendant saw that they were police officers and seemed startled, but did not ask them to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">The officers asked defendant about his medical-marijuana status to see if he was in compliance. Defendant told the officers about the number of plants he had, and the officers requested his consent to search the apartment, which he granted. Upon searching, the officers found an out-of-compliance marijuana-growing site inside defendant\u2019s apartment. Manzella provided defendant with <em>Miranda </em>warnings and interviewed him, and defendant made incriminating statements. The state later charged defendant with the above-mentioned crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of his apartment, arguing that his constitutional rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution were violated when the officers entered the backyard without a search warrant or exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">At the suppression hearing, the state argued that the basement door was defendant\u2019s \u201cfront door\u201d because it was \u201cthe primary access point for the occupant of the residence in question.\u201d Because the law presumes that a person impliedly consents to the police coming to his or her front door, and because the officers had special knowledge that it was his \u201cfront door,\u201d the state contended that the officers were not trespassing when they entered the backyard. Alternatively, the state argued that, even if that door is not considered his \u201cfront door,\u201d and the officers\u2019 entry was presumptively a trespass, defendant\u2019s behavior (without checking who was at the door, he said \u201cCome in\u201d when the police knocked) demonstrated that he impliedly consented to people entering the backyard to contact him.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In response, defendant, citing <em>State v. Larson, </em>159 Or App 34, 41-42, 977 P2d 1175, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 318 (1999), argued that the officers\u2019 subjective knowledge that defendant\u2019s only door was located in the backyard was irrelevant because the test for whether a resident has impliedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>consented to the public approaching the residence is based on what an objective visitor would do. Accordingly, defendant argued, because there was nothing indicating to an objective visitor that he or she could go into the backyard to contact defendant, the officers\u2019 entry was a trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Ultimately, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. In explaining its ruling, the court focused on whether there was implied consent for the officers to go into the backyard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">\u201c[I]t\u2019s *** an extremely interesting case, given the cases that both sides cite in their motions. It is clear from the law and <em>[State v. Ohling, </em>70 Or App 249, 688 P2d 1384, <em>rev den, </em>298 Or 334 (1984),] that going to the back door of a dwelling is a trespass or a presumptive trespass. And in the absence of an express consent, implied consent or privilege, it\u2019s presumptively a trespass that then the State would have to overcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\u201cThe issue for the Court, really, is * * * is there an implied consent in some way. There\u2019s certainly not an express consent. There\u2019s not a sign that says visitors for [defendant] go to the rear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">\u201cThe officers don\u2019t possess a privilege that I can see.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The court then concluded that, because of the knowledge of the police officers, which any member of the public who had done business with defendant might also possess, the officers had not trespassed by going into the backyard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">\u201cBut the fact of the matter remains that for his residence, the back door is his front door. Although to the average person, there\u2019s nothing that would indicate that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">\u201cBut the officers in this case are not the average person. They\u2019re people with special knowledge, just like any previous visitor to the house, even probably a Girl Scout who [sold cookies] the year before, the next year would probably go straight to the back door and knock on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">\u201c[S]o it\u2019s hard for me to fault the officers for going straight to the door that they know is his door to his * * * residence. I don\u2019t know why they would do anything other, really, because their intent is not to talk to his mom but to talk to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>him. And when they knocked, he indicated his comfort level with that scenario by yelling, Come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u201cAnd under the circumstances of this case, the officers know that * * * the front of the house is not his front door; that his front door is in the back. And so I\u2019m making the distinction that they had knowledge and based on that knowledge, they did what normal people would do; and I\u2019ve found that the defendant had a comfort level with that, given his response.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The court did not decide the state\u2019s alternative position that, even if the officers\u2019 entry was presumptively a trespass, defendant\u2019s reaction to their knocking on the door indicated his implied consent to people coming to his door, and the state does not renew that argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Following the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion, defendant waived his right to a jury trial, and, after a stipulated facts trial, the court found him guilty of the above-mentioned crimes. Defendant timely appealed, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Article I, section 9, protects \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search or seizure [.]\u201d Among the privacy interests that are protected by Article I, section 9, a person\u2019s home is considered the \u201cquintessential domain protected by the constitutional guarantee against warrantless searches.\u201d <em>State v. Louis, </em>296 Or 57, 60, 672 P2d 708 (1983). Article I, section 9, \u201cprovides protection not only to an individual\u2019s house proper, but also to the area surrounding the house, known as the curtilage.\u201d <em>State v. Russo, </em>68 Or App 760, 763, 683 P2d 163 (1984); <em>see also State v. Baker, </em>350 Or 641, 650 n 7, 260 P3d 476 (2011) (explaining that \u201ccurtilage\u201d of a home is the land immediately surrounding and associated with a person\u2019s residence). Under the Oregon Constitution, a warrantless intrusion onto residential curtilage is presumptively a trespass, unless the entry is privileged or the defendant has given express or implied consent. <em>State v. Somfleth, </em>168 Or App 414, 424, 8 P3d 221 (2000). A trespassory intrusion onto the curtilage of a person\u2019s home violates Article I, section 9. <em>Ohling, </em>70 Or App at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The parties do not dispute that, when the officers entered the backyard of the house, they were intruding onto the curtilage of the residence. And, the state does not argue that the officers were privileged to enter the backyard or had defendant\u2019s express consent to do so. Rather, as the trial court identified, this case revolves around the legal question whether that intrusion was a trespass or, instead, the officers had implied consent to enter the backyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that, because the test for whether an individual has impliedly consented to the public\u2019s entry onto the curtilage of his or her residence is an objective one, the officers\u2019 prior, subjective knowledge that his apartment could be accessed only through the backyard is irrelevant to determining if defendant impliedly consented to such an entry. Accordingly, defendant argues, the trial court erred when it relied on that rationale in its ruling on his motion. Further, defendant argues that, applying the correct test, there was no objective indication that defendant had implicitly consented to visitors entering the backyard to access his door, and therefore, the officers\u2019 entry was a trespass and violated his right against unlawful searches.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">On appeal, the state relies entirely on its argument that the subjective knowledge of the officers provided them with implied consent to enter the backyard to access what they knew to be the only door to defendant\u2019s apartment. At oral argument, the state conceded that, if the test for implied consent is based on whether the general public would understand that there was an implicit invitation for them to contact defendant at that door, \u201cthen we can\u2019t show that there was anything about this *** door that would have reflected to the public that the public was generally invited back there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Thus boiled down, the precise issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in concluding that the officers\u2019 subjective knowledge that the door in the backyard was the only door to defendant\u2019s apartment could be the basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>implied consent to enter the backyard without a warrant. We conclude that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The state relies on the rule that a resident impliedly consents to members of the public going to his or her front door, so long as the resident has not \u201cmanifested an intent to forbid the intrusion of casual visitors onto the property.\u201d <em>State v. Cam, </em>255 Or App 1, 6, 296 P3d 578, <em>modified on recons, </em>256 Or App 146, 300 P3d 208, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 148 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). That presumption of implied consent derives from social norms and expectations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">\u201cDrivers who run out of gas, Girl Scouts selling cookies, and political candidates all go to front doors of residences on a more or less regular basis. Doing so is so common in this society, that, unless there are posted warnings, a fence, a moat filled with crocodiles, or other evidence of a desire to exclude casual visitors, the person living in the house has impliedly consented to the intrusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\"><em>Ohling, </em>70 Or App at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u201cConversely, also given prevailing norms, such a presumption of implied consent to enter is not ascribed to other areas of the curtilage.\u201d <em>Somfleth, </em>168 Or App at 425; <em>accord State v. Pierce, </em>226 Or App 336, 343, 203 P3d 343 (2009) (\u201cApproaches to points on the property other than a front door *** are generally not regarded as being approaches to which the occupant has impliedly consented.\u201d). Thus, for example, \u201c[g]oing to the back of the house is a different matter. Such an action is both less common and less acceptable in our society. There is no implied consent for a stranger to do so.\u201d <em>Ohling, </em>70 Or App at 253. Therefore, \u201cas a general matter, an officer may enter a front yard and knock on a front door, but an officer may not enter a backyard and knock on a back door,\u201d <em>State v. Unger, </em>252 Or App 478, 482, 287 P3d 1196 (2012), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>356 Or 59, 333 P3d 1009 (2014), unless the resident has manifested a contrary intent, <em>see Somfleth, </em>168 Or App at 425.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>We reject the state\u2019s contention that, because the officers knew that defendant\u2019s \u201cfront door\u201d was in the backyard, the presumption that a resident impliedly consents to the public approaching his or her front door applies in this case. That argument, based on the officers\u2019 subjective knowledge that defendant lived in the basement of the home and had a door leading out to the backyard, is inconsistent with our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">We have consistently stated that the presumption of implied consent to approach a resident\u2019s front door is based on social norms and whether an objective member of the public, <em>i.e., </em>a stranger, would understand there to be an implied invitation to approach the residence. For example, we recognized in <em>Somfleth </em>that \u201c[o]ne of the analytic difficulties in this area is that \u2018front yard\u2019 and \u2018backyard\u2019 are hardly self-defining terms,\u201d but we clarified that, when we use the term \u201cfront yard\u201d or \u201cfront door,\u201d we are referring \u201cto what an <em>objective </em>visitor would regard as being the primary entrance to the property.\u201d 168 Or App at 424 n 7 (emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Hockema, </em>264 Or App 625, 631, 333 P3d 1134, <em>rev pending </em>(2014) (stating issue as whether the signs and barriers the resident posted \u201cwere sufficient to objectively manifest defendant\u2019s intention to prohibit all casual visitors from entering the open driveway and approaching defendant\u2019s front door\u201d); <em>Larson, </em>159 Or App at 41-42 (explaining that, despite testimony from the defendant\u2019s neighbor in an apartment complex that a sign stating \u201cWe like you but <em>not </em>in our backyard. <em>Please </em>KEEP OUT!\u201d was not intended by her to exclude the police, \u201cthe test is an objective one and, viewed objectively, the words of the sign did not limit who it was intended to exclude\u201d (emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>original; internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Ohling, </em>70 Or App at 253 (discussing the curtilage presumptions in terms of what is acceptable in society for \u201cstrangers\u201d to do when approaching a person\u2019s house).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">At oral argument, the state argued that, because this case involves a multi-unit dwelling, our decision in <em>State v. Stafford, </em>184 Or App 674, 57 P3d 598 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 181 (2003), controls. We stated in <em>Stafford </em>that, in multiunit dwelling cases, \u201cwe look to the physical layout of the living units and the residents\u2019 use of the area in question\u201d to determine if there was implied consent. <em>Id. </em>at 678 (internal quotation marks omitted). The state leans heavily on the phrase \u201cuse of the area in question.\u201d Because the officers knew that defendant was using the door in the backyard as his \u201cfront door,\u201d the state argues that, under the <em>Stafford </em>rule, defendant\u2019s use of the door gave rise to defendant\u2019s implied consent to have visitors enter the backyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The problem with the state\u2019s argument is that <em>Stafford, </em>consistently with our other cases, requires application of an objective test when determining implied consent. <em>See Stafford, </em>184 Or App at 678 (listing the objective evidence that demonstrated implied consent to enter through the apartment building door in order to reach the door to an upstairs apartment and explaining that \u201c[t]he residents of the upstairs units neither posted signs nor took any other action to show that they intended to exclude visitors from the stairway\u201d). Accordingly, the fact that the officers knew that defendant was using the back door as his front door does not establish his implied consent absent a showing that an objective visitor, looking at the physical layout of the living units and the residents\u2019 use of the area, would also have concluded that he or she was impliedly invited to contact defendant at that door. Thus, the state\u2019s theory that the officers\u2019 subjective knowledge gave rise to implied consent to enter the backyard is faulty, regardless of whether the house is viewed as a single-unit dwelling or a multi-unit dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u201cThe state, as the proponent of the evidence, has the burden of proving an implicit invitation to public entry sufficient to overcome the presumption of trespass.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>226 Or App at 345. As noted earlier, the state conceded at oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>argument that, if the test for implied consent is an objective one, that is, whether an objective visitor would have understood that defendant impliedly invited the visitor to enter the backyard to contact defendant, \u201cthen we can\u2019t show that there was anything about this *** door that would have reflected to the public that the public was generally invited back there.\u201d That concession is consistent with the trial court\u2019s findings that \u201cany normal visitor to the house <em>without any special knowledge </em>would go to the front door and knock\u201d and that, \u201cif they were selling Girl Scout cookies or going door-to-door for donations or something, any normal person would look at the house and go to the front door. There would be nothing to indicate any residence in the back of the house.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we conclude that the officers\u2019 entry in this case was a trespass and a violation of defendant\u2019s right against a warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The state\u2019s only other argument on appeal is that, even assuming that the officers\u2019 entry onto the curtilage was unlawful, the police did not exploit or trade on that illegality to obtain defendant\u2019s consent to enter and search his residence, and therefore, the evidence should not be suppressed. However, because the trial court did not reach that issue, we vacate the judgment and remand for the trial court to consider whether the state exploited the trespass. <em>See State v. Hayes, </em>186 Or App 49, 56-57, 61 P3d 960 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005) (remanding case to the trial court for consideration of exploitation issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> In its factual findings, the trial court said that defendant\u2019s residence was \u201cfor lack of a better word,\u201d an \u201capartment in the basement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\"> Though defendant\u2019s motion below was based on the Oregon and federal constitutions, on appeal, defendant advances arguments only under the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\"> It is overly simplistic to view this case as one involving the collision of two rules concerning different parts of the curtilage (front doors versus backyards). Although \u201c[o]ur cases have treated location as, in effect, giving rise to rebuttable \u2018presumptions\u2019\u201d about trespass and consent, we have rejected the argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>our cases establish a \u201cfront yard only\u201d or, conversely, a \u201cbackyards are different\u201d principle. <em>Somfleth, </em>168 Or App at 424. Thus, in <em>Somfleth, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that, as a matter of law, implied consent does not extend to entry into the backyard. <em>Id. </em>Rather, we concluded that implicit in our case law \u201cis the principle that location (\u2018front yard\u2019 vs. \u2018side yard\u2019 vs. \u2018backyard\u2019) is one of a universe of circumstances to be considered in assessing whether a resident has implicitly consented to an invasion of the curtilage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424. That is so, because, in any case, a resident can abrogate either presumption (the presumption of implied consent to approach the front door or the presumption that entries into other parts of the curtilage are trespasses) to indicate an intent to exclude, in the case of front door approaches, or to invite, in the case of other approaches. <em>Id. </em>at 425.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
