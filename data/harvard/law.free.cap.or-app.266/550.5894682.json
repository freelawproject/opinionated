J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjQ\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for violating a stalking protective order (SPO), ORS 163.750, and an adjudication finding defendant in contempt of court, ORS 33.065, both in connection with a letter defendant sent to a person protected by an SPO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant assigns error to, <em>inter alia, </em>the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal (MJOAs) on both charges. As explained below, we conclude that defendant was entitled to acquittal on both charges because, while the state charged defendant with causing an <em>\u201cobject\u201d </em>to be delivered to the protected person, the evidence at trial showed only that defendant had sent a <em>letter </em>to that person, and a \u201cwritten communication,\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(d), is not an \u201cobject\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.750(l)(c). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment as to both charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The relevant facts, for purposes of our review of the denial of the motions for judgment of acquittal, are undisputed. Defendant and the complainant, M, dated. After their relationship ended, defendant sent M hundreds of e-mails and text messages and, on at least one occasion, sat outside M\u2019s house and refused to leave. M eventually sought an SPO, which the trial court issued in February 2011. The final SPO barred defendant from \u201cany contacts\u201d with M, and, as relevant here, explicitly defined prohibited \u201ccontacts\u201d as including \u201csending or making written communications in any form to [M],\u201d and \u201cdelivering directly or through a third person any object to the home, property, place of work or school of [M].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">On December 12, 2011, defendant sent a letter, via the postal service, to M\u2019s residence. The letter, which was directed to M and her family, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry for what I put you and your family through as well as my own. Words cannot express how truly sorry I[] am for the anxiety, frustration and inconvenience I\u2019ve caused you. I would give my life to protect you. I was repulsively selfish in my actions and didn\u2019t understand God\u2019s Love. His love is for us to put others needs before our own and to forgive one another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">\u201cI have and will continue to leave you alone in peace. A second chance is all I ask to be free from you and to live life once more. I write you in the hope that we may place our anger and bitterness aside and to forgive one another as [our] Heavenly Father would and move on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u201cSincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201cVery Respectfully,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u201c[defendant\u2019s signature]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">\u201c2 Corinthians 2:5-11\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">M received the letter on December 15, 2011, and promptly reported it to the police. Shortly thereafter, defendant was charged by information with violating the SPO, ORS 163.750 (Count 1), and contempt of court, ORS 33.065 (Count 2). With respect to Count 1, the original charging instrument alleged that defendant violated the SPO \u201cby sending or making <em>written communication </em>to [M], thereby creating a reasonable apprehension regarding the person [al] safety of [M].\u201d (Emphasis added.) With respect to Count 2, the information alleged that defendant \u201cunlawfully and willfully disobey[ed] an order of the Lane County Circuit Court, by contacting [M].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">The state subsequently filed an amended information\u2014 whose allegations form the predicate for our review of the sufficiency of the state\u2019s proof at trial. The amended information included revisions to the allegations of both counts\u2014 those revisions were not only material, but ultimately (as we will explain) of dispositive significance. Specifically, the amended information alleged, as to both counts, that defendant violated the SPO by \u201cby delivering through a third party an <em>object </em>to the home * * * of [M].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">At trial, the state adduced evidence that defendant had sent the letter to M\u2019s home. The letter and its envelope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>were introduced into evidence, and M testified as to having received the letter on December 15, 2011. Deputy May, who had responded to M\u2019s call that day, corroborated M\u2019s testimony and testified that when he spoke with defendant the next day, on December 16, defendant admitted to having sent the letter. There was no evidence that defendant caused anything other than the letter to be delivered to M.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, asserting that, because the December 15 letter was a \u201cwritten communication\u201d within the meaning of ORS 163.730(3)(d), the state was required, under ORS 163.750(l)(c), to show that the letter had \u201ccreated reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the protected person\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 and that the state had adduced no proof that M or her family had experienced such apprehension. The state countered that, because the letter was an \u201cobject\u201d within the meaning of ORS 163.730(3)(k), ORS 163.750(l)(c) was inapposite and, thus, proof of \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d was immaterial. The trial court ultimately agreed with the state that the letter was an \u201cobject\u201d and denied the MJOAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The jury subsequently found defendant guilty of the SPO violation, and the court rendered an adjudication of guilt as to contempt of court. Defendant appeals the ensuing judgment. On appeal, the parties essentially reiterate their arguments before the trial court. Central to the dispute is the proper construction of the terms \u201cwritten * * * communication in any form,\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(d), and \u201cany object,\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(k), for the purposes of the application of ORS 163.750(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">ORS 163.730(3) sets out 11 categories of \u201ccontact\u201d that may violate an SPO. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201c\u2018Contact\u2019 includes but is not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201c(a) Coming into the visual or physical presence of the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201c(b) Following the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">\u201c(c) Waiting outside the home, property, place of work or school of the other person or of a member of that person\u2019s family or household;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u201c(d) <em>Sending or making written or electronic communications in any form to the other </em>person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">\u201c(e) Speaking with the other person by any means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201c(f) Communicating with the other person through a third person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201c(g) Committing a crime against the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201c(h) Communicating with a third person who has some relationship to the other person with the intent of affecting the third person\u2019s relationship with the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201c(i) Communicating with business entities with the intent of affecting some right or interest of the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">\u201c(j) Damaging the other person\u2019s home, property, place of work or school;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">\u201c(k) <em>Delivering directly or through a third person any object to the home, property, place of work or school of the other person </em>[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">(Emphasis and boldface added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">ORS 163.750(1), in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-13\">\u201cA person commits the crime of violating a court\u2019s stalking protective order when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">\u201c(a) The person has been served with a court\u2019s stalking protective order * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-15\">\u201c(b) The person, subsequent to the service of the order, has engaged intentionally, knowingly or recklessly in conduct prohibited by the order; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-16\">\u201c(c) If the conduct is prohibited contact as defined by ORS 163.730(3)(d), (e), (f), (h) or (i), the subsequent conduct has created reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of a person protected by the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-17\">Thus, by its terms, ORS 163.750(1) provides that a criminal violation occurs when a person subject to a valid SPO intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly engages in conduct prohibited by that SPO. Additionally, subsection (l)(c) imposes, for certain types of prohibited \u201ccontacts,\u201d an additional <em>element </em>\u2014 viz., that the conduct \u201ccreated reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety\u201d of the protected individual. Specifically, that additional element applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\u201c[s]ending or making written *** communications in any form\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(d), but does not apply to \u201c[d]elivering *** any object to [the protected person\u2019s] home,\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Therein lies the rub: For purposes of ORS 163.750(l)(c), is a letter an \u201cobject,\u201d a \u201cwritten communication\u201d \u2014 or, possibly, both? As he did before the trial court, defendant contends that a letter is a written communication, not an object. Defendant asserts that that understanding comports with the legislature\u2019s intent, in response to constitutional concerns, see, <em>e.g., State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 977 P2d 379 (1999), to impose qualitatively different requirements for alleged violations arising from contacts involving expression. Treating letters as \u201cobjects\u201d would, defendant posits, circumvent that constitutionally informed legislative design.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The state remonstrates that the two categories are not mutually exclusive and, indeed, that, as a matter of plain meaning, a letter qualifies both as a \u201cwritten communication\u201d and (because it is \u201ctangible\u201d) as an \u201cobject.\u201d That understanding, the state suggests, is consistent with the \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d requirement, because sending a physical object such as a letter to the victim is \u201clikely to create greater apprehension than an electronic communication would.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In resolving the matter, we employ, of course, the methodology prescribed in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). The legislature\u2019s intent is our lodestar. In discerning that intent, we begin by examining the text of the statute in context, along with any pertinent legislative history. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We begin by acknowledging the obvious: As a matter of plain meaning, without regard to the statutory design and context, a letter is both a \u201cwritten communication\u201d and, because it is tangible, an \u201cobject.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the most basic textual level, the ostensible breadth of both terms is reinforced by their adjectival garnishes: \u201cin any form\u201d and \u201cany.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Text, however, cannot be viewed in isolation, but must, instead, be considered in the totality of the statutory framework. That inquiry is informed by rules (or, more precisely, principles) of construction that bear directly on the interpretation of the statutory provision in context. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). Here, two such rules of construction are especially pertinent. The first rule is a general assumption that, when the legislature employs \u201cdifferent terms\u201d within the same statute, it \u201cintends different meanings for those terms.\u201d <em>State v. Newell, </em>238 Or App 385, 392-93, 242 P3d 709 (2010) (internal citation omitted). The second rule is that, \u201c[a]s a general rule, we construe a statute in a manner that gives effect, if possible, to all its provisions.\u201d <em>Crystal Communications, Inc. v. Dept. of Rev., </em>353 Or 300, 311, 297 P3d 1256 (2013); <em>State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 418, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005) (\u201c[W]e assume that the legislature did not intend any portion of its enactments to be meaningless surplusage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In this case, the state\u2019s proposed construction is incompatible with those principles in combination. To be sure, as a literal matter, \u201cwritten communications\u201d (as distinct from \u201celectronic communications\u201d) and \u201cobjects\u201d are not congruent, but, in the state\u2019s construction, the former is subsumed entirely within the latter, effectively rendering the former nugatory. The state\u2019s proposed construction could sanction subterfuge \u2014 that is, any time a letter, or other tangible \u201cwritten communication,\u201d did <em>not </em>create \u201creasonable apprehension,\u201d the state could simply elect to proceed on an \u201cobject\u201d allegation, circumventing the application of ORS 163.750(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Finally, legislative history confirms the constitutional sensibility underlying the statutory design. ORS 163.730(3), introduced as Senate Bill (SB) 833, was enacted by the 1993 Legislative Assembly, as part of a general anti-stalking scheme. Several anti-stalking bills had been introduced during the 1993 legislative session. SB 833 ultimately became law, but its language, as amended, was largely drawn from House Bill 2412 (1993), and was the product of collaboration amongst legislators from the House and Senate, law enforcement interests, the criminal defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>bar, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and victims\u2019 advocates. <em>See </em>Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 833, May 4, 1993, Tape 140, Side A; Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections, SB 833, June 9, 1993, Tape 126, Side A.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">SB 833, as enacted, was designed to accommodate those constituencies\u2019 divergent interests. First, the legislature set out to create a manageable, flexible, and effective statutory scheme, with both civil and criminal components, to enable law enforcement officers, courts, and victims to combat stalking. Second, because the bill restricted speech\u2014 to the extent that it authorized courts to prohibit communications by issuing SPOs and criminalized communications that constituted stalking or violated an existing SPO \u2014 the legislature was particularly concerned with, and sought to foreclose, potential constitutional problems with the bill. As Committee Counsel Bill Taylor explained, the measure, as enacted, \u201creflects the work done by district attorneys, the criminal defense bar, and the ACLU on this issue of making the bill constitutional.\u201d Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 833, May 4, 1993, Tape 140, Side A (statement of Committee Counsel Bill Taylor). Similarly, Senator Ron Cease, the chief sponsor of SB 833, explained that the amendments were intended to address issues identified by the ACLU, which had to do with the \u201cnature of the crime itself.\u201d Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 833, May 4, 1993, Tape 140, Side A (testimony of Sen Ron Cease).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The distinction, embedded in ORS 163.730(3), between communicative and noncommunicative contact, as well as the concomitant inclusion of the \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d element for communicative contacts that violate an SPO, were crafted to comply with Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution. <em>See, e.g., State v. Robertson, </em>293 Or 402, 649 P2d 569 (1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prohibitions on communicative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u201ccontacts\u201d were designed to be content neutral, to focus exclusively on the effect <em>{viz., </em>\u201creasonable apprehension\u201d) of such contacts on the recipient, and to restrict only non-privileged expression. Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 833, May 4, 1993, Tape 140, Side A (statement of David Fidanque, ACLU); Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 833, May 5, 1993, Tape 142, Side A (statement of Rep Kevin Mannix); Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 833, May 5, 1993, Tape 143, Side A (statements of Rep Kevin Mannix and David Fidanque).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In sum, the totality of the statutory design and the legislative history demonstrates that a \u201cwritten communication,\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(d), is not an \u201cobject,\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(k), for purposes of ORS 163.750(1). Indeed, to construe the statutes otherwise would not only contradict the patent legislative intent, but also implicate precisely the same constitutional pitfalls that the legislature sought to avoid. <em>See Pete\u2019s Mountain Homeowners v. Ore. Water Resources, </em>236 Or App 507, 522, 238 P3d 395 (2010) (\u201cWhen confronted with competing, reasonable constructions of a statute, and there is even a tenable argument that one of them would render the statute unconstitutional, we generally favor the other construction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Thus, defendant\u2019s December 15, 2011, letter to M and her family was not an \u201cobject\u201d for purposes of the crime of violating a stalking protective order, ORS 163.750(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As noted, in the amended information, the state prosecuted solely on the allegation that defendant had delivered (by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>way of a third party) an \u201cobject,\u201d and there was no proof at trial that defendant delivered, or caused to be delivered, any item, other than the letter, to the protected person. <em>See </em>266 Or App at 552. Thus, defendant was entitled to an acquittal on the charge of violating the stalking protective order. The same is true with respect to the contempt charge, which, similarly, was predicated solely upon the alleged delivery of an \u201cobject.\u201d Accordingly, both the criminal conviction and the contempt adjudication must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">In Case No. 211200312, reversed; in Case No. 211200311, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\"> On appeal, defendant challenges the conviction and sanction in Case No. 211200312. Although defendant was also convicted of a second SPO violation and found in contempt in connection with a separate incident in Case No. 211200311, defendant does not challenge that conviction or sanction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> Our disposition obviates any consideration of defendant\u2019s assignment of error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the charge of violating ORS 163.750.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\"> Defendant, as the respondent in the SPO proceeding, did not appeal the SPO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b573-11\"> Those statutes are set out in the text below. 266 Or App at 553-54.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\"> Indeed, given the statutory text\u2019s distinction between \u201cwritten\u201d and \u201celectronic\u201d communications, it would appear that the former are necessarily tangible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\"> Similarly, the determination as to whether an SPO or a stalking-related criminal conviction is challengeable on constitutional grounds tracks the statutory distinction between communicative and noncommunicative contacts. <em>See, e.g., State v. Maxwell, </em>165 Or App 467, 475-76, 998 P2d 680 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 632 (2002) (disallowing constitutional challenge to conviction predicated upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>a noncommunicative contact, where entire course of prohibited conduct involved communicative and noncommunicative contacts but the defendant was charged only with violating the SPO by \u201ccoming into the visual and/or physical presence of [the victim],\u201d based on the defendant\u2019s physical presence at the victim\u2019s church).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b578-10\"> There is, however, one case that potentially supports an interpretation under which ORS 163.730(3)(k) is broad enough to include certain documents. <em>See State v. Buchalski, </em>264 Or App 142, 144, 331 P3d 1049, <em>modified on other grounds on recons, </em>266 Or App 225, 337 P3d 923 (2014) (upholding convictions that were predicated upon allegations that, by causing a civil complaint to be delivered to the victim, the defendant \u201crecklessly violated the SPO by delivering an object to the victim\u2019s home * * * and workplace\u201d). <em>Buchalski, </em>however, is of limited relevance here, because in that case, we were not asked to determine, and did not purport to resolve, whether a pleading is an \u201cobject,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cwritten communication,\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.750(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
