We review for legal error. <em>See State v. Lowell, </em>249 Or App 364, 367-68, 277 P3d 588, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012) (concluding that the trial court committed legal error by failing to exclude detective\u2019s comments regarding defendant\u2019s credibility). We agree with defendant that the trial court erred by failing to exclude Ober\u2019s testimony that defendant, during a police interrogation, \u201cwas dishonest [,]\u201d \u201cwas untruthful[,]\u201d \u201cwas lying about the whole situation[,]\u201d and \u201cwas selectively leaving out details that he thought [were] harmful to him.\u201d We also agree with defendant that the trial court\u2019s error was not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse and remand defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 1, remand for resentencing, and otherwise affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The record discloses the following facts. Defendant\u2019s neighbor, Graham, was alerted by another person that defendant was assaulting defendant\u2019s girlfriend. Graham went down to a neighbor\u2019s property and attempted to stop the assault by yelling at defendant from beneath defendant\u2019s window. Defendant left his apartment, went down to the neighbor\u2019s property, got into an altercation with Graham, and stabbed Graham with a carving fork. Graham died on the scene, and defendant fled to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Approximately three years later, defendant turned himself in and was interrogated by Ober. During the interrogation, defendant told Ober that he was intoxicated on the night in question and that he remembered little about his actions because he had \u201cblanked out.\u201d Defendant was charged with felony assault in the fourth degree and murder, and he raised the defense of voluntary intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">At trial, Ober testified extensively about his interrogation of defendant. To elicit that testimony, the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>posed a series of questions about specific parts of the interrogation, asked Ober whether he had \u201cconfronted\u201d defendant with statements that were inconsistent with defendant\u2019s claim that he had \u201cblanked out,\u201d and solicited Ober\u2019s opinion about whether defendant\u2019s statements were contradictory. Although Ober provided extensive testimony at trial, we set forth only those parts of his testimony that are relevant to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">During direct examination, the prosecutor engaged in the following exchange with Ober:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] What was [defendant\u2019s] demeanor in this interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">\u201c[OBER:] He was very nonchalant, very casual. He kind of smiled a lot, laughed a lot at seemingly, you know, inappropriate times. He was polite and courteous but he didn\u2019t appear to be very serious about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Later, but still during direct examination, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] And what was his demeanor at this point in the interview? Was he still very nonchalant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">\u201c[OBER:] Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">During cross-examination, defense counsel pursued the following line of questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] And you described his attitude as nonchalant. * * * Is that right, that you said he was nonchalant when you interviewed him in San Diego?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-12\">\u201c[OBER:] Yeah. He didn\u2019t seem to be too concerned about it, nonchalant. In fact, when we met him at the border he kind of smiled, looked at us, hesitated, kind of turned around, kind of played with us whether he was going to cross the border or not, and then that attitude continued throughout the interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-14\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Okay. And so is it possible that that\u2019s a coping mechanism?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-15\">\u201c[OBER:] I don\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] This nonchalant attitude, is that maybe the way that he\u2019s coping with an extremely stressful situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">\u201c[OBER:] I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Finally, during redirect examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] Counsel asked you if the defendant\u2019s smiling, nonchalant, relaxed atmosphere was some sort of coping mechanism. Have you interviewed a lot of people, Detective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">\u201cHave you seen people [employ] coping mechanisms, Detective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">\u201c[OBER:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] And in your opinion, is that what this defendant was doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-12\">\u201c[OBER:] I thought that it was more his way of trying to figure out what we know, listening to what he\u2019s confronted with, and then responding in a way that would help him in his best interest. <em>I think that he was dishonest, </em>that he was choosing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-13\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] I\u2019m going to object. I don\u2019t think that he can state an opinion as to what \u2014 He can say what was said. He can say if it\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think he can say that. That\u2019s his opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-15\">\u201c[OBER:] <em>I think he was dishonest. I think he was untruthful. I think he was lying about the whole situation and he was selectively leaving out details that he thought was harmful to him. </em>He\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. You\u2019ve answered it enough. We don\u2019t want to get to credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-17\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] And again, I want to interpose an objection on the record to that last answer. It\u2019s a comment on credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u201cBY [PROSECUTOR] (Continuing)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\">\u201cJust to be clear, Detective, are you trying to comment on the defendant\u2019s credibility in any way, shape, or form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">\u201c[OBER:] No. I\u2019m trying \u2014 observing what I thought his behavior was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Defendant did not testify at trial. During closing argument, the prosecutor argued that defendant\u2019s conduct was intentional, noted defendant\u2019s claim that he did not remember some of what had happened on the night in question, and stated, for example, that defendant \u201cseems to remember things differently when really pressed.\u201d Defendant was convicted of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred by failing to exclude Ober\u2019s comments on defendant\u2019s credibility as set forth above. He further argues that that error was not harmless because the jury\u2019s verdict on the murder charge turned on the jury\u2019s assessment of whether defendant acted intentionally, rather than recklessly, and the jury\u2019s determination \u201cwas almost entirely a matter of its assessment of defendant\u2019s credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The state \u201cdoes not dispute\u201d that Ober\u2019s testimony that defendant \u201cwas dishonest [,]\u201d \u201cwas untruthful [,]\u201d and \u201cwas lying\u201d would have been inadmissible if it \u201chad been elicited during direct examination.\u201d Nevertheless, the state argues that that testimony was admissible as rebuttal evidence \u2014 that is, it was admissible because it was elicited during the prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination of Ober to rebut defense counsel\u2019s suggestion, made during cross-examination, that defendant displayed a \u201cnonchalant\u201d attitude as a coping mechanism to deal with stress. Thus, according to the state, \u201cdefense counsel opened the door to [Ober] opining, to the contrary, that defendant was being \u2018dishonest\u2019 and manipulative for strategic purposes.\u201d The state further argues that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">The Oregon Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[w]e reject testimony from a witness about the credibility of another witness [.]\u201d <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983). Thus, under Oregon law, \u201ca witness, expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court has also stated, \u201cWe have said before, and we will say it again, but this time with <em>emphasis </em>\u2014 we <em>really mean it </em>***. The assessment of credibility is for the trier of fact[.]\u201d <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 629, 756 P2d 620 (1988) (emphasis added). Thus, as time has gone on, the court has \u201camplified the importance of that rule[.]\u201d <em>State v. Salas-Juarez, </em>264 Or App 57, 63, 329 P3d 805 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">\u201cApplying that principle is a straightforward matter when one witness states directly that he or she believes another witness, or that the other witness is honest or truthful. However, statements that fall short of such overt vouching also may be impermissible.\u201d <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 357, 234 P3d 117 (2010) (concluding that health care professionals\u2019 testimony regarding child victims of sexual abuse was impermissible vouching). Under the principle set forth in <em>Lupoli, </em>\u201ca witness at trial may not comment on the credibility of another person regarding statements made by the other person, even if the other person is not a witness at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Brooks, </em>247 Or App 676, 681 n 2, 270 P3d 388, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 265 (2012) (emphases omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">As noted, the state here \u201cdoes not dispute\u201d that the challenged testimony would ordinarily be inadmissible. That position is well considered, given that Ober directly commented on defendant\u2019s credibility. <em>See Lowell, </em>249 Or App at 366-68 (trial court committed plain error by admitting detective\u2019s testimony commenting on the defendant\u2019s credibility, including that the detective \u201cdidn\u2019t think that [the defendant] was being very honest\u201d during the investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The state nevertheless argues that that testimony was admissible because defendant \u201copened the door\u201d to Ober\u2019s comments. To support that contention, the state cites three cases: <em>State v. Miranda, </em>309 Or 121, 128, 786 P2d 155, <em>cert den, </em>498 US 879 (1990) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s own inquiry on direct examination into the contents of otherwise inadmissible statements opens the door to further inquiry on cross-examination relating to those same statements.\u201d); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>342 Or 596, 622, 157 P3d 198 (2007), <em>cert den, </em>552 US 1113 (2008) (\u201cDefendant does not dispute that a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>may open the door to evidence that has been suppressed.\u201d); and <em>State v. Robinson, </em>244 Or App 368, 381, 260 P3d 671 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 33 (2012) (\u201c[0]nce defendant elicited testimony suggesting that he had refused [the breath test] only because he could not obtain counsel, the door was open for the prosecutor to comment on defendant\u2019s reasons for refusing the test.\u201d) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The state\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. First, none of the state\u2019s cited cases stands for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s questioning during cross-examination, such as occurred in this case, \u201copens the door\u201d for a witness to then comment on a defendant\u2019s credibility. Although a defendant\u2019s trial strategy may \u201copen the door\u201d to otherwise inadmissible evidence in some cases, a defendant\u2019s trial strategy does not, in every case, \u201copen the door\u201d to otherwise inadmissible evidence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Moller, </em>217 Or App 49, 53-54, 174 P3d 1063 (2007) (rejecting the state\u2019s argument that a \u201cdefendant \u2018opens the door\u2019 to testimony about a decision to invoke his constitutional rights merely by denying that he committed the crime charged\u201d). The state cites no principle from <em>Middleton </em>or its progeny that supports its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Second, the state does not cogently explain, and we do not understand, how a defendant \u201copens the door\u201d to a witness\u2019s comments on a defendant\u2019s credibility by inquiring whether the defendant may have displayed a \u201cnonchalant\u201d attitude as a coping mechanism to deal with a stressful interrogation. Defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Ober, which sought to suggest that defendant\u2019s \u201cnonchalant\u201d interaction with Ober might have been due to stress, at most could have \u201copened the door\u201d to questions on redirect examination about whether defendant appeared to be under stress. The inquiry did not \u201copen the door\u201d to a different topic \u2014 that is, whether defendant was being truthful. In other words, defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Ober did not \u201copen the door\u201d to credibility testimony because defendant\u2019s cross-examination related to defendant\u2019s demeanor, not to his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Again, we highlight the fact that the Oregon Supreme Court has \u201camplified the importance\u201d of the rule prohibiting comments on credibility, <em>Salas-Juarez, </em>264 Or App at 63, stating, \u201cWe have said before, and we will say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>it again, but this time with <em>emphasis </em>\u2014 we <em>really mean it </em>***. The assessment of credibility is for the trier of fact[.]\u201d Milbradt, 305 Or at 629 (emphasis added). Indeed, the court has even suggested that if counsel attempts to elicit such testimony, a trial judge, <em>\u201csua sponte, </em>should summarily cut off the inquiry before a jury is contaminated by it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\">In light of the importance of the principle articulated by the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Middleton </em>and then emphasized by the court again in <em>Milbradt, </em>we reject the state\u2019s argument and conclude that the state was not permitted to offer, in response to defendant\u2019s cross-examination questioning that suggested that defendant\u2019s \u201cnonchalant\u201d interaction with Ober may have been due to stress, Ober\u2019s testimony that defendant, during the interrogation, \u201cwas dishonest!,]\u201d \u201cwas untruthful!,]\u201d \u201cwas lying about the whole situation!,]\u201d and \u201cwas selectively leaving out details that he thought [were] harmful to him.\u201d To allow the state to offer that evidence in this case would be to undermine the rule against the admission of comments on credibility. Ober\u2019s testimony was inadmissible as a matter of law, and the trial court erred by failing to exclude it.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Because we conclude that the trial court erred by failing to exclude Ober\u2019s testimony that defendant \u201cwas dishonest!,]\u201d \u201cwas untruthful!,]\u201d \u201cwas lying about the whole situation!,]\u201d and \u201cwas selectively leaving out details that he thought [were] harmful to him!,]\u201d we must determine whether that error was harmless. The state acknowledges that \u201can error in admitting an improper comment on credibility is usually determined to be prejudicial, such as to warrant a reversal and remand for a new trial.\u201d <em>See State v. Watts, </em>259 Or App 560, 314 P3d 991 (2013) (trial court\u2019s error in admitting a police officer\u2019s comment on defendant\u2019s credibility was not harmless, where the focus of the analysis was the jury\u2019s determination whether defendant acted with the requisite knowledge). The state argues, however, that the error here was harmless because Ober\u2019s testimony \u201cmerely stated what already was obvious\u201d and defendant\u2019s \u201cown credibility was not directly at issue\u201d due to the fact that defendant did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>We will affirm a judgment of conviction, despite the erroneous admission of evidence, if there is little likelihood that the error affected the verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). When evaluating whether evidentiary error is harmless, we do not weigh the evidence or act as factfinder, but instead look at the likely effect of error on the verdict. <em>Id. </em>We first determine the issue to which our harmless error analysis applies. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>225 Or App 545, 550, 202 P3d 225 (2009). We then analyze the erroneously admitted evidence in light of other evidence in the record that relates to that issue. <em>Id. </em>If the erroneously admitted evidence relates to a central factual issue in the case, rather than to a tangential issue, that evidence is more likely to have affected the jury\u2019s determination. <em>Id.; see also State v. Marrington, </em>335 Or 555, 566, 73 P3d 911 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Here, the issue to which our harmlessness analysis applies is the jury\u2019s determination that defendant was guilty of murder under ORS 163.115(1). A necessary element of the offense of murder is the requisite intent. As we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">\u201cAn action is done \u2018intentionally\u2019 when \u2018a person acts with a conscious objective to cause the result or engage in the conduct so described.\u2019 ORS 161.085(7). ORS 163.115(l)(a) defines \u2018murder\u2019 to include an intentional act of criminal homicide. \u2018Criminal homicide,\u2019 in turn, is defined by ORS 163.005(1) to include \u2018intentionally *** causing] the death of another human being.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\"><em>State v. Gee, </em>224 Or App 635, 639, 198 P3d 950 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 157 (2009) (ellipsis and brackets in original). Thus, to find defendant guilty of murder under ORS 163.115(1), the jury must have found that defendant acted intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">As noted, defendant raised the defense of voluntary intoxication. He attempted to show that, although he \u201c\u2018likely committed the acts for which he [was] arrested,\u201d\u2019 he remembered little about his actions on the night in question because he had \u201cblanked out,\u201d and thus, \u201che was too drunk to form the intent\u201d to commit murder. The state attempted to prove the opposite \u2014 that defendant acted with the requisite intent to commit murder \u2014 and challenged defendant\u2019s contention that he had \u201cblanked out.\u201d For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>during closing argument, the prosecutor stated that defendant \u201cseems to remember things differently when really pressed. It\u2019s not just convenient that he blacks out for the things that he could be held responsible for, what he did to [his girlfriend], what he did to [Graham]. He didn\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d She further argued that \u201cdefendant cannot have it both ways, ladies and gentlemen. You heard that interview. [Defendant stated,] T don\u2019t remember anything. I was too drunk, but I remember enough to know I was too drunk.\u2019\u201d She followed up by stating, \u201cYou just can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d Then, she argued, \u201c[S]o while [defense] [counsel wants you to focus on this wasn\u2019t intentional and knowing, it was reckless, all he did, whatever he did was reckless, that\u2019s not true. He meant to * * * confront [Graham] like a man, and he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Thus, the erroneous admission of evidence in this case relates to a central factual issue that was the lynchpin of the defense \u2014 whether defendant had \u201cblanked out\u201d and was too intoxicated to form the intent to commit murder. The jury\u2019s determination of that issue hinged on defendant\u2019s credibility, and we conclude that the trial court\u2019s error was not harmless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the improperly admitted evidence\u2014 Ober\u2019s testimony that defendant, during the interrogation, \u201cwas dishonest [,]\u201d \u201cwas untruthful [,]\u201d \u201cwas lying about the whole situation [,]\u201d and \u201cwas selectively leaving out details that he thought [were] harmful to him\u201d \u2014 may have \u201ccolored the jury\u2019s consideration of that issue [,]\u201d <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>247 Or App 747, 755, 271 P3d 150 (2012), we cannot say that there was little likelihood that the trial court\u2019s error affected the verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Conviction on Count 1 reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-8\"> ORS 163.115(1) provides, in part, that criminal homicide constitutes murder \u201c[w]hen it is committed intentionally!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-9\"> Defendant also pleaded no contest to and was convicted of fourth-degree felony assault of his girlfriend as charged in Count 2. That conviction is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b767-6\"> In so concluding, we note that the state cites no precedent from our case law to support its argument that the obviousness of a defendant\u2019s credibility is a factor to be considered in a harmlessness analysis or that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless because defendant\u2019s \u201cown credibility was not directly at issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\"> During direct examination, the prosecutor also asked Ober if he had \u201cbeen lied to on occasion!,]\u201d Ober replied that he had, and defendant appears to assign error to the trial court\u2019s failure to sustain his objection to that testimony. Because we agree with defendant that the trial court erred in failing to exclude Ober\u2019s other comments, we need not address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
