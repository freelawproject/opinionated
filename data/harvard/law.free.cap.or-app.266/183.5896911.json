That order concluded that claimant had failed to demonstrate that she was \u201csignificantly limited in the repetitive use\u201d of her hip such as would entitle her to compensation under that rule. Claimant contends that the board erred in failing to either identify or apply a proper interpretation of the term \u201csignificantly limited.\u201d Because we conclude that the board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial reason, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The facts are undisputed. After claimant was injured at work, SAIF, her employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, accepted her claim for \u2014 among other things \u2014 a left-hip strain. One of the issues raised during the process of closing her claim was whether claimant was entitled to additional compensation for a \u201cchronic condition impairment\u201d in her left hip. That determination is controlled by OAR 436-035-0019, which provides: \u201c(1) A worker is entitled to a 5% chronic condition impairment value for each applicable body part, when a preponderance of medical opinion establishes that, due to a chronic and permanent medical condition, the worker is significantly limited in the repetitive use of [a list of body parts that includes the hip].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">As part of the claim-closure process, Dr. Franklin Wong examined claimant. SAIF sent Wong a check-the-box letter, asking him various questions about claimant\u2019s medical condition. One of those questions asked: \u201cWhich best describes the worker\u2019s limitation in repetitive use of the left hip for the accepted condition(s)?\u201d Underneath that question were three boxes, labeled \u201c[n]o limitation,\u201d \u201c[s]ome limitation,\u201d and \u201c[significant limitation.\u201d Wong checked the \u201c[s]ome limitation\u201d box.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Claimant\u2019s attorney sent Wong a \u201cconcurrence letter,\u201d asking Wong to memorialize his understanding of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>previous conversation of theirs concerning claimant\u2019s left-hip condition. Claimant\u2019s attorney asked Wong whether he agreed with the following characterization of their discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\">\u201cI asked you specifically what limitation you would anticipate. You indicated that <em>[claimant] would have difficulty with repetitive squatting, walking long distances and static standing for long periods of time. You indicated that, as a physician, the term \u2018significant\u2019 means that there is a major loss of function as a result of limitation. </em>Because SAIF Corporation only gave you three choices \u2014 no limitation, some limitation or significant limitation \u2014 you selected some limitation. We discussed the fact that neither the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Division nor the Board has provided any guidance with what the word \u2018significant\u2019 actually means, but that the dictionary definition of the word \u2018significant\u2019 merely means important, weighty, or notable. You indicated that it would be beneficial if someone would provide more guidance with how the word \u2018significant\u2019 was supposed to be interpreted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">(Emphasis added.) Wong indicated that the statement accurately reflected both their conversation and his \u201copinion to a reasonable medical probability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Claimant\u2019s attorney also sent a letter to claimant\u2019s attending physician, Dr. Hai Tran. That letter first asked Tran whether he agreed with the \u201cfindings, opinion, and diagnosis (es)\u201d that Wong had expressed in the concurrence letter; Tran responded that he did. It then asked, \u201cAssuming the definition of \u2018significant\u2019 applies (important, weighty, or notable), would you consider [the] limitations discussed on page 2 <em>[i.e., </em>difficulty with squatting, walking, and standing] to be significant?\u201d Tran initially responded \u201cyes\u201d to that question, but then crossed out that response and wrote: \u201cthere\u2019s no clear criteria for \u2018significant\u2019 therefore unable to comment either way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">SAIF issued a notice of closure that did not include, in its calculation of compensability, the five-percent chronic-condition impairment value permitted by OAR 436-035-0019. Claimant sought reconsideration of that decision before the Administrative Review Unit (ARU), which functions as a part of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (the department), the agency that administers the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Workers\u2019 Compensation Division. The ARU issued an order that did not assign the impairment value on the ground that claimant had failed to prove that she was \u201csignificantly limited\u201d in the repetitive use of her hip. The ARU order reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">\u201cIt is noted that Dr. Wong initially indicated that claimant had \u2018some\u2019 rather than \u2018significant\u2019 limitation in the repetitive use of the [left] hip due to the accepted hip conditions. Dr. Tran concurred with that assessment. Upon clarification to claimant\u2019s attorney, Dr. Wong agreed that claimant had some limitation in repetitive use and described some anticipated limitations. Dr. Wong also noted the dictionary definition of \u2018significant\u2019 and agreed that guidance as to the meaning of the meaning [sic] of \u2018significant\u2019 would be helpful. Dr. Wong did not clearly state claimant was significantly limited in repetitive use. In response to the request for clarification, Dr. Tran, claimant\u2019s attending physician, indicated he was unable to comment either way as to whether there were significant limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201cWe conclude that claimant has not met the threshold (minimum) impairment established in the rule and has not proved entitlement to a value under OAR 436-035-0019. <em>See </em>ORS 656.266 and OAR 436-035-0007(13).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In response to that order, claimant requested review of the chronic-condition-impairment determination before an administrative law judge (ALJ). The parties submitted the matter on the record. The ALJ upheld the order on reconsideration, reasoning, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u201cHere, Dr. Wong opined that claimant had \u2018some\u2019 limitation in the repetitive use of her left hip. Dr. Wong explained that claimant would have difficulty repetitively squatting, walking long distances and static standing for long periods of time. \u2018Magic Words are not required to establish a \u201cchronic condition\u201d limitation.\u2019 <em>See Buss v. SAIF, </em>182 Or App 590, 594-95 [, 50 P3d 253] (2002) (\u2018magic words\u2019 not required for \u2018chronic condition\u2019 rating when the record contained medical opinions from which it could be found the claimant was entitled to a \u2018chronic condition\u2019 award) * * *. However, without further explanation from Drs. Wong and Tran, it cannot be inferred that claimant\u2019s limitations amount to a \u2018significant limitation.\u2019 <em>See Benz v. SAIF, </em>170 Or App 22, 25 [, 11 P3d 698] (2000) (although the Board may draw reasonable inferences from the medical evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>it is not free to reach its own medical conclusions in the absence of such evidence); <em>see also SAIF v. Calder, </em>157 Or App 224, 227-28 [, 969 P2d 1050] (1998) (the Board is not an agency with specialized medical expertise entitled to take official notice of technical facts within its specialized knowledge); <em>see also, Lenore A. Barrett, </em>55 Van Natta 3261, 3262 (2003) (physician\u2019s opinion that the claimant had \u2018difficulty with doing repetitive activity\u2019 was insufficient to establish a chronic condition).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">\u201cMoreover, even when Dr. Wong was presented with a proposed definition of \u2018significant,\u2019 he, nonetheless [,] did not opine that claimant\u2019s limitation in repetitive use was \u2018significant.\u2019 * * * Thus, even if that definition were adopted, the medical evidence would still be insufficient to warrant an award for a \u2018chronic condition.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Claimant appealed that decision to the board, which, in turn, upheld the ALJ\u2019s decision and adopted its reasoning. The board also added the following supplemental reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201cThe pivotal question is whether an impairment rating for a chronic left hip condition is warranted. Such a rating is warranted if the medical evidence establishes that repetitive use of claimant\u2019s left hip is significantly limited. <em>See </em>OAR 436-035-0019(1)0); <em>see also </em>OAR 436-035-0007(7) (\u2018If there is no measurable impairment under these rules, no award of permanent partial disability is allowed.\u2019) (WCD Admin. Order 10-051).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">\u201cClaimant asserts that the activities of walking and standing are important activities of daily living and that \u2018restrictions\u2019 in repetitively performing these activities will have a \u2018significant\u2019 impact whether those activities are performed on or off the job. Thus, according to claimant, her predicted difficulties support a conclusion that she is significantly limited in the repetitive use of her left hip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">\u201cHowever, Dr. Tran specifically declined to comment on whether he considered those difficulties \u2018significant\u2019 \u2014 even if\u2018significant\u2019 means \u2018important, weighty or notable.\u2019 Under these circumstances, even assuming application of claimant\u2019s proposed definition, Dr. Tran\u2019s opinion would not support a conclusion that claimant\u2019s physical restrictions reached the \u2018significantly limited in repetitive use\u2019 requirement for a \u2018chronic condition\u2019 rating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u201cIn reaching this conclusion, we do not simply rely on the fact that the physicians used the term \u2018some\u2019 limitation, rather than \u2018significant\u2019 limitation. *** Instead, in evaluating the sufficiency of relevant medical opinions we consider them as a whole and in the context in which they were rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">\u201cHere (as noted), given choices as to whether claimant had no limitation, some limitation, or significant limitation in the repetitive use of her left hip, Dr. Wong checked a box choosing \u2018some limitation\u2019 and Dr. Tran concurred. However, the existence of a chronic condition is an \u2018either/ or\u2019 determination; a claimant\u2019s repetitive use is either \u2018significantly limited\u2019 or \u2018not significantly limited.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201cUnder these circumstances, having considered Dr. Tran\u2019s opinion as a whole and in context, we find it insufficient to warrant a chronic condition rating. <em>See James W. Mcvey, </em>63 Van Natta 1101, 1104 (2011) (evidence of limited ability to perform certain tasks does not necessarily support a significant limitation in repetitive use; nor does evidence of limited repetitive use, without evidence establishing that such a limitation is significant). Consequently, we agree with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that claimant has not carried her burden of proving error in the reconsideration process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">(Footnotes and some citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Claimant is now before us, asserting that the board erred in applying the term \u201csignificantly limited\u201d in OAR 436-035-0019.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She contends that the board failed to identify a proper, or, indeed, any interpretation of the term, and, instead, inappropriately relied entirely on the physicians\u2019 refusal to label her repetitive-use limitations \u201csignificant.\u201d She argues that no court or administrative body has provided an interpretation of the term, and points to board decisions that, she contends, demonstrate that the lack of an identifiable standard is producing inconsistent chronic-condition outcomes in cases with similar facts. She advocates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>that this court should interpret the term \u201csignificantly\u201d in OAR 436-035-0019 to refer to any repetitive-use limitation that is more than a <em>de minimis </em>one.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">SAIF presents a three-pronged response. First, it argues that claimant did not, during the reconsideration process before the department, present the <em>de minimis </em>interpretation of \u201csignificantly limited\u201d that she now advances on appeal, and that we, therefore, should not consider it here. Second, SAIF argues that we need not undertake to interpret OAR 436-035-0019 because, at all events, claimant\u2019s medical evidence was insufficient to meet her burden of establishing a chronic-condition impairment. Third, citing both the dictionary and the administrative history behind the enactment of the rule, SAIF asserts that \u2014 should we decide it necessary to interpret the rule \u2014 the phrase \u201csignificantly limited\u201d in OAR 436-035-0019 refers to a limitation that is \u201cimportant, weighty, or notable\u201d and that claimant\u2019s evidence was insufficient to make the requisite showing under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Our review of the board\u2019s order is governed by ORS 183.482(7) and (8). ORS 656.298(7). ORS 183.482(8)(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201cThe court shall set aside or remand the order if the court finds that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Substantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In order to meet the substantial evidence requirement,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201cthe board\u2019s opinion must include a sufficient explanation to allow a reviewing court to examine the agency\u2019s action; <em>i.e., </em>it must be supported by substantial reason. An order that contains a sufficient explanation is one that clearly and precisely states what the board found to be the facts and fully explains why those facts lead it to the decision it makes. <em>Home Plate, Inc. v. OLCC, </em>20 Or App 188, 190, 530 P2d 862 (1975). <em>See also Ross v. Springfield, School Dist. No. 19, </em>294 Or 357, 370, 657 P2d 188 (1982) (Tt is essential that an agency articulate in a contested case the rational connection between the facts and the legal conclusion it draws from them.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Young, </em>219 Or App 410, 413-14, 182 P3d 298 (2008) (some internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">We begin by considering, and rejecting, SAIF\u2019s argument that claimant did not adequately preserve her arguments before the department. <em>See </em>ORS 656.283(6) (\u201c[Tissues that were not raised by a party to the reconsideration may not be raised at [an ALJ] hearing unless the issue arises out of the reconsideration order itself.\u201d); ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *.\u201d); <em>Thomas Creek Lumber v. Board of Forestry, </em>188 Or App 10, 30, 69 P3d 1238 (2003) (stating that the preservation requirements of ORAP 5.45 \u201capply not only to appeals of trial court judgments but also to petitions for judicial review of agency action\u201d). It will be useful here to summarize the different interpretations of \u201csignificantly limited\u201d that surfaced at various points during these proceedings. Wong and Tran both took \u201csignificantly limited\u201d to mean a \u201cmajor loss of function.\u201d During the process of closing the claim, claimant\u2019s attorney introduced an interpretation of the phrase as \u201cimportant, weighty, or notable,\u201d by putting it to Tran whether claimant\u2019s limitations were significant under that definition. Before the ALJ and the board, claimant urged that the phrase meant any limitation that \u201cis important and likely to have influence or effect on function.\u201d Claimant is now, before this court, urging that \u201csignificantly limited\u201d refers to any limitation that is not insignificant, <em>i.e., </em>one that is more than <em>de minimis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Here, the ARU \u2014 a part of the agency that promulgated OAR 436-035-0019 \u2014 was squarely confronted with whether claimant had demonstrated that she suffered from a chronic-condition impairment. Without taking arguments from the parties, the ARU concluded that she had not, and based that decision on the record in which both the \u201cmajor loss of function\u201d and \u201cimportant, weighty, or notable\u201d interpretations appeared. Additionally, as the department acknowledged in the ARU order, claimant offered a sworn statement from Wong that \u201cit would be beneficial if someone would provide more guidance with how the word \u2018significant\u2019 was supposed to be interpreted.\u201d Claimant subsequently sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>review before the ALJ and the board, arguing to both that the rule had never been interpreted and that, correctly understood, even \u201cmild\u201d limitations on repetitive use could be \u201csignificante],\u201d and that a loss of repetitive use \u201cis significant if it is important and likely to have influence or effect on function.\u201d Although she has, in this petition for judicial review, modestly refined her proposed interpretation of \u201csignificantly limited,\u201d it cannot reasonably be said that either SAIF or any of the reviewing entities below would be caught off guard in the least by the argument that claimant makes here, which is, at its core, that the board denied that she was \u201csignificantly limited\u201d without providing any explanation of what \u201csignificantly limited\u201d means or why her evidence was insufficient as against that meaning. <em>See, e.g., Quick Collect, Inc. v. Higgins, </em>258 Or App 234, 239, 308 P3d 1089 (2013) (preservation requirements exist to permit a lower court to avoid or correct error and to ensure fairness to the opposing party).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">We turn next to SAIF\u2019s contention that it was not necessary in this case for the board to provide a conclusive interpretation of the phrase because claimant\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show that she was \u201csignificantly limited,\u201d even under the interpretation that claimant advanced below. It urges that substantial evidence supports that conclusion, and, thus, that we should reach the same conclusion here that we did in <em>Schleiss v. SAIF, </em>250 Or App 458, 281 P3d 626 (2012), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>354 Or 637, 317 P3d 244 (2013), in which we rejected a claimant\u2019s challenge to the board\u2019s application of OAR 436-035-0019 without interpreting the words \u201csignificantly limited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We reject SAIF\u2019s argument, which is based on the premise that there was insufficient evidence in the record to establish a \u201csignificant!] limit[ation]\u201d because no doctor had labeled claimant\u2019s repetitive-use limitations \u201csignificant.\u201d That fact, however, cannot be determinative in this case. As we explained in <em>Weckesser v. Jet Delivery Systems, </em>132 Or App 325, 328, 888 P2d 127 (1995),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201cthe administrative rule permits the Board to make an award for \u2018chronic condition impairment\u2019 even if the record contains no express medical finding that the condition is \u2018chronic,\u2019 so long as the record contains medical opinion * * * <em>from which it can be found </em>that the worker is unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>repetitively use a body part \u2018due to a chronic and permanent medical condition.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">(Emphasis in original.); <em>see also Buss, </em>182 Or App at 595-96 (reversing and remanding for reconsideration where it was impossible to determine whether a board order concerning chronic-condition impairment erroneously relied on \u201cmagic words\u201d). Although <em>Weckesser </em>addressed the question in the context of a doctor\u2019s failure to label a condition \u201cchronic\u201d under a former version of the rule, the principle applies equally here: As the board acknowledged, what is relevant in the chronic-condition is whether the <em>limitations </em>described in the medical-opinion evidence show that claimant is significantly limited, not whether a doctor <em>described </em>the limitations as \u201csignificant!]\u201d according to the doctor\u2019s understanding of that term. Claimant advocated to both the AL J and the board that the term \u201csignificantly limited\u201d encompassed even \u201cmild\u201d limitations on repetitive use and that a loss of repetitive use \u201cis significant if it is important and likely to have influence or effect on function.\u201d If that or a similar interpretation is correct, as claimant plausibly urges, it is difficult to see why uncontroverted evidence from two doctors that claimant would \u201chave difficulty with repetitive squatting, walking long distances and static standing for long periods of time\u201d was insufficient to establish that she was \u201csignificantly limited\u201d in the repetitive use of her left hip under OAR 436-035-0019.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">As noted, SAIF also points to our decision in <em>Schleiss </em>in urging us to affirm. In that case, a medical arbiter had declared that the claimant had \u201csome limitation in his ability to use the spinal area\u201d and that the limitation was \u201cmoderate\u201d; the board determined that the opinion did not establish that the claimant was significantly limited in the use of his back. 250 Or App at 460. The claimant argued that the board misinterpreted \u201csignificantly limited.\u201d We held otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\u201cWe disagree with a basic premise of claimant\u2019s argument, which is that the board applied an incorrect legal standard. Claimant identifies nothing in the board\u2019s order that suggests it misinterpreted the words \u2018significantly limited.\u2019 Rather, claimant\u2019s argument reduces to a claim that, because the board concluded that he was not \u2018significantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>limited\u2019 in using his back, the board <em>must have </em>applied the wrong legal standard. We are not persuaded. The board\u2019s order reflects that the board properly avoided looking for \u2018magic words\u2019 (like \u2018significant\u2019) in the medical arbiter\u2019s report and, instead, simply determined as a <em>factual </em>matter whether the arbiter\u2019s findings, including its determination that claimant had \u2018some\u2019 \u2018moderate\u2019 limitation, established that claimant\u2019s ability to use his back was significantly limited. Substantial evidence supports that determination, which we do not disturb.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 463 (emphasis in original). In contrast to <em>Schleiss, </em>where the claimant merely urged that the board must have reasoned incorrectly because it reached an unfavorable result, claimant here points to what she contends is a hole in the board\u2019s reasoning, <em>viz., </em>that it not only failed to identify a legal interpretation of the phrase \u201csignificantly limited,\u201d but also, presumably in consequence, did not explain why the evidence of her limitation in repetitive use was insufficient under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We thus turn to claimant\u2019s contention that the board failed to explain or apply a correct understanding of the term \u201csignificantly limited.\u201d Our review in that respect is governed, in part, by the principle that \u201c [i] t is essential that an agency articulate in a contested case the rational connection between the facts and the legal conclusion it draws from them.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>294 Or at 370; <em>see Young, </em>219 Or App at 413-14 (\u201c[T]he board\u2019s opinion must include a sufficient explanation to allow a reviewing court to examine the agency\u2019s action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)). The board\u2019s only explicit attempt to explain why, as a legal matter, claimant had failed to show that she was \u201csignificantly limited\u201d was wholly centered on the doctors\u2019 refusal to call claimant\u2019s limitations \u201csignificant\u201d under either a \u201cmajor loss of function\u201d or an \u201cimportant, weighty, or notable\u201d definition of the term. For instance, the board expressed its willingness to assume that the \u201cimportant, weighty, or notable\u201d definition applied, but then stated that there was insufficient medical evidence to establish that claimant was \u201csignificantly limited\u201d under that standard because Tran had refused to say that she was. That puts the cart before the horse. The doctors\u2019 opinions do not drive the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>standard announced in the administrative rule; rather, the legal meaning of the administrative rule drives the significance of the doctors\u2019 opinions. <em>See Haskins v. Employment Dept., </em>156 Or App 285, 288, 965 P2d 422 (1998) (\u201cValidly promulgated administrative rules have the force of law.\u201d). Although doctors\u2019 opinions are, of course, critical evidence in this context, they are of little use in a circumstance where the board has not identified a legal principle by which to gauge their evidentiary weight. If the pertinent question is whether the glass is a quarter-full, an opinion that the glass is not half-full is of little use, as is a refusal to say whether the glass is one-third full.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">When the doctors\u2019 <em>labels </em>of the repetitive-use limitations are stripped away from the record, all that is left, insofar as a <em>description </em>of those limitations, is the statement that claimant \u201cwould have difficulty with repetitive squatting, walking long distances and static standing for long periods of time.\u201d The board implicitly suggested that it had considered those limitations when it stated that it considered the medical opinions \u201cas a whole and in the context in which they were rendered.\u201d However, that recital tells us, the reviewing court, nothing about <em>why </em>the board considered the described limitations not \u201csignificant[]\u201d enough to qualify for an impairment value under OAR 436-035-0019. In other words, the board\u2019s order has facts and a conclusion but we are left to guess why the facts lead to the conclusion. The meaning of the phrase \u201csignificantly limited\u201d is not self-evident. Claimant has advanced an interpretation that, ostensibly, appears as valid as that which SAIF urges, but the board\u2019s order does not identify which interpretation is correct, let alone explain why that interpretation is correct. Put simply, it is not possible to discern from the board\u2019s order <em>why </em>\u201cdifficulty\u201d with repetitive squatting, walking long distances, or static standing for long periods is insufficiently \u201csignificant[]\u201d under the rule. We agree with claimant that the board has failed to provide an adequate explanation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>what it considers \u201csignificantly limited\u201d to mean and, thus, conclude that the board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial reason.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">We nonetheless decline claimant\u2019s request that we provide a judicial interpretation of the term \u201csignificantly limited.\u201d The interpretation of an administrative rule is, in the first instance, the province of the agency that promulgated it. <em>See Springfield Education Assn. v. School Dist., </em>290 Or 217, 233-34, 621 P2d 547 (1980) (\u201c[T]he function of the court is to review an interpretation if review is sought, rather than to formulate it in the first instance [.]\u201d). Although the board did not promulgate OAR 436-035-0019, we conclude that the board\u2019s order is insufficient to permit us to adequately conduct the review function that has been assigned to us by statute; we remand to the board in order to correct that deficiency. <em>See Kenimer v. SAIF, </em>183 Or App 131, 137, 51 P3d 632 (2002) (\u201cWe cannot review for substantial evidence if we cannot discern an agency\u2019s rationale.\u201d); <em>accord Buss, </em>182 Or App at 596 (reversing and remanding for lack of substantial reason in a chronic-condition-impairment case where it was impossible to determine if the board\u2019s order rested on a legally incorrect premise).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\"> The impairment value is calculated as part of the claim-closure process; a higher impairment value results in greater compensation. <em>See generally </em>ORS 656.214.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"> SAIF does not argue that claimant failed to establish any of the other requirements under OAR 436-035-0019 <em>(e.g., </em>a \u201cchronic and permanent medical condition\u201d that limits the \u201crepetitive use\u201d of, in this case, the hip). Rather, as reflected in the board\u2019s order, this dispute concerns only whether claimant established that her condition was one that \u201csignificantly\u201d limited the repetitive use of her hip.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b214-5\"> Moreover we would reject any suggestion \u2014 had one been made \u2014 that the board implicitly adopted either the \u201cmajor loss of function\u201d or \u201cimportant weighty or notable\u201d interpretation of \u201csignificantly limited.\u201d Even if it were possible to deduce, as a matter of logic, that the board intended to do so, we will not infer such an intention where the board could have easily stated its understanding one way or another.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b215-6\"> Moreover, we agree with claimant that the board\u2019s order in the present case does not, at first blush, appear to be easily reconciled with certain of its related orders. For instance, in <em>Dennis L. Gering, </em>62 Van Natta 2572 (2010), the evidence that the board chose to accept was a doctor\u2019s finding that a condition in the claimant\u2019s knee had left him with \u201can altered gait, a squat limited by left knee pain, and pain when walking.\u201d The board concluded that the claimant was \u201csignificantly limited.\u201d In <em>Dennis J. Dickens, </em>62 Van Natta 2594 (2010), the doctor\u2019s evidence on which the board relied showed that, following an injury to his spine, the claimant could \u201clift/carry\u201d 40 pounds occasionally and 25 pounds frequently, and that claimant \u201cwas limited from stooping, crouching, crawling, pushing, and pulling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2956. The doctor also noted that the claimant could sit, stand, or walk for \u201capproximately one consecutive hour.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The board concluded that the claimant was significantly limited. The board\u2019s order in this case does not identify any governing principle that distinguishes the result in those cases from the result here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
