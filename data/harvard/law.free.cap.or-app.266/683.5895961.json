When we review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence following a conviction, we examine the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the state to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the violation had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State v. Bainbridge, </em>230 Or App 500, 502, 216 P3d 338 (2009) (stating the standard of review for an appeal involving the offense of driving through a safety zone, ORS 811.030) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The record discloses the following facts. At approximately 3:00 p.m., on a summer afternoon, Kingsbury, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>motorcycle officer in the City of Beaverton\u2019s Traffic Safety Team, was traveling westbound in the right lane of a highway overpass, when he observed defendant\u2019s vehicle, a BMW, traveling on an exit ramp from the southbound highway. The BMW made a right turn off of the exit ramp and began traveling westbound down a road where there were two westbound lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The BMW drew Kingsbury\u2019s attention because it \u201ccame to a stop, in the [right] lane of traffic, with its left blinker on.\u201d Kingsbury continued to focus on the BMW \u201cbecause it wasn\u2019t proceeding down the road like it *** should [;] it was stopped with its blinker on.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The BMW had stopped in the right lane and was attempting to move into the left lane. However, the BMW could not \u201csafely move into the left lane at that time\u201d because there were two vehicles in the left lane, also proceeding westbound. As Kingsbury observed, the BMW then started to turn in front of the first vehicle that was proceeding in the left lane. That vehicle \u201chad to kind of swerve and slow, because it appeared that this BMW was going to pull in front of it.\u201d The second vehicle in the left lane also slowed down before proceeding by. In addition, there was a third vehicle on the road \u2014 this one in the right lane behind the BMW \u2014 also heading westbound. The third vehicle also had to slow \u201cbecause of the BMW that was stopped in the right lane and not proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Kingsbury subsequently pulled defendant over and asked why he had stopped in the road. Defendant told Kingsbury that \u201che was trying to get over so his son could go to the bathroom.\u201d Defendant told Kingsbury that it was an emergency, and Kingsbury told defendant \u201cthat that was not a valid emergency to stop in the flow of traffic.\u201d Kingsbury issued defendant a citation for impeding traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">At defendant\u2019s bench trial, defendant testified that he pulled off of the freeway so that his son could go to the bathroom, made a right turn onto the road, \u201cand then put [his] left [turn] signal on\u201d before \u201cslowing down and waiting\u201d for \u201ctwo or three cars\u201d to quickly go by on the left. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Defendant asked Kingsbury if defendant drove \u201cconservatively\u201d and \u201creasonably[,]\u201d and Kingsbury replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Kingsbury testified that there were \u201cother places of refuge on the right side of the road that the car could have pulled into to perform whatever task they were trying to perform.\u201d Kingsbury further testified, \u201cStopping in the middle of traffic is not safe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">During closing argument, defendant argued that a vehicle \u201cslow down\u201d for a short distance is not a violation of ORS 811.130. He pointed out that \u201cthere was only one car behind [him]\u201d and argued that there was \u201cno violation at all, because there\u2019s no blocking of the traffic, at all.\u201d Defendant also argued that he did not violate ORS 811.130 because the exception described in ORS 811.130(3)(b) applied in his situation: \u201c[m]omentarily stopping in preparation of, or moving at an extremely slow pace while, negotiating an exit from the road.\u201d The municipal court found that defendant impeded traffic, and defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">On appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> defendant raises one assignment of error: \u201cThe court erred in convicting defendant of impeding traffic.\u201d To support that challenge, defendant states that the facts are \u201cundisputed\u201d and argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cThe city\u2019s evidence showed that defendant stopped only [momentarily] to allow two cars passing from the left lane and there was only one car behind defendant [that] was slowed down for a very short period [of] time to allow two cars to drive by on defendant\u2019s left. In order to support defendant\u2019s conviction, however, the evidence must show that defendant blocked or impeded the normal and reasonable flow of traffic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Defendant relies on <em>State v. Tiffin, </em>202 Or App 199, 206, 121 P3d 9 (2005), in which we held \u201cthat the trial court erred in concluding that the officers had probable cause to stop defendant for violating ORS 811.130.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">As noted above, \u201c[a] person commits the offense of impeding traffic if the person drives a motor vehicle * * * in a manner that impedes or blocks the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.\u201d ORS 811.130(1). However, the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>contains exceptions that permit a person to impede traffic for certain purposes. For example, a person is not in violation of the statute \u201cif the person is proceeding in a manner needed for safe operation.\u201d ORS 811.130(2). \u201cProceeding in a manner needed for safe operation\u201d includes \u201c[momentarily stopping\u201d as specified in ORS 811.130(3)(a) (to allow oncoming traffic to pass before turning) and (b) (in preparation for negotiating an exit from the road). Additionally, a person is not in violation of the statute if any impediment to the flow of traffic results from the person\u2019s participation in a funeral procession meeting specified criteria. ORS 811.130(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In <em>Tiffin, </em>we considered whether officers had probable cause to stop defendant for violating ORS 811.130. 202 Or App at 206. We first stated the undisputed facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">\u201cJust before midnight on January 31, 2002, two police officers, Justema and Selig, were driving along Monument Drive in Josephine County, which is a two-lane road that has a posted speed limit of 40 miles per hour. The officers drove up behind defendant, who was driving his car between 28 and 30 miles per hour. There was no ice on the roads and it was not raining or snowing, although Justema testified that there may have been some mist or drizzle. The officers followed defendant\u2019s vehicle for approximately one mile. During that time, there were no other cars on the road. Along that mile of road, there were several turnouts that defendant could have pulled into to allow the officers to pass. Defendant did not do so. Also, along that part of the road, there was either a passing lane or a passing zone where the officers could have safely passed defendant. Justema testified that he could have passed defendant but chose not to do so because, at that point, the officers wanted to continue to follow defendant. After about a mile, defendant turned onto Timber Road. At that time, the officers activated the overhead lights on their vehicle and stopped defendant. When Justema approached defendant\u2019s vehicle to speak with him, Justema smelled the odor of alcohol coming from defendant. Based on evidence gathered as a result of the stop, defendant was arrested for and subsequently convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 201. We agreed with the defendant that those facts did not support a legal conclusion that the defendant blocked or impeded the normal and reasonable movement of traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>under ORS 811.130. <em>Id. </em>at 205. We also agreed with the defendant that the officers were \u201cnot impeded or blocked\u201d by the defendant because \u201cthey could have safely and lawfully passed him but chose not to.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also noted that the defendant\u2019s \u201cspeed was not significantly below the speed limit, there were no other cars on the road, and, if the officers\u2019 vehicle was blocked at all, it was for a very short distance [.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Applying <em>Tiffin </em>to the facts of this case and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of ORS 811.130 had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence. First, unlike the situation in <em>Tiffin, </em>where it was just before midnight and \u201cthere were no other cars on the road,\u201d here, it was approximately 3:00 in the afternoon and there were at least four other vehicles on the road in the westbound lanes (including Kingsbury\u2019s motorcycle). <em>Id. </em>at 206. Second, unlike the defendant in <em>Tiffin, </em>who was travelirig under the posted speed limit, here, there is evidence that defendant brought his vehicle to a complete stop in the right lane of moving traffic. Third, and perhaps most significantly, there is evidence that, when defendant brought his vehicle to a complete stop in the right lane of traffic, he altered the normal movement of traffic. According to that evidence, defendant started to turn in front of the first vehicle that was proceeding westbound in the left lane, and that vehicle \u201chad to kind of swerve and slow, because it appeared that this BMW was going to pull in front of it.\u201d The second vehicle in the left lane was also forced to slow, as was the vehicle behind defendant in the right lane. Because defendant caused other vehicles to slow and one vehicle to swerve, a rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of ORS 811.130 \u2014 that is, that defendant, while driving a motor vehicle, impeded or blocked the normal and reasonable movement of traffic\u2014 had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In reaching that conclusion, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that one of the exceptions described in ORS 811.130(2) and (3) for persons \u201cproceeding in a manner needed for safe operation\u201d applies to his conduct as a matter of law. The exceptions described in ORS 811.130(2) to (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>are \u201cplainly set out as [] exception [s] that stand [] apart from the description of the elements of [the] offense\u201d that are specified in ORS 811.130(1). <em>State v. Boly, </em>210 Or App 132, 135, 149 P3d 1237 (2006). Consequently, \u201cthe state [was] not required to negate the exception; rather, the exception constitutes an affirmative defense, which the defendant must establish to prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, defendant bore the burden of proving his claimed exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Here, the record does not compel the finding that defendant was \u201cproceeding in a manner needed for safe operation.\u201d ORS 811.130(2), (3). For one, the record does not indicate precisely how long defendant impeded traffic, making it unclear whether defendant\u2019s impediment of traffic was a \u201cmomentary\u201d one contemplated by the statute. More to the point, however, Kingsbury testified that defendant started to turn in front of the first vehicle that was proceeding in the left lane and that that vehicle had to swerve and slow to avoid hitting defendant. He also testified that he did not agree that defendant drove \u201cconservatively\u201d or \u201creasonably,\u201d instead emphasizing that, in this case, \u201c[s] topping in the middle of traffic [was] not safe.\u201d Under those circumstances, a rational trier of fact could conclude, as the municipal court did, that defendant failed to prove his claimed exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\"> ORS 811.130 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of impeding traffic if the person drives a motor vehicle or a combination of motor vehicles in a manner that impedes or blocks the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">\u201c(2) A person is not in violation of the offense described under this section if the person is proceeding in a manner needed for safe operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">\u201c(3) Proceeding in a manner needed for safe operation includes but is not necessarily limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-11\">\u201c(a) Momentarily stopping to allow oncoming traffic to pass before making a right-hand or left-hand turn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-12\">\u201c(b) Momentarily stopping in preparation of, or moving at an extremely slow pace while, negotiating an exit from the road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-13\">\u201c(4) A person is not in violation of the offense described under this section if the person is proceeding as part of a funeral procession under the direction of a funeral escort vehicle or a funeral lead vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-14\">\u201c(5) The offense described in this section, impeding traffic, is a Class D traffic violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-15\"> Under ORS 153.076(2), \u201c[t]he state, municipality or political subdivision [has] the burden of proving the charged violation by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\"> The BMW \u201cwas stopped between intersections\u201d \u2014 there was \u201cno road for it to turn onto\u201d and \u201cno turn that could be made\u201d at that location.
