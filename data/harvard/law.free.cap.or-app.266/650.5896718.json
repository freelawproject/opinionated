Assigning error to the court\u2019s entry of the SPO, respondent argues that the evidence was legally insufficient. We disagree with respondent and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Respondent requests that we review the facts <em>de novo. See </em>ORS 19.415(3) (stating the Court of Appeals has discretion to review <em>de novo </em>in equitable actions). We exercise that <em>de novo </em>review sparingly and only in exceptional cases. ORAP 5.40(8)(c). This is not an exceptional case. Thus, we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings for any evidence and the legal conclusions based on those findings for errors of law. <em>Brown v. Roach, </em>249 Or App 579, 580, 277 P3d 628 (2012). In light of that standard, the facts are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">A schism developed within a small church, splitting the membership into two factions, one aligned with the priest and the other aligned in opposition. When the schism first became violent, petitioner had been the head priest for over 11 years and respondent had been a member of the church for over 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">As head priest, petitioner lived in a residence located within the church building. The fact that petitioner resided in the church was a source of contention, and respondent, a member of the faction that opposed petitioner, told petitioner that he would have to leave his residence. Petitioner\u2019s residence is attached by a doorway to a kitchen. That kitchen, in turn, opens into a rectangular meeting hall where church members gather after services. The meeting hall, which is furnished with long tables and folding chairs, was the scene of a melee following services one afternoon when between 20 and 30 members of the church had gathered there, filling the meeting hall to near capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Portions of the melee were captured on two separate video recordings taken from different sides of the meeting hall. Particular individuals engage in physical confrontations, while others stand against the walls avoiding confrontations, and still others attempt to intervene. The more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>overtly physical confrontations come in waves, occurring among a group near the exit to the parking lot, and then occurring in the back corner of the meeting hall near the kitchen where petitioner stood protected by three to four church members. Petitioner did not engage in any physical confrontations.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Respondent was among a small group of people tussling with the church members protecting petitioner. Respondent and others among her group attempted to make physical contact with petitioner. During one attempt, respondent hit a member protecting petitioner with an object. Next, she picked up a small container of powdered creamer from a table and threw the container at petitioner\u2019s head, though the container did not hit petitioner or anyone else. The record does not disclose what material the creamer container was made of nor its exact size, but the video shows it was small enough to be palmed in respondent\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Following the throw, one of the members protecting petitioner removed respondent to the parking lot, and another removed a man identified as respondent\u2019s husband, who had been engaged in physical confrontations elsewhere in the meeting hall. Moments later, respondent re-entered the hall followed by her husband, who proceeded to pick up a folding chair that he attempted to swing overhead onto the head of the man who had been defending petitioner, but he was stopped by a third man. Soon, police arrived and the melee ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">At the SPO hearing, petitioner testified that he was \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cshaky\u201d following the melee, but that he allowed respondent to return to services and later attempted formal conciliation. Despite his fear of respondent during the melee, petitioner testified that he did not, at that point, attempt to exclude her from the church because his responsibility as priest was to resolve conflict with forgiveness. Respondent continued to participate in the church, though she usually arrived after services had ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">A second physical confrontation took place seven months later when respondent was in the church kitchen, which opens into the meeting hall where other church members were gathered. Another church member advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>petitioner to lock the door to his residence that connects to the kitchen. Instead, petitioner opened the door, and respondent began to yell at him. She picked up a 40-gallon plastic garbage can and threw it at petitioner who, standing in the doorway to his residence, was about three feet away. The garbage can did not hit petitioner, but coffee cans and other garbage that fell from the garbage can did. During this encounter, respondent yelled at petitioner, saying either that the \u201cdevil is on you\u201d or calling him \u201cSatan.\u201d She also told petitioner, \u201cYou will depart this church either dead or alive.\u201d Petitioner was not hurt by the throw, but he was frightened.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Petitioner, speaking through an interpreter at the SPO hearing, described how respondent had changed over the course of their acquaintance, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">\u201cAnd she\u2019s completely change [d] from the way I used to know her. She- \u2014 every time she see me her face, facial expression, is changed and everything is changed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Petitioner also explained that touching a priest carries special significance for members of the group\u2019s faith, and he reported the effect that those confrontations and the repeated violation of that norm had on him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">\u201cAnd in also our culture and our political terminology or saying, after the priest teach and get out you cannot even touch priest clothes, but all you can do is to \u2014 is to \u2014 blessed by the cross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">\u201cThat was embarrassing. That and the other way, the children were there and that is setting some kind of role model for children not to respect the priest or the church and that\u2019s embarrassing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">\u201cIn my life, she say she will do something more tomorrow. I was scared for my life and I really don\u2019t want to come here, but I scared for my life and I didn\u2019t want to waste my time here. I was scared for my life \u2014 I have children. I have a family and I scared for my life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">On appeal, respondent contends that the trial court erred in entering an SPO, arguing that the evidence is legally insufficient. In particular, respondent contends that the evidence does not show that her contacts with petitioner were objectively alarming. Petitioner argues that his alarm was objectively reasonable. We agree with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ORS 30.866, the statute governing SPOs, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">\u201c(1) A person may bring a civil action in a circuit court for a court\u2019s stalking protective order or for damages, or both, against a person if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201c(a) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">\u201c(b) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">\u201c(c) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-9\"><em>See also </em>ORS 163.730(1) (\u201c\u2018Alarm\u2019 means to cause apprehension or fear resulting from the perception of danger.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Thus, for an SPO to issue under ORS 30.866, a respondent must make repeated \u2014 that is, two or more\u2014 unwanted contacts with a petitioner. Brown, 249 Or App at 583. Moreover, \u201ceach \u2018contact,\u2019 individually, must give rise to subjective and objectively reasonable alarm or coercion.\u201d <em>Reitz v. Erazo, </em>248 Or App 700, 706, 274 P3d 214 (2012). Subjective alarm \u201crequires that the petitioner actually be alarmed or coerced by the contacts and that the contacts actually cause the petitioner reasonable apprehension regarding his or her personal safety.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Noriega v. Parsons, </em>253 Or App 768, 774, 296 P3d 522 (2012). Objectively reasonable alarm requires that the apprehension regarding the petitioner\u2019s personal safety be objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>To determine whether a petitioner\u2019s apprehension is objectively reasonable, we consider \u201call of the circumstances of the parties\u2019 relationship.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>249 Or App at 587. Moreover, \u201c[w]e recognize that conduct that might appear benign when viewed in isolation can take on a different character when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>viewed either in combination with or against the backdrop of one party\u2019s aggressive behavior toward the other.\u201d <em>Braude v. Braude, </em>250 Or App 122, 130, 279 P3d 290 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Last, if speech alone is the basis for a contact, Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution requires proof that the contact constitutes a threat \u2014 that is, \u201ca communication that instills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.\u201d <em>State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 303, 977 P2d 379 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Respondent has twice had contact with petitioner for the purpose of ORS 30.866: The first contact occurred during the melee, and the second contact occurred in the doorway to petitioner\u2019s residence. Only the second contact involved speech because during that encounter respondent said to petitioner, among other things, \u201cYou will depart this church dead or alive.\u201d Although respondent\u2019s statements do not meet the <em>Rangel </em>standard, speech communications that fall short of that standard, \u201cnevertheless, are relevant context for respondent\u2019s nonexpressive contacts.\u201d <em>Habrat v. Milligan, </em>208 Or App 229, 237, 145 P3d 180 (2006); <em>see also Christensen v. Carter/Bosket, </em>261 Or App 133, 140-41, 323 P3d 348 (2014). Here, we consider respondent\u2019s statements only as context for her nonexpressive contacts. Consequently, the only question on appeal is whether petitioner\u2019s apprehension was objectively reasonable at each contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Respondent argues that neither contact created an objectively reasonable apprehension for petitioner\u2019s personal safety because, neither contact, taken in context, was disquieting enough to justify a reasonable person\u2019s apprehension. Instead, she argues that the contacts were merely harassing or annoying. Respondent contends four elements of context support her argument: First, the parties knew each other for a number of years preceding these events during which there was no history of violence; second, the parties\u2019 relationship continued through the church after the first contact; third, the contacts were related to church politics; and fourth, respondent and petitioner were not alone during the contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>We begin by addressing respondent\u2019s first contention\u2014 that the parties\u2019 history belies petitioner\u2019s reasonable apprehension. Respondent compares this case to two cases that each involved SPO\u2019s entered against former husbands who began to drive by the homes of their ex-wives. In <em>Braude, </em>the respondent had engaged in two isolated acts of physical aggression directed at the petitioner nearly five years prior to his more recent nonviolent behavior. 250 Or App at 127. Whereas, in <em>Boyd, </em>the respondent had consistently physically abused petitioner throughout their marriage and persisted in disquieting, though not physical, behaviors after the marriage ended. <em>Boyd v. Essin, </em>170 Or App 509, 511-13, 12 P3d 1003 (2000). In <em>Braude, </em>where past violence was remote and isolated, we held that the respondent\u2019s apprehension was not objectively reasonable, 250 Or App at 130; in <em>Boyd, </em>where the violence was recent and pervasive, we held that the respondent\u2019s apprehension was objectively reasonable. 170 Or App at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Here, respondent wants to place this case on a continuum with <em>Braude </em>and <em>Boyd. </em>Respondent\u2019s continuum would begin with this case, with no history of violence, progress to <em>Braude, </em>with its remote history, then move to <em>Boyd, </em>with its recent history. But, such a construction misunderstands <em>Braude </em>and <em>Boyd. </em>In those cases, this court considered how past violence gave context to present nonviolent behavior. Respondent wants <em>Braude </em>and <em>Boyd </em>to stand for the inverse \u2014 she wants past peace to give context to present violence. But respondent\u2019s past peaceful behavior is not relevant on appeal because petitioner testified that respondent \u201ccompletely change [d] from the way I used to know her.\u201d The trial court accepted petitioner\u2019s testimony that respondent had changed and that testimony is supported by evidence in the record. Thus, we are bound by it. <em>See Amarillas v. White, </em>253 Or App 754, 766, 292 P3d 587 (2012). Moreover, respondent\u2019s continuum is flawed because it runs counter to SPO case law, which is replete with scenarios where warm relationships turn hostile. <em>See, e.g., Ragsdale v. Fleming, </em>265 Or App 342, 336 P3d 534 (2014) (upholding an SPO where a romantic partner became hostile); <em>Amarillas, </em>253 Or App 754 (upholding an SPO where a friendly coworker turned hostile); <em>State v. Shields, </em>184 Or App 505, 56 P3d 937 (2002) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>(upholding a conviction for stalking where a friend turned hostile).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Thus, we reject respondent\u2019s first contention and turn to respondent\u2019s second contention \u2014 that the parties\u2019 continued relationship after the melee proves that petitioner was not reasonably apprehensive for his personal safety following that contact. Just as parties to an SPO are often acquainted when the relationship becomes alarming to a petitioner, occasionally, the party\u2019s relationship continues even after a petitioner becomes alarmed. In <em>Amarillas, </em>the respondent and the petitioner were friends who both worked as DEA agents in the same office space, though their desks were separated by a bank of lockers. 253 Or App at 755-56. The respondent made offensive comments to the petitioner\u2019s fianc\u00e9, sent the petitioner a string of text messages stating or implying that he might harm the petitioner and his fianc\u00e9, and made accusations to a supervisor \u2014 which were later found to be unsubstantiated \u2014 that the petitioner was involved in illegal activities. <em>Id. </em>Then, in the office, the respondent \u201cdry fired\u201d his duty weapon 10 to 15 times in the petitioner\u2019s presence. <em>Id. </em>The parties continued to work in the same space, and the respondent again \u201cdry fired\u201d his duty weapon in the office in the petitioner\u2019s presence. <em>Id. </em>at 756-57. The respondent argues that <em>Amarillas </em>stands for the proposition that, by returning to their mutual work space, the petitioner demonstrated that he was not alarmed by his coworker\u2019s actions. In fact, <em>Amarillas </em>stands for the opposite proposition. In <em>Amarillas, </em>we agreed with the trial court that the first \u201cdry fire\u201d incident was both subjectively and objectively alarming for purpose of ORS 30.866, and, even though the parties continued to work in the same office space, that incident was a qualifying contact for purpose of an SPO. <em>Id. </em>at 765-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Consistently with that understanding <em>o\u00ed Amarillas, </em>we reject respondent\u2019s contention that petitioner\u2019s apprehension following the first contact was not objectively reasonable because respondent and petitioner continued to see each other at the church. Here, petitioner, who was head priest, did not attempt to bar respondent from the congregation following the melee during which respondent repeatedly attempted to breach a scrum defending petitioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>struck one of the defenders with an unidentified object, and then threw a creamer container at petitioner\u2019s head. After that encounter, petitioner attempted formal conciliation. As with <em>Amarillas, </em>the parties here are members of a shared and mutually important institution. Given the importance of membership to the parties and their respective roles within that institution, petitioner\u2019s continued dealings with respondent through the church do not demonstrate a lack of objectively reasonable apprehension. This is especially true in light of petitioner\u2019s testimony that it is his role as head priest to resolve conflict with forgiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">We analyze respondent\u2019s final contentions together\u2014 namely, that because the contacts were related to church politics and occurred when others were present, the contacts were only annoying or harassing, and not objectively alarming. Taken in isolation, respondent\u2019s physical acts amount only to two missed throws. But we do not view the contacts for purpose of an SPO in isolation; rather, we view the contacts in context. <em>Brown, </em>249 Or App at 587. The most general context of these contacts was a schism within a small church that stirred passions sufficient to precipitate a melee. A church, like other contexts in which we have upheld qualifying contact for SPO\u2019s \u2014 such as a workplace, <em>Amarillas, </em>253 Or App 754, or a romantic relationship, <em>Boyd, </em>170 Or App 50 \u2014 is an intimate setting requiring close encounters, where passions are aroused and may go unresolved. Because a church schism shares those characteristics with contexts that also support objective alarm, we reject respondent\u2019s contention otherwise. Moreover, the public nature of the acts takes on meaning within the context of the church schism. The first contact occurred during a melee in the meeting hall in which respondent was the boldest member of a group attempting to make physical contact with petitioner. The second contact occurred in the church kitchen, which is connected by a door to petitioner\u2019s residence and which opens into the meeting hall where other church members were gathered. Public violence is objectively alarming in this context because individual violence tends to encourage group violence. In fact, after respondent threw the creamer container at petitioner\u2019s head, her husband attempted to hit a man who had been defending petitioner over the head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>with a chair. Fear of future harm is precisely what our case law encapsulates in the phrase \u201capprehension regarding the petitioner\u2019s personal safety.\u201d Therefore, the fact that respondent\u2019s supporters were present during the contacts does not make her actions less objectively alarming, but rather more so.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Thus, we reject respondent\u2019s argument that petitioner was not objectively alarmed at either contact and conclude that he was objectively alarmed at each. An objective person would be apprehensive for his personal safety when confronted with respondent\u2019s physical acts within the context of a conflict within a shared mutually important institution \u2014 an institution that is the sort that elicits passionate responses. During both contacts, respondent acted in public in front of partisans to the conflict, and her individual act of public violence tended to provoke, and may have in fact provoked, acts of increasing group violence. Moreover, she had known petitioner for years but had completely changed. He was the priest of her church, but respondent called him \u201cSatan\u201d or else said that \u201cthe devil is on [him],\u201d and, during the second contact she said, \u201cYou will leave this church dead or alive.\u201d While neither of respondent\u2019s assaultive acts caused petitioner physical injury, the objective component of ORS 30.866 does not require physical injury for the entry of an SPO, but rather objectively reasonable apprehension regarding the petitioner\u2019s personal safety. <em>Noriega, </em>253 Or App at 774. On these facts, we conclude that petitioner had objectively reasonable apprehension regarding his personal safety at both contacts and, therefore, was objectively alarmed by respondent\u2019s physical acts in each instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In sum, respondent had two unwanted contacts with petitioner during which petitioner was subjectively alarmed and during which petitioner\u2019s alarm was objectively reasonable. Though one contact involved speech, that speech is not the basis for the contact for purposes of ORS 30.866. Therefore, the court did not err in issuing the SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-11\"> Petitioner \u2014 whom the trial court found credible \u2014 testified that both contacts with respondent caused him to fear for his life. Thus, petitioner was subjectively alarmed at each contact. Because petitioner was subjectively alarmed at each contact, we only analyze the objective prong.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
