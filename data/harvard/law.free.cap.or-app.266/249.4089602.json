J.</author>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">At issue in this case is whether the City of Portland Bureau of Fire and Police Disability and Retirement Fund (the fund) correctly denied claimant\u2019s application for disability benefits. The fund appeals the reviewing court\u2019s general judgment granting a writ of review setting aside the fund\u2019s denial of benefits to claimant. The fund contends that the time limitation in the rule on which it relied to deny claimant disability benefits begins to run when a member of the fund first receives treatment for a condition that the member subjectively believes to be a worsening of a prior service-connected injury. We disagree with the fund\u2019s interpretation of the time-limitation rule and, accordingly, conclude that the fund has not established that the reviewing court erred in setting aside the fund\u2019s denial of benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Claimant works as a firefighter for the City of Portland Fire and Rescue, which entitles him to disability benefits under the Fire and Police Disability, Retirement and Death Benefit Plan (the plan), adopted as chapter 5 of the City of Portland\u2019s charter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plan provides that a board of trustees supervises and controls the fund and that the board establishes the plan\u2019s administrative rules; claim approvals and denials are delegated to a fund administrator. Portland City Charter (charter) \u00a7 5-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In 1985, claimant fell about five feet through the roof of a burning building while working and landed straddling a beam between his legs. He received medical care and was diagnosed with a possible hairline fracture in his pelvis. For that injury, the fund approved claimant\u2019s application for disability benefits. Over time claimant continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>to experience pain in his pelvic area, and, in 2006 and 2008, he sought treatment, but imaging tests did not indicate an abnormality.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">On January 19,2009, claimant\u2019s pain and symptoms persisted, and he again sought treatment. On that occasion, a urologist, Dr. Ackerman, diagnosed his symptoms, which included, among other things, a lump in the middle of his penile shaft that was consistent with Peyronie\u2019s disease. Ackerman discussed treatment options with claimant, including surgery. Claimant told Ackerman that he believed that his condition was related to the 1985 injury, but Ackerman\u2019s report did not include any mention that claimant\u2019s Peyronie\u2019s disease was related to work or to his prior injury. Ackerman prescribed medication to treat claimant\u2019s symptoms and saw claimant again on June 22, 2009; they again discussed surgery as a way to treat claimant\u2019s condition. Once again, Ackerman did not, in his report, relate claimant\u2019s condition to any prior injury or to claimant\u2019s job.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Claimant decided to proceed with the surgery and met with Dr. Yoshinaga for a preoperative appointment on August 25, 2009. At that time, Yoshinaga told claimant that his Peyronie\u2019s disease was related to his work injury. He was the first treating physician to do so. Yoshinaga completed physician\u2019s disability reports, which noted that claimant was not authorized to work for the two weeks following his scheduled September 14, 2009, surgery. Yoshinaga\u2019s \u201cAttending Physician Report\u201d noted, under the heading, \u201cSubjective Findings,\u201d that Ackerman had stated (without indicating how the statement was communicated to Yoshinaga) that claimant\u2019s Peyronie\u2019s disease \u201cis caused by previous injury to the penis and scar tissue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">On the day of claimant\u2019s preoperative appointment, claimant completed a \u201cdisability in line of duty\u201d report for a disability claim, noting the date of his 1985 fall as the date that his injury occurred and that he would need time off from work. The surgery was rescheduled and performed on October 21, 2009. As a condition of making a compensability decision on his claim, the fund required claimant to undergo two independent medical examinations on November 5, 2009. In its letter to the medical examiners, Drs. Kaempf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>and Rischitelli, the fund asked them to determine, \u201c[g]iven the work history and medical records, in your opinion, is there medical evidence, supported by objective findings!,] that the [1985] on-the-job injury was a significant factor in the cause of [claimant\u2019s] development of Peyronie\u2019s Disease?\u201d (Underscoring omitted.) Kaempf concluded that claimant\u2019s 1985 injury was a significant factor, and Rischitelli concluded that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The fund denied the claim, for the reason that the \u201cclaim was not filed within 30 days of [claimant\u2019s] alleged injury or illness as required by Section 5.7.03 of the *** Administrative Rules.\u201d That rule provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">\u201c(A) No disability benefits shall be paid to a Member unless the Member files with the Director a complete and timely application requesting such benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">\u201c(D) Applications for disability benefits must be submitted to the Director no later than 30 days after the Member is injured or experiences an illness, unless the Member establishes good cause for failing to do so. Failure to file an application within the time specified bars a Claim for disability benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Fire and Police Disability and Retirement Fund Rule (FPDR) 5.7.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Claimant requested a hearing to contest the denial with the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). The fund\u2019s attorney met with Ackerman in anticipation of the hearing. A letter memorializing their conversation noted that Ackerman had confirmed to the fund\u2019s attorney that claimant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">\u201c \u2018definitely\u2019 told you during your examination on January 19, 2009 that his symptoms and related objective findings, which you diagnosed as Peyronie\u2019s disease, were caused by his employment as a firefighter for the City of Portland and that he recounted to you the work injuries in that job which he believed caused the Peyronie\u2019s disease. You included this history of work injuries in your January 19, 2009 chart note. <em>You believe that the January 19, 2009 chart note confirms [claimant\\ telling you that he believed his need for medical treatment was related to the work injuries described </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>in your chart note. You did not tell [claimant] that his condition or need for treatment were not work related.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">A hearing was held, and the OAH administrative law judge (AL J) issued an order reversing the fund\u2019s denial of the disability claim, finding that FPDR 5.7.03(D) did not apply to claimant\u2019s request for disability benefits. The fund appealed the ALJ\u2019s order to an OAH appellate review board, a panel of three ALJs. The fund asserted before the panel that the time-limitation rule applied and that the relevant date to begin the time limit for claimant\u2019s recurrence of his service-connected injury \u201cshould be the first date of medical treatment or disability related to the worsened condition\u201d; the relevant date, the fund asserted, was no later than claimant\u2019s January 19,2009, appointment with Ackerman in which claimant was diagnosed with Peyronie\u2019s disease and told Ackerman that he believed his condition was related to the prior work injury. The panel agreed with the fund that FPDR 5.7.03(D) applies to a recurrence claim and that the claim was untimely submitted. To interpret the time-limitation rule, it looked to the definitions for the relevant administrative section in FPDR 5.7.01, namely \u201cRecurrence\u201d and \u201cAggravation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cRecurrence\u201d is defined as an</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cAggravation of a service-connected injury/illness or occupational disability that requires Claim re-opening for additional disability benefits and/or medical benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">FPDR 5.7.01. In turn, the term \u201cAggravation\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">\u201cmeans a Worsening of an approved service-connected injury/illness or occupational disability that occurs after the Member\u2019s condition has been deemed medically stationary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\"><em>Id. </em>The panel reasoned that claimant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\"><em>\u201csubjectively believed </em>that his condition was related to his 1985 injury. He went to Dr. Ackerman because he believed his condition was getting worse. Thus, as of January 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>2009, [claimant] believed that he had a worsening of his 1985 injury that required treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">(Emphasis added.) Notably, the panel did not discuss the FPDR 5.7.01 definition of \u201cWorsening,\u201d discussed below, in its analysis. The panel concluded that the time claimant first became aware that his condition was related to his prior injury was sufficient to make claimant eligible for medical or disability benefits for his worsening, and, thus, his January 2009 appointment and diagnosis was a compensable medical benefit that began the 30-day claim-filing deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Claimant then filed a petition for a writ of review in Multnomah County Circuit Court, challenging the panel\u2019s final order that denied his disability claim. The reviewing court reversed the OAH final order and set aside the fund\u2019s denial of the disability claim. Although the reviewing court agreed with the panel\u2019s conclusion that claimant was required to submit a claim or application for a recurrence, it disagreed with the panel\u2019s determination that claimant\u2019s application was untimely. In its written opinion, the reviewing court concluded that the 30-day limitation rule applies to recurrence claims only if the \u201cRecurrence\u201d is a disabling injury, <em>i.e., </em>one that requires time loss, and, thus, the January 2009 diagnosis did not start the time-limitation rule, because at that time, claimant was not eligible for disability benefits because he did not have a disabling injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The parties\u2019 arguments on appeal, consisting of interpretations of the text and context of several charter and rule provisions, are directed at the reviewing court\u2019s conclusion that FPDR 5.7.03(D)\u2019s time limitation begins when the claimant is eligible for time loss as a result of his service-connected injury as a basis for its grant of the writ of review that reversed the panel\u2019s order. We affirm the reviewing court\u2019s grant of claimant\u2019s writ of review to set aside the denial of his claim but do so, as we discuss below, for different reasons. The concurring opinion, however, states that we are \u201cabandon [ing our] duty to review the legal correctness of the reviewing court\u2019s order and judgment\u201d and tasks us with determining the \u201ccorrect meaning of [FPDR 5.7.03(D)]\u201d so that we may \u201cremand the case to the reviewing court to apply or require the fund to apply that interpretation.\u201d 266 Or App at 265, 265-66 (Sercombe, J., concurring). A <em>discussion </em>of the reviewing court\u2019s reasoning that provides a definitive interpretation of FPDR 5.7.03(D) is, however, unnecessary. That is so because we decide whether there was a sufficient basis under the charter and the rules for the fund to deny claimant benefits based on the fund\u2019s fundamental premise for its argument that claimant\u2019s January 2009 medical visit, when claimant had only his own suspicion that his condition was related to his original injury, triggered the 30-day claim-filing deadline under FPDR 5.7.03(D).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>conclude, as we explain below, that it does not, and, thus, our task ends there.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The fund challenges the reviewing court\u2019s conclusions and urges us to adopt the panel\u2019s analysis of FPDR 5.7.03(D). We construe municipal administrative rules in the same manner as we construe Oregon statutes and administrative rules: We discern the intent of the body that promulgated the law by examining the text, context, and helpful legislative history of the provision in dispute and, if necessary, turn to maxims of construction. <em>See Lincoln Loan Co. v. City of Portland, </em>317 Or 192, 199, 855 P2d 151 (1993) (\u201cThe same rules that govern the construction of statutes apply to the construction of municipal ordinances.\u201d); <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (setting out the methodology for statutory interpretation); <em>see also State v. Hogevoll, </em>348 Or 104, 109-10, 228 P3d 569 (2010) (\u201cIn construing an administrative rule, we apply the same analytical framework that applies to the construction of statutes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The rules do not support the fund\u2019s assertion (as the panel ruled) that the time-bar rule begins on the first occasion a member is eligible for medical treatment of a recurrence and that eligibility is established based on a claimant\u2019s subjective belief that his or her condition is related to an approved service-connected injury. According to the fund, the term \u201cis injured\u201d in the rule includes a recurrence, and claimant\u2019s eligibility for benefits to treat the recurrence triggers FPDR 5.7.03(D). A \u201cRecurrence,\u201d as noted earlier, is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\u201c[a]n Aggravation of a service-connected injury/illness or occupational disability that requires Claim re-opening for additional disability benefits and/or medical benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">FPDR 5.7.01. An \u201cAggravation,\u201d also noted earlier, means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">\u201ca Worsening of an approved service-connected injury/ illness or occupational disability that occurs after the Member\u2019s condition has been deemed medically stationary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\"><em>Id. </em>And finally, a \u201cWorsening\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">\u201cobjective findings indicating a worsening of the approved service-connected injury/illness or occupational disease based on expert medical opinion or an expert medical opinion explaining why the Member\u2019s symptoms indicate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>worsening of the approved service-connected injury/illness or occupational disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, a \u201cRecurrence\u201d requires a worsening of the original injury after it has become medically stationary, and, in particular, the \u201cRecurrence\u201d requires either <em>objective findings </em>that indicate that a prior service-connected injury has worsened based on medical evidence or an <em>expert medical opinion explaining </em>why a claimant\u2019s symptoms indicate that a prior service-connected injury has worsened.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Put in the context of FPDR 5.7.03(D), without those objective findings, and, therefore, without any \u201cRecurrence,\u201d a timeliness requirement for filing a <em>recurrence </em>claim is not at issue <em>if there is not a recurrence of an injury or illness for which a member could file benefits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We conclude that the fund\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s disability claim was erroneous because in January 2009 there was no recurrence for which a claim could be filed. The fund\u2019s contention that it \u201cis reasonable to trigger the 30-day deadline in FPDR 5.7.03(D) from the time [claimant] admits he was seeking medical treatment for what <em>he considered </em>to be symptoms related to his service-connected injury\u201d effectively creates a subjective standard that is different from the objective findings or expert medical explanation required by the definition of \u201cWorsening.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The fund\u2019s reliance on claimant\u2019s subjective, nonexpert belief that his condition was related to his prior injury when he sought medical treatment in January 2009 \u2014 namely, claimant\u2019s admission that he believed then that his condition arose from the prior injury and Ackerman\u2019s later affirmation that he did not tell claimant otherwise at that time \u2014 to establish his eligibility for benefits ignores the objective requirements for establishing a \u201cWorsening.\u201d Put differently, the fund incorrectly treated claimant\u2019s subjective belief about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>his condition when he received medical treatment from Ackerman in January 2009 as sufficient to begin the 30-day time limitation of FPDR 5.7.03(D). Because that basis was insufficient to deny claimant disability benefits, and because that argument is the fundamental basis for the fund\u2019s contention that we should reverse the reviewing court\u2019s ruling on the writ of review, the fund has not established grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> The plan provides workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the city\u2019s firefighters and police officers, who are considered \u201cMembers\u201d of the plan. Members of the plan are exempted from ORS chapter 656, which governs workers\u2019 compensation generally. <em>See </em>ORS 656.027(6) (providing that workers are not subject to ORS chapter 656 if they are \u201c[fjirefighter and police employees of any city having a population of more than 200,000 that provides a disability and retirement system by ordinance or charter\u201d). We have stated that the exemption must be for \u201cequivalent compensation.\u201d <em>See Harrington v. Board of Trustees, </em>100 Or App 733, 738 n 3, 788 P2d 1019, <em>rev den, </em>310 Or 133 (1990). (\u201cORS 656.027(6) defines a class that is exempt from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law because it is entitled to equivalent compensation. We cannot say that the legislature made an irrational choice in defining such an exemption.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-11\"> Unless otherwise noted, we cite and quote the version of the FPDR that was in effect in 2009 and relied upon by the OAH and the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\"> Our concern with the conclusion that the need for time-loss benefits begins the 30-day claim-filing deadline is that the conclusion creates an implication that medical benefits are not available to members unless the fund first approves time-loss benefits for a work injury, <em>i.e., </em>work-related injuries that do not require time loss are not compensable by the fund. As the concurring opinion acknowledges, medical expenses are reimbursed after a claim is approved under FPDR 5.7.03. 266 Or App at 272 (Sercombe, J., concurring). Because the concurring opinion concludes that claim approval under FPDR 5.7.03 concerns only injuries that require time-loss benefits, <em>i.e., </em>disabling injuries, 266 Or App at 270 (Sercombe, J., concurring), it follows that medical expense reimbursement would require that a member\u2019s injuries are disabling. If, on the other hand, the term \u201cdisability benefits\u201d in FPDR 5.7.03 is understood to mean time-loss benefits <em>and </em>medical-expense reimbursement, as the fund contends, eligibility for medical-expense reimbursement does not require that a service-connected injury is disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">A construction of the charter and the rules that has the implication that non-disabling injuries are not compensable by the fund is untenable. Neither party contemplates that the plan should be construed that way. The fund asserts that recurrence claims can be for medical treatment only, noting that the definition of \u201cRecurrence\u201d is an injury that \u201crequires claim re-opening for additional disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>benefits and/or medical benefits.\u201d FPDR 5.7.01 (emphasis added). Claimant, on appeal, refers to the <em>former </em>version of charter section 5-306(g)(2), which does not limit reasonable medical and hospital expense reimbursement to \u201caccepted\u201d claims. Thus, claimant contemplates that medical-expense reimbursement is separately provided for in FPDR 5.9.01 <em>et seq. </em>without any need for a claimant to obtain fund approval for time loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Moreover, the implication that benefits for nondisabling injuries are not compensable by the fund runs contrary to the need to make the fund benefits equivalent to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, 266 Or App at 250 n 1. Oregon\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws provide for compensation for nondisabling injuries that are aggravations of injuries. <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(7)(d) (\u201cA \u2018nondisabling compensable injury\u2019 is any injury which requires medical services only.\u201d); ORS 656.273 (providing for worsened conditions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> Claimant filed his claim application forms on August 25, 2009, the day he was informed that his condition was related to his 1985 work injury, required surgery, and that he would need two weeks of time loss to recover from the surgery. The fund does not contend that, if January 19, 2009 was the incorrect date to trigger the 30-day deadline, then there is some other reason that the August 25, 2009, date was untimely Consequently, we need not address the reviewing court\u2019s rationale for determining that the August 2009 disability claim filing was timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\"> We recognize the circularity of the definition. The definition of \u201cWorsening\u201d in Rule 5.7.01 has been amended, effective March 25, 2014, to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cobjective findings indicating a <em>deterioration </em>of the approved service-connected injury/illness or occupational disability based on expert medical opinion or an expert medical opinion explaining why the Member\u2019s symptoms indicate a worsening of the approved service-connected injury/illness or occupational disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b278-5\">SERCOMBE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arc\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Chapter 5 of the Portland City Charter (PCC) creates the Fire and Police Disability and Retirement Fund and establishes policies for the administration of the fund and payment of retirement and disability benefits to members of the fund \u2014 city police officers and firefighters. A board of trustees administers the fund and is authorized to adopt rules to implement the charter provisions. PCC \u00a7 5-202(a). One of those rules, Fire and Police Disability and Retirement Fund Rule (FPDR) 5.7.03(D), requires that \u201c[applications for disability benefits must be submitted to the Director no later than 30 days after the Member is injured or experiences an illness, unless the Member establishes good cause for failing to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The issue that we must resolve in this case is when an application for supplemental disability benefits is due under that rule in circumstances where a disability benefits claim is reopened after closure \u2014 long after the time of the initial work injury or illness and the qualification of that injury or illness as service-connected \u2014 because the work injury has worsened and disabled the member again (a recurrence of the service-connected injury or illness). In the proceedings below, a writ-of-review court concluded that claimant\u2019s application for disability benefits was timely because it was filed within 30 days from the time that a worsened injury caused a need for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">On review for whether the reviewing court\u2019s construction of the rule is legally correct, I conclude that it is. Specifically, I agree with the reviewing court that the rule applies to the circumstances presented here and that, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the text and context of the rule, the time to make a post-closure claim for disability benefits is measured from the time the recurrence of the injury became disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">An application for disability benefits under FPDR 5.7.03 (D), either because of an original injury or a recurrence of that injury, is measured from a single point in time \u2014 the time that \u201cthe Member is injured or experiences an illness.\u201d That application, both for an original injury and a recurrence of that injury, seeks two things: a qualification of the claim as work-related or service-connected and a determination that the claimant is disabled and entitled to time-loss benefits. It follows that the time to apply for disability benefits for a recurring injury is measured from a specific benchmark \u2014 from the time that the injury recurred and caused a need for time-loss compensation and a determination of service-connectedness. That specific benchmark is when the claimant is disabled by a recurrence of a service-connected injury or illness. Thus, I concur that the reviewing court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed, but not based upon the reasoning advanced by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">FPDR 5.7.03 describes the application process for \u201cdisability benefits\u201d and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201c(A) No disability benefits shall be paid to a Member unless the Member files with the Director a complete and timely application requesting such benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u201c(D) Applications for disability benefits must be submitted to the Director no later than 30 days after the Member is injured or experiences an illness, unless the Member establishes good cause for failing to do so. Failure to file an application within the time specified bars a Claim for disability benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">\u201c(E) By making application for disability benefits, each applicant thereby authorizes the Director to request and obtain [documents and information] regarding the applicant\u2019s health, income and employment which in any way relates to the applicant\u2019s Claim of disability and/or capacity to engage in Substantial Gainful Activity. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">\u201c(F) All applications for service-connected disability benefits shall contain a report of a superior officer, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>signature of the Chief of the Bureau affected and a report of the Member\u2019s Attending Physician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">FPDR 5.7.03 applies both to an initial claim for disability benefits related to a service-connected injury or illness and a claim for benefits because of a recurrence of that injury or illness. A \u201c[Recurrence\u201d is defined by FPDR 5.7.01 to be \u201c[a]n Aggravation of a service-connected injury/illness * * * that requires Claim re-opening for additional disability benefits and/or medical benefits.\u201d \u201cAggravation,\u201d in turn, is defined by the same rule to be \u201ca Worsening of an approved service-connected injury/illness *** that occurs after the Member\u2019s condition has been deemed medically stationary.\u201d After either type of claim is filed, it is approved or denied by the director of the fund under FPDR 5.7.04(B):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201cThe Director shall provide written notification of Claim approval or Claim denial to the Member or the Member\u2019s representative, and the Member\u2019s attending physician within sixty (60) days of the Director\u2019s receipt of a written application for benefits. This applies to the initial claim for benefits and subsequent Claims for Recurrence or Aggravation benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">As recounted by the majority, this case concerns whether the fund properly denied claimant\u2019s claim for recurrence benefits, and, specifically, whether claimant\u2019s application for those benefits was timely under FPDR 5.7.03(D). Each of the decision-makers in the proceedings below, as well as the majority, answered the filing deadline question differently. The fund denied the claim because the application was filed more than 30 days after the injury had actually worsened. On review, an administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that FPDR 5.7.03(D) applied only to initial claims for disability benefits and did not limit the time to file for a reopening of the claim because the work injury or illness had recurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">On further review, an independent panel of three ALJs determined that FPDR 5.7.03(D) governed claimant\u2019s post-closure application for disability benefits from the worsening of an approved service-connected injury, and a \u201crecurrence exists once a condition has worsened to such an extent that the Member is eligible for additional disability or medical benefits.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The panel further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>determined that the rule requires that the application be filed no later than 30 days after the claimant \u201cfirst becomes aware that the condition might be related to the approved claim and had worsened to the extent that it could entitle the [claimant] to additional medical or disability benefits.\u201d The panel reasoned that when an injury has worsened may be difficult to detect, so that the triggering event for an application for recurrence disability benefits must include some other marker in addition to a worsening-in-fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">\u201c[Claimant\u2019s] assertion that the deadline should not be triggered until a Member seeks benefits is not supported by the Fund\u2019s rules. FPDR Admin. Rule 5.7.03(D) explicitly states that the applicable deadline begins on the date of the injury or illness. The date of injury or illness does not necessarily coincide with the date of a medical procedure for the injury or illness or time lost from work. Nor do the rules suggest that the timeliness of a claim can be measured from the time that a Member elects to receive benefits. The fact that a member may choose to delay seeking disability or medical benefits does not thereby extend the period for filing a timely claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">\u201cWe agree with the Fund that the triggering event in a recurrence claim is often difficult to pinpoint. In a given case, the nature of the worsening or disability may be such that the triggering event is obvious. For example, a sudden exacerbation of a previously approved back condition that causes a Member to be unable to work could constitute a recurrence even if the Member did not seek medical treatment. However, in cases where the connection between the current condition and the one previously approved is not so clear, it is reasonable to treat the triggering event as the time when a Member first becomes aware that the condition might be related to the approved claim and had worsened to the extent that it could entitle the Member to additional medical or disability benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Claimant sought a writ of review, and the court considered whether the panel \u201c[improperly construed the applicable law\u201d under ORS 34.040(l)(d) (stating that standard of review) and concluded that it had. The reviewing court agreed with the panel that FPDR 5.7.03 (D) applies to qualification of post-closure claims for disability benefits. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the court disagreed with the panel\u2019s legal conclusion that FPDR 5.7.03(D) requires a claim for additional benefits to be filed within 30 days of the time that the claimant becomes aware of the service-connectedness of the worsened injury. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">\u201c\u2018Recurrence\u2019 is defined, in relevant part, as a Worsening of a service connected injury that: (1) occurs after the Member has been deemed medically stationary; and (2) requires Claim re-opening for additional disability benefits and/or medical benefits. So a \u2018Recurrence\u2019 in the context of disability benefits \u2018requires\u2019 reopening of the disability claim. Any \u2018Recurrence\u2019 of an injury must be \u2018disabling\u2019 to trigger the 30 day clock in Rule 5.[7].03(D). To find otherwise would be contrary to Rule 5.7.02, which provides that \u2018Disability benefits will be paid to a Member only during such time as a Member is unable to perform his or her required duties in the Bureau of Fire and Rescue . . .\u2019 Thus, the 30 day clock for disability claims under Rule 5.[7] .03(D) can only commence when a member becomes eligible for disability benefits based on a Recurrence (which \u2018requires\u2019 reopening of the disability claim), or at a time that the Recurrence causes the Member to be unable to perform his work duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In other words, the reviewing court found that an application for recurrence-related disability benefits necessarily cannot be filed until a claimant is disabled, that is, until a claimant is unable to perform his or her work duties. The occurrence of that disability triggers the time to apply for benefits. As applied to claimant, the court concluded that his application for disability benefits was timely because it was filed before 30 days after his disability \u2014 his inability to work because of surgery and recovery from surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">On appeal, the fund argues that the reviewing court erred in its construction of FPDR 5.7.03(D). It does not argue that the panel was correct when it held that the FPDR 5.7.03 deadline is triggered by a claimant\u2019s subjective belief that the worsened injury was service-connected. The fund does not dispute that the time to apply for disability benefits begins to run when the work injury worsens and the claimant becomes entitled to benefits. The fund\u2019s caveat, however, is that the time to apply for disability benefits begins to run from the time a claimant becomes entitled to either disability or medical services benefits, whichever is earlier; in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>words, that the claimant \u201cwas injured, in essence, when his need for any benefits from [the fund] recurred.\u201d According to the fund, the charter provisions and rules treat medical services reimbursement as a type of disability benefit, so that an \u201c [application for disability benefits\u201d under FPDR 5.7.03(D) can refer to an application for time-loss benefits or medical services cost reimbursement. From that, the fund concludes that the time to file an application for recurrence disability benefits begins to run when a claimant qualifies for <em>any </em>disability <em>or </em>medical services benefit. In this case, the fund argues that claimant qualified for medical services disability benefits when he obtained medical treatment for the worsened injury on January 19, 2009, the 30 days began to run at that point, and the deadline expired before his August 25, 2009, claim application. (And, according to the fund, claimant should have applied for <em>all </em>benefits in January 2009 \u2014 even benefits related to a disability that had not yet occurred.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Claimant, for his part, argues that a recurrence claim for disability benefits arises when there is a need for disability benefits, that is, when a claimant is unable to work. Claimant contends that an application for disability benefits is not a claim for reimbursement of the cost of medical services, and that medical services claims are governed by different rules in a chapter entitled \u201cMedical Benefits Plan\u201d (FPDR 5.9.01 <em>et seq.), </em>which have their own claims process with a different deadline than the one for disability benefits under FPDR 5.7.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The majority does not address that dispute. It does not decide whether the application deadline is triggered by an actual worsening or aggravation of a service-connected injury or illness plus: (1) a need for medical services; (2) a need for time-loss compensation (disability status); (3) either a need for medical services or time-loss compensation; or (4) nothing else. Instead, the majority concludes that it does not need to assess whether the reviewing court\u2019s construction of the rule was correct. It is sufficient, according to the majority, to conclude that the panel\u2019s construction of the rule was incorrect \u2014 that the subjective knowledge of the claimant of the service-connection of the aggravated or worsened injury/illness is immaterial to the application deadline. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>determination alone, the majority reasons, is sufficient to affirm the reviewing court\u2019s judgment setting aside the fund\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The majority, however, hints at how it would set the required application deadline for a recurrence under FPDR 5.7.03(D). Based on the definition of \u201c[worsening\u201d in FPDR 5.7.01, the majority suggests that the application deadline is tied to the time that a physician certifies that the aggravated injury or illness is service-connected. I disagree with that construction of FPDR 5.7.03(D), which was not advanced by the fund (in its denial letter), the ALJ, the independent panel, the reviewing court, or either party on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">As noted, FPDR 5.7.01 defines a \u201c[Recurrence\u201d to mean \u201c [a] n Aggravation of a service-connected injury/illness * * * that requires Claim re-opening for additional disability benefits and/or medical benefits.\u201d \u201cAggravation,\u201d in turn, is defined under the same rule, to be \u201ca Worsening of an approved service-connected injury/illness *** that occurs after the Member\u2019s condition has been deemed medically stationary.\u201d Finally, FPDR 5.7.01 defines \u201cWorsening\u201d to mean an expert medical opinion that contains \u201cobjective findings\u201d or an explanation \u201cindicating a worsening of the approved service-connected injury/illness.\u201d The majority reasons that, for recurrence claims, the time that \u201cthe Member is injured or experiences an illness\u201d under FPDR 5.7.03(D) is the time that a recurrence occurs, and that a recurrence does not occur until a worsening of an accepted injury or illness is documented by a physician: \u201cPut in the context of FPDR 5.7.03(D), without those objective findings, and, therefore, without any \u2018Recurrence,\u2019 a timeliness requirement for filing a <em>recurrence </em>claim is not at issue <em>if there is not a recurrence of an injury or illness for which a member could file benefits!\u2019 </em>266 Or App at 257 (emphasis in original). The majority implies, then, that a recurrence claim can be filed no later than 30 days after a physician issues a written opinion or explanation that a service-connected injury or illness has worsened, even if that physician statement occurs months or years after the injury or illness becomes aggravated and the claimant needs disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>I disagree with both the majority\u2019s explicit and implicit conclusions. In my view, the majority abandons its duty to review the legal correctness of the reviewing court\u2019s order and judgment. Under ORS 34.100, \u201c[f]rom the judgment of the circuit court on [writ of] review, an appeal may be taken in like manner and with like effect as from a judgment of a circuit court in an action.\u201d This means that we \u201cmay affirm, reverse or modify the judgment or part thereof appealed from as to any or all of the parties joining in the appeal.\u201d ORS 19.420(1). In <em>Davis v. Jefferson County, </em>239 Or App 564, 571, 245 P3d 665 (2010), we stated that the standard of review in writ of review cases is \u201cfor errors of law; that is, we ask whether the trial court correctly [reviewed the lower tribunal\u2019s decision for errors of law].\u201d <em>See also Friends of Polk County v. Oliver, </em>245 Or App 680, 688, 264 P3d 165 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 586 (2012) (same). In this case, we are obliged to decide whether the reviewing court was correct in concluding that the disability benefits application was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The majority ducks that question. It reasons that its rejection of a \u201cfundamental premise\u201d of the independent panel decision makes a \u201cdiscussion of the reviewing court\u2019s reasoning *** unnecessary.\u201d 266 Or App at 255 (emphasis omitted). With respect, that reasoning is incorrect. The reviewing court\u2019s judgment sets aside the fund\u2019s \u201cNovember 30, 2009 denial of benefits [based] on the purported untimely submission of Claimant\u2019s application for benefits.\u201d The fund\u2019s denial was because the \u201cclaim was not filed within 30 days of [the] alleged injury or illness.\u201d The reviewing court\u2019s order that underlies its judgment expressly determines that claimant\u2019s \u201capplication for benefits prior to his October 21, 2009 surgery was timely.\u201d The fund challenges those determinations of the reviewing court in its assignment of error: \u201cThe circuit court committed legal error in interpreting FPDR Administrative Rule 5.7.03(D) for a Recurrence Claim as allowing a claim to be filed within 30 days of disability as a result of a scheduled surgery.\u201d In order to address that assignment of error and review the issued judgment, we are obliged to determine if the court correctly interpreted the rule. If it did not, then we should determine the correct meaning of the rule and remand the case to the reviewing court to apply or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>require the fund to apply that interpretation. The conclusion that the independent panel got it wrong does not answer the question whether the reviewing court got it right.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The majority is also wrong to imply that the time to apply for disability benefits related to a recurrence is pegged to the time that a physician issues written documentation of the occurrence of an aggravation of a service-connected injury or illness. First, that interpretation of FPDR 5.7.03(D) would permit a claimant to control the timing of the application deadline by delaying the obtaining of any physician statement until the claimant is ready to apply. In practical terms, the majority\u2019s interpretation reads FPDR 5.7.03(D) to state no deadline at all to apply for a recurrence claim\u2014 the deadline is whenever the claimant desires to proceed. We should not construe the rule to avoid its stated intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Second, the majority\u2019s interpretation of the rule allows a claimant multiple opportunities to apply for benefits when a medically stationary and service-connected injury or illness becomes aggravated over a period of time. A recurrence would occur each time that a physician documents a worsening of a service-connected injury or illness, even if a claimant suffers a need for time-loss compensation or medical services reimbursement from the initial aggravation. That indeterminate application period is inconsistent with the rule\u2019s elucidation of a single point of time within which to apply, \u201c30 days after the Member is injured or experiences an illness.\u201d There would be no fixed deadline if the time to apply for disability benefits for an injury that is worsening is measured from any time that (1) the condition changes, (2) the member is aware that the condition has changed, or (3) a physician documents that the work injury has changed. Instead, the deadline is better pegged, as both parties agree, from the time that the need for disability benefits arises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>That better interpretation of FPDR 5.7.03(D) \u2014 one that creates a fixed deadline for a recurrence claim and allows early investigation of that claim by the fund, and one that can be consistently applied to original and recurring injuries and illnesses \u2014 is this: An application for disability benefits for time-loss compensation is not due under the rule until the claimant suffers an original or aggravated service-connected injury or illness and the claimant misses work <em>(i.e., </em>is disabled) because of that injury or illness. That interpretation of the rule was adopted by the reviewing court, and it is suggested by the context of the charter provisions and other rules that regulate the obtaining of disability benefits from the fund. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Again, the issue before us is the meaning of\u201c [application for disability benefits\u201d and \u201cthe Member is injured or experiences an illness\u201d under FPDR 5.7.03(D). The method we use to discern that meaning is familiar. In construing an administrative rule, we apply the same analytical framework that applies to the construction of statutes. <em>State v. Hogevoll, </em>348 Or 104, 109-10, 228 P3d 569 (2010). Thus, in determining the proper construction of FPDR 5.7.03(D), we look to its text, the context of the rule and related rules, the context of the charter provisions that the rule implements, any relevant legislative history of the rule, and, if necessary, maxims of construction. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>see also State v. Ofodrinwa, </em>353 Or 507, 512, 300 P3d 154 (2013) (\u201cThe context for interpreting a statute\u2019s text includes *** the statutory framework within which the law was enacted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)); <em>Force v. Dept. of Rev., </em>350 Or 179, 188, 252 P3d 306 (2011) C\u201c[C]ontext\u2019 includes, among other things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>other parts of the statute at issue.\u201d); <em>State v. Klein, </em>352 Or 302, 309, 283 P3d 350 (2012) (a statute\u2019s context includes \u201crelated statutes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">FPDR 5.7.01 defines some of the terms used in FPDR 5.7.03(D). \u201cApplication[] for disability benefits\u201d is synonymous with the term \u201cclaim\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018Claim\u2019 means a written request to [the fund] for a retirement, disability or death benefit and may be filed by an active member, his/her representative or legal beneficiary, or surviving spouse or other legal representative of a deceased member. This term may be used synonymously with the term \u2018application.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Although \u201cinjury\u201d is not defined, \u201cOriginal Injury\u201d under FPDR 5.7.01 means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">\u201cthe period from the first occasion of medical treatment or disability resulting from a service-connected injury/illness or occupational disability through the date the member first reaches a medically stationary status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Thus, the time of an \u201cinjury\u201d may mean the time of \u201cthe first occasion of medical treatment or disability\u201d related to an actual service-connected injury or illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The context of FPDR 5.7.03(D) includes related charter and rule provisions. As noted, chapter 5 of the PCC establishes the fund, delegates authority to the fund\u2019s officers and trustees, sets out the process for disability claims processing, and defines the amount and duration of the provided disability, death, and retirement benefits. The board of trustees has adopted rules to implement those charter provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">That context offers two insights into the meaning of \u201capplication for disability benefits\u201d or \u201cclaim\u201d that settle the question of whether the time of an injury or illness is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>measured from the first occasion of medical treatment or the time the member becomes disabled. First, under the charter and rules, the application or claim functions both to establish the injury or illness as service-connected and to qualify the claimant as disabled. Second, an application under FPDR 5.7.03(D) is for \u201cdisability benefits,\u201d specifically, time-loss compensation. That context suggests that an application for disability benefits is premature until there is a need for time-loss compensation and the applicant can be qualified as disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Again, the purpose of an application for disability benefits under the rule is twofold. First, the application seeks a determination of a claimant\u2019s eligibility for disability benefits. Under PCC section 5-306(a), \u201c[a]n Active Member shall be eligible for the service-connected disability benefit when unable to perform the Member\u2019s required duties <em>because of an injury or illness arising out of and in the course of </em>the Member\u2019s employment in the Bureau of Police or Fire.\u201d (Emphasis added.) FPDR 5.7.04(A)(1), relating to \u201cclaim approval or denial,\u201d provides that \u201cDisability Claim applications\u201d for \u201cService-Connected Disability Claims\u201d require the director to \u201cdetermine the existence of a disability and whether the preponderance of the evidence indicates it arises out of and in the course of the Member\u2019s employment.\u201d The director must provide \u201cwritten notification of Claim approval or Claim denial * * * within sixty (60) days of the Director\u2019s receipt of a written application for benefits. This applies to the initial claim for benefits and subsequent Claims for Recurrence or Aggravation benefits.\u201d FPDR 5.7.04(B). A claim approval must state \u201cthat the injury/illness occurring on the particular date has been approved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, an application for disability benefits for an aggravated or worsened work injury under FPDR 5.7.03 seeks a determination that a disability exists (that the claimant is unable to work) <em>and </em>that the disability results from a service-connected aggravated or worsened work injury (acceptance of the recurrence).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Second, an application under FPDR 5.7.03 seeks an award of \u201cdisability benefits\u201d \u2014 that is, time-loss compensation. The fund contends that \u201cdisability benefits\u201d under the rule includes an approval of medical services reimbursement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>and that the time to apply for disability benefits is measured from the earliest time that medical services are obtained or the member becomes disabled. The premise underlying the fund\u2019s contention is wrong. Both the charter and the rules use the term \u201cdisability benefits\u201d to mean only time-loss compensation. It is reasonable to conclude that the term \u201cdisability benefits\u201d means the same thing throughout the charter and the fund\u2019s rules implementing the provisions of the charter. <em>See Tharp v. PSRB, </em>338 Or 413, 422, 110 P3d 103 (2005) (\u201cWhen the legislature uses the identical phrase in related statutory provisions that were enacted as part of the same law, we interpret the phrase to have the same meaning in both sections.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Under the charter and the rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">1. <em>Eligibility for a \u201cservice-connected, disability benefit\u201d is tied to the existence of a disability, an inability to work, and not to the incurring of medical expenses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">As just noted, PCC section 5-306(a) links eligibility for a \u201cservice-connected disability benefit\u201d to a disability that arises out of and in the course of a member\u2019s employment. Under PCC section 5-306(d), a disability benefit is paid \u201cuntil the earliest date on which the Member is both medically stationary and capable of Substantial Gainful Activity.\u201d FPDR 5.7.02(A) further explains that \u201c[disability benefits will be paid to a Member only during such time as the Member is unable to perform his or her required duties in the Bureau of Fire and Rescue or Bureau of Police.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cAfter Claim approval, a member may be paid a disability benefit by [the fund] for each authorized absence from work\u201d for medical appointments. FPDR 5.7.06(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">2. <em>\u201cDisability benefits\u201d are defined to be a percentage of a claimant\u2019s salary and are not defined to include expenses for medical or hospital services or rehabilitation costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">PCC section 5-306(d) limits the \u201cAmount of Benefits\u201d to be paid to a member eligible for the disability benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>under section 5-306 (a) to a specified percentage of the member\u2019s salary (\u201crate of Base Pay in effect at disability\u201d). Under FPDR 5.7.05, \u201c[djuring the period the Member continues to be eligible under this section, benefits shall be paid\u201d at a certain percentage of \u201cthe Member\u2019s rate of Base Pay in effect at disability.\u201d If a member is demoted during the time that the member is receiving disability benefits, the \u201cdisability benefit will be based on the base pay of the position held at the time the Member first became disabled on the Claim.\u201d FPDR 5.7.02(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">3. <em>\u201cDisability benefits\u201d are paid </em>regularly, <em>not as expenses are incurred.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u201c[D]isability benefits shall be paid bi-weekly during the first year from the date of disability and paid monthly thereafter.\u201d PCC \u00a7 5-306(e); <em>see also </em>FPDR 5.7.06(A) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">4. <em>\u201c[Disability benefits\u201d are paid only during the time that a member is employed, and not after retirement, in contrast to medical service reimbursement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">As provided by PCC section 5-306(f), with certain exceptions, \u201cdisability benefits\u201d cease at retirement, the time that a member ceases to be paid wages. <em>See also </em>FPDR 5.7.02(D) (disability benefits payable \u201cup to the date [the member] attains Disability Retirement Age\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">5. <em>\u201c[Disability benefits\u201d may be offset by \u201cwages earned in other employment.\u201d FPDR 5.7.12.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Those \u201cdisability benefits\u201d presumably are the equivalent of the member\u2019s wage from the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Thus, \u201cdisability benefits\u201d under the charter and rules are lost wages during the period of a disability that are (1) based on the member\u2019s rate of pay, (2) paid in the same manner as wages, (3) paid only during the time that the member is employed and not after retirement, and (4) subject to offset by the payment of other wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">By contrast, medical services reimbursement is not referenced as part of a \u201cdisability benefit\u201d under the charter and rules. Instead, that reimbursement is allowed through a supplementary and later process than approval of a claim for disability benefits. PCC section 5-306(g)(2) treats <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>medical and hospital expense reimbursement as a separate benefit from the payment of disability benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">\u201cFor members who are not retired before January 1, 2007, <em>in addition to the benefits described above, </em>a member with a service-connected or occupational injury or illness accepted before retirement shall be reimbursed from the Fund for reasonable medical and hospital expenses arising from the injury or illness, as determined by the Fund Administrator. The Fund Administrator may limit reimbursement to particular medical and hospital service providers with which it has made fee arrangements * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">(Emphasis added.) The \u201cmedical and hospital expenses\u201d are \u201cin addition to the benefits described above\u201d \u2014 the lost wages during the period of a disability that are based on the member\u2019s rate of pay, paid in the same manner as wages, and paid only during the time that the member is employed and not after retirement. PCC \u00a7\u00a7 5-306(a), (d), (e), (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The rules treat allowed medical and hospital expense reimbursement through a supplemental and separate process than a claim for disability benefits. Under FPDR 5.7.04(B)(1), after the director approves a claim for disability benefits, a notice is sent to the claimant \u201cthat the service-connected injury/illness occurring on the particular date has been approved. The notice also shall include information on how the Member can request reimbursement for covered expenses personally paid for by the Member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The reimbursement process is further described in a separate chapter (FPDR 5.9.01 <em>et seq.). </em>FPDR 5.9.03(A)(1) provides that \u201cMembers shall be reimbursed for the actual, reasonable and necessary medical expenses they have paid for or incurred. Payment directly to the medical care provider shall be deemed to be reimbursement of the Member.\u201d FPDR 5.9.03(A)(7) regulates the timing of an application for reimbursement of medical expenses: \u201cAll requests for reimbursement for expenses paid by the Member must be submitted to and received by the Director within 60 days of making payment for or incurring the expense for which reimbursement is sought.\u201d Medical services reimbursement is owed only after a disability benefit claim is approved. Under FPDR 5.9.04, \u201cMedical Services provided to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>injured Member must not be more than is reasonable and necessary to treat the approved service-connected injury/ illness.\u201d Therefore, an application for disability benefits under FPDR 5.7.03(D) does not seek reimbursement or payment of medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Based on that context, the reviewing court\u2019s construction of FPDR 5.7.03 was correct. More specifically, (1) FPDR 5.7.03 limits the time to apply for disability benefits, whether those benefits are sought as part of the initial determination of a disability and qualification of an injury as service-connected or as a determination that a new disability exists and a recurring or aggravated injury is service-connected; (2) the \u201c[application for disability benefits\u201d under the rule seeks both an allowance of a \u201cclaim\u201d (that the member has a disabling service-connected injury or illness) and an award of disability benefits; (3) \u201cdisability benefits,\u201d as that term is used in FPDR 5.7.03 means only time-loss benefits and not reimbursement of medical and hospital expenses or rehabilitation benefits; (4) in contrast, an application for medical services reimbursement is due \u201cwithin 60 days of making payment for or incurring the expense for which reimbursement is sought\u201d under FPDR 5.9.03(7); (5) an application under FPDR 5.7.03 for disability benefits for a recurrence seeks a determination that a disability exists and is service-connected, and necessarily cannot be filed and evaluated until a disability exists; (6) the triggering event under FPDR 5.7.03 for a recurrence claim for disability benefits is the occurrence of a disability from a service-connected aggravated injury and the need for disability benefits (that is, time-loss benefits, as opposed to medical services); (7) the deadline is not additionally or otherwise calculated from the time the member became aware that the condition was a worsening of a work-related injury, the time that a physician documents that work-relatedness, or the time that the injury physically worsens; and (8) the triggering event for claimant\u2019s application in this case was his disability arising from the October 2009 surgery so that his August 25, 2009, application for benefits was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">For those reasons, I concur that the judgment of the reviewing court should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\"> Admittedly, defining a medical condition (\u201cWorsening\u201d) to mean a physician action (issuance of findings or explanation by a physician) under FPDR 5.7.01 is peculiar. FPDR 5.7.03(F) generally requires an application for disability benefits to contain a \u201creport of the Member\u2019s Attending Physician.\u201d That report presumably would certify that the member has become disabled due to an injury or illness. (Under the same rule, the application separately establishes that the injury or illness is service-connected through \u201ca report of a superior officer [and] the signature of the Chief of the Bureau affected.\u201d) The definition of \u201cWorsening,\u201d in my view, merely establishes that the physician report that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>part of an application for recurrence disability benefits certify that the original injury or illness has worsened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\"> The parties do not dispute that claimant was required to file an application for disability benefits under FPDR 5.7.03 in order to obtain those benefits. I agree with that conclusion. FPDR 5.7.03 (A) provides that \u201c [n] o disability benefits shall be paid to a Member unless the Member files with the Director a complete and timely application requesting such benefits.\u201d After providing for the 30-day application deadline, FPDR 5.7.03(D) goes on to say that \u201c[fjailure to file an application within the time specified bars a Claim for disability benefits.\u201d Moreover, as noted, FPDR 5.7.04(B) covers disposition of claims and provides that the director must provide notification of claim approval or denial for \u201csubsequent Claims for Recurrence or Aggravation benefits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-11\"> The rules contain chapters on general administration (FPDR 5.3.01 <em>et seq.), </em>the retirement benefits and appeals process (FPDR 5.4.01 <em>et seq.), </em>death benefits (FPDR 5.5.01 <em>et seq.), </em>the appeals process for disability claims (FPDR 5.6.01 <em>et seq.), </em>the process for obtaining and paying service-connected or occupational disability benefits (FPDR 5.7.01 <em>et seq.), </em>the process for obtaining and paying nonservice-connected disability benefits (FPDR 5.8.01 <em>et seq.), </em>the process for reimbursement of medical services expenses by a recipient of disability benefits (FPDR 5.9.01 <em>et seq.), </em>and vocational rehabilitation programs (FPDR 5.10.01 <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> FPDR 5.7.02(A) is the rule that the reviewing court found to be contextually relevant to the meaning of FPDR 5.7.03(D). The majority argues that the rule relates only to the duration of time-loss benefits. The rule, however, plainly requires that disability benefits are paid only during the time that a member is disabled and cannot be paid before that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
