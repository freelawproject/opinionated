J.</author>\n<p id=\"b770-3\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for multiple counts of first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree rape, second-degree unlawful sexual penetration, second-degree sodomy, and second-degree sexual abuse arising from abuse of his children. Defendant raises four assignments of error, challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of his mistrial motion, the calculation of his sentence, and the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury regarding \u2014 and its acceptance of \u2014 a nonunanimous jury verdict. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Because defendant was found guilty, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Zweigart, </em>344 Or 619, 622, 188 P3d 242 (2008). We first set out the facts generally supporting defendant\u2019s convictions, supplementing them as necessary in our discussion of defendant\u2019s specific assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Defendant married in 1996; the same year, defendant and his wife became licensed foster parents and began providing care for children. The couple separated in 2007, several months before the abuse underlying defendant\u2019s convictions came to light. Over the course of their marriage, defendant and his wife fostered \u201cclose to 100\u201d children, eight of whom the couple adopted. Over that span, the couple would regularly have six or seven children in their home at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Defendant\u2019s wife first learned that defendant had sexually abused their children in early 2007, after defendant had moved out of the family home. Evidence of the abuse surfaced during an argument with their child K, who had just turned 17. K told defendant\u2019s wife that he intended to move out of their home, and a physical struggle ensued. During the struggle, K revealed that defendant had sexually abused him, saying something to the effect of \u201cyou let your sick husband molest all of us children\u201d and \u201c[y]ou let that son of a bitch rape me.\u201d Thereafter, in an attempt to verify K\u2019s allegation, defendant\u2019s wife called another of her children, J. At that time, J, who is cognitively impaired, had recently turned 18 and was living in an adult group home. Defendant\u2019s wife asked J if defendant had abused her, and J confirmed that he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Defendant\u2019s wife then arranged to meet defendant to confront him about the allegations. During that meeting, defendant admitted to abusing J and explained that J \u201ccame on to\u201d him. A third child, M, who was living with defendant, was present at that meeting, and defendant\u2019s wife insisted that defendant tell M what he had done. Defendant then told M that \u201che [had] sexually abused [K] and [J] and that he was really sorry.\u201d Ultimately the allegations reached the principal of K\u2019s school, and the principal immediately reported the abuse to a child-abuse-reporting hotline. Subsequently, defendant quit his job and left the state, ultimately settling with his mother in Long Beach, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Miller, a detective at the Lincoln County Sheriffs Office, was assigned to investigate the sexual-abuse allegations against defendant. Miller first attempted to interview defendant at his former Oregon home \u2014 a local trailer park\u2014 but discovered that defendant\u2019s trailer was gone. Miller then met with defendant\u2019s wife and interviewed K and M. Because Miller was concerned about J\u2019s cognitive impairment, Miller did not interview J; instead, she arranged to have J interviewed at the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center, an organization that counsels and interviews child victims of abuse. Miller also arranged interviews for defendant\u2019s younger children at the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center, as well as a number of children who had been fostered in defendant\u2019s home at various times. Eventually, Miller was able to reach defendant by telephone. During the call, defendant adamantly denied any wrongdoing and explained that he had left the area to care for his ailing mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In a 17-count indictment, defendant was charged with five counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427; three counts of first-degree rape, ORS 163.375; three counts of first-degree unlawful sexual penetration, ORS 163.411; three counts of second-degree sodomy, ORS 163.395; one count of second-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.425; and two counts of coercion, ORS 163.275. The charges stemmed from defendant\u2019s abuse of J and K, as well as two younger children. Defendant was arrested and held in the Lincoln County Jail pending trial. Thereafter, Maeurer, an inmate at the jail, contacted Miller and explained that he had met and befriended defendant while both were incarcerated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>that defendant had made a variety of admissions to him about defendant\u2019s abuse of his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges and proceeded to a jury trial, which was conducted over nine weeks from April to June 2010. At trial, the state elicited extensive testimony regarding the certification and operation of foster homes in general, as well as specifics regarding the circumstances of defendant\u2019s home. Both J and K testified regarding defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of them, and the recorded interview of J conducted at the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center was played for the jury. Maeurer also testified about his conversations with defendant in jail and related a number of graphic statements that he attributed to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The jury ultimately convicted defendant of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, two counts of first-degree rape, one count of second-degree unlawful sexual penetration, one count of second-degree sodomy, and one count of second-degree sexual abuse for conduct involving J and K. The jury failed to reach a verdict on three counts of first-degree sexual abuse stemming from defendant\u2019s alleged abuse of the two other children, and the state dismissed those charges without prejudice. The state had dismissed the remaining charges against defendant during trial. The trial court sentenced defendant to 536 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by lifetime post-prison supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Defendant appeals, raising four assignments of error. We reject two of defendant\u2019s assignments \u2014 each relating to nonunanimous jury verdicts \u2014 without written discussion. In his remaining two assignments of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of a mistrial motion that defendant made following the admission of improper testimony by defendant\u2019s wife and the trial court\u2019s calculation of his sentence for his conviction of second-degree sexual abuse. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">We turn first to the denial of defendant\u2019s mistrial motion. During redirect examination of defendant\u2019s wife at trial, the state inquired whether the family had ever been investigated by the Department of Human Services (DHS) for violations related to foster care. Defendant\u2019s wife testified that there had been \u201ca couple over the years\u201d but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>\u201cnothing was founded.\u201d She then recounted two incidents that had resulted in DHS investigations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-3\">\u201c[Witness:] I remember one time there \u2014 these kids that I was babysitting for one of the sheriffs and his wife, they had three little boys that we watched. And the allegation was that [defendant] used a drill \u2014 an electric drill that we have \u2014 and was touching them in the privates and chasing them around with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\">\u201c[State:] That was deemed to who to be unfounded?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\u201c[Witness:] By DHS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">\u201c[State:] Do you know why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">\u201c[Witness:] It was just their word against ours, I guess, or against his. He was babysitting the kids.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">\u201c[State:] Did you ever have any allegation that either you or [defendant] were spanking children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-9\">\u201c[Witness:] Yes, but that was unfounded too. I remember that now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-10\">\u201c[State:] Tell me about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-11\">\u201c[Witness:] That\u2019s all I remember. They came to the house and talked to all the kids. It was that [defendant] had slapped one of the kids.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">Defendant objected and, after the jury was excused, summarized his understanding of the allegations against defendant\u2019s family as (1) that K \u2014 not defendant, whose name is similar \u2014 had been chasing children around with a drill and touching them sexually and (2) that defendant had slapped another child. Based on that understanding, defendant moved to strike the testimony relating to the second alleged incident as impermissible character evidence under OEC 403 and OEC 404. Defendant also noted that he had a question regarding the first alleged incident and that, if the testimony had implicated defendant, he would need to move for a mistrial. The trial court sustained defendant\u2019s objection and granted his motion to strike the testimony relating to the second, slapping incident. The trial court also replayed the testimony relating to the first alleged incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Defendant moved for a mistrial immediately after the testimony was replayed, arguing that the state had engaged in prosecutorial misconduct. Defendant contended that the state\u2019s questioning evidenced the state\u2019s awareness of the sexual nature of the alleged incident, that defendant was never provided any discovery materials relating to the incident, and that the resulting testimony was improper and prejudicial. The state denied knowing of the sexual nature of the alleged incident, explained that it did not have a report of the incident because the incident had been reported in a different county, and obtained and provided the report to defendant during a brief recess. The state contended that the line of questioning was in response to defendant\u2019s implication \u2014 raised in his opening statements \u2014 that the family\u2019s problems with DHS began only after he had separated from his wife. The trial court deferred ruling on the motion and recessed for the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">After the court reconvened and heard additional argument the next morning, it denied defendant\u2019s mistrial motion. In doing so, the trial court discussed 12 appellate cases that had dealt with similar improper testimony, and concluded that the effect of the improper testimony could be obviated by a jury instruction. The court found that defendant\u2019s wife had volunteered the improper testimony unexpectedly, and it repeatedly emphasized that defendant\u2019s wife had \u201cunflinchingly told the jury [that the allegation] was unfounded.\u201d It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">\u201cObviously I wish the statement had not been made. Again, because of [defendant\u2019s wife] characterizing it as unfounded, I don\u2019t believe it has an unfair prejudicial effect. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to influence the jury. I think they will disregard it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The court then allowed both parties to comment on a curative jury instruction, which it delivered after the jury returned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cI\u2019m going to give you an instruction right now that I need to ask you to pay close attention to, please. [Defendant\u2019s wife] was asked if DHS had ever conducted any investigation of possible wrongdoing while [defendant] still lived in the home, and [defendant\u2019s wife] responded by brief references to such investigations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>\u201cI instruct you that [defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s] responses to all of those questions are stricken from this record. You are to completely ignore all of those particular responses about that DHS investigation about other events while [defendant] lived in the home completely. And I\u2019m talking, again, only about the two such investigations that she mentioned and not about the entirety of her testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">\u201cYou are further instructed to report to this Court immediately if any other juror mentions any of [defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s] responses which I have ordered you to ignore, at any point from now on, including during your deliberations. [Defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s] stricken responses- \u2014 that is to say they\u2019re stricken from the record the answers that I say can\u2019t be considered at all \u2014 the stricken responses must be completely excluded from your deliberations, both individually in your own thoughts and collectively as a group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">\u201cHow do you notify me? Simply write me a note, hand it to the bailiff either when we\u2019re in session or during a recess, and I\u2019ll share your note with the parties at that point. So you can do that individually and confidentially if the need should arise. That\u2019ll be the extent of the instruction at this point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">On appeal, defendant renews his arguments below, contending that the line of questioning was designed to elicit the improper testimony and that the resulting prejudice was not cured by the court\u2019s instruction. In response, the state notes that the trial court found that the state was unaware of the sexual nature of the report and, therefore, did not intentionally elicit the improper testimony. The state also contends that the trial court\u2019s decision to give a curative instruction was well within the bounds of reason and, therefore, the denial of the mistrial motion was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">We review the denial of a mistrial motion for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>328 Or 248, 271, 971 P2d 879 (1999). \u201cIn ruling on a motion for a mistrial, a trial court must decide whether to grant the motion, to cure the effect of inappropriate conduct or testimony by giving a proper instruction instead, or to do nothing at all.\u201d <em>State v. Evans, </em>211 Or App 162, 166, 154 P3d 166 (2007), <em>aff'd, </em>344 Or 358, 182 P3d 175 (2008). \u201cThe trial judge is in the best position to assess the impact of the complained-of incident and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>select the means (if any) necessary to correct any problem resulting from it.\u201d <em>State v. Wright, </em>323 Or 8, 12, 913 P2d 321 (1996); <em>see also State v. Clark, </em>171 Or App 1, 6, 14 P3d 626 (2000) (determination whether to grant a mistrial motion \u201cis addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, because that judge is in the best position to assess and rectify any potential prejudice to the defendant\u201d). A trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is outside the range of legally permissible choices, <em>State v. Deloretto, </em>221 Or App 309, 321, 189 P3d 1243 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 66 (2009), or exceeds the bounds of reason, <em>State v. Agee, </em>223 Or App 729, 735, 196 P3d 1060 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">On this record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. As an initial matter, the events that gave rise to defendant\u2019s mistrial motion did not involve the type of misconduct or constitutional violation for which a curative instruction is insufficient as a matter of law. <em>Cf. State v. Johnson, </em>199 Or App 305, 313-14, 111 P3d 784, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 701 (2005) (\u201cThus, the case falls within [the rule announced in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 US 123, 136-37, 88 S Ct 1620, 20 L Ed 2d 476 (1968)]; the trial court\u2019s decision that the redactions, in combination with a precautionary jury instruction, sufficed to rectify any constitutional infirmity, was legal error. Denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was therefore beyond the court\u2019s discretion and was legal error.\u201d). Instead, defendant argues that the improper testimony was so inherently prejudicial that the trial court unreasonably concluded that a curative instruction could rectify any prejudiced caused by it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">There are two difficulties with defendant\u2019s position. The first is that it conflicts with the trial court\u2019s characterization of the improper evidence\u2019s prejudicial effect. In addition to its repeated observation that defendant\u2019s wife testified that the allegation had been unfounded, the court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201cif the jury were to try to make any unfair use of the information \u2014 if there was any proclivity on the part of any juror to improperly consider this \u2014 they couldn\u2019t help but notice that the father of the alleged victims was a deputy sheriff. So if you were to let your mind run wild, it would be not just that DHS thought it was unfounded, but that * * * efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>to contact his children sexually would not go unnoticed by a deputy sheriff. *** [I]t would support the inference that it was unfounded if there was no evidence that any charge was ever filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Although defendant challenges that characterization, reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion, we do not think it unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The second difficulty with defendant\u2019s position is that we assume that a jury has followed a court\u2019s curative instruction unless there is an \u201coverwhelming probability\u201d that the jury was incapable of following the instruction. <em>State v. Vorce, </em>170 Or App 61, 65, 11 P3d 674 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 584 (2001). Defendant does not identify why there is an \u201coverwhelming probability\u201d that the jury was incapable of following the trial court\u2019s detailed instruction, and nor can we. A bare assertion by defendant that such a probability exists does not persuade us that the jury was incapable of following the court\u2019s curative instruction in this case. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s mistrial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">We turn to defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence. In imposing sentence on Count 7 (second-degree sexual abuse), the court categorized defendant as a \u201c7-A\u201d offender under the sentencing guidelines and imposed a presumptive sentence of 36 months\u2019 incarceration, consecutive to the sentences imposed on Count 1 (first-degree sexual abuse), Count 2 (first-degree rape), Count 3 (first-degree rape), and Count 4 (second-degree unlawful sexual penetration). Defendant objected and argued that, if the court were to impose a consecutive sentence on Count 7, it should apply the shift-to-1 rule and categorize defendant as a \u201c7-1\u201d offender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>OAR 213~012-0020(2)(a)(B) (trial court must shift to the Criminal History I Column when calculating consecutive sentences arising from the same criminal episode). Defendant reprises that argument on appeal, contending that his conviction for Count 7 was \u201cso closely linked in time, place and circumstances * * * that a complete account of Count 7 could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>related without relating details of either Count 1, <em>2, </em>3, or 4,\u201d and, therefore, that the trial court erred when it failed to apply the shift-to-I rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\u2018\u201c[t]he \u201cshift-to-I\u201d rule applies when a defendant is sentenced for multiple felonies in the same proceeding. In that event, the defendant\u2019s true criminal history score is used in assessing the gridblock for imposing sentence on the primary offense (and any other offenses for which sentences will run concurrently). OAR 213-012-0020(2)(a)(A). For additional offenses for which consecutive sentences will be imposed, the court is required to use the criminal history score \u201cI.\u201d OAR 213-012-0020(2)(a)(B).\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\"><em>State v. Monro, </em>256 Or App 493, 495, 301 P3d 435, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 148 (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Mayes, </em>234 Or App 707, 709 n 1, 229 P3d 628, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 669 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The rule does not apply to \u201cconsecutive sentences imposed for crimes that have different victims.\u201d OAR 213-012-0020(5); <em>State v. McNeil, </em>170 Or App 407, 12 P3d 992 (2000). Nor does it apply to consecutive sentences that stem from different criminal episodes. <em>See Orchard v. Mills, </em>247 Or App 355, 358, 270 P3d 309 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 33 (2012) (\u201c[T]he \u2018shift-to-I\u2019 rule applies only when consecutive sentences are imposed for crimes that arise from a single criminal episode.\u201d); ORS 131.505(4) (defining \u201ccriminal episode\u201d as \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted conduct that *** is so joined in time, place and circumstances that such conduct is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">As an initial matter, Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 each involved the same victim, J. Thus, the dispositive issue on appeal is whether defendant\u2019s conviction for Count 7 arose from the same criminal episode as Counts 1, 2, 3, or 4. That is a legal question. <em>See State v. Fore, </em>185 Or App 712, 716-17, 62 P3d 400 (2003). However, that legal determination \u201cis based on a factual finding[ \u2014 ] specifically, the finding that the acts giving rise to the convictions were not part of \u2018continuous and uninterrupted conduct.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Yashin, </em>199 Or App 511, 514, 112 P3d 331, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 407 (2005). If the trial court made such findings, we defer to them to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>extent that they are supported by evidence in the record. <em>Fore, </em>185 Or App at 716-17. If the trial court did not make an express finding, and there is evidence from which facts could be decided in more than one way, we presume that the facts were decided in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">As noted, on appeal, defendant contends that the convictions at issue \u201carose from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct\u201d and that the convictions were \u201cso closely linked in time, place and circumstances * * * that a complete account of Count 7 could not be related without relating details of either Count 1, 2, 3, or 4.\u201d Defendant puts forward a three-part argument in support of his position. First, defendant contends that, as set out in his indictment, the pertinent counts had identical date ranges and, aside from the two counts of first-degree rape, lacked specific identifying factors. Second, he contends that the evidence presented at trial \u201cestablished that the various sexual acts occurred during the same incidents.\u201d Finally, he contends that the jury was instructed with general wording similar to that found in the indictment. Reviewing the record, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">At trial, J, who had been placed in defendant\u2019s home when she was eight or nine years old, testified that she did not remember when defendant began abusing her. Her first memory of abuse occurred in the living room of defendant\u2019s home; she was sitting on the couch with defendant, and he placed his hands inside her shirt and her underwear. On three occasions, defendant had inserted part of his hands into her vagina. On several occasions, defendant had J perform oral sex on him in the living room and in defendant\u2019s bedroom. Also on several occasions, defendant touched J\u2019s breasts and had her touch his penis while defendant was driving. J also recounted various instances of abuse that occurred in defendant\u2019s bedroom. Specifically, J testified that defendant had made her touch his penis, that he would touch her on her breasts and vagina, that defendant put his mouth on her vagina, and that defendant had engaged in vaginal intercourse with her when she was twelve years old. Finally, J testified that on a number of occasions K would touch her breasts while defendant was in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Likewise, K testified that he was placed in defendant\u2019s home when he was eight years old and that defendant began abusing him shortly thereafter. In addition to recounting multiple instances in which defendant had abused him, K testified that, when he was 10 or 11 years old, defendant began instructing K and J, who was one year older, to have vaginal intercourse. K recalled three separate occasions in which that had occurred. K explained that, the first time, he had watched defendant engage in vaginal intercourse with J on their living room couch and that defendant told K to do the same thing. K also testified that he had witnessed numerous other instances in which defendant had abused J. K testified that, on one occasion, he had come home from a school dance and heard a commotion coming from J\u2019s bedroom. From the hallway, K heard J telling defendant to stop. He opened the bedroom door and saw defendant engaging in vaginal intercourse with J on the bedroom floor. He testified that, during his time in defendant\u2019s home, he had seen defendant touching J\u2019s genitalia with his hand or penis \u201cupwards of 20\u201d times, that he had seen defendant kissing J and touching her breasts \u201ca lot more than that,\u201d and that he had seen J performing oral sex on defendant several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Maeurer testified that he had been placed in protective custody at the Lincoln County Jail. Over the course of a month there, he met and befriended defendant. During that time, defendant admitted to Maeurer that he had sexually abused his children. Specifically, defendant admitted that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with K, J, and another child. Maeurer recounted defendant admitting to engaging in multiple episodes of abuse similar to those described in the testimony of J and <em>K </em>\u2014 viz., abusing J during car rides, engaging in vaginal intercourse with J, sodomizing both children, and directing J and K to engage in vaginal intercourse with each other while defendant watched.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Thus, although defendant is correct that the evidence presented at trial tended to show that \u201cvarious sexual acts occurred during the same incidents\u201d \u2014 that is, there was evidence that defendant often engaged in multiple sexual acts with J during individual incidents of abuse \u2014 that does little to further defendant\u2019s position. That is because the evidence at trial also established that defendant engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>in many, distinct episodes of abuse over many years. And, more to the point, it established that the criminal episode giving rise to Count 7 was distinct from those giving rise to Counts 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">As a starting point, we note that defendant does not identify the \u201ccriminal episode\u201d that gave rise to his conviction in Count 7. Leaving aside any dearth of identifying factors in either the indictment or the jury instructions\u2014 neither of which are at issue on appeal \u2014 the pertinent conduct underlying Count 7 was made clear at trial, both to the court, in response to defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, and to the jury, in the state\u2019s closing argument:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was the incident in which K returned home from a school dance to find defendant engaging in vaginal sex with J in J\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The record is equally clear as to the conduct giving rise to Counts 1, 2, and 3. For each of those counts, the state identified a particular incident of abuse, distinct from the incident giving rise to Count 7, that was recounted in detail in the testimony of either J or K. For Count 1 (first-degree sexual abuse), the state identified J\u2019s testimony regarding her first memory of <em>abuse </em>\u2014 viz., defendant placing his hands inside her shirt and underwear while they were sitting together on the couch in the living room. For Count 2 (first-degree rape), the state identified J\u2019s testimony regarding vaginal intercourse in defendant\u2019s \u2014 not J\u2019s \u2014 bedroom. For Count 3 (first-degree rape), the state identified K\u2019s testimony that he had observed defendant engage in vaginal intercourse with J in the living room before instructing K to do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Finally, although the state was unable to point to a specific incident of abuse underlying Count 4 \u2014 as it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>with Counts 1, 2, 3, and 7 \u2014 it identified J\u2019s testimony that defendant had inserted a part of his hand into her vagina three times. Even were we to assume that one of those instances occurred during the same criminal episode as the vaginal intercourse that gave rise to Count 7, according to J\u2019s testimony, two instances remain. Further, although the state did not specifically rely on K\u2019s testimony, he testified that he had observed defendant touching J\u2019s vagina <em>\u201ca </em>lot more\u201d than 20 times, and, specifically, that he had observed defendant penetrating J\u2019s vagina with his finger on an occasion distinct from the incident in J\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">In calculating defendant\u2019s sentence for Count 7 under grid block 7-A, the trial court implicitly found that the conduct underlying Count 4 was not a continuous and uninterrupted part of the conduct underlying Count 7. There is ample evidence supporting that implicit finding, and we therefore defer to it. <em>Gladden, </em>250 Or at 487. Accordingly, because the conduct underlying defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 7 was not part of the same \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted conduct\u201d that formed the bases for defendant\u2019s other convictions, we conclude that the conduct in Count 7 was not directed toward the accomplishment of the same criminal objective as Counts 1, 2, 3, or 4. <em>See </em>ORS 131.505(4); <em>Orchard, </em>247 Or App at 358. Nor did \u201c\u2018a complete account of [Count 7] <em>necessarily </em>include[] details of [Counts 1, 2, 3, or 4.]\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Witherspoon, </em>250 Or App 316, 322, 280 P3d 1004 (2012) (quoting <em>State v. Potter, </em>236 Or App 74, 82-83, 234 P3d 1073 (2010)) (emphasis in <em>Witherspoon). </em>In short, Count 7 constituted a distinct \u201ccriminal episode,\u201d and, it follows, the trial court did not err when it declined to apply the shift-to-I rule in calculating defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Orchard, </em>247 Or App at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant\u2019s mistrial motion. Nor did it err when it calculated defendant\u2019s sentence for Count 7 under grid block 7-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\"> Each of defendant\u2019s other convictions was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence under Measure 11; thus, the shift-to-I rule did not apply to them. <em>State v.

And that\u2019s sex abuse in the second degree. That\u2019s the discussion where [J] was being raped by [defendant] in her bedroom and [K] came home from the dance and he saw her. * * * There\u2019s information that she was fighting back. There\u2019s not an age requirement on count seven.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">The state identified the same conduct, though in more detail, to the jury during its closing argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
