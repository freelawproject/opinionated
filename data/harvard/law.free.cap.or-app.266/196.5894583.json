The court took jurisdiction of the children based on its determination that their condition and circumstances endangered their welfare because (1) father had caused a nonaccidental injury to H that amounted to child abuse and resulted in \u201csignificant adverse consequences\u201d for H; and (2) mother refused to acknowledge father\u2019s role in injuring H and, for that reason, was not capable of protecting the children from father. On appeal, mother and father each assign error to the juvenile court\u2019s finding that H\u2019s injury was nonaccidental; mother also contends that, even if the injury was non-accidental, the juvenile court erred in finding that the children\u2019s circumstances endangered them. Both parents also assert that they have made a sufficient showing of inadequate assistance of counsel before the juvenile court so as to warrant a remand under <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Geist, </em>310 Or 176, 796 P2d 1193 (1990), for an evidentiary hearing on the adequacy of their lawyers\u2019 performances. We affirm the judgment of the juvenile court and decline to exercise our discretion to remand the case for an evidentiary hearing on parents\u2019 claim of inadequate assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Mother and father have been in a relationship since approximately 2008. Their two sons, S and H, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>born in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Father is a commercial fisherman who regularly is away from home for periods of approximately two months. Mother has advanced degrees in counseling and psychology and, before having children, worked as a mental-health counselor, a school counselor, and a school psychologist. She stopped working outside the home at some point after her children were born.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">When H was approximately three weeks old, he suffered his first injury while in father\u2019s care: a broken femur. According to father, the injury occurred while father was holding H in one arm and reaching up for a bottle for H with the other arm. H squirmed out of father\u2019s grasp, and father caught H by the leg as he fell, causing the child\u2019s leg to break. Father took H to the emergency room, where doctors treated the break with a Pavlik harness. Although long-bone injuries are generally concerning for child abuse in nonambulatory children under the age of 14 months, the emergency room doctors thought that father\u2019s report of how the injury occurred seemed consistent with the injury and did not suspect child abuse at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">A little over three and one-half months later \u2014 six days after father had returned home after being away for work for almost three months \u2014 H suffered his second injury while in father\u2019s care. H had received vaccinations several days earlier and had been vomiting periodically since their administration. After one episode of vomiting, father took H upstairs to clean and change him. H stopped breathing while father was in the process of changing him. Father called to mother, who was in a different room at the time, for assistance. Mother contacted 9-1-1; father began administering CPR to H.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">H was taken to the emergency room and later admitted into intensive care. Brain imaging tests revealed that H was suffering from bilateral subdural hematomas. An ophthalmological exam revealed that H also was suffering from significant bilateral retinal hemorrhages. H experienced seizures in the days after he was admitted to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Because H\u2019s presentation at the hospital was indicative of nonaccidental trauma, the hospital alerted its CARES team of the need to assess whether H\u2019s injuries resulted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>abuse. Dr. Copeland, a child-abuse pediatrician for CARES Northwest, was assigned to evaluate H\u2019s case. After reviewing H\u2019s records, and consulting with the doctors involved in H\u2019s treatment, she determined that H was suffering from an acute subdural hemorrhage, brain injuries, and retinal hemorrhages. The particular pattern of H\u2019s retinal hemorrhages was consistent with severe trauma. Combined with the evidence of the subdural hematomas, the evidence of the retinal hemorrhages was \u201cindicative of a severe inflicted injury,\u201d particularly in \u201ca young, nonmobile infant with no other available history to explain those findings.\u201d The fact that H\u2019s status had deteriorated suddenly further indicated to Copeland that H\u2019s condition was the result of an inflicted injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Concerned that H had been abused and by parents\u2019 failure to acknowledge that abuse, the Department of Human Services (DHS) petitioned for jurisdiction over S and H on the ground that their condition and circumstances endangered them. The children were placed in the temporary custody of DHS, and mother\u2019s parents moved in with parents to serve as safety service providers for the children pending the outcome of the jurisdictional trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">At the jurisdictional trial, mother and father both denied that father had injured H. Mother testified that, even though father had assaulted her in the past, she did not believe that father had the capacity to injure a child and did not believe that father injured H, and that nothing except an admission by father would cause her to change her mind about the source of H\u2019s injuries. She further testified that, if, at the close of trial, the court determined that DHS had not established that jurisdiction was warranted, she anticipated that the family\u2019s life would be the same, except that her parents would not be living with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The trial consisted in large part of competing testimony from doctors regarding the source of H\u2019s injuries. Among other witnesses, DHS called Dr. Shelak, who was working in the pediatric intensive care unit at the time that H was admitted with the brain injury; Dr. Elia, the family\u2019s primary pediatrician until a few months before trial; Copeland; and Dr. Achterman, the orthopedic surgeon who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>had treated H in connection with the femur fracture. Shelak testified that, in her opinion, H\u2019s injury resulted from \u201can acute event in some period of hours before his presentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Elia testified that, based upon his review of the records of H\u2019s hospitalization, and on his own training and experience, he \u201cagree [d] with the diagnosis of abusive head trauma.\u201d Elia also testified that, after his injury, H \u201chad multiple regressions in developmental skills.\u201d Specifically, H lost the ability to eat; lost his head and neck strength, which had been good before the injury; and, although he continued to react to neurological stimulation, H stopped seeking out such interactions. Before his injury, H was developmentally on track in all respects; afterwards, he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Copeland testified that she had concluded to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that H\u2019s injuries resulted from \u201ca significant inflicted injury.\u201d Apparently in anticipation of parents\u2019 defense theory, Copeland also testified as to why other possible explanations for H\u2019s injury, including a chronic subdural hematoma and the blood disorder known as Von Willebrand\u2019s Disease, could not account for H\u2019s condition, given H\u2019s particular medical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Achterman testified that, at the time that he had treated H\u2019s femur fracture, he had thought that father\u2019s explanation of the injury was \u201cviable.\u201d Achterman testified that his opinion had changed, however, as a result of H\u2019s subsequent injuries. He explained that, \u201cin my experience of 30 plus years, when you have two events like that, the likelihood that it is not nonaccidental trauma is minuscule,\u201d particularly where both injuries occurred only months apart while H was in father\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Mother and father<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> called Dr. Recht, a pediatric hematologist; Dr. Karr, a pediatric ophthalmologist; and Dr. Green, a doctor who specializes in children\u2019s disorders, each of whom evaluated or treated H following his brain injury. In addition, mother and father presented expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>testimony regarding the cause of H\u2019s brain injury from Dr. Jollo.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Recht testified that H had a blood disease known as Von Willebrand\u2019s Disease, which causes him to bleed longer than other people when he is injured. Recht opined that that disease would need to be taken into account in assessing whether H\u2019s injuries resulted from abusive head trauma. On cross-examination, however, Recht acknowledged that it would be \u201cvanishingly rare\u201d for Von Willebrand\u2019s Disease to explain H\u2019s condition, given his belief that H suffered from a \u201cless severe\u201d form of the disease. Karr similarly testified that blood disorders, including leukemia, can cause retinal hemorrhages. However, on cross-examination, Karr conceded that, given the particular pattern of H\u2019s retinal hemorrhages, and assuming that H did not, in fact, have leukemia, it was \u201cprobably greater than 90 percent likely\u201d that the cause of H\u2019s hemorrhages was abusive head trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Green testified that H was a medically vulnerable or fragile child, and that, in his opinion, it was possible that H\u2019s injuries resulted from H\u2019s vulnerabilities rather than from abuse. In particular, Green opined that, given H\u2019s vulnerabilities, H\u2019s hematomas and retinal hemorrhages possibly resulted from insignificant or accidental trauma. According to Green, H\u2019s injuries could have resulted from CPR or even from the vomiting that H experienced in the days before his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Finally, Jollo testified that he had reviewed H\u2019s medical records, as well as mother\u2019s prenatal records related to her pregnancy with H. Jollo testified that there is skepticism in the medical community as to whether the presence of acute subdural hematomas and retinal hemorrhages are indicative of abusive head trauma. He also testified that, based on his review of the medical records associated with H, he had concluded that H suffered from chronic subdural hematomas and hygromas that had been present at least since birth, and that an acute cardiovascular event possibly had led to the acute subdural hematomas and retinal hemorrhages identified when H was hospitalized. Jollo testified that he could not be certain what caused the acute bleeding, but that it was also possible that the vaccinations triggered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>it. Although Jollo could not exclude the possibility that H\u2019s injuries resulted from a traumatic event, including abuse, he thought that it was more likely than not that H\u2019s injuries were the result of H\u2019s chronic subdural hematomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">At the close of trial, the juvenile court found that jurisdiction was warranted. The court noted that, although mother should be commended for the lengths to which she had gone to remedy the harm to H as a result of his injury, \u201cwe need to all remember that none of those [lengths] would have been necessary if he hadn\u2019t been hurt in the first place.\u201d It then found that the evidence established that the children\u2019s condition and circumstances endangered them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201cAnd I think the overwhelming weight of the evidence in this case, the persuasive evidence in this case by experienced \u2014 experienced and qualified witnesses is that this was a non-accidental injury that occurred while in the care of parents, more particularly the father, which constitutes child abuse of [H] and has caused him significant consequences, and that the children are both at risk because the mother is unable or unwilling to believe that the children are at risk when with the father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Both parents timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Mother and father each request that we review <em>de novo. </em>We decline that request. Although the key factual finding that parents challenge on appeal was central to the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional determination, this is not the type of \u201cexceptional\u201d case in which we should exercise our discretion to displace the juvenile trial court as factfinder and determine the facts ourselves from a paper record, without the opportunity to observe the witnesses and their demeanors on the stand. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. J. G., </em>260 Or App 500, 502-03, 317 P3d 936 (2014). Accordingly, we review the juvenile court\u2019s factual findings to determine whether those findings are supported by any evidence in the record and review its legal conclusions for legal error. <em>Id. </em>at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Mother and father first contend that the juvenile court erred by taking jurisdiction because, in their view, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>evidence does not support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that H\u2019s brain injury resulted from abuse by father. We disagree. As noted, a number of medical professionals testified that H\u2019s injuries resulted from nonaccidental trauma. Even Karr, the pediatric ophthalmologist called by parents, testified that it was more than \u201c90 percent likely\u201d that the particular pattern of retinal hemorrhages suffered by H was caused by abuse. Moreover, the evidence of the circumstances of H\u2019s injuries also supports the finding that H\u2019s injuries were caused by father\u2019s abuse. In particular, the facts that (1) H broke his femur shortly after birth while in father\u2019s care; (2) father left shortly thereafter for nearly three months, during which time H did not suffer injuries; and (3) within a week of father\u2019s return, H suffered a traumatic head injury while in father\u2019s care permit the reasonable inference that father caused H\u2019s injuries through abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Mother next asserts that, even if the juvenile court correctly found that H\u2019s injury resulted from father\u2019s abuse, it nonetheless erred in concluding that the children\u2019s circumstances endangered them so as to warrant jurisdiction. She argues that the evidence shows that she is a skilled, caring, and engaged parent, and that, as a result, S and H are not in dangerous circumstances. She argues further that the fact that she does not believe father caused H\u2019s injuries is insufficient to permit the conclusion that S and H are endangered, in the light of the evidence of mother\u2019s parenting skills. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Whether a child is endangered so as to warrant the exercise of jurisdiction turns on whether, \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances, there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. Z., </em>236 Or App 436, 440, 236 P3d 791 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that that standard is met here. Although the record demonstrates that mother is an engaged and caring parent, father caused a severe brain injury to H, notwithstanding mother\u2019s parental abilities. Mother nonetheless continues to reside with father, is adamant that father did not injure H, and is unwilling to accept the medical evidence regarding the source of the injuries to H. Mother testified that, if DHS were no longer involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the family\u2019s life, she would continue to believe that father did not harm H, she would be relieved to have DHS out of the family\u2019s life, and the family would \u201cprobably function relatively the same except for my parents wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d Those circumstances create a reasonable likelihood of harm to S and H. As the juvenile court found, because mother does not believe that father played a role in harming H, she does not perceive the need to take steps to protect her children from father. That, in turn, creates a reasonable likelihood that mother will leave S and H unsupervised in father\u2019s care, because that is what mother did before DHS became involved with the family, and that father will again inflict a significant injury on one of the children \u2014 particularly given that, as of the time of trial, father, like mother, had not acknowledged his own role in H\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Finally, in the alternative to their arguments challenging the merits of the juvenile court\u2019s decision, parents also assert that their lawyers below rendered inadequate assistance of counsel by not calling a particular expert witness \u2014 Dr. Barnes \u2014 to testify at the jurisdictional trial. Parents request that we remand the case to the juvenile court to permit them to further develop that claim. <em>See Geist, </em>310 Or at 192 n 16. In support of that claim, parents have submitted extra-record material consisting of declarations from each parent averring that they wanted Barnes to testify at their trial; a declaration from a lawyer who has expertise handling cases involving infants with injuries that resemble those suffered by H stating that, in her opinion, Barnes\u2019s testimony would be helpful; and a letter to father\u2019s lawyer from Barnes summarizing Barnes\u2019s recommendations\u2014 following a review of \u201cavailable\u201d records associated with H\u2014 regarding possible avenues of investigation as to the causes of H\u2019s injuries. DHS opposes parents\u2019 request for a remand, contending that (1) statutory amendments have supplanted any authority that we had under <em>Geist </em>to remand a case for development of a claim of inadequate assistance of counsel; (2) the statutory right to adequate counsel established by <em>Geist </em>does not apply where, as here, parents have retained their own lawyers; (3) the procedure contemplated by <em>Geist </em>applies only if parental rights are terminated and does not apply at the jurisdictional stage of a juvenile case; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>(4) parents have not shown that their lawyers performed inadequately by not calling Barnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We assume without deciding that the statutory amendments identified by the state have not foreclosed our discretion to remand a case for evidentiary development of a claim of inadequate assistance of counsel in the manner contemplated by <em>Geist. </em>We also assume without deciding that the right to the adequate assistance of counsel applies even where a parent\u2019s lawyer is retained and that it applies at all stages of a juvenile case, including the jurisdictional stage. We nonetheless decline to exercise our discretion to remand the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In <em>Geist, </em>the Supreme Court cautioned that a court should authorize an evidentiary hearing on a claim that counsel was inadequate for failing to call a particular witness in a juvenile case \u201cif ever, only when a parent raises a <em>substantial </em>question\u201d concerning the issue. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The court further explained what a parent would have to show to raise a \u201csubstantial\u201d question that would warrant an evidentiary hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201cBefore authorizing an evidentiary hearing, a court doubtless would require a threshold showing of specific allegations, including the names of witnesses to be called, the expected substance of their testimony, and an explanation of how that testimony would show that trial counsel was inadequate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Here, parents\u2019 extra-record submissions to us do not reveal what the expected substance of Barnes\u2019s testimony at trial would have been; those submissions show only that Barnes had conducted a preliminary evaluation of the case, that Barnes concluded that the images that he reviewed were not specific to nonaccidental trauma and that there were other potential causes of H\u2019s injuries, and that Barnes recommended that those other potential causes be further evaluated by clinical experts. Absent a clearer picture of what, exactly, Barnes\u2019s testimony would have contributed to the trial \u2014 -including a clearer picture of what Barnes would have said if asked to opine on the likelihood that H\u2019s injuries resulted from abuse \u2014 we are not persuaded that there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201csubstantial question\u201d as to whether parents\u2019 lawyers performed inadequately by not calling Barnes. Accordingly, we deny parents\u2019 request to remand the case for an evidentiary hearing on their claim of inadequate assistance of counsel. Our denial of parents\u2019 request is without prejudice to parents\u2019 ability to renew the request in the juvenile court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\"> Following oral argument and the submission of these appeals, the Department of Human Services (DHS) filed a \u201cNotice of Potential Mootness\u201d to alert us that the juvenile court had entered a judgment terminating jurisdiction. Mother and father separately responded, arguing that the judgment terminating jurisdiction does not moot this appeal because, if this court dismisses parents\u2019 appeals without deciding the case on the merits, the persistence of the initial jurisdictional determination will (1) limit father\u2019s access to, and contact with, his children; (2) have collateral effects on mother\u2019s particular employment prospects as a licensed school psychologist, school counselor, and mental-health counselor; (3) affect any future investigation of the children\u2019s circumstances; and (4) result in continued and profound social stigma. Consistent with the decisions in <em>Dept. of Human Services v. G. D. W., </em>353 Or 25, 32, 292 P3d 548 (2012), and <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. L. B., </em>233 Or App 360, 363-65, 226 P3d 66 (2010), we agree with parents that this appeal is not moot. In particular, we note that the judgment terminating jurisdiction incorporates restrictions on father\u2019s access to children and parenting time. At a minimum, were we to rule in favor of parents on this appeal, that ruling could provide a basis for removing those restrictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> The transcript identifies mother as the person who called Recht, Karr, Green, and Jollo. However, parents were unified in their presentation of their theory of defense below \u2014 that father was not the source of H\u2019s injuries \u2014 and it appears that Recht, Karr, Green, and Jollo were all called to support that theory. Thus, we refer to them as parents\u2019 witnesses, not just as mother\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-5\"> DHS argues in its brief, and conceded at oral argument, that parents would be entitled to raise their claim of inadequate assistance of counsel through a motion under ORS 419B.923(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
