J.</author>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for one count of unlawful possession of heroin, ORS 475.854, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained after he was stopped by a Clackamas County deputy sheriff. Defendant contends that the officer stopped him without first developing reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity, thereby violating Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion for legal error, deferring to the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact when there is constitutionally sufficient evidence in the record to support them. <em>State v. </em>Bertha, 256 Or App 375, 378, 300 P3d 265 (2013). In the absence of express findings, we resolve any factual disputes consistently with the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Id. </em>We state the facts in accordance with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Witnessing what she believed to be an illegal drug transaction, a named informant contacted the Clackamas County Sheriffs Department. The informant reported that the transaction involved people in two cars \u2014 a black Hyundai and a yellow Subaru \u2014 that were parked at the far end of a McDonald\u2019s parking lot. A Clackamas County Sheriff\u2019s dispatcher conveyed the informant\u2019s report to Deputy Sheriff Schoenfeld, who knew that that McDonald\u2019s parking lot was a common location for the purchase and sale of heroin. Schoenfeld arrived at the McDonald\u2019s approximately one minute after receiving the informant\u2019s report. Schoenfeld testified at the suppression hearing, that, as he drove to the McDonald\u2019s parking lot, the dispatcher had told him that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201c[the informant] had observed two Hispanic males in a black Hyundai with no front license plate back into a parking space, door to door with the driver of a yellow Subaru with [an identified Oregon license plate] * * * in the parking lot behind [the McDonald\u2019s]. * * * [The informant] related to dispatch that she observed what she believed was an illegal drug transaction between the driver of the yellow car and the driver of the black car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>On his arrival at the parking lot, Schoenfeld found the yellow Subaru as it had been described by the informant. The two occupants of the Subaru \u2014 defendant, who was the driver, and a passenger \u2014 were talking to a third person who was leaning into defendant\u2019s window. The black Hyundai was not present. Schoenfeld parked his patrol car \u201cslightly behind and a little away from\u201d the Subaru, which was facing a row of planters and could not drive forward. Schoenfeld testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">\u201cI didn\u2019t intend on blocking them in. In that area I\u2019ve got lots of police officers in the area. You can see how I parked there [on a diagram]. I wasn\u2019t trying to block them in purposely. And the way I parked, [the driver] could have backed out and then pulled out that driveway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Schoenfeld then got out of his patrol car and approached the Subaru; he did not activate his emergency lights and kept his gun holstered.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Regarding what happened next, Schoenfeld testified at the suppression hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">\u201c[T]hey didn\u2019t even notice my patrol car pulling up. I was actually able to walk up to the door of the driver, that open window, and asked the guy [who] was near the window to step back near the curb. * * * I walked right up to the window, which was open, and I contacted the driver. And right when I contacted him, he dropped his hands to his lap. And what he was trying to hide was a lighter in his hand and a plastic straw.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Schoenfeld later clarified that he had seen the straw in the driver\u2019s hand at that moment but only identified the lighter later, based on its proximity to the straw. He also testified that straws and lighters are commonly used to smoke heroin. Schoenfeld immediately ordered defendant and the passenger to place their hands on the dashboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">After waiting for backup to arrive, Schoenfeld explained to defendant that a witness had seen him purchasing narcotics, and he asked defendant for consent to search the car. Defendant consented, and the subsequent search produced several tinfoil squares, which Schoenfeld testified were similar to those typically used to smoke heroin, as well as a bag containing what the officers believed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>be heroin. Defendant and the passenger were given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and defendant made a series of statements admitting that he had purchased the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the stop. He argued that Schoenfeld had stopped him when Schoenfeld parked behind the Subaru and that, at that time, Schoenfeld did not have reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal activity. In defendant\u2019s view, the information that Schoenfeld had received from the dispatcher was insufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity because it lacked sufficient detail to support such a suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that \u201cSchoenfeld had reasonable suspicion to stop the occupants of [the Subaru] based on the fact that the citizen informant who reported illegal drug activity in [the] car was named and showed other indicia of reliability.\u201d Because the trial court concluded that Schoenfeld had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity when Schoenfeld entered the parking lot and saw the Subaru, the court did not need to determine the point at which Schoenfeld stopped defendant. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On appeal, defendant renews his arguments, contending that Schoenfeld stopped defendant when he entered the McDonald\u2019s parking lot and parked his car \u201cslightly behind and a little away from\u201d the Subaru and that, at that time, Schoenfeld lacked reasonable suspicion of any criminal activity by defendant. In response, the state argues that Schoenfeld did not stop defendant until he ordered defendant and the passenger to place their hands on the dashboard and that, at that time, Schoenfeld had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on the informant\u2019s report, Schoenfeld\u2019s observations confirming details of the report, the paraphernalia in defendant\u2019s hands, and Schoenfeld\u2019s knowledge that the area was a known center of heroin distribution. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Although they disagree as to the point at which it occurred, the state and defendant agree that Schoenfeld stopped defendant. Accordingly, we first determine when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the stop occurred. For an encounter between an officer and a citizen to be a seizure under Article I, section 9, the officer must add to the inherent pressures of a citizen-police encounter \u201cby either physically restraining the citizen\u2019s liberty in a significant way or engaging in a \u2018show of authority\u2019 that, explicitly or implicitly, reasonably conveys to the person a significant restriction on the person\u2019s freedom to terminate the encounter or otherwise go about his or her ordinary affairs.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>354 Or 440, 450, 313 P3d 1113 (2013) (citing <em>State v. Backstrand, </em>354 Or 392, 402, 313 P3d 1084 (2013)). \u201cThe test is an objective one: Would a reasonable person believe that a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricted, interfered with, or otherwise deprived the individual of his or her liberty or freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">With those principles in mind, and contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, we conclude that Schoenfeld did not stop defendant by entering the McDonald\u2019s parking lot and parking his patrol car \u201cslightly behind and a little away from\u201d the Subaru that defendant was driving. Schoenfeld testified that he did not intend to block the Subaru and, accordingly, that he had parked his patrol car in a manner that would have allowed defendant to back out of his parking space and leave the McDonald\u2019s parking lot. Thus, at that time, Schoenfeld did not \u201cphysically restraint] [defendant\u2019s] liberty in a significant way.\u201d <em>See State v. Aronson, </em>247 Or App 422, 426-28, 271 P3d 121 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 33 (2012) (officer\u2019s act of parking his car behind the defendant\u2019s car in a manner that would allow the defendant to leave a parking space did not constitute a stop).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We turn to the point at which defendant became aware that Schoenfeld was standing at the open window of the Subaru, and we conclude that the stop occurred at the moment that Schoenfeld ordered defendant to place his hands on the dashboard of the Subaru. That order was in direct response to defendant\u2019s attempt to hide the contents of his hands, including the plastic straw that Schoenfeld knew to be an item commonly associated with heroin use. The order constituted a stop, which we conclude was based on reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>For reasonable suspicion to exist, an officer must subjectively believe that the person has committed or is about to commit a crime and that belief must be objectively reasonable. <em>State v. Maciel, </em>254 Or App 530, 535, 295 P3d 145 (2013). To be objectively reasonable, the officer\u2019s suspicion must be based on specific and articulable facts. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 80, 854 P2d 421 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Here, defendant\u2019s furtive gesture with the straw, combined with the informant\u2019s report that a drug transaction had occurred between people in the Subaru and those in a second vehicle moments before Schoenfeld arrived, Schoenfeld\u2019s knowledge that plastic straws are commonly used to smoke heroin, and Schoenfeld\u2019s knowledge that the parking lot in which the Subaru was located was a common location for the distribution of heroin, constitute specific and articulable facts that support reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in illegal drug activity. Accordingly, we conclude that Schoenfeld had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant at the moment that he did. <em>See State v. Hiner, </em>240 Or App 175, 181, 246 P3d 35 (2010) (\u201cReasonable suspicion, as a basis for an investigatory stop, does not require that the facts as observed by the officer conclusively indicate illegal activity but, rather, only that those facts support the reasonable inference of illegal activity by that person.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Because Schoenfeld had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant, the stop did not violate Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution or the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It follows that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of that stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b585-7\">EGAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aid\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The majority concludes that Deputy Sheriff Schoenfeld stopped defendant when he ordered defendant to place his hands on the Subaru\u2019s dashboard \u201cin direct response to defendant\u2019s attempt to hide the contents of his hands\u201d and determines that Schoenfeld had reasonable suspicion to support the stop. 266 Or App at 564. Because I dispute the point at which the stop occurred, I conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Schoenfeld lacked reasonable suspicion to support the stop. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">I begin by noting several significant facts. At the suppression hearing, Schoenfeld testified that, while working the day shift, at 12:54 p.m., he received from dispatch a drug-vice complaint occurring at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant parking lot, which was known as a hotspot for the purchase and sale of heroin. From the dispatcher\u2019s report, Schoenfeld learned particularized information about the make, model, and license plates of the two vehicles, detailed descriptions of the vehicles\u2019 positioning, the number of occupants of each vehicle, and the ethnicity of the occupants. In contrast to that thorough description of the people and vehicle involved, as to criminal activity, Schoenfeld was told only that the informant had seen an \u201cillegal drug transaction.\u201d He knew nothing of the type of drugs or the nature of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Approximately 30 seconds to one minute after receiving the report from dispatch, Schoenfeld arrived at the McDonald\u2019s parking lot, pulled his marked patrol car directly behind the Subaru, and parked at an angle \u201cto the back left corner of the vehicle\u201d one to two car lengths\u2014 \u201cbetween 10 and 25 feet\u201d \u2014 from the rear of the Subaru. For safety purposes, he parked in a manner that allowed him to keep the driver (defendant), the passenger, and the third man standing at the driver\u2019s-side window in his field of vision. Although he did not intend to block the Subaru in, he also was not concerned about the vehicle driving away.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Schoenfeld further testified that he exited his vehicle quickly, taking an estimated four seconds to walk the distance between the two cars, because he believed that he might be able to witness the occupants possessing or smoking heroin. The third man noticed Schoenfeld approach and Schoenfeld immediately \u201cordered\u201d him to step back from the Subaru; the man immediately followed Schoenfeld\u2019s directive. Schoenfeld continued to quickly approach the driver\u2019s-side door, noticed that the driver\u2019s window was down, and at that point, \u201ccontacted\u201d the driver, <em>i.e., </em>defendant. He smelled no odors emanating from the car and did not see any drugs or drug paraphernalia in the car. He <em>then </em>saw defendant drop his hands to his lap, dropping a McDonald\u2019s plastic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>straw.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Believing that defendant was trying to hide something, Schoenfeld immediately ordered defendant and the passenger to place their hands on the dashboard. At that point, a mere 10 seconds had gone by since Schoenfeld left his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">At the close of the suppression hearing, the trial court concluded that Schoenfeld had reasonable suspicion to support the stop based solely on the informant\u2019s report and the high-crime area of the McDonald\u2019s, but did not pinpoint exactly <em>when </em>the stop occurred. That determination is the crux of this appeal. As I explain below, I determine that Schoenfeld stopped defendant when he \u201ccontacted\u201d defendant through his open window. Because I determine that Schoenfeld stopped defendant at an earlier point than does the majority, I also conclude that Schoenfeld lacked reasonable suspicion to stop defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\u201cA \u2018seizure\u2019 of a person occurs * * * (a) if a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricts, interferes with, or otherwise deprives an individual of that individual\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement; or (b) if a reasonable person under the totality of the circumstances <em>would </em>believe that (a) above has occurred.\u201d <em>State v. Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or 297, 316, 244 P3d 360 (2010) (emphasis in original); <em>see also State v. Backstrand, </em>354 Or 392, 399 n 8, 313 P3d 1084 (2013) (declining to reconsider <em>Ashbaugh </em>test). A person is seized under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, if the officer adds \u201cto those inherent pressures [created by the officer\u2019s status as an authority figure] by * * * engaging in a show of authority that, explicitly or implicitly, reasonably conveys to the person a significant restriction on the person\u2019s freedom to terminate the encounter or otherwise go about his or her ordinary affairs.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>354 Or 440, 450, 313 P3d 1113 (2013) (citing <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 402) (internal quotation marks omitted). To determine whether the officer has manifested such a \u201cshow of authority,\u201d it is necessary to examine the facts of each particular case, based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>A show of authority may be established by the overall context of the police-citizen encounter, including the content of the officer\u2019s questions, the officer\u2019s manner and actions during the encounter, the officer\u2019s physical acts\u2014 such as drawing weapons, shining a spotlight on a vehicle, or activating emergency lights or sirens \u2014 as well as the number of officers present, the officer\u2019s positioning in relation to the defendant, the officer\u2019s subjective intent to allow the defendant to leave, and whether the officer communicated those intentions to the defendant or otherwise acted upon those intentions so as to significantly restrict the defendant\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement. <em>See, e.g., Anderson, </em>354 Or App at 450-51 (content of officer\u2019s requests, manner of request, overall context of contact between officer and citizen); <em>Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or at 317 (officer\u2019s positioning in relation to defendant, officer\u2019s manner and actions, and content of questions); <em>State v. Smith, </em>247 Or App 624, 629, 270 P3d 382 (2012) (number of officers, physical acts, officer\u2019s positioning); <em>State v. Aronson, </em>247 Or App 422, 428, 271 P3d 121 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 33 (2012) (spotlight); <em>State v. Calhoun, </em>101 Or App 622, 624, 792 P2d 1223 (1990) (emergency lights and sirens).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Part of that context must take into account that, when an officer parks behind a defendant\u2019s car, that action may effectively prevent the defendant\u2019s egress. Thus, that action may transform a \u201cmere\u201d encounter into a seizure. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>259 Or App 294, 300, 313 P3d 388 (2013); <em>see also State v. Mesenbrink, </em>106 Or App 306, 309, 807 P2d 319, <em>rev den, </em>312 Or 235 (1991) (a stop occurs \u201cwhen an officer\u2019s vehicle blocks a vehicle in a manner that would prevent it from being driven away\u201d); <em>Aronson, </em>247 Or App at 428 (considerations relevant to the analysis of whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave include \u201cwhere an officer\u2019s vehicle physically blocks a suspect\u2019s vehicle from being driven away\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Although Schoenfeld\u2019s subjective intent when parking the patrol car may not have been to block defendant\u2019s car in its parking spot, those actions are part of the totality of the circumstances to be considered when analyzing whether Schoenfeld engaged in a show of authority. As indicated, I look at the objective <em>circumstances </em>\u2014 i.e., the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>positioning of Schoenfeld\u2019s patrol car \u2014 and not the subjective circumstances \u2014 that Schoenfeld did not intend to block defendant\u2019s car but intended to take control of the situation. Those objective facts indicate that Schoenfeld\u2019s decision to position the patrol car directly behind the Subaru, only one to two car lengths away, sideways in the driving area of the parking <em>lot </em>\u2014 i.e., the area that defendant needed to use if he decided to leave \u2014 effectively restricted defendant\u2019s freedom to terminate the encounter. Thus, the positioning of the patrol car is an important circumstance to consider in determining when Schoenfeld <em>engaged in a show of authority.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">That circumstance colors the remainder of the encounter for the purpose of the Article I, section 9, analysis. <em>See State v. Charles, </em>263 Or App 578, 585, 331 P3d 1012 (2014) (in determining whether a defendant was seized, we do not examine an officer\u2019s actions separately, but instead analyze \u201cwhether all of the officer\u2019s actions combine to form a whole greater than the sum of its parts; that is, whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would believe that the officer had intentionally and significantly deprived defendant of his freedom of movement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The remainder of Schoenfeld\u2019s actions plainly indicate when he engaged in a show of authority. By parking in such a manner, Schoenfeld was able to cross the distance between the patrol car and the Subaru within seconds. This show of authority culminated in Schoenfeld\u2019s \u201ccontact\u201d with defendant through the open window, which significantly restricted defendant\u2019s freedom to terminate the encounter and go about his affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">After Schoenfeld parked his car, within a span of 10 seconds, he rapidly approached the Subaru. Defendant and the third man were engaged in conversation as Schoenfeld approached. Before Schoenfeld could see into the vehicle and <em>before </em>seeing any furtive movements or evidence of illegal activity, he immediately ordered the third man to step back, interrupted the conversation between defendant and the third man, and positioned himself at the driver\u2019s door. By all indications, Schoenfeld physically blocked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>car door and restricted defendant\u2019s freedom of movement before he \u201ccontacted\u201d defendant through his open window. All of Schoenfeld\u2019s actions alerted defendant to Schoenfeld\u2019s presence and made his seizure a <em>fait accompli. </em>According to Schoenfeld\u2019s testimony, it was only <em>after he contacted defendant </em>that he saw defendant drop his hands to his lap and ordered defendant (and the passenger) to put their hands on the dashboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">In light of those circumstances, I readily conclude that Schoenfeld, in rapid succession, carried out actions that significantly restricted defendant\u2019s ability to \u201cotherwise go about his * * * ordinary affairs.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>354 Or at 450.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, I conclude that Schoenfeld engaged in a show of authority because he exercised control over the scene in a manner that exceeded the bounds of ordinary social encounters between private citizens. <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 399, 401. <em>But see State v. Dierks, </em>264 Or App 443, 450-51, 332 P3d 348 (2014) (concluding that when police officer \u201capproached a parked car, informed its occupants that they were in a high-crime area, asked if they had seen anything suspicious, and asked what they were doing,\u201d \u201ctook no physical action other than to approach the parked car,\u201d and \u201crequested no physical action from defendant and [her companion,]\u201d the officer\u2019s actions \u201cdid not communicate an exercise of authority of the kind required for a <em>seizure </em>\u2014 i.e., authority to restrain\u201d (brackets in original)); <em>Anderson, </em>354 Or at 453 (concluding that no stop occurred when three officers approached the defendant and his companion, asked the two to identify themselves, engaged in conversation, made inquiries relating to a separate, but ongoing, investigation, and asked to see identification, because, \u201cby those brief verbal exchanges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>and inquiries alone,\u201d the officers had not engaged in a show of authority).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Having made that determination, I turn to analyze whether Schoenfeld had reasonable suspicion to support the <em>stop.Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or at 308-09; ORS 131.615. Reasonable suspicion is a \u201cbelief that is reasonable under the totality of the circumstances existing at the time and place the peace officer acts.\u201d ORS 131.605(6); <em>State v. Faubion, </em>258 Or App 184, 193, 308 P3d 337 (2013) (noting that, when evaluating reasonable suspicion, we examine the facts known to the officer at the time the stop occurred). As relevant here,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the objective test \u201crequires the officer \u2018to point to specific and articulable facts,\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Aguilar, </em>139 Or App 175, 182, 912 P2d 379, <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 265 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 80, 854 P2d 421 (1993)), which need not \u201cconclusively indicate illegal activity but, rather, only [need to indicate] that those facts support the reasonable inference of illegal activity by that person,\u201d <em>State v. Hiner, </em>240 Or App 175, 181, 246 P3d 35 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">I conclude that Schoenfeld lacked reasonable suspicion to stop defendant. The majority bases much of its conclusion that reasonable suspicion existed on defendant\u2019s furtive gestures, defendant\u2019s presence in a high-crime area, Schoenfeld\u2019s knowledge that straws are often used to consume drugs, and the informant\u2019s report. That Schoenfeld saw defendant drop his hands to his lap, and, in Schoenfeld\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>view, was trying to hide something <em>after </em>he stopped defendant is of no import to the reasonable suspicion analysis. \u201cWhen there is evidence that criminal activity has in fact just occurred, [furtive movements] may provide a basis for believing that the actor has participated in it.\u201d <em>State v. Butkovich, </em>87 Or App 587, 591, 743 P2d 752, <em>rev den, </em>304 Or 548 (1987). However, at the time of the stop, Schoenfeld had not observed any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Further, a defendant\u2019s presence in a high-crime area carries minimal weight when evaluating the objective reasonableness of an officer\u2019s suspicion. <em>State v. Wiggins, </em>262 Or App 351, 361, 324 P3d 626 (2014); <em>see also State v. Bertsch, </em>251 Or App 128, 134, 284 P3d 502 (2012) (\u201c[A] person\u2019s presence in a location associated with drug activity is insufficient to support an objectively reasonable belief that the person is himself * * * engaged in drug activity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Likewise, Schoenfeld\u2019s knowledge that plastic straws are commonly used to smoke heroin, while relevant, only nominally influences the analysis. Although an officer\u2019s knowledge and experience may help explain why a fact is suspicious, further elaboration by the officer is required to prove that \u201cotherwise innocuous facts\u201d \u2014 such as sitting in the parking lot of a McDonald\u2019s with a plastic straw in your hand during the lunch hour \u2014 \u201care evidence of criminal activity.\u201d <em>State v. Alvarado, </em>257 Or App 612, 631, 307 P3d 540 (2013). Schoenfeld\u2019s \u201cknowledge\u201d alone \u201cis not a magical incantation with the power to imbue speculation, stereotype, or pseudoscience with an impenetrable armor of veracity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Daniels, </em>234 Or App 533, 541, 228 P3d 695 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">That leaves only the informant\u2019s report. Although a reliable informant\u2019s report can \u201cfurnish the required specific and articulable facts to support\u201d reasonable suspicion, <em>State v. Goss, </em>219 Or App 645, 650, 184 P3d 1155, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 94 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted), I agree with defendant that the \u201ccontent of the information relayed to Schoenfeld\u201d \u2014 recounting only that the informant had witnessed an \u201cillegal drug transaction\u201d \u2014 was too imprecise and vague, in itself, to support a reasonable belief that defendant had committed a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Schoenfeld received a report that two vehicles were sitting door-to-door in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot during the noon hour. The report included detailed descriptions of the vehicles, the occupants \u2014 including the number and ethnicity\u2014 of the vehicles, but included only vague information relating to the illegal activity, <em>viz., </em>that the informant had seen an \u201cillegal drug transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">When Schoenfeld arrived in the parking lot less than a minute after receiving the report, he observed innocuous facts \u2014 the presence of one of the described vehicles in the reported parking lot \u2014 that tended to corroborate the informant\u2019s report. However, despite arriving so close in time after receiving the report, Schoenfeld saw <em>no </em>evidence of any illegal activity or anything that would indicate that an \u201cillegal drug transaction\u201d had recently occurred. Instead, as he arrived, he saw that the occupants of the Subaru were talking to a third person who had apparently arrived in the seconds between Schoenfeld\u2019s receipt of the report and his arrival at the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The entire chain of events occurred in a very short span of time and, according to Schoenfeld\u2019s testimony, occurred sequentially. Neither the events that Schoenfeld observed <em>at the time of the stop, </em>nor the scant details provided by the informant\u2019s report were sufficient to constitute the \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d required to support a reasonable suspicion. <em>See State v. Simpson, </em>245 Or App 152, 156, 261 P3d 90 (2011) (explaining that the \u201cquantity and quality\u201d of information in an informant\u2019s report can affect a determination of reasonable suspicion); <em>State v. Hames, </em>223 Or App 624, 635, 196 P3d 88 (2008) (noting that the totality of the circumstances includes \u201cwhat an officer does not observe\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Thus, based on the totality of the circumstances, I would conclude that defendant was stopped when Schoenfeld contacted him through the open window, that stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion, and the subsequently obtained evidence should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-6\"> As noted by the majority, although Schoenfeld originally testified that he had seen defendant holding a lighter and straw, he later clarified at the suppression hearing that he had initially seen defendant possess only a straw.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-5\"> The majority too quickly bypasses the relevant facts relating to Schoenfeld\u2019s initial approach of the Subaru, jumping instead to \u201cthe point at which defendant became aware that Schoenfeld was standing at the open window of the Subaru.\u201d 266 Or App at 564. In determining when the stop occurred, the precise moment at which defendant became aware of the presence of a police officer and, relatedly, that the police officer was exerting control over the scene, are factors of decided importance. From a practical standpoint, it is difficult to conclude, as the majority appears to, that defendant was unaware of Schoenfeld\u2019s presence at the scene when Schoenfeld, while rapidly approaching defendant\u2019s car, ordered the third man to step back, interrupting defendant\u2019s conversation, which would have caused defendant to become aware that (a) a police officer was present and (b) was issuing orders to exert control over his companion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b591-6\"> Schoenfeld\u2019s actions as he approached defendant\u2019s car and contacted defendant through the window are sufficiently coercive to constitute a show of authority at that point. In <em>Dierks </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>the officers approached the defendants and initially asked them questions, asked for their identification, and, although the officers\u2019 questions \u201cmay have signaled to defendant that the officer suspected that she and her companion might be involved in criminal activity, those questions \u2018equally conveyed that the [officer was] interested in whatever information the two might be able to provide.\u2019\u201d <em>Dierks, </em>264 Or App at 451 (quoting Anderson, 354 Or at 453). In this case, by contrast, Schoenfeld\u2019s actions involved no \u201cmere conversation,\u201d but instead involved immediate orders to the third man and then to defendant and the passenger. Schoenfeld engaged in additional significant behavior by ordering the third man to step back \u2014 that is, he requested physical action from defendant\u2019s companion. <em>Cf. Dierks, </em>264 Or App at 450 (concluding that no stop occurred when the officer had \u201c\u2018requested no physical action from defendant and [her companion] at that point\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>354 Or at 450)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\"> Reasonable suspicion \u201chas subjective and objective components.\u201d <em>State v. Mitchele, </em>240 Or App 86, 90, 251 P3d 760 (2010). Defendant does not contend that Schoenfeld lacked subjective suspicion; thus, I only analyze the objective prong.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
