J.</author>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Petitioner seeks judicial review of an order of the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (the board), postponing his parole release date for 24 months on the ground that he had <em>\u201ca </em>present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u201d ORS 144.125(3)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dispositive issue on review is whether the board\u2019s decision to postpone petitioner\u2019s release date is supported by substantial evidence in the record, where petitioner\u2019s psychological evaluation states that he \u201ccould\u201d constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community. As explained below, we conclude that the board\u2019s finding that petitioner\u2019s psychological evaluation demonstrated that he had a present severe emotional disturbance that constituted a danger to the health or safety of the community is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">A detailed recitation of the historical facts and procedural circumstances giving rise to this case \u2014 which have been previously recounted by us and the Supreme Court, <em>see Gordon v. Board of Parole, </em>343 Or 618, 175 P3d 461 (2007) <em>(Gordon I); Gordon v. Board of Parole, </em>246 Or App 600, 267 P3d 188 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 341 (2012) <em>(Gordon II)\u2014 </em>would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is sufficient to note that, in 1975, petitioner raped and murdered a young mother in Roseburg. He was sentenced under what was known as the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d system to life in prison with the possibility of parole for the murder conviction and a consecutive 20-year indeterminate sentence for the rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Thereafter, in 1977, the legislature replaced the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d system with a new sentencing system\u2014 <em>viz., </em>the \u201cmatrix\u201d system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u201c[a]fter the legislature adopted the matrix system, the board adopted a policy under which it would permit inmates like petitioner, who were serving indeterminate sentences [under the discretionary system], to elect to be treated under the new matrix system. Over time, as the board amended its rules pertaining to the implementation of the new system, the board applied a policy under which it would consider each inmate\u2019s eligibility for release according to the statute and rules in effect when the inmate committed his or her crimes. For inmates who committed their crimes before the adoption of the matrix system and later elected to be treated under that system, the board applied a policy of determining the inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole according to the statute and rules in effect at the time of the inmate\u2019s election into the matrix system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 622-23. As pertinent here, under the matrix system, once the board sets an initial release date, the board may postpone that date only if, among other reasons, the inmate has \u201ca present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u201d ORS 144.125(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Although the parties agree that the matrix system applies to this case, they disagree as to when petitioner elected into that system. That is so because, in 1984, petitioner signed a request to be treated under the matrix system. Then, in 1985, the board issued an order stating that petitioner had signed an application for the purpose of remaining under the discretionary system. Ultimately, in 1988, petitioner again signed a request to be considered under the matrix system.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The date of petitioner\u2019s election into the matrix system is significant because it affects the information on which the board may rely in determining whether petitioner has a present severe emotional disturbance for purposes of ORS 144.125(3)(a). If he elected into the matrix system in 1984, the board may rely on \u201cboth a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis and other pertinent evidence in the record\u201d \u2014 that is, all evidence in the record. <em>See Weidner v. Armenakis, </em>154 Or App 12, 20, 959 P2d 623, <em>vac\u2019d and rent\u2019d, </em>327 Or 317 (1998), <em>dismissed by order </em>July 13, 1998, <em>reasoning readopted and reaffirmed in Merrill v. Johnson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>155 Or App 295, 964 P2d 284, <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 40 (1998).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, if petitioner did not opt into the matrix system until 1988, the board could rely only on the psychological evaluation in determining whether he has a present severe emotional disturbance. <em>See Peek v. Thompson, </em>160 Or App 260, 265-66, 980 P2d 178, <em>rev dismissed, </em>329 Or 553 (1999). That is so because an administrative rule, which was in effect during that time, imposed \u201ca greater limit on the [b]oard\u2019s authority to extend a release date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265; <em>see generally id. </em>at 264-66 (discussing OAR 255-60-006 (1988), which provided in part that, \u201c[i]f the evaluation does not make a finding of a severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community, the Board shall affirm the parole release date and set parole conditions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Against that historic backdrop, we turn to the procedural facts giving rise to this judicial review proceeding. In March 2009, the board conducted an exit interview with petitioner. Before the hearing, the board received a psychological evaluation from Dr. Stuckey. Because that evaluation is central to our analysis, we describe it in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Stuckey began by describing the circumstances giving rise to petitioner\u2019s rape and murder convictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">\u201c[0]n September 4, 1975[,] *** [petitioner] *** raped the victim and forced her to commit sodomy at gunpoint. He was subsequently arrested and placed in jail. He apparently posted bail and was allowed to leave Douglas County on the condition that he would return only for the purposes of meeting with his attorney. Approximately 15 days later, [petitioner] returned to the Roseburg area. According to the deputy district attorney, [petitioner] had premeditated the murder. He had chartered an airplane at the Hood River Airport. When he arrived at the Hood River Airport, he had his face wrapped in Ace bandages with only his mouth and eyes visible. He told the pilot that he had received Napalm burns in Vietnam and he was going to the Veteran\u2019s Hospital in Roseburg for corrective surgery. When he arrived at Roseburg, he instructed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>pilot to wait. He then removed the Ace bandages and called a taxi. He was carrying a manila envelope which contained a hunting knife, which was one of the murder weapons. He had the taxi drive him to the victim\u2019s husband\u2019s employment to determine that he was at work and not at home. He had entered a business and identified himself as \u2018Deputy Jones\u2019 from the city police department and requested to use a phone in order to call the victim\u2019s husband\u2019s employment to determine whether he was at work. In discovering that the victim\u2019s husband was at work, he walked to the victim\u2019s home. He then drove the victim to a construction site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">\u201cIn his taped confession, he stated that he almost let the victim go three or four times, but he thought about the trouble and expense in coming to the Roseburg area and decided to kill the victim so he would not have to worry about her any further. He stabbed the victim near the construction site and left the victim bleeding in the car with her two young children. He then stole a pickup truck and traveled back to the victim\u2019s car and placed the victim in the pickup and drove to a construction site where he beheaded her with a second knife and placed her body in a trench and covered it with gravel. He then drove three-quarters of a mile to another construction site and buried the victim\u2019s head. He then abandoned the pickup and obtained a ride to the local airport. He returned to Hood River on the same charter plane. He had clean clothes hidden under his seat at the Hood River Airport and he changed into the clean clothes. He placed the bloody clothes in a trash barrel at the service station.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In discussing the rape and murder, petitioner told Stuckey that, after he posted bail, he thought that he had \u201c\u2018[a] mission\u2019\u201d and that, when he realized that the victim would not go along with his wishes, he \u201cfelt angry\u201d and that \u201c \u2018 [he] had to do what [he] had to do.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In describing his interview findings, Stuckey stated that petitioner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">\u201cwas not able to penetrate below the surface of his preoccupation with diagnostic labels, including his report of [post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]. <em>He did not display any genuine feelings or empathy for the victim, in spite of his verbalization to the contrary. He certainly appeared to be a controlling individual during this interview, just as he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>did in the past. </em>He appeared egocentric, narcissistic!,] and self-absorbed throughout the interview process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">(Emphasis added.) Although petitioner did not exhibit overt signs \u201cindicative of a psychotic process\u201d and there did not \u201cappear to be a major affective disorder,\u201d Stuckey noted that petitioner \u201cpresented as having a characterological disorder of longstanding\u201d and \u201cwas certainly not in remission at the time of our interview.\u201d Further, Stuckey explained that petitioner \u201ccontinues to present with a controlling fashion with glib and superficial responses and a failure to experience deep, empathic-feeling concern for the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Stuckey also conducted \u201cobjective psychological testing,\u201d which \u201cindicated that [petitioner] scored at two standard deviations above the mean on the antisocial or psychopathic scale of the MM[P]I.\u201d According to Stuckey, petitioner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cappears to have deep-seated anger problems, which certainly were manifested in a deliberate and premeditated action at the time of this offense. [Petitioner] appears to be an individual who has a severe emotional disturbance that he attempts to cover up not only to others, but to himself. He simply has not dealt properly with the internal conflicts, attitudes, and emotions which were displayed at the time of the rape and the murder. * * <em>* He appears to be an extremely antisocial and rebellious individual.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">(Emphasis added.) In sum, Stuckey opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">\u201c[Petitioner] has a personality disorder, [not otherwise specified] with Antisocial [,] Dependent, Narcissistic and Avoidance Features. <em>He appears to be a highly egocentric individual with feelings of entitlement. In my opinion, he has not worked through or resolved the issues that caused him to act-out in a heinous, bizarre and cruel manner at the time of the murder. </em>As the district attorney stated, <em>there appears to be deep-seated revenge motive </em>in [petitioner\u2019s] background. In conclusion, it is my opinion that [petitioner] has a present severe emotional disturbance that <em>could </em>constitute a danger to the health and safety of the community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">(Emphasis and boldface added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Ultimately, in Board Action Form (BAF) 16, the board applied the legal standards in effect in 1984 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>determined that, based on Stuckey\u2019s \u201creport and diagnosis, coupled with all the information that the board is considering,\u201d petitioner had a present severe emotional disturbance that constituted a danger to the health or safety of the community and postponed his parole release date for 24 months. (Capitalization omitted.) Petitioner sought administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">In Administrative Review Response (ARR) 13, the board rejected petitioner\u2019s contentions that it had erred in postponing his release date. In doing so, the board offered two alternative rationales, each of which it deemed to be independently sufficient to support its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">First, the board rejected petitioner\u2019s contention that it had erred in \u201cdetermining that [his] matrix opt-in date is 1984\u201d rather than the date of his \u201clater matrix election * * * in 1988\u201d and, in turn, in applying the 1984 legal standards in determining whether to postpone his release date. Specifically, the board applied the <em>Weidner </em>standard described above, 266 Or App at 407-08, and determined that, after considering \u201call [of] the information available,\u201d including \u201cthe contents of [petitioner\u2019s] hearing packet, facts arising from the hearing itself, and the findings and conclusions of the psychological examiner,\u201d there \u201cwas ample evidence in the record to support a determination by the Board that [petitioner is] suffering from a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Second, and alternatively, the board rejected petitioner\u2019s contention that \u201cthe psychological evaluation [was] not adequate to support a [present severe emotional disturbance] finding and deferral of [his] parole under the *** 1988 rules.\u201d In doing so, the board reasoned that, even if it were required to apply the legal standards in effect in 1988 as petitioner contended \u2014 that is, the <em>Peek </em>standard described above, 266 Or App at 408 \u2014 it would find that he suffered from the requisite present severe emotional disturbance \u201cbased solely on Dr. Stuckey\u2019s psychological report.\u201d Specifically, the board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201cDr. Stuckey assigned a diagnosis of \u2018personality disorder, [not otherwise specified] with Antisocial [,] Dependent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Narcissistic and Avoidant features.\u2019 He stated that your demeanor during the interview was \u2018defensive, evasive and controlling.\u2019 Testing indicated a score of two standard deviations above the mean on the psychopathic scale of the MMPI. He opined that you attempt to cover up your severe emotional disturbance to yourself as well as to others, and that you \u2018simply [have] not dealt with the internal conflicts, attitudes, and emotions which were displayed at the time of the rape and the murder.\u2019 He added that you appear \u2018to be an extremely antisocial and rebellious individual.\u2019 Dr. Stuckey concluded that you remain a danger to the community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">(Brackets in ARR 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Petitioner sought judicial review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On review, petitioner challenges both of the board\u2019s rationales for postponing his release date. As explained below, because we conclude that the board did not err in postponing petitioner\u2019s release date based on its second alternative rationale, which was predicated on its application of the <em>Peek </em>standard, we need not in this case address, and resolve, petitioner\u2019s contentions relating to the board\u2019s application of the <em>Weidner </em>standard. <em>See Gordon II, </em>246 Or App at 607 (noting that the petitioner challenged the board\u2019s application of both standards; addressing only the petitioner\u2019s contentions pertaining to the board\u2019s application of the <em>Peek </em>standard because they were dispositive). We also reject petitioner\u2019s remaining due-process-related contentions without published discussion. Accordingly, we turn to petitioner\u2019s contentions pertaining to the board\u2019s application of the <em>Peek </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Specifically, petitioner contends that the board\u2019s decision to postpone his release date under the 1988 standards as construed in <em>Peek </em>was not supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>evidence. According to petitioner, \u201c [b]ecause it appears that the board could properly glean from [Stuckey\u2019s] report that petitioner has a [present severe emotional disturbance], the issue in this case is whether the disorder \u2018constitutes a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u2019\u201d In particular, petitioner explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\">\u201cStuckey did not address whether petitioner, or even individuals with petitioner\u2019s disorder in general, are at higher risk for violence than the general public. Stuckey did not attempt to assign a risk assessment rating to petitioner. Rather, Stuckey merely stated that his disorder <em>\u2018could </em>constitute a danger to the health and safety of the community.\u2019 The fact that Stuckey stated that petitioner \u2018could\u2019 constitute a danger is significant, because the question is not whether there is a potential that petitioner could constitute a danger but, rather, whether petitioner actually presents a danger. By using the modal verb \u2018could,\u2019 Stuckey rejected the suggestion that petitioner was presently dangerous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">(Record citations and footnote omitted; emphasis in petitioner\u2019s brief.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The board remonstrates that, \u201cwhen read as a whole, [Stuckey\u2019s evaluation] supports the board\u2019s conclusion that petitioner suffers from a severe emotional disturbance that makes him a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u201d In particular, the board notes that, \u201c[b]ecause petitioner is currently incarcerated, he <em>could </em>pose a danger <em>if </em>released into the community. In that context, it is of no moment that Dr. Stuckey did not use the word \u2018would.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Whether a petitioner has a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community is a determination \u201cthat the legislature intended the Board to make.\u201d <em>Weidner, </em>154 Or App at 19. \u201cAs we suggested in <em>Weidner, </em>the statute creates a legal, not a medical standard, so applying a medical diagnosis to that legal standard necessarily requires some translation from one system to the other.\u201d <em>Peek, </em>160 Or App at 268. The legal determination is composed of four elements: \u201cwhether petitioner (1) has an emotional disorder that is (2) present, (3) severe, and (4) one that made the petitioner a danger to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the health and safety of the community.\u201d <em>Gordon II, </em>246 Or App at 610 (internal quotation marks omitted). In making that determination, the board is required to review the psychological evaluation \u201cas a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611; <em>see Peek, </em>160 Or App at 269. \u201cNo \u2018magic words\u2019 are required because the report must satisfy the legal standard engrafted into the [applicable] statute and rule but need not use its particular words.\u201d <em>Gordon II, </em>246 Or App at 610 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Thus, under the <em>Peek </em>standard, the issue in this case is whether Stuckey\u2019s evaluation, reasonably understood in its entirety, permitted the board to find that petitioner had a present severe emotional disturbance that constituted a danger to the health or safety of the community. <em>Gordon II, </em>246 Or App at 609-10; <em>Peek, </em>160 Or App at 266. We review that finding for substantial evidence. <em>Gordon II, </em>246 Or App at 609; <em>Carter v. Board of Parole, </em>223 Or App 745, 750, 196 P3d 111 (2008); ORS 183.482(8)(c) (\u201cSubstantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d). In other words, we examine the record \u2014 that is, Stuckey\u2019s evaluation \u2014 as a whole to determine whether it permitted a reasonable person to make the finding that the board made. <em>Gordon II, </em>246 Or App at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Applying those principles here, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding that petitioner had a present severe emotional disturbance that constituted a danger to the health or safety of the community. As noted above, 266 Or App at 413, petitioner essentially acknowledges that, based on Stuckey\u2019s evaluation, the board was permitted to find that petitioner had a present severe emotional disturbance. Thus, the only issue is whether Stuckey\u2019s evaluation permitted the board to find that petitioner\u2019s disorder was one that \u201cconstitute [d] a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">We readily conclude that, viewed as a whole, Stuckey\u2019s evaluation permitted that finding. Although Stuckey stated that petitioner <em>\u201ccould </em>constitute a danger to the health and safety of the community,\u201d he described petitioner as a \u201ccontrolling,\u201d \u201cantisocial,\u201d \u201crebellious,\u201d and \u201chighly egocentric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>individual with feelings of entitlement\u201d and a \u201cdeep-seated revenge motive.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, Stuckey noted that petitioner \u201cdid not display any genuine feelings or empathy for the victim, in spite of his verbalization to the contrary.\u201d Moreover, and significantly, Stuckey explained that petitioner \u201chas not worked through or resolved the issues that caused him to act-out in a heinous, bizarre and cruel manner at the time of the murder.\u201d Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding that petitioner had a present severe emotional disturbance that constituted a danger to the health or safety of the community, and, in turn, its decision to postpone petitioner\u2019s release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> Although ORS 144.125 has been amended several times since the relevant time period in this case, those amendments are not material to our analysis.
