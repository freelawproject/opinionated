After Johnson put defendant in a headlock and punched him in the head several times, defendant retrieved a knife from his backpack and repeatedly stabbed Johnson. Defendant asserted that he had acted in self-defense. During the jury trial, defendant testified that he had never stabbed anyone before. The state successfully argued that defendant\u2019s testimony could be impeached on cross-examination through questioning about a prior, unrelated incident, in which defendant had threatened a bicyclist with a knife. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred by allowing that evidence, and that the error requires a reversal of his conviction for first-degree assault. We conclude that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence because the prior incident was not relevant to impeach defendant\u2019s testimony that he had never stabbed anyone before. However, we also conclude that the error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The facts relevant to our disposition are undisputed. Defendant, Johnson, and a third man were together at Johnson\u2019s apartment one night. Defendant and Johnson were drinking beer, playing music, and playing a game with a cue ball. At some point, Johnson placed defendant in a headlock and punched him on top of the head a couple of times. After Johnson released defendant, defendant retrieved a knife from his backpack and stabbed Johnson in the neck. Defendant proceeded to stab Johnson seven more times, including in the back of his legs. Defendant testified at trial that he was in fear of his life because, during the course of the night, Johnson had periodically become angry and hit defendant and had refused to let defendant leave. Defendant testified that he had preexisting spinal conditions that made him fearful that being hit again could cause paralysis or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>During the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">\u201c[Defendant]: *** I\u2019m going, what did I do, I\u2019m sitting there freaking out. I don\u2019t know, you never been in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I\u2019ve never stabbed someone, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\u201c[Defendant]: Yeah. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: So I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">\u201c[Defendant]: Well, I never have either, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">\u201c [Prosecutor]: I\u2019m sorry, what? You never have either?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">\u201c[Defendant]: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">At that point, the prosecutor argued that defendant\u2019s testimony that he had never stabbed anyone before opened the door to questioning defendant about an incident \u201cinvolving the defendant taking a swipe with the knife at a bicyclist [.]\u201d Defense counsel argued that the incident did not rebut defendant\u2019s statement and that defendant\u2019s testimony did not show that he had a particular character trait that the incident could be admissible to rebut. The trial court allowed the prosecutor to ask limited questions about the incident with the bicyclist, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-13\">\u201cI think it opens the door for the next question, which is, isn\u2019t it true that you\u2019ve tried to stab people before, and we\u2019ll see what he answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-15\">\u201cI think it goes to whether or not the State has a reasonable expectation of the truthfulness of the matter that they\u2019re asking about in cross, so I\u2019m going to allow it and I\u2019m going to stop it though at, isn\u2019t it true that you\u2019ve taken a swipe at other people with a knife. I\u2019m going to let it stop there, depending on what the defendant says.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">The following exchange on cross-examination then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-17\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: [Defendant], you said that you had never stabbed anyone before. Have you ever swung at anyone with a knife before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-19\">\u201c[Defendant]: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-20\">\u201c [Prosecutor]: And when was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u201c[Defendant]: I don\u2019t recall, but I know I\u2019ve done it before but I don\u2019t think I swiped, I just threatened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: You threatened someone else with a knife before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201c[Defendant]: Yeah. I didn\u2019t swipe. He was looking through the cars by the theater where I live. I can watch right out my window and he wouldn\u2019t leave and he was looking in the cars on his bicycle, and I said, get out, and he said, f you or whatever, and so I came out with it and then I went back in because he said he was going to call the police. So I went back in the house and just said, the police will come, you know, that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201c [Prosecutor]: You said the police came?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201c[Defendant]: I think so. I don\u2019t really remember because I \u2014 but I didn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t, you know \u2014 it didn\u2019t have anything to do with \u2014 it was protecting other people\u2019s property because I don\u2019t even drive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Evidence of prior, uncharged misconduct, such as the incident between defendant and the bicyclist, \u201cis not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.\u201d OEC 404(3). Such evidence of prior acts may, however, \u201cbe admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Evidence of prior, uncharged misconduct also may be used to impeach the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony. <em>State v. Manrique, </em>271 Or 201, 213, 531 P2d 239 (1975); <em>see also State v. Smith, </em>86 Or App 239, 244, 739 P2d 577 (1987) (evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d of the defendant that contradicts a statement of fact made by a witness may be used to impeach the witness\u2019s credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">On appeal, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the state to question him about the incident with the bicyclist because that evidence did not contradict his statement that he had never stabbed anyone before. As a result, defendant argues, the evidence was not proper impeachment and was relevant only as a means to infer that defendant has a violent temper, which is an impermissible basis for admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The state responds that the evidence was admissible for impeachment, because defendant had tried to persuade the jury in his opening statement that Johnson was a violent person and that defendant was not violent and only carried a knife for protection. In that context, the state urges, \u201cdefendant\u2019s unsolicited testimony that he had never stabbed anyone in the past created an inaccurate perception,\u201d and, thus, the state was entitled to impeach defendant with the prior incident to rebut a misleading inference. The state argues that the impeachment evidence did not have to directly contradict defendant\u2019s testimony \u201cin a literal sense\u201d to be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">We review the admission of evidence for errors of law. <em>State v. Grey, </em>175 Or App 235, 245, 28 P3d 1195 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 463 (2002). To be admissible, the evidence of defendant\u2019s incident with the bicyclist had to be \u201cindependently relevant for a noncharacter purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the state contends that the evidence was admissible for impeachment purposes and so was independently relevant for a noncharacter purpose. However, we conclude that the testimony concerning defendant\u2019s wielding of a knife when he confronted a bicyclist looking into cars outside defendant\u2019s home was not proper impeachment of defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Although a party may impeach a witness by contradicting the witness\u2019s testimony, <em>see State v. Gibson, </em>338 Or 560, 572-73, 113 P3d 423, <em>cert den, </em>546 US 1044 (2005) (discussing impeachment by contradiction), defendant testified during cross-examination that he had never <em>stabbed </em>anyone before. Defendant did not testify that he had never wielded a knife before. Indeed, he admitted that he knew how to handle a knife and how to protect himself with it. Evidence that defendant had, in a prior incident, threatened someone with a knife was not relevant to discredit his testimony that he had not stabbed anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">We also reject the state\u2019s argument that the evidence was admissible to impeach defendant\u2019s testimony in order to correct a \u201cmisperception\u201d that \u201cdefendant had not used his knife in a violent manner in the past.\u201d In the state\u2019s view, a misperception arose through a combination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of defendant\u2019s testimony that he had never stabbed anyone before and defense counsel\u2019s opening statement that defendant did not have the \u201cproblems\u201d that Johnson did with violent felony convictions and that defendant carried the knife only for protection. The state relies on a number of cases for that argument, including <em>Smith, </em>86 Or App at 246, and <em>Grey, </em>175 Or App at 249. We are not persuaded by the state\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s initial testimony on cross-examination was so broad in scope that it referred to any nonviolent use of a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">On cross-examination, defendant testified that \u201cI never have either,\u201d after the prosecutor volunteered that \u201cI\u2019ve never stabbed someone, no.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s testimony was as to a precise fact \u2014 that he never had stabbed someone before the incident with Johnson. That precise statement of fact is only susceptible to impeachment by contradiction with evidence that contradicts that same precise fact, that is, only by evidence that showed defendant had stabbed someone before. <em>See State v. Rood, </em>118 Or App 480, 486, 848 P2d 128, <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 272 (1993) (upholding exclusion of impeachment evidence offered by defendant because, \u201c[t]o be used for impeachment, a contradictory statement must be \u2018reasonably precise\u2019 and not merely a \u2018recitation of opinion and character\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>State v. Hayes, </em>117 Or App 202, 205, 843 P2d 948 (1992), <em>rev den, </em>316 Or 528 (1993)); <em>see also Hayes, </em>117 Or App at 205-06 (holding that impeachment by contradiction requires a precise fact statement to which the rebuttal evidence is contradictory because, \u201c [i] f a statement is ambiguous or imprecise, there is a danger that the evidence will seem to contradict something that was not intended\u201d). Defendant did not make a sweeping statement about never having displayed or threatened someone with a knife that the evidence could have impeached. <em>Cf. State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number><em>v. Schober, </em>67 Or App 385, 389, 678 P2d 746 (1984) (allowing evidence of prior instances of the defendant drinking to rebut his testimony that \u201cfor all practical purposes I do not drink\u201d). The impeachment evidence that the state introduced was not sufficiently precise to contradict the precise factual statement made by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The cases offered by the state do not persuade us otherwise. For example, in <em>Smith, </em>the defendant was charged with driving while suspended on a specific day. 86 Or App at 241. The defendant\u2019s son testified that the defendant did not drive his car on the day in question and also testified that he had not seen the defendant ever drive during his suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 241-43. We concluded that the trial court did not err in allowing the state to impeach the son with contradictory evidence that the defendant had driven his car the day after the day in question because it contradicted a statement of fact made by the defendant\u2019s son. <em>Id. </em>at 244. In <em>Grey, </em>the defendant was charged with harassment of a police officer. The defendant put on evidence that she had acted in the way she had because she was unfamiliar with American police practices. 175 Or App at 238-39. The state cross-examined the defendant about that claim and impeached her with questions about her two previous arrests. <em>Id. </em>at 242. We concluded that the evidence was proper impeachment because it showed that the defendant had prior contacts with American police and, thus, knowledge of police practices. <em>Id. </em>at 249-50. In both <em>Smith </em>and <em>Grey, </em>the impeachment evidence was sufficiently precise to contradict a specific fact statement made by the witness. Here, in contrast, defendant\u2019s encounter with the bicyclist did not impeach his factual statement that he had never stabbed someone before; rather, the state sought to contradict an alleged general perception about defendant\u2019s character and not his precise factual statement. The trial court erred in permitting the state to question defendant about the incident with the bicyclist because it was not relevant impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Although we conclude that the trial court erred, we cannot reverse defendant\u2019s conviction if that error was harmless. Erroneously admitted evidence is harmless if there is little likelihood that the error affected the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>In this case, defendant admitted to stabbing Johnson. The issue for the jury to resolve was whether defendant acted in self-defense under ORS 161.209.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Defendant argues that the error likely affected the jury\u2019s verdict because the jury could have used the evidence to infer that defendant had a violent temperament and thus also infer that defendant was the initial aggressor and used unreasonable force. The dispositive issue that the jury was required to resolve was not whether defendant was the initial aggressor \u2014 it being undisputed that the incident started with Johnson putting defendant in a headlock and hitting him \u2014 but whether defendant used \u201cforce which [defendant] reasonably believe [d] [was] necessary for the purpose [of self-defense].\u201d ORS 161.209. Given the undisputed evidence that what defendant feared was being hit by Johnson again and that he reacted by stabbing Johnson eight times, including in the back of the legs, the error at issue here had little likelihood of affecting the jury\u2019s verdict as to the \u201creasonable use of force\u201d issue. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\"> ORS 163.185(l)(a) provides that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of assault in the first degree if the person * * * [intentionally causes serious physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-5\"> We note that, because the state elicited the fact statement from defendant on cross-examination, the state also may have been precluded from seeking to impeach the statement on another ground: a party cannot elicit a collateral fact on cross-examination that is beyond the scope of direct examination and then use impeachment by contradiction to introduce extrinsic evidence concerning that collateral fact. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>277 Or 45, 48-49, 559 P2d 496 (1977) (reversible error to allow impeachment where state asked on cross-examination whether the defendant was a drug dealer so it could impeach the defendant with a prior conversation in which he admitted to being a drug dealer). However, because the issue was not raised by defendant, we do not discuss that point further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\"> ORS 161.209 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\u201cExcept as provided in ORS 161.215 and 161.219, a person is justified in using physical force upon another person for self-defense or to defend a third person from what the person reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force, and the person may use a degree of force which the person reasonably believes to be necessary for the purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
