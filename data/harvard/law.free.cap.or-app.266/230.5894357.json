J.</author>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">This case is on remand from the Oregon Supreme Court for a second time. For the reasons explained below, we now conclude that, because defendant was not seized for purposes of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In our original opinion, we vacated the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence found during the search of defendant\u2019s person and remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration in light of our decision in <em>State v. Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App 16, 200 P3d 149 (2008) <em>(Ashbaugh I), rev\u2019d, </em>349 Or 297, 244 P3d 360 (2010) <em>(Ashbaugh II), </em>in which we had held that a subjective test applied to determine whether a defendant had been stopped. <em>State v. Parker, </em>225 Or App 610, 202 P3d 205 <em>(Parker I), adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>227 Or App 413, 206 P3d 259 (2009) <em>(Parker II). </em>After the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Ashbaugh I, </em>it vacated our decision in <em>Parker </em>and remanded for reconsideration in light of its decision in <em>Ashbaugh II. State v. Parker, </em>349 Or 663, 249 P3d 1281 (2011) <em>(Parker III).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">On remand, noting that the facts of this case were \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from those in our decision in <em>State v. Highley, </em>219 Or App 100, 180 P3d 1230 (2008) <em>(Highley I), rev\u2019d, </em>354 Or 459, 313 P3d 1068 (2013) <em>(Highley II), </em>we concluded that defendant had been unlawfully seized because a reasonable person in his position would have concluded that he was the subject of an investigation and not free to leave when the officer asked defendant whether he had any warrants, obtained defendant\u2019s identifying information, and then returned to his vehicle to run a check to determine whether defendant was the subject of any warrants. <em>State v. Parker, </em>242 Or App 387, 255 P3d 624 (2011) <em>{Parker IV). </em>Following its reversal of our decision in <em>Highley I, </em>the Supreme Court vacated our decision in <em>Parker IV </em>and, once again, remanded this case for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>reconsideration in light of its decisions in <em>Highley II, State v. Backstrand, </em>354 Or 392, 313 P3d 1084 (2013), and <em>State v. Anderson, </em>354 Or 440, 313 P3d 1113 (2013). <em>State v. Parker, </em>355 Or 751, 331 P3d 1010 (2014) (Parker V).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">With four amplifications noted below, we take the material facts and a description of the procedural history of this case from <em>Parker I, </em>reiterating as we did there that \u201c [t]he trial court expressly found both the police officers\u2019 and the defendant\u2019s accounts of the facts to be \u2018accurate, and a fair recitation of what occurred.\u2019\u201d 225 Or App at 612.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cConsistently with that finding, the salient facts here are as follows: On May 23, 2006, defendant was a passenger in a pickup truck stopped by Portland Police Officers Cioeta and Boman for expired license plate tags. Boman asked the driver and the other passenger for their identification and obtained their information. Cioeta asked defendant if he had any outstanding warrants; defendant replied that he did not. Cioeta then asked for defendant\u2019s identification,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] wrote down defendant\u2019s information, returned the identification, and then immediately returned to the police vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201cThe officers ran all the occupants\u2019 information and checked them for warrants. In the meantime, at least one additional police vehicle arrived on the scene. Boman then asked the driver and another passenger to get out of the truck. The driver was cited for driving while suspended. Boman conducted a patdown search of the other passenger, informed him he was under arrest for an outstanding warrant, and placed him in custody. [Cioeta decided to tow the truck and inventory its contents because the driver\u2019s license was suspended.] Cioeta then approached defendant and asked him to get out of the truck. Cioeta asked defendant if he had any weapons; defendant denied that he did. Cioeta then asked for permission to search defendant, and defendant consented. Cioeta conducted a patdown search of defendant and retrieved a switchblade knife from defendant\u2019s pants pocket. [At no point during the encounter did Cioeta tell defendant that he was free to leave.] Defendant was arrested and subsequently charged with carrying a concealed weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>\u201cBefore trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence. The trial court denied that motion, concluding that \u2018regardless of anything that happened before, the consent was freely given and was voluntary.\u2019 Following a stipulated facts trial, the court convicted defendant of carrying a concealed weapon, ORS 166.240(1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><em>Parker I, 225 </em>Or App at 612-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">On remand, the dispositive issue is whether the encounter between defendant and the officers constituted a seizure for purposes of Article I, section 9. In supplemental briefing, relying on the historical and procedural facts as stated in <em>Parker I, </em>defendant contends that he was seized for purposes of Article I, section 9, because \u201cthere were numerous shows of authority creating the type of police dominated atmosphere that would indicate to a reasonable person that they were not free to leave and terminate the encounter.\u201d Specifically, defendant explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201c[T]he facts demonstrate an unbroken chain of police dominated events: the officer stopped the car in which defendant was a passenger; the police investigated defendant\u2019s associates; the police arrested defendant\u2019s associates; the police controlled defendant\u2019s movement by removing him from the car; the police obtained defendant\u2019s information to start a criminal investigation; and the police disregarded the defendant\u2019s denial of wrongdoing and requested consent. At no time during th[at] sequence of events did defendant leave and return or engage in a \u2018cat and mouse\u2019 game of legerdemain with the officers. A reasonable person in that same position would believe that the officer was using his authority to seize the person until the investigation was complete or the officer indicated as much.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Ashbaugh II, </em>a person is seized for purposes of Article I, section 9,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">\u201c(a) if a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricts, interferes with, or otherwise deprives an individual of that individual\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement; or (b) if a reasonable person under the totality of the circumstances <em>would </em>believe that (a) above has occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">349 Or at 316 (emphasis in original). The guiding principle in determining whether an encounter is a constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>significant seizure is whether the officer has manifested a \u201cshow of authority\u201d that intentionally and significantly restricts an individual\u2019s liberty. <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 399 (\u201cWhat distinguishes a seizure (either a stop or an arrest) from a constitutionally insignificant police-citizen encounter \u2018is the imposition, either by physical force or through some \u201cshow of authority,\u201d of some restraint on the individual\u2019s liberty.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Ashbaugh II, </em>349 Or at 309.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">A \u201cshow of authority\u201d is a \u201cprecise concept\u201d that requires \u201ca reasonable perception that an officer is exercising his or her official authority to restrain.\u201d <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 401. In other words, \u201c[e]xplicitly or implicitly, an officer must convey to the person with whom he is dealing, either by word, action, or both, that the person is not free to terminate the encounter or otherwise go about his or her ordinary affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401-02. Although that \u201cinquiry necessarily is fact-specific and requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 399, we and the Supreme Court have identified four salient principles, which inform our resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">First, \u201c[p]assengers in a stopped vehicle \u2014 whether [the vehicle has been] lawfully or unlawfully stopped \u2014 are not seized merely by virtue of their status as passengers.\u201d <em>State v. Ross, </em>256 Or App 746, 754, 304 P3d 759 (2013). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>State v. Amaya, </em>336 Or 616, 630-31, 89 P3d 1163 (2004),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201c[i]t is a truism that all passengers in a validly stopped car have been \u2018stopped,\u2019 at least physically. However, such a stop is not a \u2018seizure\u2019 of those passengers for constitutional purposes. It also is true that an officer may take reasonable steps respecting the passengers, including, for example, asking the passengers to exit the vehicle so the officer may search the vehicle, assuming that the driver has consented to the search or that it otherwise is justified. However, an officer\u2019s further exercise of coercive authority over the passengers after they are out of the vehicle may, in certain circumstances, constitute a seizure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">(Citation omitted.) In other words \u201ca passenger is only seized when there has been the imposition, either by physical force or through some show of authority, of some restraint on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>individual\u2019s liberty.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>256 Or App at 754 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see id. </em>at 752 (\u201cEither a police \u2018show of authority\u2019 during a traffic stop is sufficient to constitute a seizure under <em>Ashbaugh [II] </em>with respect to a passenger or it is not.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Second, \u201c[a] mere request for identification made by an officer in the course of an otherwise lawful police-citizen encounter does not, in and of itself, result in a seizure.\u201d <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 410. As the Supreme Court explained, \u201cthe fact that an individual \u2014 for reasons personal to that individual \u2014 feels obliged to cooperate with the officer simply because of the officer\u2019s status is not the form or source of coercion that is of constitutional concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402. Applying that principle in <em>Highley II, </em>the court reasoned that the officer\u2019s inquiry about whether the defendant was on probation followed by a request for identification, was \u201ca straightforward request for information and cooperation of the kind that this court, since <em>[State v.] Holmes, </em>[311 Or 400, 813 P2d 28 (1991),] has continued to affirm police officers may make without implicating Article I, section 9.\u201d 354 Or at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Third, in <em>Backstrand </em>\u2014 as well as in <em>Highley II </em>and <em>Anderson </em>\u2014 the Supreme Court \u201crepeatedly emphasized that neither briefly holding a person\u2019s identification card, nor calling in the person\u2019s identification information to check for warrants, necessarily and always meant that the person was stopped.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson, </em>264 Or App 754, 759, 333 P3d 1125 (2014). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Highley II,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201ca person who decides to cooperate with an officer\u2019s request for identification reasonably can expect that the officer will do something with that identification, such as seek to verify the person\u2019s identity or status. That the officer either retains the identification for a reasonable time while doing so, or swiftly returns the identification and uses information from it for those purposes, are not actions that transform a noncoercive encounter into one in which the individual\u2019s liberty is significantly restrained through an exercise of coercive police authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">354 Or at 470 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Finally, as we reasoned in <em>State v. Dudley, </em>245 Or App 301, 263 P3d 1054 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 838 (2014), unless coupled with other coercive actions, the combination of an officer (a) asking a passenger to get out of a car that the officer intends to search before having it towed due to the driver\u2019s arrest and (b) then seeking consent to search the passenger after he or she has denied having drugs or weapons in his or her possession does not constitute a \u201cshow of authority.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, in <em>Dudley, </em>we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">\u201cIn this case, the officer\u2019s actions toward defendant did not amount to a \u2018show of authority\u2019 that restricted her movement such that she was \u2018stopped\u2019 when she consented to the officer\u2019s search of her purse. *** [T]he officer\u2019s question whether defendant possessed any drugs or weapons was not a constitutionally significant \u2018show of authority,\u2019 and neither was his request that she step out of the car. Unlike in <em>State v. Courtney, </em>242 Or App 321, 325, 255 P3d 577[, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 401] (2011), the officer\u2019s question and his request that defendant step out of the car were not coupled with any other show of authority, such as the officer\u2019s command to the defendant in <em>Courtney </em>that he place his hands on top of his head and interlace his fingers. It follows under <em>Ashbaugh II </em>that the officer did not \u2018intentionally and significantly\u2019 interfere with defendant\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement when he asked defendant to get out of the car and that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s situation would not have believed that the officer had done so. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">245 Or App at 306-07.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Applying those principles to the circumstances of the encounter in this case, we conclude that defendant was not stopped because the officer\u2019s actions toward defendant did not amount to a \u201cshow of authority.\u201d Here, defendant was a passenger in a truck that was lawfully stopped by two officers. Officer Boman obtained identifying information from the driver and another passenger. Officer Cioeta spoke with defendant. In response to Cioeta\u2019s inquiry, defendant indicated that he had no outstanding warrants and provided identifying information, which the officer ran to check for warrants. As explained above, under the principles described in <em>Backstrand, Highley II, </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>those circumstances do not give rise to a constitutionally significant show of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">As a result of running the occupants\u2019 information, the officer learned that the other passenger had an outstanding warrant. In the meantime, at least one additional police vehicle arrived. At that point, Boman asked the driver and the other passenger to get out of the truck. The driver was cited for driving with a suspended license, and the other passenger was arrested and placed in custody. Cioeta decided to tow the truck and inventory its contents because the driver\u2019s license was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">At that point in the encounter, a single officer\u2014 Cioeta \u2014 turned his attention to defendant, who had remained in the truck\u2019s passenger seat. Cioeta asked defendant to get out of the truck and inquired as to whether he had weapons. When defendant denied that he possessed weapons, Cioeta sought his consent to search. Although Cioeta did not tell defendant that he was free to leave at any point during the encounter, there is no evidence that Cioeta drew a weapon, raised his voice, or otherwise spoke in a manner that was nonconversational.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Viewed in their entirety, those circumstances are materially indistinguishable from those in <em>Dudley </em>in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>we held that the defendant was not seized for purposes of Article I, section 9. As in <em>Dudley </em>\u2014 and consistently with the principles articulated in <em>Backstrand </em>and <em>Highley </em>II\u2014 the circumstances here demonstrate that the officers asked defendant, a passenger in a lawfully stopped truck, for information <em>(e.g, </em>identifying information, whether he had any warrants or possessed weapons) and sought his cooperation in various respects <em>(e.g., </em>asking defendant to get out of the truck after the driver had been cited for driving with a suspended license, the other passenger had been arrested, and defendant had been unable to produce identification other than a work badge; asking for defendant\u2019s consent to search). Nothing about those circumstances demonstrates that Cioeta, explicitly or implicitly, conveyed to defendant that he was not free to terminate the encounter or otherwise go about his ordinary affairs. <em>See Highley II, </em>354 Or at 473 (\u201cNone of [the officer\u2019s] actions \u2014 the request for identification, the check of defendant\u2019s probationary status, and the request for consent to search \u2014 individually constituted a seizure. Considered in combination, they were simply acts that occurred sequentially. They did not combine to form a whole greater than the sum of their parts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">In sum, given the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would not have believed that his or her liberty was significantly restrained. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> Article I, section 9 provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure [.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> Defendant testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really have ID, as such\u201d but showed Cioeta a work \u201cbadge []\u201d with his \u201cpicture on it.\u201d Cioeta asked defendant for his name and date of birth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-6\"> The defendant in <em>Dudley </em>petitioned the Supreme Court for review of our decision. The court held that petition in abeyance pending the issuance of its decisions in <em>Backstrand, Highley II, </em>and <em>Anderson. </em>Following the issuance of its decisions in those cases, the Supreme Court denied review in <em>Dudley.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"> <em>See State v. Smith, </em>247 Or App 624, 629, 270 P3d 382 (2012) (noting that, although it appeared that the officer had a valid reason related to the traffic stop for asking the defendant passenger to step out of the car \u2014 that is, the officer intended to have the car towed after learning that the driver\u2019s license was suspended \u2014 that reason was not expressed to the defendant when he was asked to step out of the car and the defendant was never told that he was free to leave; holding that \u201cthe officer\u2019s question whether defendant possessed any drugs or weapons was not a constitutionally significant \u2018show of authority\u2019 and neither was his request that he step out of the car\u201d); <em>State v.
