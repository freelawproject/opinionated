They reportedly were met by defendant\u2019s loud and repeated profanity-laced comments directed at police. Also present were her children and various neighbors in the residential neighborhood. During the second dispatch, as an officer attempted to arrest defendant, she allegedly thrusted her torso against the officer\u2019s torso as she said to the officer, \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d She was charged with the violations of disorderly conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>and harassment in the second degree. Following a nonjury trial, County Court found her guilty of both charges and sentenced her to 10 days in jail. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Defendant argues that the convictions were not supported by legally sufficient evidence and was against the weight of the evidence. There was proof that defendant engaged in a stream of protracted, loud and escalating obscenities with the aim of disparaging police, in the presence of her children and gathering neighbors. Despite repeated warnings and efforts by police to calm defendant, she persisted and eventually purposely initiated physical contact with an officer who was attempting to arrest her as she uttered a phrase reflecting the intentionality of her act. Viewed most favorably to the People, this proof was sufficient to establish disorderly conduct <em>(see People v Weaver, </em>16 NY3d 123, 128-129 [2011]; <em>see also People v Baker, </em>20 NY3d 354, 360-361 [2013]; <em>People v Tichenor, </em>89 NY2d 769, 776-777 [1997], <em>cert denied </em>522 US 918 [1997]), as well as harassment in the second degree <em>(see People v Collins, </em>178 AD2d 789, 789-790 [1991]). Upon independently weighing and considering the evidence in the record, while deferring to the many credibility determinations made by the factfinder with respect to the considerable conflicting proof, we find that defendant\u2019s convictions were not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]).</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-5\">McCarthy, Egan Jr. and Devine, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"Au8G\">Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, and matter remitted to the County Court of Columbia County for further proceedings pursuant to CPL 460.50 (5).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
