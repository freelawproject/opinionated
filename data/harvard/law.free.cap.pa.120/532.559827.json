On April 25,1887, the rule was made absolute, Woodward, J., without opinion filed, and an exception to the order sealed for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-6\">On May 3, 1887, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked leave to file the following exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-7\">1.

O'Weill, </em>for the plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-7\">1. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the aider-man within twenty days, paid the costs accrued, filed the affidavit and gave the bail required by the act of April 20, 1876, P. L. 43. On the argument, the defendant offered to file an amended affidavit to correspond with the requirements of \u00a7 1, act of February 28, 1870, P. L. 269, and an additional recognizance to meet the requirements of \u00a7 5, act of April 9, 1872, P. L. 48. It was error to quash the appeal, without allowing the appellant an opportunity to perfect it: Means v. Trout, 16 S. &amp; R. 349; Huntingdon v. Jackson, 2. P. &amp; W. 431; Adams v. Null, 5 W. &amp; S. 363; Koenig v. Bauer, 57 Pa. 171; Bream v. Spangler, 1 W. &amp; S 378; McIlhaney v. Holland, 111 Pa. 634.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-8\">2. The act of April 20, 1876, P. L. 43, is class legislation, and applies only to suits \u201c for wages for manual labor.\u201d The suit was brought in this case for \u201cwork and labor done,\u201d which might be work other than manual labor. As the plaintiffs are claiming a right not common to citizens generally, every requisite to bring the case within the act should appear upon the record clearly and not argumentatively: Womelsdorf v. Heifner, 104 Pa. 1; Del. &amp; H. Canal Co. v. Loftus, 71 Pa. 421.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-9\">3. The act of February 28, 1870, P. L. 269, was a special local act, providing only for appeals in suits for wages for work done in Luzerne county. Being class legislation, this act must be construed strictly. It is not set forth in the record of the justice that the work and labor for which the plaintiffs claimed was done in Luzerne county; wherefore, the act is not applicable. Even if it were applicable, it is repealed by \u00a7 6, act of April 9, 1872, P. L. 47.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-10\">4. But the Wages Act of April 9, 1872, P. L. 47, does not apply in this case: (1) Because it does not affirmatively appear that the employee was either a miner, mechanic, laborer or clerk. (2) Nor that the defendant is an owner, lessee, contractor, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>under-owner \u201cof any works, mines, manufactory or other business where clerks, miners or mechanics are employed.\u201d (8) The act of April 20, 1876, P. L. 43, under which this appeal was taken, regulates the entire subject and repeals all previous acts inconsistent therewith.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b571-5\"><em>Mr. Edward A. </em>Lynch, for the defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-6\">1. The grounds of the motion appeared of record. The transcript showed that the recognizance and the affidavit were not in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, act of February 28, 1870, P. L. 269, and of \u00a7\u00a7 1-5, act of April 9, 1872, P. L. 47, as amended by \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, act of June 13, 1883, P. L. 116. The appeal could not be taken under the act of April 20, 1876, P. L. 43, because the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was for \u201c work and labor done,\u201d and the provisions of that act have reference to wages for \u201cmanual labor:\u201d Womelsdorf v. Heifner, 104 Pa. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-7\">2. The act of April 20, 1876, does not repeal the local act of February 28, 1870, and the general act of April 9, 1872. Implied repeals are not favored; the inconsistency must be clear: Merritt v. Smith, 2 Pa. 161; Osborne v. Everitt, 103 Pa. 421.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-8\">3. The record does not show that an amended recognizance and affidavit were tendered or filed. The court could not say there was a good appeal as the record stood, and this was all they had to do with it: Carr v. McGovern, 66 Pa. 458; Cummings v. Forsman, 6 Pa. 194.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"APHY\">Mu. Justice Gbeen:</author>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">We think it quite clear that the act of April 9, 1872, P. L. 47, is not applicable to this case. By the first section, it is provided that moneys due for labor and services rendered by any miner, mechanic, laborer, or clerk, and many others, \u201cfrom any person or persons or chartered company employing clerks, miners, mechanics, or laborers, either as owners, lessees, contractors, or under-owners, of any works, mines, manufactory, or other business where clerks, miners, or mechanics are employed,\u201d shall be a lien, etc. Section 5 provides that, \u201c In all cases of appeal from the judgments of justices of the peace for wages or moneys mentioned in the first section of this act,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>a certain oath or affirmation shall be made and certain bail shall be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We have repeatedly held that any person who claims the benefit of this act must bring himself clearly within the description of persons who are entitled to its peculiar and special advantages: Wentroth\u2019s App., 82 Pa. <em>469; </em>Pardee\u2019s App., 100 Pa. 408. The wages must be due to one of the class named, and from one of the enumerated classes of debtors mentioned in the act, and this must be made affirmatively to appear in the claim for a lien, otherwise the claimant is not entitled to a lien. In regulating appeals from justices in the fifth section, the particular formalities required to be observed are obligatory only in case of suits for wages or moneys mentioned in the first section.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In the present case the only knowledge we can have on this subject, is that which is derived from an inspection of the justice\u2019s transcript. Upon referring to the transcript we find nothing to individuate the claim of the plaintiffs, except that it is for work and labor done by their son for the defendant. It is therefore not a claim by the laborer himself for his own wages, but by his parents for wages which they claim a right to have for services rendered by him. It is needless to say that the act of 1872 gives no preference to any such claims as this. But again, neither is the kind of .labor indicated, nor is there the slightest allegation on this record that the person who owes the wages is one of the enumerated classes of debtors against whom the preferences of the act are given. In either point of view there is an entire absence of the statutory requirements which are necessary to appear in order to bring this case within the purview of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">As the act of 1872 is inapplicable, it is only necessary to say that we are not referred to any other law which establishes the invalidity of the recognizance and affidavit for appeal entered and made when this appeal was taken. They are quite in conformity to the requirements of \u00a7 1 of the act of April 20,1876, P. L. 43, which seems to be applicable; but, whether it is or not, we are not shown any law or decision which invalidates the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Judgment reversed, appeal reinstated, and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
