L. 187, and the defendants claimed a deduction of five per centum from the amount of said assessment, for prompt payment thereof.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\">On November 21, 1887, the court, Rice, P. J., filed the following opinion and decree:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">Briefly stated, the case presented for decision is as follows: The duplicate of road taxes has been placed in the hands of the regularly elected and duly qualified collector, who has given the notice required by the seventh section of the act of June 25, 1885, P. L. 187. The sixty days period has not yet expired, and the defendants are prepared and willing to pay the amount assessed against them, less five per centum. The question is, whether they are entitled to that reduction for prompt payment.. They clearly are so, unless road taxes are excepted out of the provisions of the above cited section. The second proviso to the fourth section of the act reads as follows: \u201c The limitations in this act as to time and the requirements hereof relating to keeping an alphabetical list of \u25a0 persons charged with taxes, shall not apply to road taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-7\">What are the \u201c limitations as to time\u2019\u2019here referred to? These terms are somewhat indefinite and have not, to our knowledge, received judicial interpretation. Neither do we know what construction has heretofore been placed upon them in the practical execution of the law by collectors and other township officers throughout the commonwealth. It is therefore with some hesitation that we express our opinion that the terms refer to: 1st, the provision of the fourth section requiring the duplicate to be issued before August first; 2d, the provision of the seventh section fixing the period of sixty days within which the tax payer may obtain a reduction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>five per centum by payment of Ms taxes; and, 3d, tbe provision of the same section fixing a time when five per centum may be added to the taxes. The last two of these provisions are as fairly entitled as the first to be called \u201climitations as to time; \u201d there are no other provisions in the act to which the terms can apply, and the plural is used, signifying that the legislature had more than one in contemplation. For these reasons we do not feel justified in singling out one of these provisions and holding that the proviso applies to that alone. Hence we conclude that the provision of the seventh section relating to the payment of taxes within sixty days does not apply to road taxes, and that the defendants are not entitled to the five per centum abatement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-4\">Now, Nov. 21,1887, in accordance with the stipulations of the case stated, judgment is directed to be entered for the plaintiff for four hundred and sixty-one dollars ($461).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\">Judgment having been entered for the plaintiff as ordered, the defendants took this writ, assigning that the court erred:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\">1. In holding that the provision of the seventh section of the act of June 25, A. d. 1885, relating to the payment of taxes within sixty days, does not apply to road taxes and that the defendants are not entitled to the five per cent, abatement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">2.

L. 187, clearly applies to all taxes, the duplicates of which are placed in the hands of the collector, and road taxes would therefore be subject to the five per cent, abatement, unless the second proviso in the fourth section governs all other provisions of the \u2018act, and places a limitation on the effect of the seventh section. We submit that the application of the words \u201climitations as to time,\u201d in this proviso, is confined to the fourth section, in which it occurs, and it was error to give the proviso effect other than to the preceding enacting clause. A proviso is defined to be something engrafted upon a preceding enactment for the purpose of taking special cases out of it and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>providing specially for them. It is to be strictly construed, and takes no case out of the enacting clause which is not fairly within the terms of the proviso: Folmer\u2019s App., 87 Pa, 133; Lehigh Co. v. Meyer, 102 Pa. 479; United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141; Packer v. Railroad Co., 19 Pa. 211.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-5\">2. The special taxes that the supervisors have discretion to place in the hands of the collector, under \u00a7 4, are the special taxes provided by \u00a7 1, act of March 31, 1864, P. L. 162, to pay the indebtedness of the township found by proceedings under that act. The other \u201croad taxes,\u201d upon which they may exercise such discretion, are those levied under the act of February 28, 1835, P. L. 46, to discharge a debt due to a former supervisor, and the annual tax provided for in \u00a7 4, act of April 20,1874, P. L. 67, to pay the interest and principal of outstanding obligations. Therefore the duplicates for the taxes for laying out, opening, making or repairing roads and bridges shall\u2019be issued to the tax collector, and the duplicate for the special and other road taxes may be issued to him, in the discretion of the supervisors.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-6\"><em>Mr. John D. </em>Hayes, for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-7\">1.

Taking the act as a whole it was evidently intended to exclude the collecting of the road taxes from its operation, and this is apparent when it is - considered: (1) That road taxes may be worked out as heretofore. (2) That such road taxes as it may be lawful and necessary to collect in money, may in the discretion of the supervisors be placed in the hands of the collector, or the supervisor may collect them as heretofore. (3) The limitations in this act as to time do not apply to road taxes. (4) The requirements as to keeping an alphabetical list of persons charged with taxes do not apply to road taxes. (5) The provision that the collector is to receive 5 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>centum for the collecting of road taxes, if the duplicate is placed in his hands, whilst his commission on all taxes that must be collected by him is limited to 2 per centum, if paid to him within 60 days after publication of notice.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AEr\">Me. Justice Clark:</author>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">This case involves the construction of the act of assembly, approved June 25, 1885, P. L. 187, entitled, \u201cAn act regulating the collection of taxes in the several boroughs and townships of this commonwealth,\u201d as to the collection of road taxes. It must be conceded, that in respect of the road taxes the language of the act is much involved and obscure, but we think the conclusion to which the learned court below came in the construction is the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">It seems reasonably clear, the legislature intended that road taxes might be collected by the collector of taxes. The first clause of the fourth section of the act provides, that all of the several county, borough, township, school, poor and other authorities, empowered to levy taxes, within the boroughs and townships of the commonwealth, shall on or before the first day of August, in each year, issue their duplicates of taxes to the collector, directing and authorizing him to collect the taxes, etc. It is plain that the road taxes are embraced within this provision of the act, subject of course, to the subsequent clauses and sections having special reference to this particular subject. It is provided, however, that \u201croad taxes may be worked out as heretofore.\u201d But if the duplicate of the road taxes should issue to the collector, on or before the first day of August in each year, the policy of the state heretofore pursued, with respect to the repair of the public roads, would be practically defeated. It is a fact known from common observation and experience, that the repair of the roads can be more conveniently and effectively made in the months of August, September, October, and November, than in any other portion of the year, and the great bulk of the work has heretofore been done during those months. To confine the supervisors and the tax-payers to the months prior to August, would operate as a practical denial of the privilege. The right to work out the road taxes is one which is exercised mainly by those engaged in farming, and as the spring and early summer months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>must necessarily be given to tbe work of tbe farm, those engaged in such pursuits could not and would not neglect the cultivation and harvesting of their crops to work on the roads. \u2018 It was doubtless deemed impracticable therefore, to limit the time for the issuing of the duplicate of road taxes to the first day of August.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Moreover, as the work on the roads would probably in most places and under most circumstances, extend into the late fall, or early winter, in order to give all the tax-payers an opportunity to work out their taxes, the duplicates would not ordinarily reach the collector\u2019s hands until it would be too late to comply with the provisions and limitations of the seventh section. The default in payment of the taxes within six months would, in many cases, perhaps, carry them over into the term of the incoming collector, and much confusion and embarrassment would certainly ensue in consequence. Such a result was not in the contemplation of the legislature. Hence it was provided, that the limitations of the act, \u201c as to time,\u201d etc., should not apply to road taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Whilst the opportunity to work out the road taxes has been held to be a condition precedent to the issuing of a warrant for their collection: Miller v. Gorman, 38 Pa. 309; Pierce v. Torrence, 2 Gr. 82; Hilbish v. Hower, 58 Pa. 93; yet it is not compulsory upon the tax-payer to do so, and in consequence a portion of the taxes generally remain, which it is \u201c lawful and necessary to collect in money.\u201d Besides there are certain special taxes, authorized by the acts of February 28, 1835, P. L. 46; March 31, 1864, P. L. 162,. and April 20, 1874, P. L. 67, which it is also \u201clawful and necessary to collect in money;\u2019\u2019 and, therefore, in the fourth section of the act of 1885, it is provided as follows: \u201c That such special and other road taxes, as it may be lawful and necessary to collect in money, may, at the discretion of the supervisors or road commissioners, be placed in the hands of the collector of taxes, with their warrant for collection by him; for which he shall receive five per centum of the amount collected by him, or the same may be collected by the supervisors or road commissioners as heretofore.\u201d By the \u201c special \u201d road taxes we are to understand, the taxes authorized to be levied under the several acts of assembly just referred to, and the \u201c other \u201d road taxes, such as have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>not been worked out after full opportunity has been given. By this act of 1885, therefore, we have a special and exceptional, but uniform provision for the collection of road taxes; payable in money ; a provision which excludes the limitations of the act of 1885, as to time, etc., but affords a speedy and adequate means for its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">This construction of the act is consistent with, and harmonizes all its provisions, and we are of opinion, that it is the correct one. It follows that the defendants were not entitled to the reduction of five per centum for prompt payment, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
