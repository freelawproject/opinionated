It was here libelled by the United States for forfeiture, and arrested by the marshal, under process therein, as prize of war. The property is still held by the marshal on that arrest, and due return is made by him of the seizure, and of public notice, thereof. No claim oi intervention is made in court for the property, and no proofs are given supporting the charges of the libel. Although, in cases of absolute necessity, proceedings, in prize may be prosecuted to effect without the observance of the formalities required by the prize rules, and the attendance and testimony of witnesses from the delinquent ship may be dispensed with, yet adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>.proof must be supplied, aliuude, of the de--lictum .charged, to enable the \u00a1court to sustain the accusation. Jecker v. Montgomery, 13 How. [54 U. S.] 198, and 18 How. [59 U. S.] 110. There is no legal proof that the lost vessel committed the offence alleged, or that this parcel of goods was part of her cargo. There is, therefore, no foundation laid for the exercise of prize jurisdiction over it.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Om\">The libellants will be allowed a reasonable time to furnish evidence of these facts, and, if they fail to produce such within thirty days from the entry of this order, the suit will be dismissed as not brought within the cognizance of the court. Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
