A plaintiff cannot be nonsuited against his consent, because he has a right by law to have his case submitted to a jury and the court. He may agree to a nonsuit; but, if he does not choose so to do, the court cannot compel him to submit to it. Elmore v. Grymes, 1 Pet. r20 U. S.] 471; D\u2019Wolf v. Rabaud, 1 Pet. [26 U.

Stewart, 7 Ala. 525: Scruggs v. Brackin, 4 Yerg. 528. A plaintiff may take a nonsuit at any time before the court or jury have actually rendered a verdict Lawrin v. Hawks. 3 McCord, 559; M\u2019Lughn v. Bovard, 4 Watts. 308: Wooster v. Burr, 2 Wend. 295; Haskell v. Whitney, 12 Mass. 49, note. In Arkansas it is provided by statute that \u201cno plaintiff shall be permitted to suffer a nonsuit on trial after the jury have retired from the bar, or the cause has been submitted to the court.\u201d Digest, p. 813, \u00a7 111. A nonsuit cannot be ordered by the court without the acquiescence of the plaintiff. The correct practice is to instruct the jury that, if the evidence has not proven a matter necessary to be proven, the jury must find for the defendant. Martin v. W\u2019ebb, 5 Ark. 74; Ringo v.
