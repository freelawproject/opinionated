By a statute of Arkansas in force 20th March, 1839. it is provided that, when an officer shall sell any real estate or lease of lands for more than three years, he shall make the purchaser a deed, to be paid for by the purchaser, reciting the names of the parties to the execution, the date when issued, the date of the judgment, order, or decree, and other particulars recited in the execution, also a description of the time, place, and manner of sale; which recital shall be received in evidence of the facts therein stated. Dig. p. 504, \u00a7 60. This was intended to supersede the necessity of producing the records from which the recitals are made, and to furnish evidence of the authority under which the officer acted, as well as the manner in which he had executed that authority. It is, however, only prima facie, and not conclusive, evidence, and may be rebutted by proof. Newton's Heirs v. State Bank, 14 Ark. 10; Hardy v.
