The case turns upon the interaction of relevant provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (IIRIRA or Act). The Act provides that every alien ordered removed from the United States has a right to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>one motion to reopen his or her removal proceedings. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The statute also provides, however, that if the alien\u2019s request for voluntary departure is granted after he or she is found removable, the alien is required to depart within the period prescribed by immigration officials, which cannot exceed 60 days. See \u00a71229c(b)(2) (2000 ed.). Failure to depart within the prescribed period renders the alien ineligible for certain forms of relief, including adjustment of status, for a period of 10 years. \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Pursuant to regulation, however, departure has the effect of withdrawing the motion to reopen. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Without some means, consistent with the Act, to reconcile the two commands \u2014 one directing voluntary departure and the other directing termination of the motion to reopen if an alien departs the United States \u2014 an alien who seeks reopening has two poor choices: The alien can remain in the United States to ensure the motion to reopen remains pending, while incurring statutory penalties for overstaying the voluntary departure date; or the alien can avoid penalties by prompt departure but abandon the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The issue is whether Congress intended the statutory right to reopen to be qualified by the voluntary departure process. The alien, who is petitioner here, urges that filing a motion to reopen tolls the voluntary departure period pending the motion\u2019s disposition. We reject this interpretation because it would reconfigure the voluntary departure scheme in a manner inconsistent with the statutory design. We do not have the authority to interpret the statute as petitioner suggests. Still, the conflict between the right to file a motion to reopen and the provision requiring voluntary departure no later than 60 days remains untenable if these are the only two choices available to the alien. Absent a valid regulation resolving the dilemma in a different way, we conclude the alien must be permitted an opportunity to withdraw the motion for voluntary departure, provided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>request is made before the departure period expires. Petitioner attempted to avail himself of this opportunity below. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not disturb the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA or Board) denial of petitioner\u2019s request to withdraw the voluntary departure election. We now reverse its decision and remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Petitioner Samson Taiwo Dada, a native and citizen of Nigeria, came to the United States in April 1998 on a temporary nonimmigrant visa. He overstayed it. In 1999, petitioner alleges, he married an American citizen. Petitioner\u2019s wife filed an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf. The necessary documentary evidence was not provided, however, and the petition was denied in February 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charged petitioner with being removable under \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as redesignated by IIRIRA \u00a7 305(a)(2), 110 Stat. 3009-598, and as amended, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. V), for overstaying his visa. Petitioner\u2019s wife then filed a second 1-130 petition. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied petitioner\u2019s request for a continuance pending adjudication of the newly filed 1-130 petition and noted that those petitions take an average of about three years to process. The IJ found petitioner to be removable but granted the request for voluntary departure under \u00a7 1229c(b) (2000 ed.). The BIA affirmed on November 4, 2005, without a written opinion. It ordered petitioner to depart within 30 days or suffer statutory penalties, including a civil fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 and ineligibility for relief under \u00a7\u00a7 240A, 240B, 245, 248, and 249 of the INA for a period of 10 years. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Two days before expiration of the 30-day period, on December 2, 2005, petitioner sought to withdraw his request for voluntary departure. At the same time he filed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>BIA a motion to reopen removal proceedings under 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V). He contended that his motion recited new and material evidence demonstrating a bona fide marriage and that his case should be continued until the second 1-130 petition was resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">On February 8, 2006, more than two months after the voluntary departure period expired, the BIA denied the motion to reopen on the ground that petitioner had overstayed his voluntary departure period. Under \u00a7 240B(d) of the INA, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), the BIA reasoned, an alien who has been granted voluntary departure but fails to depart in a timely fashion is statutorily barred from applying for and receiving certain forms of discretionary relief, including adjustment of status. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4. The BIA did not address petitioner\u2019s motion to withdraw his request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. <em>Dada </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>207 Fed. Appx. 425 (2006) <em>(per curiam). </em>Relying on its decision in <em>Banda-Ortiz </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>445 F. 3d 387 (2006), the court held that the BIA\u2019s reading of the applicable statutes as rendering petitioner ineligible for relief was reasonable. The Fifth Circuit joined the First and Fourth Circuits in concluding that there is no automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period. See <em>Chedad </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>497 F. 3d 57 (CA1 2007); <em>Dekoladenu </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>459 F. 3d 500 (CA4 2006). Four other Courts of Appeals have reached the opposite conclusion. See, <em>e. g., Kanivets </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>424 F. 3d 330 (CA3 2005); <em>Sidikhouya </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>407 F. 3d 950 (CA8 2005); <em>Marte </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>394 F. 3d 1278 (CA9 2005); <em>Ugokwe </em>v. <em>United States Atty. Gen., </em>453 F. 3d 1325 (CA11 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">We granted certiorari, see <em>Dada </em>v. <em>Keisler, </em>551 U. S. 1188 (2007), to resolve the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals. After oral argument we ordered supplemental briefing, see 552 U. S. 1138 (2008), to address whether an alien may withdraw his request for voluntary departure be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>fore expiration of the departure period. Also after oral argument, on January 10, 2008, petitioner\u2019s second 1-130 application was denied by the IJ on the ground that his marriage is a sham, contracted solely to obtain immigration benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Resolution of the questions presented turns on the interaction of two statutory schemes \u2014 the statutory right to file a motion to reopen in removal proceedings and the rules governing voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief that allows certain favored aliens \u2014 either before the conclusion of removal proceedings or after being found deportable \u2014 to leave the country willingly. Between 1927 and 2005, over 42 million aliens were granted voluntary departure; almost 13 million of those departures occurred between 1996 and 2005 alone. See Dept. of Homeland Security, Aliens Expelled: Fiscal Years 1892 to 2005, Table 38 (2005), online at http:// Avww.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics/publications/YrBk05En.shtm (all Internet materials as visited June 13, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">Voluntary departure was \u201coriginally developed by administrative officers, in the absence of a specific mandate in the statute.\u201d 6 C. Gordon, S. Mailman, &amp; S. Yale-Loehr, Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 74.02[1], p. 74-15 (rev. ed. 2007) (hereinafter Gordon). The practice was first codified in the Alien Registration Act of 1940, \u00a7 20, 54 Stat. 671. The Alien Registration Act amended \u00a719 of the Immigration Act of Feb. 5,1917,39 Stat. 889, to provide that an alien \u201cdeportable under any law of the United States and who has proved good moral character for the preceding five years\u201d may be permitted by the Attorney General to \u201cdepart the United States to any country of his choice at his OAvn expense, in lieu of deportation.\u201d \u00a7 20(c), 54 Stat. 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>In 1996, perhaps in response to criticism of immigration officials who had expressed frustration that aliens granted voluntary departure were \u201cpermitted to continue their illegal presence in the United States for months, and even years,\u201d Letter from Benjamin G. Habberton, Acting Commissioner on Immigration and Naturalization, to the Executive Director of the President\u2019s Commission on Immigration and Naturalization, reprinted in Hearings before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 1954 (Comm. Print 1952), Congress curtailed the period of time during which an alien may remain in the United States pending voluntary departure. The Act, as pertinent to voluntary departures requested at the conclusion of removal proceedings, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">\u201cThe Attorney General may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States at the alien\u2019s own expense if, at the conclusion of a proceeding under section 1229a of this title, the immigration judge enters an order granting voluntary departure in lieu of removal and finds that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">\u201c(A) the alien has been physically present in the United States for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the date the notice to appear was served under section 1229(a) of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">\u201c(B) the alien is, and has been, a person of good moral character for at least 5 years immediately preceding the alien\u2019s application for voluntary departure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">\u201c(C) the alien is not deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) or section 1227(a)(4) of this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">\u201c(D) the alien has established by clear and convincing evidence that the alien has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(l).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">See also \u00a7 1229c(a)(1) (\u201cThe Attorney General may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States at the alien\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>own expense under this subsection\u201d in lieu of being subject to removal proceedings or prior to the completion of those proceedings; the alien need not meet the requirements of \u00a7 1229c(b)(1) if removability is conceded).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">When voluntary departure is requested at the conclusion of removal proceedings, as it was in this case, the statute provides a voluntary departure period of not more than 60 days. See \u00a7 1229c(b)(2). The alien can receive up to 120 days if he or she concedes removability and requests voluntary departure before or during removal proceedings. See \u00a7 1229c(a)(2)(A). Appropriate immigration authorities may extend the time to depart but only if the voluntary departure period is less than the statutory maximum in the first instance. The voluntary departure period in no event may exceed 60 or 120 days for \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(b) and 1229c(a) departures, respectively. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26(f) (2007) (\u201cAuthority to extend the time within which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the Board is only within the jurisdiction of the district director, the Deputy Executive Associate Commissioner for Detention and Removal, or the Director of the Office of Juvenile Affairs.... In no event can the total period of time, including any extension, exceed 120 days or 60 days as set forth in section 240B of the Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The voluntary departure period typically does not begin to run until administrative appeals are concluded. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(47)(B) (\u201cThe order ... shall become final upon the earlier of \u2014 (i) a determination by the [BIA] affirming such order; or (ii) the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the [BIA]\u201d); \u00a7 1229c(b)(1) (Attorney General may permit voluntary departure at conclusion of removal proceedings); see also 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.6(a) (2007) (\u201c[T]he decision in any proceeding . . . from which an appeal to the Board may be taken shall not be executed during the time allowed for the filing of an appeal . . . \u201d). In addition some Federal Courts of Appeals have found that they may stay voluntary departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>pending consideration of a petition for review on the merits. See, <em>e. g., Thapa </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>460 F. 3d 323, 329-332 (CA2 2006); <em>Obale </em>v. <em>Attorney General of United States, </em>453 F. 3d 151, 155-157 (CA3 2006). But see <em>Ngarurih </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>371 F. 3d 182, 194 (CA4 2004). This issue is not presented here, however, and we leave its resolution for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Voluntary departure, under the current structure, allows the Government and the alien to agree upon a <em>quid pro quo. </em>From the Government\u2019s standpoint, the alien\u2019s agreement to leave voluntarily expedites the departure process and avoids the expense of deportation \u2014 including procuring necessary documents and detaining the alien pending deportation. The Government also eliminates some of the costs and burdens associated with litigation over the departure. With the apparent purpose of ensuring that the Government attains the benefits it seeks, the Act imposes limits on the time for voluntary departure, see <em>supra, </em>at 10, and prohibits judicial review of voluntary departure decisions, see 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(f) and 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Benefits to the alien from voluntary departure are evident as well. He or she avoids extended detention pending completion of travel arrangements; is allowed to choose when to depart (subject to certain constraints); and can select the country of destination. And, of great importance, by departing voluntarily the alien facilitates the possibility of readmission. The practice was first justified as involving \u201cno warrant of deportation ... so that if [the alien reapplies] for readmission in the proper way he will not be barred.\u201d 2 National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement: Report on the Enforcement of the Deportation Laws of the United States 57, 102-103 (1931) (Report No. 5). The current statute likewise allows an alien who voluntarily departs to sidestep some of the penalties attendant to deportation. Under the current Act, an alien involuntarily removed from the United States is ineligible for readmission for a period of 5, 10, or 20 years, depending upon the circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>removal. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71182(a)(9)(A)(i) (\u201cAny alien who has been ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title or at the end of proceedings under section 1229a of this title initiated upon the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States and who again seeks admission within 5 years of the date of such removal (or within 20 years in the case of a second or subsequent removal.. .) is inadmissible\u201d); \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii) (\u201cAny alien not described in clause (i) who \u2014 (I) has been ordered removed under section [240] or any other provision of law, or (II) departed the United States while an order of removal was outstanding, and who seeks admission within 10 years of the date of such alien\u2019s departure or removal.. . is inadmissible\u201d). An alien who makes a timely departure under a grant of voluntary departure, on the other hand, is not subject to these restrictions \u2014 although he or she otherwise may be ineligible for readmission based, for instance, on an earlier unlawful presence in the United States, see \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">A motion to reopen is a form of procedural relief that \u201casks the Board to change its decision in light of newly discovered evidence or a change in circumstances since the hearing.\u201d 1 Gordon \u00a73.05[8][c], at 3-76.32. Like voluntary departure, reopening is a judicial creation later codified by federal statute. An early reference to the procedure was in 1916, when a Federal District Court addressed an alien\u2019s motion to reopen her case to provide evidence of her marriage to a United States citizen. See <em>Ex parte Chan Shee, </em>236 F. 579 (ND Cal.); see also <em>Chew Hoy Quong </em>v. <em>White, </em>244 F. 749, 750 (CA9 1917) (addressing an application to reopen to correct discrepancies in testimony). \u201cThe reopening of a case by the immigration authorities for the introduction of further evidence\u201d was treated then, as it is now, as \u201ca matter for the exercise of their discretion\u201d; where the alien was given a \u201cfull opportunity to testify and to present all witnesses and documentary evidence at the original hearing,\u201d judicial in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>terference was deemed unwarranted. <em>Wong Shong Been </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>79 F. 2d 881, 883 (CA9 1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In 1958, when the BIA was established, the Attorney General promulgated a rule for the reopening and reconsideration of removal proceedings, 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2, upon which the current regulatory provision is based. See 23 Fed. Reg. 9115, 9118-9119 (1958), final rule codified at 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2 (1959) (\u201cThe Board may on its own motion reopen or reconsider any case in which it has rendered a decision\u201d upon a \u201cwritten motion\u201d); see also BIA: Powers; and Reopening or Reconsideration of Cases, 27 Fed. Reg. 96-97 (1962). Until 1996, there was no time limit for requesting the reopening of a case due to the availability of new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Then, in 1990, \u201cfear[ful] that deportable or excludable aliens [were] try[ing] to prolong their stays in the U. S. by filing one type of discretionary relief . . . after another in immigration proceedings,\u201d Justice Dept. Finds Aliens Not Abusing Requests for Relief, 68 Interpreter Releases 907, 908 (July 22, 1991) (No. 27), Congress ordered the Attorney General to \u201cissue regulations with respect to . . . the period of time in which motions to reopen . . . may be offered in deportation proceedings,\u201d including \u201ca limitation on the number of such motions that may be filed and a maximum time period for the filing of such motions,\u201d Immigration Act of 1990, \u00a7 545(d)(1), 104 Stat. 5066. The Attorney General found little evidence of abuse, concluding that requirements for reopening are a disincentive to bad faith filings. See 68 Interpreter Releases, <em>supra. </em>Because \u201cCongress . . . neither rescinded [n]or amended its mandate to limit the number and time frames of motions,\u201d however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a regulation imposing new time limits and restrictions on filings. The new. regulation allowed the alien to file one motion to reopen within 90 days. Executive Office for Immigration Review; Motions and Appeals in Immigration Proceedings, 61 Fed. Reg. 18900, 18901, 18905 (1996); see 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>With the 1996 enactment of the Act, Congress adopted the recommendations of the DOJ with respect to numerical and time limits. The current provision governing motions to reopen states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">\u201c(A) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201cAn alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\u201c(B) Contents</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">\u201cThe motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">\u201c(C) Deadline</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">\u201c(i) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">\u201cExcept as provided in this subparagraph, the motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d 8 U.

C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">To qualify as \u201cnew,\u201d \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B), the facts must be \u201cmaterial\u201d and of the sort that \u201ccould not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing,\u201d 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (2007); 1 Gordon \u00a7 3.05[8][c], at 3-76.34 (\u201cEvidence is not previously unavailable merely because the movant chose not to testify or to present evidence earlier, or because the IJ refused to admit the evidence\u201d). There are narrow exceptions to the 90-day filing period for asylum proceedings and claims of battered spouses, children, and parents, see 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), (iv) (2000 ed., Supp. V), which are not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">The Act, to be sure, limits in significant ways the availability of the motion to reopen. It must be noted, though, that the Act transforms the motion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statutory form of relief available to the alien. Nowhere in \u00a7 1229c(b) or \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) did Congress discuss the impact of the statutory right to file a motion to reopen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>on a voluntary departure agreement. And no legislative history indicates what some Members of Congress might have intended with respect to the motion\u2019s status once the voluntary departure period has elapsed. But the statutory text is plain insofar as it guarantees to each alien the right to file \u201cone motion to reopen proceedings under this section.\u201d \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The Government argues that, by requesting and obtaining permission to voluntarily depart, the alien knowingly surrenders the opportunity to seek reopening. See Brief for Respondent 29-30. Further, according to the Government, petitioner\u2019s proposed rule for tolling the voluntary departure period would undermine the \u201ccarefully crafted rules governing voluntary departure,\u201d including the statutory directive that these aliens leave promptly. <em>Id., </em>at 18, 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">To be sure, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(2) contains no ambiguity: The period within which the alien may depart voluntarily \u201cshall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days.\u201d See also 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26(f) (2007) (\u201cIn no event can the total period of time, including any extension, exceed\u201d the statutory periods prescribed by 8 U.

Further, \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) does not forbid a scheme under which an alien knowingly relinquishes the right to seek reopening in exchange for other benefits, including those available to the alien under the voluntary departure statute. That does not describe this case, however. Nothing in the statutes or past usage with respect to voluntary departure or motions to reopen indicates they cannot coexist. Neither \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) nor \u00a7 1229e(b)(2) says anything about the filing of a motion to reopen by an alien who has requested and been granted the opportunity to voluntarily depart. And there is no other statutory language that would place the alien on notice of an inability to seek the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>case\u2019s reopening in the event of newly discovered evidence or changed circumstances bearing upon eligibility for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In reading a statute we must not \u201clook merely to a particular clause,\u201d but consider \u201cin connection with it the whole statute.\u201d <em>Kokoszka </em>v. <em>Belford, </em>417 U.

S. C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V) to pursue \u201cone motion to reopen proceedings,\u201d the Government\u2019s position that the alien is not entitled to pursue a motion to reopen if the alien agrees to voluntarily depart is unsustainable. It would render the statutory right to seek reopening a nullity in most cases of voluntary departure. (And this group is not insignificant in number; between 2002 and 2006,897,267 aliens were found removable, of which 122,866, or approximately 13.7%, were granted voluntary departure. See DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, FY 2006 Statistical Year Book, p. Q1 (Feb. 2007).) It is foreseeable, and quite likely, that the time allowed for voluntary departure will expire long before the BIA issues a decision on a timely filed motion to reopen. See Proposed Rules, DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion To Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 72 Fed. Reg. 67674, 67677, and n. 2 (2007) (\u201cAs a practical matter, it is often the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>case that an immigration judge or the Board cannot reasonably be expected to adjudicate a motion to reopen or reconsider during the voluntary departure period\u201d). These practical limitations must be taken into account. In the present case the BIA denied petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen 68 days after he filed the motion \u2014 and 66 days after his voluntary departure period had expired. Although the record contains no statistics on the average disposition time for motions to reopen, the number of BIA proceedings has increased over the last two decades, doubling between 1992 and 2000 alone; and, as a result, the BIA\u2019s backlog has more than tripled, resulting in a total of 63,763 undecided cases in 2000. See Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP, Study Conducted for: the American Bar Association Commission on Immigration Policy, Practice and Pro Bono Re: Board of Immigration Appeals: Procedural Reforms To Improve Case Management 13 (2003), online at http://www.dorsey.com/files/upload/Dorsey StudyABA_8mgPDF.pdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Since 2000, the BIA has adopted new procedures to reduce its backlog and shorten disposition times. In 2002, the DOJ introduced rules to improve case management, including an increase in the number of cases referred to a single Board member and use of summary disposition procedures for cases without basis in law or fact. See BIA: Procedural Reforms To Improve Case Management, 67 Fed. Reg. 54878 (2002), final rule codified at 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.1 <em>et seq. </em>(2006); see also \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (summary affirmance procedures). Nevertheless, on September 30,2005, there were 33,063 cases pending before the BIA, 18% of which were more than a year old. See FY 2006 Statistical Year Book, <em>supra, </em>at Ul. On September 30,2006, approximately 20% of the cases pending had been filed during fiscal year 2005. See <em>ibid. </em>Whether an alien\u2019s motion will be adjudicated within the 60-day statutory period in all likelihood will depend on pure happenstance \u2014 namely, the backlog of the particular Board member to whom the motion is assigned. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>son, </em>503 U. S. 329, 334 (1992) (arbitrary results are \u201cnot to be presumed lightly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Absent tolling or some other remedial action by the Court, then, the alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis: He or she can leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order; but, pursuant to regulation, the motion to reopen will be deemed withdrawn. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d); see also 23 Fed. Reg. 9115, 9118, final rule codified at 8 CFR \u00a7 3.2 (1958). Alternatively, if the alien wishes to pursue reopening and remains in the United States to do so, he or she risks expiration of the statutory period and ineligibility for adjustment of status, the underlying relief sought. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (failure to timely depart renders alien \u201cineligible, for a period of 10 years,\u201d for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 240A, adjustment of status under \u00a7245, change of nonimmigrant status under \u00a7 248, and registry under \u00a7 249 of the INA); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4 (treating petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen as forfeited for failure to depart).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The purpose of a motion to reopen is to ensure a proper and lawful disposition. We must be reluctant to assume that the voluntary departure statute was designed to remove this important safeguard for the distinct class of deportable aliens most favored by the same law. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (barring aliens who have committed, <em>inter alia, </em>aggravated felonies or terrorism offenses from receiving voluntary departure); \u00a7 1229c(b)(1)(B) (requiring an alien who obtains voluntary departure at the conclusion of removal proceedings to demonstrate \u201cgood moral character\u201d). This is particularly so when the plain text of the statute reveals no such limitation. See <em>Costello </em>v. <em>INS, </em>376 U. S. 120, 127-128 (1964) (counseling long hesitation \u201cbefore adopting a construction of [the statute] which would, with respect to an entire class of aliens, completely nullify a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>cedure so intrinsic a part of the legislative scheme\u201d); see also <em>Stone </em>v. <em>INS, </em>514 U. S. 386, 399 (1995) (\u201cCongress might not have wished to impose on the alien\u201d the difficult choice created by treating a motion to reopen as rendering the underlying order nonfinal for purposes of judicial review); <em>INS </em>v. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.

Petitioner, as noted, proposes automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period during the pendency of the motion to reopen. We do not find statutory authority for this result. Voluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement. In return for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she \u201chas the means to depart the United States and intends to do so\u201d promptly. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(1)(D); 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1240.26(c)(1)-(2) (2007); cf. \u00a7 1240.26(c)(3) (the judge may impose additional conditions to \u201censure the alien\u2019s timely departure from the United States\u201d). Included among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the 60-day period. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brockamp, </em>519 U. S. 347, 352 (1997) (substantive limitations are not subject to equitable tolling). If the alien is permitted to stay in the United States past the departure date to wait out the adjudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>cation of the motion to reopen, he or she cannot then demand the full benefits of voluntary departure; for the benefit to the Government \u2014 a prompt and costless departure \u2014 would be lost. Furthermore, it would invite abuse by aliens who wish to stay in the country but whose cases are not likely to be reopened by immigration authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Although a statute or regulation might be adopted to resolve the dilemma in a different manner, as matters now stand the appropriate way to reconcile the voluntary departure and motion to reopen provisions is to allow an alien to withdraw the request for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The DOJ, which has authority to adopt regulations relevant to the issue at hand, has made a preliminary determination that the Act permits an alien to withdraw an application for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period. According to this proposal, there is nothing in the Act or the implementing regulations that makes the grant of voluntary departure irrevocable. See 72 Fed. Reg. 67679. Accordingly, the DOJ has proposed an amendment to 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26 that, prospectively, would \u201cprovide for the automatic termination of a grant of voluntary departure upon the timely filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider, as long as the motion is filed prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period.\u201d 72 Fed. Reg. 67679, Part IV-D; cf. <em>id., </em>at 67682, Part VI (\u201cThe provisions of this proposed rule will be applied prospectively only, that is, only with respect to immigration judge orders issued on or after the effective date of the final rule that grant a period of voluntary departure\u201d). Although not binding in the present case, the DOJ\u2019s proposed interpretation of the statutory and regulatory scheme as allowing an alien to withdraw from a voluntary departure agreement \u201cwarrants respectful consideration.\u201d <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs. </em>v. <em>Blumer, </em>534 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>U. S. 473, 497 (2002) (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mead Corp., </em>533 U. S. 218 (2001), and <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ. </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>512 U. S. 504 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">We hold that, to safeguard the right to pursue a motion to reopen for voluntary departure recipients, the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a voluntary departure request before expiration of the departure period, without regard to the underlying merits of the motion to reopen. As a result, the alien has the option either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forgo those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">If the alien selects the latter option, he or she gives up the possibility of readmission and becomes subject to the IJ\u2019s alternative order of removal. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1240.26(d). The alien may be removed by the DHS within 90 days, even if the motion to reopen has yet to be adjudicated. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(A). But the alien may request a stay of the order of removal, see BIA Practice Manual \u00a7 6.3(a), http://www. usdoj.gov/eoir/vll/qapracmanual/apptmtn4.htm; cf. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) (providing that a removal order entered <em>in absentia </em>is stayed automatically pending a motion to reopen); and, though the BIA has discretion to deny the motion for a stay, it may constitute an abuse of discretion for the BIA to do so where the motion states nonfrivolous grounds for reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Though this interpretation still confronts the alien with a hard choice, it avoids both the quixotic results of the Government\u2019s proposal and the elimination of benefits to the Government that would follow from petitioner\u2019s tolling rule. Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, the rule we adopt does not alter the <em>quid pro quo </em>between the Government and the alien. If withdrawal is requested prior to expiration of the voluntary departure period, the alien has not received benefits without costs; the alien who withdraws from a voluntary departure arrangement is in the same position as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>alien who was not granted voluntary departure in the first instance. Allowing aliens to withdraw from their voluntary departure agreements, moreover, establishes a greater probability that their motions to reopen will be considered. At the same time, it gives some incentive to limit filings to non-frivolous motions to reopen; for aliens with changed circumstances of the type envisioned by Congress in drafting \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) are the ones most likely to forfeit their previous request for voluntary departure in return for the opportunity to adjudicate their motions. Cf. Supp. Brief for Respondent 1-2 (\u201c[I]t is extraordinarily rare for an alien who has requested and been granted voluntary departure by the BIA to seek to withdraw from that arrangement within the voluntary departure period\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">A more expeditious solution to the untenable conflict between the voluntary departure scheme and the motion to reopen might be to permit an alien who has departed the United States to pursue a motion to reopen postdeparture, much as Congress has permitted with respect to judicial review of a removal order. See IIRIRA \u00a7 306(b), 110 Stat. 3009-612 (repealing 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1105a(c) (1994 ed.), which prohibited an alien who \u201cdeparted from the United States after the issuance of the order\u201d to seek judicial review). As noted previously, 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d) provides that the alien\u2019s departure constitutes withdrawal of the motion to reopen. This regulation, however, has not been challenged in these proceedings, and we do not consider it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Petitioner requested withdrawal of his motion for voluntary departure prior to expiration of his 30-day departure period. The BIA should have granted this request, without regard to the merits of petitioner\u2019s 1-130 petition, and permitted petitioner to pursue his motion to reopen. We find this same mistake implicit in the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>mand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b51-6\">Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join,</author>\n<p id=\"AR\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The statutory provision at issue here authorizes the Attorney General to permit an alien who has been found deport-able, if he so requests, to depart the country voluntarily. This enables the alien to avoid detention pending involuntary deportation, to select his own country of destination, to leave according to his own schedule (within the prescribed period), and to avoid restrictions upon readmission that attend involuntary departure. The statute specifies that the permission \u201cshall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days,\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229e(b)(2), and that failure to depart within the prescribed period causes the alien to be ineligible for certain relief, including adjustment of status, for 10 years, \u00a7 1229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Moreover, pursuant to a regulation that the Court accepts as valid, departure (whether voluntary or involuntary) terminates the alien\u2019s ability to move for reopening of his removal proceeding, and withdraws any such motion filed before his departure. See 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.2(d) (2007). All of these provisions were in effect when petitioner agreed to depart, and the Court cites no statute or regulation currently in force that permits an alien who has agreed voluntarily to depart to change his mind. Yet the Court holds that petitioner must be permitted to renounce that agreement (the opinion dresses this up as \u201cwithdraw[ing] the motion for voluntary departure\u201d) provided the request is made before the departure period expires. <em>Ante, </em>at 5. That is \u201cnecessary,\u201d the Court says, to \u201cpreserve the alien\u2019s right to pursue reopening,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 19, forfeiture of which was the known consequence of the departure he had agreed to. The Court\u2019s perceived \u201cnecessity\u201d does not exist, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>and the Court lacks the authority to impose its chosen remedy. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The Court is resolute in its belief that there is a \u201cconflict between the right to file a motion to reopen and the provision requiring voluntary departure no later than 60 days.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 5. The statute cannot be interpreted to put the alien to the choice of either (1) \u201cremaining] in the United States to ensure [his] motion to reopen remains pending, while incurring statutory penalties for overstaying the voluntary departure date\u201d or (2) \u201cavoiding] penalties by prompt departure but abandoning] the motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This, according to the Court, would \u201crender the statutory right to seek reopening a nullity in most cases of voluntary departure.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 16. Indeed, the problem is of mythological proportions: \u201c[T]he alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis: He or she can leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order; but, pursuant to regulation, the motion to reopen will be deemed withdrawn.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 18. So certain is the Court of this premise that it is asserted no less than seven times during the course of today\u2019s opinion. See <em>ante, </em>at 5, 16, 18-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The premise is false. It would indeed be extraordinary (though I doubt it would justify a judicial rewrite) for a statute to impose that stark choice upon an alien: depart and lose your right to seek reopening, or stay and incur statutory penalties. But that is <em>not </em>the choice this statute imposes. It offers the alien a deal, if he finds it in his interest and wishes to take it: \u201cAgree to depart voluntarily (within the specified period, of course) and you may lose your right to pursue reopening, but you will not suffer detention, you can depart at your own convenience rather than ours, and to the destination that you rather than we select, and you will not suffer the statutory restrictions upon reentry that accompany involuntary departure. If you accept this deal, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ever, but do not live up to it \u2014 if you fail to depart as promised within the specified period \u2014 you will become ineligible for cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, and voluntary departure.\u201d Seems entirely reasonable to me. Litigants are put to similar voluntary choices between the rock and the whirlpool all the time, without cries for a judicial rewrite of the law. It happens, for example, whenever a criminal defendant is offered a plea bargain that gives him a lesser sentence than he might otherwise receive but deprives him of his right to trial by jury and his right to appeal. It is indeed utterly commonplace that <em>electing </em>to pursue one avenue of relief may require the surrender of certain other remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Petitioner requested and accepted the above described deal, but now \u2014 to put the point bluntly but entirely accurately \u2014 he wants to back out. The case is as simple as that. Two days before the deadline for his promised voluntary departure, he filed a motion asking the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to reopen his removal proceedings and remand his case to the Immigration Judge for adjustment of status based on his wife\u2019s pending visa petition. Administrative Record 3; see <em>id., </em>at 8-21. The motion also asked the BIA to \u201cwithdraw his request for voluntary departure\u201d and \u201cinstead accep[t] an order of deportation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 10. After the voluntary departure period expired, the BIA denied petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen, explaining that under 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), \u201can alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure ... is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">It seems to me that the BIA proceeded just as it should have, and just as petitioner had every reason to expect. To be sure, the statute provides for the right to file (and presumably to have ruled upon in due course) a petition to reopen. But it does not forbid the relinquishment of that right in exchange for other benefits that the BIA has discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>provide. Nor does it suggest any weird departure from the ancient rule that an offer (the offer to depart voluntarily in exchange for specified benefits, and with specified consequences for default) cannot be \u201cwithdrawn\u201d after it has been accepted and after the <em>quid pro quo </em>promise (to depart) has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The Court\u2019s rejection of this straightforward analysis is inconsistent with its treatment of petitioner\u2019s argument that the statute requires automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period while a motion to reopen is pending. With respect to that argument, the Court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cVoluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement. In return for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she \u2018has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so\u2019 promptly. Included among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the 60-day period.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 19 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Precisely so. But also among the substantive burdens is the inability to receive certain relief through a motion to reopen once the promised departure date has passed; and perhaps paramount among the substantive burdens is that the alien is <em>bound </em>to his agreement. The Court is quite right that the Act does not allow us to require that an alien who agrees to depart voluntarily must receive the benefits of his bargain without the costs. But why does it allow us to convert the alien\u2019s statutorily required promise to depart voluntarily into an \u201coption either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forgo those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion\u201d? <em>Ante, </em>at 21. And why does it allow us to nullify the provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u00a7 1229c(d)(1) that failure to depart within the prescribed and promised period causes the alien to be ineligible for certain relief, including adjustment of status (which is what petitioner seeks here) for 10 years?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Of course it is not unusual for the Court to blue-pencil a statute in this fashion, directing that one of its provisions, severable from the rest, be disregarded. But that is done when the blue-penciled provision is <em>unconstitutional. </em>It would be unremarkable, if the Court found that the alien had a constitutional right to reopen, and that conditioning permission for voluntary departure upon waiver of that right was an unconstitutional condition, for the Court to order that the alien cannot be held to his commitment. But that is not the ease here. The Court holds that the plain requirement of the statute and of validly adopted regulations cannot be enforced <em>because the statute itself forbids it.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Not so. The Court derives this prohibition from its belief that an alien must, no matter what, be given the full benefit of the right to reopen, even if that means creating an extra-statutory option to renege upon the statutorily contemplated agreement to depart voluntarily. \u201cWe must be reluctant to assume,\u201d the Court says, \u201cthat the voluntary departure statute was designed to remove this important safeguard [of the motion to reopen],\u201d \u201cparticularly so when the plain text of the statute reveals no such limitation.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 18. But in fact that safeguard is not sacrosanct. The \u201cplain text of the statute\u201d does <em>cause </em>voluntary departure to remove that safeguard for at least 30 days of its 90-day existence, and <em>permits </em>voluntary departure to remove it almost entirely. Section 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V) generally permits the filing of a motion to reopen \u201cwithin 90 days of... entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d But as I have described, \u00a7 1229c(b)(2) (2000 ed.) provides that a grant of voluntary departure issued at the conclusion of removal proceedings \u201cshall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days.\u201d Since motions to reopen cannot be filed after removal or de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>parture, the unquestionable effect of the statutory scheme is to deprive the alien who agrees to voluntary departure of the (sacrosanct) right to reopen for a full third of its existence. And since 60 days is merely the maximum period for a voluntary departure, it is theoretically possible for the right to reopen to be limited to one week, or even one day. Given that reality, it is not at all hard to believe that the statute allows nullification of motions to reopen requesting adjustment of status filed within the 60-day departure period and not ruled upon before departure. Indeed, it seems to me much more likely that the statute allows that than that it allows judicial imposition of the unheard-of rule that a promise to depart is not a promise to depart, and judicial nullification of a statutorily prescribed penalty for failure to depart by the gimmick of allowing the request for voluntary departure to be \u201cwithdrawn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The same analysis makes it true that, even under the Court\u2019s reconstructed statute, a removable alien\u2019s agreement to depart voluntarily may limit, and in some instances foreclose, his ability to pursue a motion to reopen at a later date. Even if the alien who has agreed to voluntary departure is permitted to renege within the specified departure period, that period can be no longer than 60 days after entry of the order of removal \u2014 meaning that he has been deprived of at least 30 days of his right to reopen. Thus, the Court has not \u201creconciled\u201d statutory provisions; it has simply rewritten two of them to satisfy its notion of sound policy \u2014 the requirement of a commitment to depart and the prescription that a failure to do so prevents adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The Court suggests that the statute compels its conclusion because otherwise \u201c[wjhether an alien\u2019s motion will be adjudicated within the 60-day statutory period in all likelihood will depend on pure happenstance \u2014 namely, the backlog of the particular Board member to whom the motion is assigned\u201d and because \u201carbitrary results are \u2018not to be presumed lightly.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 17-18. It is, however, a happenstance that the alien embraces when he makes his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>commitment to leave, and its effect upon him is therefore not arbitrary. If he wants to be sure to have his motion to reopen considered, he should not enter into the voluntary departure agreement. A reading of the statute that permits that avoidable happenstance seems to me infinitely more plausible than a reading that turns a commitment to depart into an option to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">But the most problematic of all the Court\u2019s reasons for allowing petitioner to withdraw his motion to depart voluntarily is its reliance on the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) as-yet-unadopted proposal that is in some respects (though not the crucial one) similar to the Court\u2019s rule. See <em>ante, </em>at 20-21 (citing Proposed Rules, DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion To Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 72 Fed. Reg. 67674, 67677, and n. 2 (2007)). I shall assume that the proposed rule would be valid, even though it converts the statutory <em>requirement </em>of departure within the prescribed period (on pain of losing the right to seek adjustment of status) into an <em>option </em>to depart.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the Court, the proposed regulation \u201c\u2018warrants respectful consideration.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 20. What this evidently means is respectful adoption of that portion of the proposed regulation with which the Court agrees, and <em>sub silentio </em>rejection of that portion it disfavors, namely: \u201cThe provisions of this proposed rule will be applied . .. only with respect to immigration judge orders issued on or after the effective date of the final rule that grant a period of voluntary departure,\u201d 72 Fed. Reg. 67682. See Supp. Brief for Respondent 8-9 (observing that the rule \u201cwill not apply to petitioner\u2019s case\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Our administrative law jurisprudence is truly in a state of confused degeneration if this pick-and-choose technique constitutes \u201crespectful\u201d consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">It must be acknowledged, however, that the Department\u2019s proposed regulation has some bearing upon this case: It demonstrates that the agency is actively considering whether the terms it has prescribed for its discretionary grants of voluntary departure are too harsh and should be revised for the future, perhaps along the very lines that the Justices in today\u2019s majority would choose if they were the Attorney General. It shows, in other words, that today\u2019s interpretive gymnastics may have been performed, not for the enjoyment of innumerable aliens in the future, but for Mr. Dada alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In the final analysis, the Court\u2019s entire approach to interpreting the statutory scheme can be summed up in this sentence from its opinion: \u201cAllowing aliens to withdraw from their voluntary departure agreements . . . establishes a greater probability that their motions to reopen will be considered.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 22. That is true enough. What does not appear from the Court\u2019s opinion, however, is the source of the Court\u2019s authority to increase that probability in flat contradiction to the text, of the statute. Just as the <em>Government </em>can (absent some other statutory restriction) relieve criminal defendants of their plea agreements for one reason or another, the <em>Government </em>may well be able to let aliens who have agreed to depart the country voluntarily repudiate their agreements. This Court lacks such authority, and nothing in the statute remotely dictates the result that today\u2019s judgment decrees. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-6\"> An agency need not adopt, as we must, the <em>best </em>reading of a statute, but merely one that is permissible. See <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U. S. 837, 866 (1984). Moreover, the proposed rule, operating only prospectively, makes the ability to withdraw part of the deal that the alien accepts, and limits the alien\u2019s commitment accordingly. Petitioner\u2019s promise has already been made, and the requirement that he depart within the specified period is unconditional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> Justice Alito agrees that the statute does not require the BIA to grant petitioner\u2019s motion to withdraw from his agreement to depart voluntarily. He chooses to remand the case because the BIA did not give the reason for its denial of the withdrawal motion, and he believes the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>would be the wrong one if the BIA thought it lacked statutory authority to grant. <em>Post, </em>at 32 (dissenting opinion). But petitioner has challenged neither the adequacy of the BIA\u2019s reason for denying his motion, nor the BIA\u2019s failure to specify a reason. He has argued only that the statute requires that he be allowed to withdraw.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"Ay\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">This case presents two questions: (1) \u201c[wjhether the filing of a motion to reopen removal proceedings automatically tolls the period within which an alien must depart... under an order granting voluntary departure,\u201d Brief for Petitioner i, and (2) \u201c[wjhether an alien who has been granted voluntary departure and has filed a timely motion to reopen should be permitted to withdraw the request for voluntary departure prior to the expiration of the departure period,\u201d 552 U. S. 1138 (2008). I agree with the Court that the answer to the first question is no. <em>Ante, </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">As to the second question, the Court\u2019s reasoning escapes me. The Court holds as follows: <em>\u201cAbsent a valid regulation resolving the dilemma in a different way,\u201d </em>\u201cthe appropriate way to reconcile the\u201d relevant provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \u201cis to allow an alien to withdraw the request for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 5, 20 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court apparently does not hold that the statute compels the Government to permit an alien to withdraw a request for voluntary departure, only that the statute permits that approach, a proposition with which I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Since the statute does not decide the question whether an alien should be permitted to withdraw a voluntary departure request, the authority to make that policy choice rests with the agency. See, <em>e. g., Smiley </em>v. <em>Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., </em>517 U. S. 735, 740-741 (1996) (noting the \u201cpresumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency\u201d); <em>De</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>partment of Treasury, IRS </em>v. <em>FLRA, </em>494 U. S. 922, 932-933 (1990) (refusing to sustain an agency\u2019s decision on the ground that it was based on \u201ca permissible (though not an inevitable) construction of [a] statute,\u201d because the agency should define and adopt that construction \u201cin the first instance\u201d). Accordingly, at the time of the decision in petitioner\u2019s case, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) had the authority (1) to adopt the majority\u2019s automatic withdrawal rule (indeed, the agency has proposed a regulation to that effect, see <em>ante, </em>at 20), (2) to decide that withdrawal should be permitted in certain circumstances, which may or may not be present here, or (3) to hold that a motion to withdraw is never appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Neither the BIA nor the Fifth Circuit addressed petitioner\u2019s motion to withdraw, see <em>ante, </em>at 7, and therefore the ground for the Board\u2019s decision is unclear. I would affirm if the BIA either chose as a general matter not to permit the withdrawal of requests for voluntary departure or decided that permitting withdrawal was not appropriate under the facts of this case. However, if the BIA rejected the withdrawal request on the ground that it lacked the statutory authority to permit it, the Board erred. Because the ground for the BIA\u2019s decision is uncertain, I would vacate and remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
