S. C. \u00a7 1146(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Respondent Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., was granted an exemption for assets transferred after it had filed for bankruptcy but before its Chapter 11 plan was submitted to, and confirmed by, the Bankruptcy Court. Petitioner, the Florida Department of Revenue, seeks reversal of the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the Court of Appeals upholding the exemption for Piccadilly\u2019s asset transfer. Because we hold that \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s stamp-tax exemption does not apply to transfers made before a plan is confirmed under Chapter 11, we reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Piccadilly was founded in 1944 and was one of the Nation\u2019s most successful cafeteria chains until it began experiencing financial difficulties in the last decade. On October 29, 2003, Piccadilly declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 1101 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 ed. and Supp. V), and requested court authorization to sell substantially all its assets outside the ordinary course of business pursuant to \u00a7 363(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Piccadilly prepared to sell its assets as a going concern and sought an exemption from any stamp taxes on the eventual transfer under \u00a7 1146(a) of the Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Bankruptcy Court conducted an auction in which the winning bidder agreed to purchase Piccadilly\u2019s assets for $80 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">On January 26, 2004, as a precondition to the sale, Piccadilly entered into a global settlement agreement with committees of senior secured noteholders and unsecured creditors. The settlement agreement dictated the priority of distribution of the sale proceeds among Piccadilly\u2019s creditors. On February 13, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court approved the proposed sale and settlement agreement. The court also ruled that the transfer of assets was exempt from stamp taxes under \u00a7 1146(a). The sale closed on March 16, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Piccadilly filed its initial Chapter 11 plan in the Bankruptcy Court on March 26, 2004, and filed an amended plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>on July 31, 2004.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plan provided for distribution of the sale proceeds in a manner consistent with the settlement agreement. Before the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the plan, Florida filed an objection, seeking a declaration that the $39,200 in stamp taxes it had assessed on certain of Piccadilly\u2019s transferred assets fell outside \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s exemption because the transfer had not been \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d under Chapter 11. On October 21, 2004, the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan. On cross-motions for summary judgment on the stamp-tax issue, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in favor of Piccadilly, reasoning that the sale of substantially all Piccadilly\u2019s assets was a transfer \u201c \u2018under\u2019 \u201d its confirmed plan because the sale was necessary to consummate the plan. App. D to Pet. for Cert. 40a-41a. The District Court upheld the decision on the ground that \u00a7 1146(a), in certain circumstances, affords a stamp-tax exemption even when a transfer occurs prior to confirmation. <em>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., </em>379 B. R. 215, 226 (SD Fla. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that \u201c\u00a7 1146[(a)]\u2019s tax exemption may apply to <em>those </em>pre-confirmation transfers that are necessary to the consummation of a confirmed plan of reorganization, which, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>very least, requires that there be some nexus between the pre-confirmation transfer and the confirmed plan.\u201d <em>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., </em>484 F. 3d 1299, 1304 (2007) <em>(per curiam). </em>Finding the statutory text ambiguous, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a7 1146(a) should be interpreted consistent with \u201cthe principle that a remedial statute such as the Bankruptcy Code should be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court further noted that its interpretation of \u00a7 1146(a) better accounted for \u201cthe practical realities of Chapter 11 reorganization cases\u201d because a debtor may need to transfer assets to induce relevant parties to endorse the proposed confirmation of a plan. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court of Appeals acknowledged that its holding conflicted with the approach taken by the Courts of Appeals for the Third and Fourth Circuits, <em>id., </em>at 1302, which have held that \u00a7 1146(a) \u201cdoes not apply to ... transactions that occur prior to the confirmation of a plan under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,\u201d <em>In re Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del., </em>335 F. 3d 243, 246 (CA3 2003); see also <em>In re NVR, LP, </em>189 F. 3d 442, 458 (CA4 1999) (holding that \u00a7 1146(a) \u201capplies] only to transfers under the Plan occurring after the date of confirmation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. 1074 (2007), to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether \u00a7 1146(a) applies to preconfirmation transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Section 1146(a), entitled \u201cSpecial tax provisions,\u201d provides: \u201cThe issuance, transfer, or exchange of a security, or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer <em>under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title, </em>may not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Florida asserts that \u00a7 1146(a) applies only to postconfirmation sales; Piccadilly contends that it extends to preconfirmation transfers as long as they are made in accordance with a plan that is eventually confirmed. Florida and Piccadilly base their competing readings of \u00a7 1146(a) on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>provision\u2019s text, on inferences drawn from other Code provisions, and on substantive canons of statutory construction. We consider each of their arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Florida contends that \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s text unambiguously limits stamp-tax exemptions to postconfirmation transfers made under the authority of a confirmed plan. It observes that the word \u201cconfirmed\u201d modifies the word \u201cplan\u201d and is a past participle, <em>i. e., </em>\u201c[a] verb form indicating past or completed action or time that is used as a verbal adjective in phrases such as <em>baked beans </em>and <em>finished work.\u201d </em>American Heritage Dictionary 1287 (4th ed. 2000). Florida maintains that a past participle indicates past or completed action even when it is placed after the noun it modifies, as in \u201cbeans baked in the oven,\u201d or \u201cwork finished after midnight.\u201d Thus, it argues, the phrase \u201cplan confirmed\u201d denotes a \u201cconfirmed plan\u201d \u2014 meaning one that has been confirmed in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Florida further contends that the word \u201cunder\u201d in \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d should be read to mean \u201cwith the authorization of\u201d, or \u201cinferior or subordinate\u201d to its referent, here the confirmed plan. See <em>Ardestani </em>v. <em>INS, </em>502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991) (noting that a thing that is \u201c \u2018under\u2019 \u201d a statute is most naturally read as being \u201c \u2018subject to\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018governed by\u2019 \u201d the statute). Florida points out that, in the other two appearances of \u201cunder\u201d in \u00a7 1146(a), it clearly means \u201csubject to.\u201d' Invoking the textual canon that \u201c\u2018identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,\u2019\u201d <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc., </em>508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993), Florida asserts the term must also have its core meaning of \u201csubject to\u201d in the phrase \u201cunder a plan confirmed.\u201d Florida thus reasons that to be eligible for \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s exemption, a transfer must be subject to a plan that has been confirmed subject to \u00a7 1129 (2000 ed. and Supp. V). Echoing the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>NVR, supra, </em>at 457, Florida concludes that a transfer made prior to the date of plan confirmation cannot be subject to, or under the authority of, something that did not exist at the time of the transfer \u2014 a confirmed plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Piccadilly counters that the statutory language does not unambiguously impose a temporal requirement. It contends that \u201cplan confirmed\u201d is not necessarily the equivalent of \u201cconfirmed plan,\u201d and that had Congress intended the latter, it would have used that language, as it did in a related Code provision. See \u00a7 1142(b) (referring to \u201cany instrument required to effect a transfer of property dealt with by a confirmed plan\u201d). Piccadilly also argues that \u201cunder\u201d is just as easily read to mean \u201cin accordance with.\u201d It observes that the variability of the term \u201cunder\u201d is well documented, noting that the American Heritage Dictionary 1395 (1976) provides 15 definitions, including \u201c[i]n view of,\u201d \u201cbecause of,\u201d \u201cby virtue of,\u201d as well as \u201c[s]ubject to the restraint. . . of.\u201d See also <em>Ardestani, supra, </em>at 135 (recognizing that \u201c[t]he word \u2018under\u2019 has many dictionary definitions and must draw its meaning from its context\u201d). Although \u201cunder\u201d appears several times in \u00a7 1146(a), Piccadilly maintains there is no reason why a term of such common usage and variable meaning must have the same meaning each time it is used, even in the same sentence. As an illustration, it points to \u00a7 302(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which states, \u201cThe commencement of a joint case under a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief under such chapter.\u201d Piccadilly contends that this provision is best read as: \u201cThe commencement of a joint case <em>subject to the provisions of </em>a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief <em>in </em>such chapter.\u201d Piccadilly thus concludes that the statutory text \u2014 standing alone \u2014 is susceptible of more than one interpretation. See <em>Hechinger, supra, </em>at 253 (\u201c[W]e cannot say that the language of [\u00a7 1146(a)] rules out the possibility that \u2018under a plan confirmed\u2019 means \u2018in agreement with a plan confirmed\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>While both sides present credible interpretations of \u00a7 1146(a), Florida has the better one. To be sure, Congress could have used more precise <em>language </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>\u201cunder a plan <em>that has been </em>confirmed\u201d \u2014 and thus removed all ambiguity. But the two readings of the language that Congress chose are not equally plausible: Of the two, Florida\u2019s is clearly the more natural. The interpretation advanced by Piccadilly and adopted by the Eleventh Circuit \u2014 that there must be \u201csome nexus between the pre-confirmation transfer and the confirmed plan\u201d for \u00a7 1146(a) to apply, 484 F. 3d, at 1304\u2014 places greater strain on the statutory text than the simpler construction advanced by Florida and adopted by the Third and Fourth Circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Furthermore, Piccadilly\u2019s emphasis on the distinction between \u201cplan confirmed\u201d and \u201cconfirmed plan\u201d is unavailing because \u00a7 1146(a) specifies not only that a tax-exempt transfer be \u201cunder a plan,\u201d but also that the plan in question be confirmed pursuant to \u00a7 1129. Congress\u2019 placement of \u201cplan confirmed\u201d before \u201cunder section 1129\u201d avoids the ambiguity that would have arisen had it used the term \u201cconfirmed plan,\u201d which could easily be read to mean that the transfer must be \u201cunder section 1129\u201d rather than under a plan that was itself confirmed under \u00a71129.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Although we agree with Florida that the more natural reading of \u00a7 1146(a) is that the exemption applies only to postconfirmation transfers, ultimately we need not decide whether the statute is unambiguous on its face. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the language of \u00a7 1146(a) is facially ambiguous, the ambiguity must be resolved in Florida\u2019s favor. We reach this conclusion after considering the parties\u2019 other arguments, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Piccadilly insists that, whatever the degree of ambiguity on its face, \u00a7 1146(a) becomes even more ambiguous when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>read in context with other Bankruptcy Code provisions. Piccadilly asserts that if Congress had intended \u00a7 1146(a) to apply exclusively to transfers occurring after confirmation, it would have made its intent plain with an express temporal limitation similar to those appearing elsewhere in the Code. For example, \u00a71127 governs modifications to a Chapter 11 plan, providing that the proponent of a plan may modify the plan \u201cat any time before confirmation,\u201d or, subject to certain restrictions, \u201cat any time after confirmation of such plan.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 1127(a)-(b). Similar examples abound. See, <em>e. g., </em>\u00a7 1104(a) (\u201c[a]t any time after the commencement of the case but before confirmation of a plan . . . \u201d); \u00a7 1104(c) (\u201cat any time before the confirmation of a plan ... \u201d). Piccadilly emphasizes that, \u201cwhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d <em>Russello </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Congress did not impose a clear and commonly used temporal limitation in \u00a7 1146(a), Piccadilly concludes that Congress did not intend one to exist. Piccadilly buttresses its conclusion by pointing out that \u00a7 1146(b)\u2014the subsection immediately following \u00a7 1146(a)\u2014includes an express temporal limitation. See \u00a7 1146(b) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (providing that a bankruptcy court may declare certain tax consequences after the date a government unit responds to a plan proponent\u2019s request or \u201c270 days after such request,\u201d whichever is earlier). But Congress included no such limitation in subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Piccadilly also relies on other Code provisions to bolster its argument that the term \u201cunder\u201d preceding \u201ca plan confirmed\u201d in \u00a7 1146(a) should be read broadly \u2014 to mean \u201cin accordance with\u201d rather than the narrower \u201cauthorized by.\u201d Apart from \u00a7 302, discussed above, Piccadilly adverts to \u00a7111, which states that an agency providing credit counseling to debtors is required to meet \u201cthe standards set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>under this section.\u201d \u00a7 111(b)(4)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Piccadilly argues that this language requires the agency to meet \u201cthe standards set forth <em>in </em>this section,\u201d because reading the quoted language to mean \u201cthe standards set forth <em>authorized by </em>this section\u201d would render the words \u201cset forth\u201d nonsensical. Piccadilly additionally refers to \u00a7 303(a), which provides that \u201c[a]n involuntary case may be commenced only under chapter 7 or 11 of this title.\u201d Again, Piccadilly asserts that this language means \u201can involuntary case may be commenced only <em>in </em>chapter 7 or 11 of this title.\u201d It reasons that \u201cunder\u201d in \u00a7 303(a) cannot mean \u201cauthorized by\u201d because \u00a7 303(a) itself authorizes involuntary cases, and the provisions of Chapters 7 and 11 do not. Piccadilly makes a similar argument with respect to \u00a7 343, which provides that \u201c[t]he debtor shall appear and submit to examination under oath at the meeting of creditors.\u201d Reading \u201cunder\u201d to mean \u201cauthorized by\u201d would make little sense here. On the basis of these examples, Piccadilly concludes that the term \u201cunder\u201d is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Finally, Piccadilly maintains that \u201cunder\u201d in \u00a7 1146(a) should be construed broadly in light of \u00a7 365(g)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease constitutes the equivalent of a prebankruptcy breach \u201cif such contract or lease has not been assumed under this section or under a plan confirmed under chapter ... 11.\u201d In <em>Hechinger, </em>the Third Circuit concluded that substituting \u201cauthorized by\u201d for \u201cunder\u201d in \u00a7 1146(a) would be consistent with the use of the parallel language in \u00a7 365(g)(1). 335 F. 3d, at 254. Piccadilly attempts to refute Hechinger\u2019s reading of \u00a7 365(g)(1), asserting that, because authorization for the assumption of a lease under a plan is described in \u00a7 1123(b)(2), which \u201ccircles back to section 365,\u201d such authorization cannot be \u201csubject to\u201d or \u201cauthorized by\u201d Chapter 11. Brief for Respondent 39 (emphasis deleted); see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1123(b)(2) (providing that \u201ca plan may . . . subject to section 365 of this title, provide for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>assumption, rejection, or assignment of any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor not previously rejected under such section\u201d). The phrase \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d in \u00a7 365(g)(1), contends Piccadilly, is thus best read to mean <em>\u201cin accordance with </em>a plan confirmed\u201d because a plan may provide for the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease but not \u2014 unlike \u00a7 365 \u2014 be the ultimate authority for that assumption. As a result, Piccadilly concludes that the identical language of \u00a7 1146(a) should have the same meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Piccadilly supports this point with its assertion that, unlike sales, postconfirmation assumptions or rejections are not permitted under the Bankruptcy Code. See <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Bildisco &amp; Bildisco, </em>465 U. S. 513, 529 (1984) (stating that in \u201ca Chapter 11 reorganization, a debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed to decide whether to accept or reject an executory contract\u201d). Because, as Piccadilly contends, the phrase \u201cunder a plan confirmed under chapter ... 11\u201d in \u00a7 365(g)(1) cannot refer to assumptions or rejections occurring after confirmation, it would be anomalous to read the identical phrase in \u00a7 1146(a) to cover <em>only </em>postconfirmation transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">For its part, Florida argues that the statutory context of \u00a7 1146(a) supports its position that the stamp-tax exemption applies exclusively to postconfirmation transfers. It observes that the subchapter in which \u00a7 1146(a) appears is entitled, \u201cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS.\u201d Florida contends that, while not dispositive, the placement of a provision in a particular subchapter suggests that its terms should be interpreted consistent with that subchapter. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury, </em>489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989) (\u201cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme\u201d). In addition, Florida dismisses Piccadilly\u2019s references to the temporal limitations in other Code provisions on the ground that it would have been superfluous for Congress to add any fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ther limitations to \u00a71146(a)\u2019s already unambiguous temporal element.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Even on the assumption that the text of \u00a7 1146(a) is ambiguous, we are not persuaded by Piccadilly\u2019s contextual arguments. As noted above, Congress could have used language that made \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s temporal element clear beyond question. Unlike \u00a7 1146(a), however, the temporal language examples quoted by Piccadilly are indispensable to the operative meaning of the provisions in which they appear. Piccadilly\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 1127, for example, is misplaced because that section explicitly differentiates between preconfirmation modifications, see \u00a7 1127(a), and postconfirmation modifications, which are permissible \u201conly if circumstances warrant\u201d them, \u00a7 1127(b). It was unnecessary for Congress to include in \u00a7 1146(a) a phrase such as \u201cat any time after confirmation of such plan\u201d because the phrase \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d is most naturally read to require that there be a confirmed plan at the time of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Even if we were to adopt Piccadilly\u2019s broad definition of \u201cunder,\u201d its interpretation of the statute faces other obstacles. The asset transfer here can hardly be said to have been consummated \u201cin accordance with\u201d any confirmed plan because, as of the closing date, Piccadilly had not even submitted its plan to the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation. Piccadilly\u2019s asset sale was thus not conducted \u201cin accordance with\u201d any plan confirmed under Chapter 11. Rather, it was conducted \u201cin accordance with\u201d the procedures set forth in Chapter 3 \u2014 specifically, \u00a7 363(b)(1). To read the statute as Piccadilly proposes would make \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s exemption turn on whether a debtor-in-possession\u2019s actions are consistent with a legal instrument that does not exist \u2014 and indeed may not even be conceived of \u2014 at the time of the sale. Reading \u00a7 1146(a) in context with other relevant Code provisions, we find nothing justifying such a curious interpretation of what is a straightforward exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Nor does anything in \u00a7 365(g)(1) recommend Piccadilly\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1146(a). Section 365(g) generally allows a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>trustee to reject \u201can executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>to reject a contract that is unfavorable to the estate, subject to court approval. As the text makes clear, such approval may occur either under \u201cthis section,\u201d \u00a7 <em>365(g)</em>\u2014i. <em>e., </em>\u201cat any time before the confirmation of a plan,\u201d \u00a7 365(d)(2)\u2014or \u201cunder a plan confirmed under chapter 9,11,12, or 13,\u201d \u00a7 365(g)(1). Piccadilly relies heavily on <em>Bildisco, supra, </em>in which this Court held that \u00a7365 permits a debtor-in-possession to reject a collective-bargaining agreement like any other executory contract, and that doing so is not an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act. In reaching this conclusion, the Court observed that \u201ca debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed <em>to decide </em>whether to accept or reject an executory contract.\u201d 465 U. S., at 529 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We agree with <em>Bildisco\u2019s </em>commonsense observation that the <em>decision </em>whether to reject a contract or lease must be made before confirmation. But that in no way undermines the fact that the rejection takes <em>effect </em>upon or after confirmation of the Chapter 11 plan (or before confirmation if pursuant to \u00a7 365(d)(2)). In the context of \u00a7 1146(a), the decision whether to transfer a given asset \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d must be made prior to submitting the Chapter 11 plan to the bankruptcy court, but the transfer itself cannot be \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d until the court confirms the plan in question. Only at that point does the transfer become eligible for the stamp-tax exemption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>If the statutory context suggests anything, it is that \u00a7 1146(a) is inapplicable to preconfirmation transfers. We find it informative that Congress placed \u00a7 1146(a) in a sub-chapter entitled, \u201cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS.\u201d To be sure, a subchapter heading cannot substitute for the operative text of the statute. See, <em>e. g., Pennsylvania Dept of Corrections </em>v. <em>Yeskey, </em>524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (\u201c'[T]he title of a statute . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of the text\u2019\u201d). Nonetheless, statutory titles and section headings \u201c 'are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Nussle, </em>534 U. S. 516, 528 (2002). The placement of \u00a7 1146(a) within a subchapter expressly limited to postconfirmation matters undermines Piccadilly\u2019s view that \u00a7 1146(a) covers preconfirmation transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">But even if we were fully to accept Piccadilly\u2019s textual and contextual arguments, they would establish at most that the statutory language is ambiguous. They do not \u2014 and largely are not intended to \u2014 demonstrate that \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s purported ambiguity should be resolved in Piccadilly\u2019s favor. Florida argues that various nontextual canons of construction require us to resolve any ambiguity in its favor. Piccadilly responds with substantive canons of its own. It is to these dueling canons of construction that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Florida contends that even if the statutory text is deemed ambiguous, applicable substantive canons compel its interpretation of \u00a7 1146(a). Florida first invokes the canon that \u201cCongress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change.\u201d <em>Lorillard </em>v. <em>Pons, </em>434 U. S. 575, 580-581 (1978). Florida observes that the relevant language of \u00a7 1146(a) relating to \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d has remained unchanged since 1978 despite several revisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The most recent revision in 2005 occurred after the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>NVR </em>and the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Hecln</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>inger </em>but before the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision below. Florida asserts that Congress ratified this longstanding interpretation when, in its most recent amendments to the Code, it \u201creadopted\u201d the stamp-tax provision verbatim as \u00a7 1146(a). Brief for Petitioner 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Florida also invokes the substantive canon \u2014 on which the Third Circuit relied in <em>Hechinger </em>\u2014 that courts should \u201c \u2018proceed carefully when asked to recognize an exemption from state taxation that Congress has not clearly expressed.\u2019\u201d 335 F. 3d, at 254 (quoting <em>California State Bd. of Equalization </em>v. <em>Sierra Summit, Inc., </em>490 U. S. 844, 851-852 (1989)). In light of this directive, Florida contends that \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s language must be construed strictly in favor of the States to prevent unwarranted displacement of their tax laws. See <em>National Private Truck Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>515 U. S. 582, 590 (1995) (discussing principles of comity in taxation and the \u201cfederal reluctance to interfere with state taxation\u201d given the \u201cstrong background presumption against interference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Furthermore, Florida notes that the canon also discourages federal interference with the administration of a State\u2019s taxation scheme. See <em>id., </em>at 586, 590. Florida contends that the Court of Appeals\u2019 extension of \u00a7 1146(a) to preconfirmation transfers directly interferes with the administration of the State\u2019s stamp tax, which is imposed \u201cprior to recordation\u201d of the instrument of transfer. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 201.01, 201.02(1) (2006). Extending the exemption to transfers that occurred months or years before a confirmable plan even existed, Florida explains, may require the States to \u201c \u2018unravel\u2019 \u201d stamp taxes already collected. Brief for Petitioner 31. Alternatively, should a court grant an exemption under \u00a7 1146(a) before confirmation, States would be saddled with the task of monitoring whether the plan is ever eventually confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In response, Piccadilly contends that the federalism principle articulated in <em>Sierra Summit, supra, </em>at 852, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>apply where there is a \u201cclear expression of an exemption from state taxation\u201d overriding a State\u2019s authority to tax. In Piccadilly\u2019s view, that is precisely the case with regard to \u00a7 1146(a), which proscribes the imposition of stamp taxes and demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent to exempt a category of state taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Piccadilly further maintains that Florida\u2019s stamp tax is nothing more than a postpetition claim, specifically an administrative expense, which is paid as a priority claim ahead of the prepetition claims of most creditors. Equating Florida\u2019s receipt of tax revenue with a preference in favor of a particular claimant, Piccadilly argues that \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s ambiguous exemption should not be construed to diminish other claimants\u2019 recoveries. See <em>Howard Delivery Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zurich American Ins. Co., </em>547 U. S. 651, 667 (2006) (emphasizing that \u201cprovisions allowing preferences must be tightly construed\u201d). Reading the stamp-tax exemption too narrowly, Piccadilly maintains, \u201c \u2018is not only inconsistent with the policy of equality of distribution\u2019 \u201d but also \u201c \u2018dilutes the value of the priority for those creditors Congress intended to prefer\u2019 \u201d \u2014 those with prepetition claims. Brief for Respondent 54 (quoting <em>Howard Delivery Serv., supra, </em>at 667).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Above all, Piccadilly urges us to adopt the Court of Appeals\u2019 maxim that \u201ca remedial statute such as the Bankruptcy Code should be liberally construed.\u201d 484 F. 3d, at 1304; cf. <em>Isbrandtsen Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>343 U. S. 779, 782 (1952). In Piccadilly\u2019s view, any ambiguity in the statutory text is overshadowed by \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s obvious purpose: to facilitate the Chapter 11 process \u201cthrough giving tax relief.\u201d <em>In re Jacoby-Bender, Inc., </em>758 F. 2d 840, 841 (CA2 1985). Piccadilly characterizes the tax on asset transfers at issue here as tantamount to a levy on the bankruptcy process itself. A stamp tax like Florida\u2019s makes the sale of a debtor\u2019s property more expensive and reduces the total proceeds available to satisfy the creditors\u2019 claims, contrary to Congress\u2019 clear intent in enacting \u00a7 1146(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>What is unclear, Piccadilly argues, is why \u201cCongress would have intended the anomaly that a transfer essential to a plan that occurs two minutes before confirmation may be taxed, but the same transfer occurring two seconds after may not.\u201d Brief for Respondent 43. After all, interpreting \u00a7 1146(a) in the manner Florida proposes would lead precisely to that result. And that, Piccadilly asserts, is \u201cabsurd\u201d in light of \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s policy aim \u2014 evidenced by the provision\u2019s text and legislative history \u2014 of reducing the cost of asset transfers. In that vein, Piccadilly contends that interpreting \u00a7 1146(a) to apply solely to postconfirmation transfers would undermine Chapter ll\u2019s twin objectives of \u201cpreserving going concerns and maximizing property available to satisfy creditors.\u201d <em>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn. </em>v. <em>203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, </em>526 U. S. 434, 453 (1999). In order to obtain the maximum value for its assets \u2014 especially assets rapidly declining in value \u2014 Piccadilly claims that a debtor often must close the sale before formal confirmation of the Chapter 11 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">We agree with Florida that the federalism canon articulated in <em>Sierra Summit </em>and elsewhere obliges us to construe \u00a71146(a)\u2019s exemption narrowly. Piccadilly\u2019s effort to evade the canon falls well short of the mark because reading \u00a7 1146(a) in the manner Piccadilly proposes would require us to do exactly what the canon counsels against. If we recognized an exemption for preconfirmation transfers, we would in effect be \u201c \u2018recognizing] an exemption from state taxation that <em>Congress has not clearly expressed\u2019\u201d </em>\u2014 namely, an exemption for preconfirmation transfers. <em>Sierra Summit, supra, </em>at 851-852 (emphasis added); see also <em>Swarts </em>v. <em>Hammer, </em>194 U. S. 441, 444 (1904) (reasoning that if Congress endeavored to exempt a debtor from state and local taxation, \u201cthe intention would be clearly expressed, not left to be collected or inferred from disputable considerations of convenience in administering the estate of the bankrupt\u201d). Indeed, Piccadilly proves precisely this point by resting its entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>case on the premise that Congress has expressed its stamp-tax exemption in ambiguous language. Therefore, far from being inapposite, the canon is decisive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The canons on which Piccadilly relies are inapposite. While we agree with Piccadilly that \u201cprovisions allowing preferences must be tightly construed,\u201d <em>Howard Delivery Serv., supra, </em>at 667, \u00a7 1146(a) is not a preference-granting provision. The statutory text makes no mention of preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Nor are we persuaded that in this case we should construe \u00a7 1146(a) \u201cliberally\u201d to serve its ostensibly \u201cremedial\u201d purpose. Based on the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s declaration that the Bankruptcy Code is a \u201cremedial statute,\u201d Piccadilly would stretch the disallowance well beyond what the statutory text can naturally bear. Apart from the opinion below, however, the only authority Piccadilly offers is a 1952 decision of this Court interpreting the Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872. See Brief for Respondent 54 (citing <em>Isbrandtsen, supra, </em>at 782). But unlike the statutory scheme in <em>Isbrandtsen, </em>which was \u201c\u2018designed to secure the comfort and health of seamen aboard ship, hospitalization at home and care abroad,\u2019 \u201d 343 U. S., at 784 (quoting <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of N. J., </em>318 U. S. 724, 728-729 (1943)), the Bankruptcy Code \u2014 and Chapter 11 in particular \u2014 is not a remedial statute in that sense. To the contrary, this Court has rejected the notion that \u201cCongress had a single purpose in enacting Chapter 11.\u201d <em>Toibb </em>v. <em>Radloff </em>501 U. S. 157, 163 (1991). Rather, Chapter 11 strikes a balance between a debtor\u2019s interest in reorganizing and restructuring its debts and the creditors\u2019 interest in maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate. <em>Ibid. </em>The Code also accommodates the interests of the States in regulating property transfers by \u201c\u2018generally [leaving] the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt\u2019s estate to state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>549 U. S. 443, 450-451 (2007). Such interests often do not coincide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>and in this case, they clearly do not. We therefore decline to construe the exemption granted by \u00a7 1146(a) to the detriment of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">As for Piccadilly\u2019s assertion that reading \u00a7 1146(a) to allow preconfirmation transfers to be taxed while exempting others moments later would amount to an \u201cabsurd\u201d policy, we reiterate that \u201c \u2018it is not for us to substitute our view of . . . policy for the legislation which has been passed by Congress.\u2019\u201d <em>Hechinger, </em>335 F. 3d, at 256. That said, we see no absurdity in reading \u00a7 1146(a) as setting forth a simple, bright-line rule instead of the complex, after-the-fact inquiry Piccadilly envisions. At bottom, we agree with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s summation of \u00a7 1146(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\u201cCongress struck a most reasonable balance. If a debtor is able to develop a Chapter 11 reorganization and obtain confirmation, then the debtor is to be afforded relief from certain taxation to facilitate the implementation of the reorganization plan. Before a debtor reaches this point, however, the state and local tax systems may not be subjected to federal interference.\u201d <em>NVR, </em>189 F. 3d, at 458.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Lastly, to the extent the \u201cpractical realities\u201d of Chapter 11 reorganizations are increasingly rendering postconfirmation transfers a thing of the past, see 484 F. 3d, at 1304, it is incumbent upon the Legislature, and not the Judiciary, to determine whether \u00a7 1146(a) is in need of revision. See, <em>e. g., All </em>v. <em>Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>552 U. S. 214, 228 (2008) (\u201cWe are not at liberty to rewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem more desirable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The most natural reading of \u00a7 1146(a)\u2019s text, the provision\u2019s placement within the Code, and applicable substantive canons all lead to the same conclusion: Section 1146(a) affords a stamp-tax exemption only to transfers made pursuant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Chapter 11 plan that has been confirmed. Because Piccadilly transferred its assets before its Chapter 11 plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it may not rely on \u00a7 1146(a) to avoid Florida\u2019s stamp taxes. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below and remand the ease for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\"> When litigation commenced in the lower courts, the stamp-tax exemption was contained in \u00a7 1146(c) (2000 ed.). In 2005, Congress repealed subsections (a) and (b), and the stamp-tax exemption was recodified as \u00a7 1146(a). See Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, \u00a7 719(b)(3), 119 Stat. 133. For simplicity, we will cite the provision as it is currently codified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-6\"> Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings ordinarily culminate in the confirmation of a reorganization plan. But in some cases, as here, a debtor sells all or substantially all its assets under \u00a7 363(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) before seeking or receiving plan confirmation. In this scenario, the debtor typically submits for confirmation a plan of liquidation (rather than a traditional plan of reorganization) providing for the distribution of the proceeds resulting from the sale. Here, Piccadilly filed a Chapter 11 liquidation plan after selling substantially all its assets as a going concern. Although the central purpose of Chapter 11 is to facilitate reorganizations rather than liquidations (covered generally by Chapter 7), Chapter 11 expressly contemplates liquidations. See \u00a71129(a)(11) (2000 ed.) (\u201cConfirmation of the plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the debtor or any successor to the debtor under the plan, unless such liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the plan\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\"> Also meritless is Piccadilly\u2019s argument that \u201cunder\u201d in the phrase \u201cunder a plan confirmed under chapter . . . 11\u201d in \u00a7 365(g)(1) cannot be read to mean \u201csubject to\u201d because \u00a7 1123(b)(2), in Piccadilly\u2019s words, \u201ccircles back to section 365.\u201d Brief for Respondent 39 (emphasis deleted). Section 1123(b)(2) authorizes a plan to provide for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease, but requires that the plan do so in a manner consistent with the various requirements set forth throughout \u00a7 365. By contrast, the phrase \u201cunder this section\u201d in \u00a7 365(g)(1) serves as a reference to \u00a7 365(d)(2), which permits preconfirmation assumptions and rejections pursuant to a court order (and not, as in \u00a7 1123(b)(2), pursuant to a confirmed plan).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b81-6\">Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,</author>\n<p id=\"AK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The Bankruptcy Code provides that the \u201ctransfer\u201d of an asset <em>\u201cunder a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title, </em>may not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.\u201d 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1146(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (previously \u00a7 1146(c)) (emphasis added). In this case, the debtor\u2019s reorganization \u201cplan\u201d provides for the \u201ctransfer\u201d of assets. But the \u201cplan\u201d itself was not \u201cconfirmed under section 1129 of this title\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>the Bankruptcy Judge did not formally approve the plan) until <em>after </em>the \u201ctransfer\u201d of assets took place. See \u00a7 1129 (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (detailing the requirements for bankruptcy court approval of a Chapter 11 plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Hence we must ask whether the time of transfer matters. Do the statutory words \u201cunder a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title\u201d apply only where a transfer takes place \u201cunder a plan\u201d that at the time of the transfer <em>already has been </em>\u201cconfirmed under section 1129 of this title\u201d? Or, do they also apply where a transfer takes place \u201cunder a plan\u201d that <em>subsequently is </em>\u201cconfirmed under section 1129 of this title\u201d? The Court concludes that the statutory phrase applies only where a transfer takes place \u201cunder a plan\u201d that at the time of transfer <em>already has been </em>\u201cconfirmed under section 1129 of this title.\u201d In my view, however, the statutory phrase applies \u201cunder a plan\u201d that at the time of transfer either <em>already has been </em>or <em>subsequently is </em>\u201cconfirmed.\u201d In a word, the majority believes that the time (pre- or post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>transfer) at which the bankruptcy judge confirms the reorganization plan matters. I believe that it does not. (And construing the provision to refer to a plan that simply \u201cis\u201d confirmed would require us to read fewer words into the statute than the Court\u2019s construction, which reads the provision to refer only to a plan \u201cthat has been\u201d confirmed, <em>ante, </em>at 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The statutory language itself is perfectly ambiguous on the point. Linguistically speaking, it is no more difficult to apply the words \u201cplan confirmed\u201d to instances in which the \u201cplan\u201d <em>subsequently is </em>\u201cconfirmed\u201d than to restrict their application to instances in which the \u201cplan\u201d <em>already has been </em>\u201cconfirmed.\u201d See <em>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., </em>484 F. 3d 1299, 1304 (CA11 2007) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\u201c[T]he statute can plausibly be read either as describing eligible transfers to include transfers \u2018under a plan confirmed\u2019 regardless of <em>when </em>the plan is confirmed, <em>or .. . </em>imposing a temporal restriction on when the confirmation of the plan must occur\u201d (emphasis in original)). Cf. <em>In re Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del., </em>335 F. 3d 243, 252-253 (CA3 2003) (majority opinion of Alito, J.) (noting more than one \u201cplausible interpretation\u201d); <em>In re NVR, LP, </em>189 F. 3d 442, 458 (CA4 1999) (Wilkinson, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201cequally possible that the provision requires only that the transfer oecur \u2018under\u2019 \u2014 i. e., that it be inferior or subordinate to \u2014 \u2018a plan\u2019 that is ultimately \u2018confirmed\u2019 \u201d). But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 41 (majority believes its reading is \u201cclearly the more natural\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Nor can I find any text-based argument that points clearly in one direction rather than the other. Indeed, the majority, after methodically combing the textualist beaches, finds that a comparison with other somewhat similar phrases in the Bankruptcy Code sheds little light. For example, on the one hand, if Congress thought the time of confirmation mattered, why did it not say so expressly as it has done elsewhere in the Code? See, <em>e. g., </em>11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1127(b) (plan proponent may modify it \u201cat any time <em>after </em>confirmation\u201d (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>added)); \u00a7 1104(a) (\u201c[a]t any time after the commencement of the case but <em>before </em>confirmation\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7 1104(c) (\u201cat any time <em>before </em>the confirmation of a plan\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7 1114(e)(2) <em>(\u201cbefore </em>a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title is effective\u201d (emphasis added)). On the other hand, if Congress thought the time of confirmation did <em>not </em>matter, why did it place this provision in a subchapter entitled \u201cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS\u201d? See 11 U. S. C., ch. 11, subch. III. (And yet one could also argue that the tax-exemption provision appears under the \u201cpost-confirmation matters\u201d title because the trigger for the exemption is plan confirmation. Thus, the exemption is a \u201cpostconfirmation matter,\u201d regardless of when the transfer occurs.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The canons of interpretation offer little help. And the majority, for the most part, seems to agree. It ultimately rests its interpretive conclusion upon this Court\u2019s statement that courts \u201cmust proceed carefully when asked to recognize an exemption from state taxation that Congress has not clearly expressed.\u201d <em>California State Bd. of Equalization </em>v. <em>Sierra Summit, Inc., </em>490 U. S. 844, 851-852 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). See <em>ante, </em>at 50-51. But when, as here, we interpret a provision the <em>express point of which </em>is to exempt some category of state taxation, how can the statement in <em>Sierra Summit </em>prove determinative? See \u00a7 1146(a) (\u201cThe issuance, transfer, or exchange of a security, or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title, <em>may not be taxed </em>under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Neither does Florida\u2019s related claim, protesting federal interference in the <em>administration </em>of a State\u2019s taxation scheme, seem plausible. See Brief for Petitioner 32-33 (noting the \u201cadditional difficulties and complexities that will proliferate\u201d under the lower court\u2019s decision). <em>If </em>Florida now requires transferees to file a <em>pre-existing </em>confirmed plan in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>order to avoid payment of the stamp tax, then why could Florida not require a transferee under a not-yet-confirmed plan to pay the stamp tax and then file the plan after its confirmation in order to obtain a refund? (If there is some other, less curable, practical problem, Florida has not explained what it is.) Given these difficulties, I suspect that the majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>Sierra Summit\u2019s </em>\u201ccanon,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 48, reflects no more than an effort to find the proverbial \u201cany port\u201d in this interpretive storm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The absence of a clear answer in text or canons, however, should not lead us to judicial despair. Consistent with Court precedent, we can and should ask a further question: <em>Why </em>would Congress have insisted upon temporal limits? What reasonable <em>purpose </em>might such limits serve? See, <em>e. g., Dolan </em>v. <em>Postal Service, </em>546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, <em>considering the purpose </em>and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U. S. 337, 346 (1997) (the Court\u2019s construction of a statute\u2019s meaning based in part on its consideration of the statute\u2019s <em>\u201cprimary purpose\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). In fact, the majority\u2019s reading of temporal limits in \u00a7 1146(a) serves <em>no reasonable congressional purpose at all.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The statute\u2019s purpose is apparent on its face. It seeks to further Chapter ll\u2019s basic objectives: (1) \u201cpreserving going concerns\u201d and (2) \u201cmaximizing property available to satisfy creditors.\u201d <em>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn. </em>v. <em>203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, </em>526 U. S. 434, 453 (1999). See also <em>Toibb </em>v. <em>Radloff </em>501 U. S. 157, 163 (1991) (Chapter 11 \u201cembodies the general [Bankruptcy] Code policy of maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate\u201d). As an important bankruptcy treatise notes, \u201c[i]n addition to tax relief, the purpose of the exemption of [\u00a7 1146(a)] is to encourage and facilitate bankruptcy asset sales.\u201d 8 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1146.02, p. 1146-3 (rev. 15th ed. 2005). It fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>thers these objectives where, <em>e. g., </em>asset transfers are at issue, by turning over to the estate (for the use of creditors or to facilitate reorganization) funds that otherwise would go to pay state stamp taxes on plan-related transferred assets. The requirement that the transfers take place pursuant to a reorganization \u201cplan\u201d that is \u201cconfirmed\u201d provides the bankruptcy judge\u2019s assurance that the transfer meets with creditor approval and the requirements laid out in \u00a7 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">How would the majority\u2019s temporal limitation further these statutory objectives? It would not do so in any way. From the perspective of these purposes, it makes no difference whether a transfer takes place before or after the plan is confirmed. In both instances the exemption puts in the hands of the creditors or the estate money that would otherwise go to the State in the form of a stamp tax. In both instances the confirmation of the related plan ensures the legitimacy (from bankruptcy law\u2019s perspective) of the plan that provides for the assets transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Moreover, one major reason why a transfer may take place <em>before </em>rather than <em>after </em>a plan is confirmed is that the preconfirmation bankruptcy process takes time. As the Administrative Office of the United States Courts recently reported, \u201c[a] Chapter 11 case may continue for many years.\u201d Bankruptcy Basics (Apr. 2006), online at http://www.uscourts.gov/ bankruptcycourts/bankruptcybasics/chapterll.html (as visited June 13, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Accord, <em>In re Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del., </em>254 B. R. 306, 320 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Del. 2000) (noting it may run \u201ca year or two\u201d). And a firm (or its assets) may have more value (say, as a going concern) where sale takes place quickly. As the District Court in this case acknowledged, \u201cthere are times when it is more advantageous for the debtor to begin to sell as many assets as quickly as possible in order to insure that the assets do not lose value.\u201d <em>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., </em>379 B. R. 215, 224 (SD Fla. 2006) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). See, <em>e. g., In re Webster Classic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Auctions, Inc., </em>318 B. R. 216, 219 (Bkrtey. Ct. MD Fla. 2004) (recognizing \u201cthe inestimable benefit to a Chapter 11 estate to sell a piece of property at the most opportune time\u2014 whether pre- or postconfirmation \u2014 as opposed to requiring all concerned to wait for a postconfirmation sale in order to receive the tax relief Congress obviously intended\u201d); <em>In re Medical Software Solutions, </em>286 B. R. 431, 441 (Bkrtey. Ct. Utah 2002) (approving preconfirmation sale of debtor\u2019s assets recognizing that the assets\u2019 \u201cvalue is reducing rapidly\u201d and there was only a narrow window for a viable sale of the assets). Thus, an immediate sale can often make more revenue available to creditors or for reorganization of the remaining assets. Stamp taxes on related transfers simply reduce the funds available for any such legitimate purposes. And insofar as the Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute reduces the funds made available, that interpretation inhibits the statute\u2019s efforts to achieve its basic objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Worse than that, if the potential loss of stamp tax revenue threatens delay in implementing any such decision to sell, then creditors (or the remaining reorganized enterprise) could suffer far more serious harm. They could lose the extra revenues that a speedy sale might otherwise produce. See, <em>e. g., In re Met-L-Wood Cory., </em>861 F. 2d 1012, 1017 (CA7 1988) (as suppliers and customers \u201cshy away,\u201d it can make sense quickly to sell business to other owners so that it \u201ccan continue\u201d to operate \u201cfree of the stigma and uncertainty of bankruptcy\u201d). In the present case, for example, Piccadilly, by selling assets quickly after strategic negotiation, realized $80 million, considerably more than the $54 million originally offered before Piccadilly filed for bankruptcy. That fact, along with the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding of \u201csound business reasons\u201d for the prompt sale of Piccadilly\u2019s assets and that the expeditious sale was \u201cin the best interests of creditors of [Piccadilly] and other parties in interest,\u201d App. 32a, \u00b69, suggest that considerably less would have been available for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>creditors had Piccadilly waited until after the plan\u2019s confirmation to execute the sale plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">What conceivable reason could Congress have had for silently writing into the statute\u2019s language a temporal distinction with such consequences? The majority can find none. It simply says that the result is not \u201c \u2018absurd\u2019 \u201d and notes the advantages of a \u201cbright-line rule.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 52. I agree that the majority\u2019s interpretation is not absurd and do not dispute the advantages of a clear rule. But I think the statute supplies a clear enough rule \u2014 transfers are exempt when there is confirmation and are not exempt when there is no confirmation. And I see no reason to adopt the majority\u2019s preferred construction (that only transfers completed after plan confirmation are exempt), where it conflicts with the statute\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Of course, we should not substitute <em>\u201c\u2018\u201cour view </em>of . . . policy\u201d \u2019 \u201d for the statute that Congress enacted. <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). But we certainly should consider <em>Congress\u2019 </em>view of the policy for the statute it created, and that view inheres in the statute\u2019s purpose. \u201cStatutory interpretation is not a game of blind man\u2019s bluff. Judges are free to consider statutory language in light of a statute\u2019s basic purposes.\u201d <em>Dole Food Co. </em>v. <em>Patrickson, </em>538 U. S. 468, 484 (2003) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It is the majority\u2019s failure to work with this important tool of statutory interpretation that has led it to construe the present statute in a way that, in my view, runs contrary to what Congress would have hoped for and expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
