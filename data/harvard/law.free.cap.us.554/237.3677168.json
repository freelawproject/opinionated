The specific question presented: May a United States Court of Appeals, acting on its own initiative, order an increase in a defendant\u2019s sentence? Petitioner Michael J. Greenlaw was convicted of various offenses relating to drugs and firearms, and was sentenced to imprisonment for 442 months. He appealed urging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his sentence was unreasonably long. After rejecting all of Greenlaw\u2019s arguments, the Court of Appeals determined, without Government invitation, that the applicable law plainly required a prison sentence 15 years longer than the term the trial court had imposed. Accordingly, the appeals court instructed the trial court to increase Greenlaw\u2019s sentence to 622 months. We hold that, absent a Government appeal or cross-appeal, the sentence Greenlaw received should not have been increased. We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Greenlaw was a member of a gang that, for years, controlled the sale of crack cocaine in a southside Minneapolis neighborhood. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>481 F. 3d 601, 604 (CA8 2007) (case below). To protect their drug stash and to prevent rival dealers from moving into their territory, gang members carried and concealed numerous weapons. See <em>id., </em>at 605. For his part in the operation, Greenlaw was charged, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, with eight offenses; after trial, he was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>guilty on seven of the charges. App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a-17a.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Among Greenlaw\u2019s convictions were two for violating 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), which prohibits carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime: His first \u00a7 924(c) conviction was for carrying a firearm in connection with a crime committed in 1998; his second, for both carrying and discharging a firearm in connection with a crime committed in 1999. App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a. A first conviction for violating \u00a7 924(c) carries a mandatory minimum term of 5 years, if the firearm is simply carried. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). If the firearm is also discharged, the mandatory minimum increases to 10 years. \u00a7 924(e)(1)(A)(iii). For \u201ca second or subsequent conviction,\u201d however, whether the weapon is only carried or discharged as well, the mandatory minimum jumps to 25 years. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i). Any sentence for violating \u00a7 924(c), moreover, must run consecutively to \u201cany other term of imprisonment,\u201d including any other conviction under \u00a7 924(c). \u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">At sentencing, the District Court made an error. Over the Government\u2019s objection, the court held that a \u00a7 924(c) conviction does not count as \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d when it is \u201ccharged in the same indictment\u201d as the defendant\u2019s first \u00a7 924(c) conviction. App. 59,61-62. The error was plain because this Court had held, in <em>Deal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>508 U. S. 129 (1993), that when a defendant is charged in the same indictment with more than one offense qualifying for punishment under \u00a7 924(c), all convictions after the first rank as \u201csecond or subsequent,\u201d see <em>id., </em>at 132-137.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">As determined by the District Court, Greenlaw\u2019s sentence included 262 months (without separately counting sentences that ran concurrently) for all his convictions other than the two under \u00a7 924(c). For the first \u00a7 924(c) offense, the court imposed a 5-year sentence in accord with \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). As to the second \u00a7 924(c) conviction, the District Court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>jected the Government\u2019s request for the 25-year minimum prescribed in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) for \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d offenses; instead, it imposed the 10-year term prescribed in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) for first-time offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The total sentence thus calculated came to 442 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Greenlaw appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, urging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the appropriate total sentence for all his crimes was 15 years. See 481 F. 3d, at 607. The Court of Appeals found no merit in any of Greenlaw\u2019s arguments. <em>Id., </em>at 606-607. Although the Government did not appeal or cross-appeal, <em>id., </em>at 608, it did note, on brief and at oral argument, the District Court\u2019s error: Greenlaw\u2019s sentence should have been 15 years longer than the 442 months imposed by the District Court, the Government observed, because his second \u00a7 924(c) conviction called for a 25-year (not a 10-year) mandatory minimum consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Government made the observation that the sentence was 15 years too short only to counter Greenlaw\u2019s argument that it was unreasonably long. See App. 84-86; Recording of Oral Arg. in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>No. 05-3391 (CA8, Sept. 26, 2006), at 16:53-19:04, available at http://www. ca8.uscourts.gov/oralargs/oaFrame.html (as visited June 13, 2008). Having refrained from seeking correction of the District Court\u2019s error by pursuing its own appeal, the Government simply urged that Greenlaw\u2019s sentence should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Government, while objecting at sentencing to the trial court\u2019s erroneous reading of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C), had elected to seek no appellate court alteration of Greenlaw\u2019s sentence. 481 F. 3d, at 608. Relying on the \u201cplain-error rule\u201d stated in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), however, the appeals court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>that it had discretion to raise and correct the District Court\u2019s error on its own initiative. 481 F. 3d, at 608-609. The Court of Appeals therefore vacated the sentence and instructed the District Court \u201cto impose the [statutorily mandated] consecutive minimum sentence of 25 years.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Petitioning for rehearing and rehearing en banc, Greenlaw asked the Eighth Circuit to adopt the position advanced by the Seventh Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>411 F. 3d 864 (2005). App. 95. \u201cBy deciding not to take a cross-appeal,\u201d the Seventh Circuit stated, \u201cthe United States has ensured that [the defendant\u2019s] sentence cannot be increased.\u201d 411 F. 3d, at 867. The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing without an opinion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. On remand, as instructed by the Court of Appeals, the District Court increased Greenlaw\u2019s sentence by 15 years, yielding a total prison term of 622 months. App. 103-104, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Greenlaw petitioned for certiorari noting a division among the Circuits on this question: When a defendant unsuccessfully challenges his sentence as too high, may a court of appeals, on its own initiative, increase the sentence absent a cross-appeal by the Government? In response, the Government \u201cagree[d] with [Greenlaw] that the court of appeals erred in <em>sua sponte </em>remanding the case with directions to enhance petitioner\u2019s sentence.\u201d Brief in Opposition 12. We granted review and invited Jay T. Jorgensen to brief and argue this case, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>in support of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment. 552 U. S. 1087 and 1135 (2008). Mr. Jorgensen accepted the appointment and has well fulfilled his assigned responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">In our adversary system, in both civil and criminal cases, in the first instance and on appeal, we follow the principle of party presentation. That is, we rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties present. To the extent courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>have approved departures from the party presentation principle in criminal cases, the justification has usually been to protect a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s rights. See <em>Castro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>540 U. S. 375, 381-383 (2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But as a general rule, \u201c[o]ur adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 386 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As cogently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">\u201c[Courts] do not, or should not, sally forth each day looking for wrongs to right. We wait for cases to come to us, and when they do we normally decide only questions presented by the parties. Counsel almost always know a great deal more about their cases than we do, and this must be particularly true of counsel for the United States, the richest, most powerful, and best represented litigant to appear before us.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>808 F. 2d 1298, 1301 (CA8 1987) (R. Arnold, J., concurring in denial of reh\u2019g en banc).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The cross-appeal rule, pivotal in this case, is both informed by, and illustrative of, the party presentation principle. Under that unwritten but longstanding rule, an appellate court may not alter a judgment to benefit a nonappealing party. This Court, from its earliest years, has recognized that it takes a cross-appeal to justify a remedy in favor of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>appellee. See <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Dannery, </em>3 Dall. 188, 198 (1796). We have called the rule \u201cinveterate and certain.\u201d <em>Morley Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>300 U. S. 185, 191 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Courts of Appeals have disagreed, however, on the proper characterization of the cross-appeal rule: Is it \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and therefore exceptionless, or a \u201crule of practice,\u201d and thus potentially subject to judicially created exceptions? Compare, <em>e. g., Johnson </em>v. <em>Teamsters Local 559, </em>102 F. 3d 21, 28-29 (CA1 1996) (cross-appeal rule \u201cis mandatory and jurisdictional\u201d), with, <em>e.g., American Roll-On Roll-Off Carrier, LLC </em>v. <em>P &amp; O Ports Baltimore, Inc., </em>479 F. 3d 288, 295-296 (CA4 2007) (\u201ccross-appeal requirement [is] one of practice, [not] a strict jurisdictional requirement\u201d). Our own opinions contain statements supporting both characterizations. Compare, <em>e. g., Morley Constr. Co., </em>300 U. S., at 187 (cross-appeal rule defines \u201c[t]he <em>power </em>of an appellate court to modify a decree\u201d (emphasis added)), with, <em>e. g., Langnes </em>v. <em>Green, </em>282 U. S. 531, 538 (1931) (cross-appeal requirement is \u201ca rule of practice which generally has been followed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In <em>El Paso Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Neztsosie, </em>526 U. S. 473, 480 (1999), we declined to decide \u201cthe theoretical status\u201d of the cross-appeal rule. It sufficed to point out that the rule was \u201cfirmly entrenched\u201d and served to advance \u201cinstitutional interests in fair notice and repose.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIndeed,\u201d we noted, \u201cin more than two centuries of repeatedly endorsing the cross-appeal requirement, not a single one of our holdings has ever recognized an exception to the rule.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Following the approach taken in <em>Neztsosie, </em>we again need not type the rule \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in order to decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Congress has eased our decision by specifying the instances in which the Government may seek appellate review of a sentence, and then adding this clear instruction: Even when a United States Attorney files a notice of appeal with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>respect to a sentence qualifying for review, \u201c[t]he Government may not further prosecute [the] appeal without the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3742(b). Congress thus entrusted to named high-ranking officials within the Department of Justice responsibility for determining whether the Government, on behalf of the public, should seek a sentence higher than the one imposed. It would severely undermine Congress\u2019 instruction were appellate judges to \u201csally forth\u201d on their own motion, cf. <em>supra, </em>at 244, to take up errors adverse to the Government when the designated Department of Justice officials have not authorized an appeal from the sentence the trial court imposed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">This Court has recognized that \u201cthe Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>418 U. S. 683, 693 (1974). We need not decide whether comparable authority and discretion are lodged in the Executive Branch with respect to the pursuit of issues on appeal. We need only recognize that Congress, in \u00a7 3742(b), has accorded to the top representatives of the United States in litigation the prerogative to seek or forgo appellate correction of sentencing errors, however plain they may be. That measure should garner the Judiciary\u2019s full respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In ordering the District Court to add 15 years to Green-law\u2019s sentence, despite the absence of a cross-appeal by the Government, the Court of Appeals identified Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) as the source of its authority. See 481 F. 3d, at 608-609, and n. 5. Rule 52(b) reads: \u201cA plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d Nothing in the text or history of Rule 52(b) suggests that the rulemakers, in codifying the plain-error doctrine, meant to override the cross-appeal requirement. See Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 1664 (describing Rule 52(b) as <em>\u201ca </em>restatement of existing law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Nor do our opinions support a plain-error exception to the cross-appeal rule. This Court has indeed noticed, and ordered correction of, plain errors not raised by defendants, but we have done so only to benefit a defendant who had himself petitioned the Court for review on other grounds. See, <em>e. g., Silber </em>v. <em>United States, </em>370 U. S. 717 (1962) <em>(per curiam). </em>In no case have we applied plain-error doctrine to the detriment of a petitioning party. Rather, in every case in which correction of a plain error would result in modification of a judgment to the advantage of a party who did not seek this Court\u2019s review, we have invoked the cross-appeal rule to bar the correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In <em>Chittenden </em>v. <em>Brewster, 2 </em>Wall. 191 (1865), for example, the appellants asserted that an award entered in their favor was too small. A prior decision of this Court, however, made it plain that they were entitled to no award at all. See <em>id., </em>at 195-196 (citing <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Green, </em>1 Wall. 330 (1864)). But because the appellee had not filed a cross-appeal, the Court left the award undisturbed. See 2 Wall., at 196. <em>Strunk </em>v. <em>United States, </em>412 U. S. 434 (1973), decided over a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>century later, is similarly illustrative. There, the Court of Appeals had determined that the defendant was denied his right to a speedy trial, but held that the proper remedy was reduction of his sentence as compensation for the delay, not dismissal of the charges against him. As petitioner in this Court, the defendant sought review of the remedial order. See <em>id., </em>at 435. The Court suggested that there may have been no speedy trial violation, as \u201cit seem[ed] clear that [the defendant] was responsible for a large part of the . .. delay.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 436. But because the Government had not raised the issue by cross-petition, we considered the case on the premise that the defendant had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right, <em>id., </em>at 437, and ruled that dismissal of the indictment was the proper remedy, <em>id., </em>at 439-440.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Even if there might be circumstances in which it would be proper for an appellate court to initiate plain-error review, sentencing errors that the Government refrained from pursuing would not fit the bill. Heightening the generally applicable party presentation principle, Congress has provided a dispositive direction regarding sentencing errors that aggrieve the Government. In \u00a7 3742(b), as earlier explained, see <em>supra, </em>at 245-246, Congress designated leading Department of Justice officers as the decisionmakers responsible for determining when Government pursuit of a sentencing appeal is in order. Those high officers, Congress recognized, are best equipped to determine where the Government\u2019s interest lies. Rule 52(b) does not invite appellate court interference with their assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\"><em>Amicus </em>supporting the Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment links the argument based on Rule 52(b) to a similar argument based on 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2106. See Brief for <em>Amicus Curiae </em>by Invitation of the Court 40-43 (hereinafter Jorgensen Brief). Section 2106 states that federal appellate courts \u201cmay affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment . . . law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>fully brought before it for review.\u201d For substantially the same reasons that Rule 52(b) does not override the cross-appeal requirement, \u00a7 2106 does not do so either. Section 2106 is not limited to plain errors, much less to sentencing errors in criminal cases \u2014 it applies to all cases, civil and criminal, and to all errors. Were the construction <em>amicus </em>offers correct, \u00a7 2106 would displace the cross-appeal rule cross the board. The authority described in \u00a7 2106, we have observed, \u201cmust be exercised consistent with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as interpreted by this Court.\u201d <em>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Swift-Eckrich, Inc., </em>546 U. S. 394, 402-403, n. 4 (2006). No different conclusion is warranted with respect to the \u201cinveterate and certain\u201d cross-appeal rule. <em>Morley Constr. Co., </em>300 U. S., at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In defending the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment, <em>amicus </em>places heavy weight on an argument pinned not to Rule 52(b) or 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2106, but to the text of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3742, the Criminal Code provision governing appellate review of criminal sentences. As <em>amicus </em>reads \u00a73742, once either party appeals a sentence, the Court of Appeals must remand \u201cany illegal sentence regardless of whether the remand hurts or helps the appealing party.\u201d Jorgensen Brief 9. Congress so directed, <em>amicus </em>argues, by instructing that, upon review of the record, a court of appeals <em>\u201cshall determine </em>whether the sentence . . . was imposed in violation of law,\u201d \u00a7 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (emphasis added), and <em>\u201cshall </em>remand\u201d if it so determines, \u00a7 3742(f)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). See Jorgensen Brief 10-11, and n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\"><em>Amicus </em>makes a further text-based observation. He notes that \u00a7 3742(f)(2)\u2014the provision covering sentences \u201coutside the applicable [G]uideline range\u201d\u2014calls for a remand only where a departure from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines harms the appellant. In contrast, <em>amicus </em>emphasizes, \u00a7 3742(f)(1)\u2014the provision controlling sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>imposed \u201cin violation of law\u201d and Guidelines application errors \u2014 contains no such appellant-linked limitation. The inference <em>amicus </em>draws from this distinction is that Congress intended to override the cross-appeal rule for sentences controlled by \u00a7 3742(f)(1), <em>i. e., </em>those imposed \u201cin violation of law\u201d (or incorrectly applying the Guidelines), but not for Guidelines departure errors, the category covered by \u00a7 3742(f)(2). See <em>id., </em>at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">This novel construction of \u00a73742, presented for the first time in the brief <em>amicus </em>filed in this Court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is clever and complex, but ultimately unpersuasive. Congress enacted \u00a7 3742 in 1984. See Sentencing Reform Act, \u00a7 213(a), 98 Stat. 2011. At that time, the cross-appeal requirement was a solidly grounded rule of appellate practice. See <em>supra, </em>at 244-245. The inference properly drawn, we think, is that Congress was aware of the cross-appeal rule, and framed \u00a73742 expecting that the new provision would operate in harmony with the \u201cinveterate and certain\u201d bar to enlarging judgments in favor of an appellee who filed no cross-appeal. Cf. <em>Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Solimino, </em>501 U. S. 104, 108 (1991) (\u201cCongress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Congress indicated awareness of the cross-appeal rule in an earlier measure, the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (OCCA), Pub. L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, which provided for review of sentences of \u201cdangerous special offenders.\u201d See \u00a7 1001(a), <em>id., </em>at 948-951. For that Act, Congress crafted an explicit exception to the cross-appeal rule. It ordered that an appeal of a sentence taken by the Government \u201cshall be deemed the taking of [an appeal] by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 950. But the \u201cdeeming\u201d ran in only one direction: \u201c[A] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>sentence may be made more severe,\u201d OCCA provided, \u201conly on review ... taken by the United States.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 950-951.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Congress repealed this provision and, in \u00a7 3742, broadly provided for appellate review of sentences, it did not similarly express in the new text any exception to the cross-appeal rule. In short, Congress formulated a precise exception to the cross-appeal rule when that was its intention. Notably, the exception Congress legislated did not expose a defendant to a higher sentence in response to his own appeal. Congress spoke plainly in the 1970 legislation, leaving nothing for a court to infer. We therefore see no reason to read the current statute in the inventive manner <em>amicus </em>proposes, inferring so much from so little.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><em>Amicus\u2019 </em>reading of \u00a73742, moreover, would yield some strange results. We note two, in particular. Under his construction, \u00a73742 would give with one hand what it takes away with the other: Section 3742(b) entrusts to certain Government officials the decision whether to appeal an illegally low sentence, see <em>supra, </em>at 245-246; but according to <em>amicus, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3742(e) and (f) would instruct appellate courts to correct an error of that order on their own initiative, thereby trumping the officials\u2019 decision. We resist attributing to Congress an intention to render a statute so internally inconsistent. Cf. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization of S. D., </em>480 U. S. 123, 133 (1987) (\u201cThe illogical results of applying [a proffered] interpretation . . . argue strongly against the conclusion that Congress intended th[o]se results . . . .\u201d). Further, the construction proposed by <em>amicus </em>would draw a puzzling distinction between incorrect applications of the Sentencing Guidelines, controlled by \u00a7 3742(f)(1), and erroneous departures from the Guidelines, covered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u00a7 3742(f)(2). The latter would be subject to the cross-appeal rule, the former would not. We do not see why Congress would want to differentiate Guidelines decisions this way.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In increasing Greenlaw\u2019s sentence by 15 years on its own initiative, the Eighth Circuit did not advert to the procedural rules setting deadlines for launching appeals and cross-appeals. Unyielding in character, these rules may be seen as auxiliary to the cross-appeal rule and the party presentation principle served by that rule. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) provides that \u201c[a]n appeal permitted by law ... may be taken <em>only by filing a notice of </em>appeal... within the [prescribed] time.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Complementing Rule 3(a)(1), Rule 4(b)(1)(B)(ii) instructs that, when the Government has the right to cross-appeal in a criminal case, its notice <em>\u201cmust be filed . . </em>. within 30 days after . . . the filing of a notice of appeal by any defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The filing time for a notice of appeal or cross-appeal, Rule 4(b)(4) states, may be extended \u201cfor a period not to exceed 30 days.\u201d Rule 26(b) bars any extension beyond that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The firm deadlines set by the Appellate Rules advance the interests of the parties and the legal system in fair notice and finality. Thus a defendant who appeals but faces no cross-appeal can proceed anticipating that the appellate court will not enlarge his sentence. And if the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>files a cross-appeal, the defendant will have fair warning, well in advance of briefing and argument, that pursuit of his appeal exposes him to the risk of a higher sentence. Given early warning, he can tailor his arguments to take account of that risk. Or he can seek the Government\u2019s agreement to voluntary dismissal of the competing appeals, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b), before positions become hardened during the hours invested in preparing the case for appellate court consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The strict time limits on notices of appeal and cross-appeal would be undermined, in both civil and criminal cases, if an appeals court could modify a judgment in favor of a party who filed no notice of appeal. In a criminal prosecution, moreover, the defendant would appeal at his peril, with nothing to alert him that, on his own appeal, his sentence would be increased until the appeals court so decreed. In this very case, Greenlaw might have made different strategic decisions had he known soon after filing his notice of appeal that he risked a 15-year increase in an already lengthy sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We note that nothing we have said in this opinion requires courts to modify their current practice in so-called \u201csentencing package cases.\u201d Those cases typically involve multicount indictments and a successful attack by a defendant on some but not all of the counts of conviction. The appeals court, in such instances, may vacate the entire sentence on all counts so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan to ensure that it remains adequate to satisfy the sentencing factors in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). In remanded cases, the Government relates, trial courts have imposed a sentence on the remaining counts longer than the sentence originally imposed on those particular counts, but yielding an aggregate sentence no longer than the aggregate sentence initially imposed. See Brief for United States 23, n. 11 (citing, <em>inter alia, United States </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>Pimienta-Redondo, </em>874 F. 2d 9 (CA1 1989) (en banc)). Thus the defendant ultimately may gain nothing from his limited success on appeal, but he will also lose nothing, as he will serve no more time than the trial court originally ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The practice the Government describes is not at odds with the cross-appeal rule, which stops appellate judges from adding years to a defendant\u2019s sentence on their own initiative. It simply ensures that the sentence \u201c \u2018will suit not merely the offense but the individual defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pimienta-Redondo, </em>874 F. 2d, at 14 (quoting <em>Wasman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U. S. 559, 564 (1984)). And the assessment will be made by the sentencing judge exercising discretion, not by an appellate panel ruling on an issue of law no party tendered to the court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">This is not a \u201csentencing package\u201d case.

See <em>post, </em>at 264-265, and n. 2. The cross-appeal rule, we of course agree, does not confine the trial court. But default and forfeiture doctrines do. It would therefore be hard to imagine a case in which a district court, after a court of appeals vacated a criminal sentence, could properly increase the sentence based on an error the appeals court left uncorrected because of the cross-appeal rule. What of cases remanded <em>post-Booker </em>on defendants\u2019 appeals, the dissent asks? <em>Post, </em>at 265, n. 2.

By what standard is the Court of Appeals to make such an assessment? Without venturing to answer these questions, see <em>post, </em>at 268, n. 3, the dissent would simply \u201centrust the decision to initiate error correction to the sound discretion of the courts of appeals,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 256.

Moreover, as a general matter, I would leave application of the rule to the courts of appeals, with our power to review their discretion \u201cseldom to be called into action.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>340 U. S. 474, 490 (1951). But since this case is now before us, I would consider whether the Court of Appeals here acted properly. Primarily for the reasons stated by the majority in footnote 9 of its opinion, I believe that the court abused its discretion in <em>sua sponte </em>increasing petitioner\u2019s sentence. Our precedent precludes the creation of an exception to the cross-appeal requirement based solely on the obviousness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>lower court\u2019s error. See, <em>e. g., Chittenden </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>2 Wall. 191, 195-196 (1865). And I cannot see how the interests of justice are significantly disserved by permitting petitioner\u2019s release from prison at roughly age 62, after almost 37 years behind bars, as opposed to age 77.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b284-5\">Justice Alito, with whom Justice Stevens joins, and with whom Justice Breyer</author>\n<p id=\"AaVt\">joins as to Parts I, II, and III, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">I respectfully dissent because I view the cross-appeal requirement as a rule of appellate practice. It is akin to the rule that courts invoke when they decline to consider arguments that the parties have not raised. Both rules rest on premises about the efficient use of judicial resources and the proper role of the tribunal in an adversary system. Both are sound and should generally be followed. But just as the courts have made them, the courts may make exceptions to them, and I do not understand why a reviewing court should enjoy less discretion to correct an error <em>sua sponte </em>than it enjoys to raise and address an argument <em>sua sponte. </em>Absent congressional direction to the contrary, and subject to our limited oversight as a supervisory court, we should entrust the decision to initiate error correction to the sound discretion of the courts of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Before laying out my view in more detail, I must first address the question whether federal courts have subject-matter jurisdiction to enlarge an appellee\u2019s judgment in the absence of a cross-appeal. Because the Court would not recognize any exceptions to the cross-appeal requirement when the defendant appeals his sentence, it does not decide that question. See <em>ante, </em>at 245. I must confront it, though I do not regard it as a substantial question. The cross-appeal requirement seems to me a prime example of a \u201c\u2018rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>practice,\u2019 subject to exceptions, not an unqualified limit on the power of appellate courts.\u201d <em>El Paso Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Neztsosie, </em>526 U. S. 473, 480 (1999). While a court should generally enforce the cross-appeal requirement, a departure from it would not divest the court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">This Court has never addressed whether an appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction to enlarge a judgment in favor of an appellee is contingent on a duly filed cross-appeal. The majority\u2019s contention that \u201c[o]ur own opinions contain statements supporting\u201d the \u201c \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 \u201d characterization of the requirement, <em>ante, </em>at 245, relies on a misreading of that precedent. The Court may have previously characterized the cross-appeal requirement as limiting \u201c \u2018[t]he <em>power </em>of an appellate court to modify a decree,\u2019\u201d <em>ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Morley Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>300 U. S. 185, 187 (1937)), but it does not follow that jurisdiction is conditioned on a properly filed cross-appeal. A court may lack the power to do something for reasons other than want of jurisdiction, and a rule can be inflexible without being jurisdictional. See <em>Eberhart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>546 U. S. 12, 19 (2005) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The jurisdiction of the courts of appeals is fixed by Congress. See <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>551 U. S. 205, 212 (2007); <em>Ankenbrandt </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>504 U. S. 689, 698 (1992) (\u201c \u2018[T]he judicial power of the United States ... is (except in enumerated instances, applicable exclusively to this Court) dependent for its distribution and organization, and for the modes of its exercise, entirely upon the action of Congress\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>3 How. 236, 245 (1845))). If Congress wants to withhold from the courts of appeals the power to decide questions that expand the rights of nonappealing parties, it may do so. See U. S. Const., Art. Ill, \u00a7 1 (authorizing Congress to establish the lower courts and, by corollary, to fix their jurisdiction); <em>Kontrick </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>540 U. S. 443, 452 (2004) (\u201cOnly Congress may determine a lower federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction\u201d). The jurisdictional question thus reduces to whether Congress intended to make a cross-appeal a condition precedent to the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction to enlarge a judgment in favor of a nonappealing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">As always with such questions, the text of the relevant statute provides the best evidence of congressional intent. The relevant statute in this case is 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3742 (2000 ed. and Supp. V). Section 3742(a) authorizes a criminal defendant to \u201cfile a notice of appeal\u201d to review a sentence that was, among other possibilities, \u201cimposed in violation of law.\u201d <em>E.g., </em>\u00a7 3742(a)(1). Section 3742(b) provides parallel authority for the Government to \u201cfile a notice of appeal\u201d to review unlawful sentences. <em>E. g., </em>\u00a7 3742(b)(1). The statute conditions the Government\u2019s authority to further prosecute its appeal on \u201cthe personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.\u201d \u00a7 3742(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Nothing in this language remotely suggests that a court of appeals lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence in the absence of a cross-appeal by the Government. In fact, the statute does not even mention cross-appeals. It separately authorizes either party to \u201cfile a notice of appeal,\u201d but it never suggests that the reviewing court\u2019s power is limited to correcting errors for the benefit of the appealing party. If anything, it suggests the opposite. Without qualifying the appellate court\u2019s power in any way, \u00a7 3742(e) instructs the court to determine, among other things, whether the sentence was \u201cimposed in violation of law.\u201d \u00a7 3742(e)(1). And while \u00a7 3742(f)(2) limits the action that a court of appeals can take depending on which party filed the appeal, compare \u00a7 3742(f)(2)(A) (sentences set aside as \u201ctoo high\u201d if defendant filed) with \u00a7 3742(f)(2)(B) (sentences set aside as \u201ctoo low\u201d if Government filed), no such limitation appears in \u00a7 3742(f)(1). That paragraph requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>a court of appeals simply to set aside any sentence \u201cimposed in violation of law or imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Since a cross-appeal has no effect on the appellate court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction, the cross-appeal requirement is best characterized as a rule of practice. It is a rule created by the courts to serve interests that are important to the Judiciary. The Court identifies two of these interests: notice to litigants and finality. <em>Ante, </em>at 252; see also <em>Neztsosie, supra, </em>at 480. One might add that the cross-appeal requirement also serves a third interest: the appellate court\u2019s interest in being adequately briefed on the issues that it decides. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 28.1(c) and Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes, 28 U. S. C. App., pp. 615-616. Although these are substantial interests in the abstract, I question how well an inflexible cross-appeal requirement serves them.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\"><em>Notice. </em>With respect to notice, the benefits of an unyielding cross-appeal requirement are insubstantial. When the Government files a notice of cross-appeal, the defendant is alerted to the possibility that his or her sentence may be increased as a result of the appellate decision. But if the cross-appeal rule is, as I would hold, a strong rule of practice that should be followed in all but exceptional instances, the Government\u2019s failure to file a notice of cross-appeal would mean in the vast majority of cases that the defendant thereafter ran little risk of an increased sentence. And the rare cases where that possibility arose would generally involve errors so plain that no conceivable response by the defendant could alter the result. It is not unreasonable to consider an appealing party to be on notice as to such serious errors of law in his favor. And while there may be rare cases in which the existence of such a legal error would come as a complete surprise to the defendant or in which argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>from the parties would be of assistance to the court, the solution to such a problem is not to eliminate the courts of appeals\u2019 authority to correct egregious errors. Rather, the appropriate response is for the court of appeals to request supplemental briefing or \u2014 if it deems that insufficient \u2014 simply to refuse to exercise its authority. Cf. <em>Irizarry </em>v. <em>United States, </em>553 U. S. 708, 716 (2008). In short, the Court\u2019s holding does not increase the substance of the notice that a defendant receives; it merely accelerates that notice by at most a few weeks in a very small number of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The Court contends that \u201c[g]iven early warning, [the defendant] can tailor his arguments to take account of [the risk of a higher sentence] . . . [o]r he can seek the Government\u2019s agreement to voluntary dismissal of the competing appeals.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 253 (citing Fed. Rule App. Proc. 42(b)). But the Court does not explain how a notice of cross-appeal, a boilerplate document, helps the defendant \u201ctailor his arguments.\u201d Whether the cross-appeal rule is ironclad, as the Court believes, or simply a strong rule of practice, a defendant who wishes to appeal his or her sentence is always free to seek the Government\u2019s commitment not to cross-appeal or to terminate a cross-appeal that the Government has already taken. Rule 42(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\"><em>Finality. </em>An inflexible cross-appeal rule also does little to further the interest of the parties and the Judiciary in the finality of decisions. An appellate court\u2019s decision to grant a nonappealing party additional relief does not interrupt a long, undisturbed slumber. The error\u2019s repose begins no earlier than the deadline for filing a cross-appeal, and it ends as soon as the reviewing court issues its opinion \u2014 and often much sooner. Here, for example, the slumber was broken when the Government identified the error in its brief as appellee. See Brief for United States 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\"><em>Orderly Briefing. </em>I do not doubt that adversarial briefing improves the quality of appellate decisionmaking, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>hardly follows that appellate courts should be denied the authority to correct errors that seriously prejudice nonappealing parties. Under my interpretation of the cross-appeal rule, a court of appeals would not be obligated to address errors that are prejudicial to a nonappealing party; a court of appeals would merely have the authority to do so in appropriate cases. If a court of appeals noticed such an error and concluded that it was appropriate to address the issue, the court could, if it wished, order additional briefing. If, on the other hand, the court concluded that the issue was not adequately addressed by the briefs filed by the parties in the ordinary course and that additional briefing would interfere with the efficient administration of the court\u2019s work, the court would not be required to decide the issue. Therefore, I do not see how the courts of appeals\u2019 interest in orderly briefing is furthered by denying those courts the discretionary authority to address important issues that they find it appropriate to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Indeed, the inflexible cross-appeal rule that the Court adopts may disserve the interest in judicial efficiency in some cases. For example, correcting an error that prejudiced a nonappealing defendant on direct review might obviate the need for a collateral attack. Cf. <em>Granberry </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>481 U. S. 129, 134 (1987) (allowing the Court of Appeals to address the merits of an unexhausted habeas corpus petition if \u201cthe interests of comity and federalism will be better served by addressing the merits forthwith [than] by requiring a series of additional state and district court proceedings before reviewing the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim\u201d); <em>Munaf </em>v. <em>Geren, </em>553 U. S. 674, 691 (2008) (recognizing \u201coccasions . . . when it is appropriate to proceed further and address the merits\u201d of a habeas corpus petition rather than reverse and remand on threshold matters). Because the reviewing court is in the best position to decide whether a departure from the cross-appeal rule would be efficient, rigid enforcement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>that rule is more likely to waste judicial resources than to conserve them.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In sum, the Court exaggerates the interests served by the cross-appeal requirement. At the same time, it overlooks an important interest that the rule disserves: the interest of the Judiciary and the public in correcting grossly prejudicial errors of law that undermine confidence in our legal system. We have repeatedly stressed the importance of that interest, see, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Olano, </em>507 U. S. 725, 736-737 (1993); <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty., </em>464 U. S. 501, 507 (1984); <em>New York Central R. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>279 U. S. 310, 318 (1929), and it has justified departures from our traditional adversary framework in other contexts. The Court mentions one of those contexts, see <em>ante, </em>at 243-244 <em>(pro se </em>litigation), but there are others that deserve mention.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The most well known is plain-error review. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) authorizes reviewing courts to correct \u201c[a] plain error that affects substantial rights . . . even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d Although I agree with the Court that this Rule does not independently justify the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision, see <em>ante, </em>at 247,1 believe that the Rule\u2019s underlying policy sheds some light on the issue before us. We have explained that courts may rely on Rule 52(b) to correct only those plain errors that \u201c \u2018seriously affec[t] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Olano, supra, </em>at 736 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>297 U. S. 157, 160 (1936)). We have thus recognized that preservation of the \u201cfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d may sometimes justify a departure from the traditional adversarial framework of issue presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Perhaps the closest analogue to the cross-appeal requirement is the rule of appellate practice that restrains reviewing courts from addressing arguments that the parties have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>not made. Courts typically invoke this rule to avoid resolving a case based on an unaired argument, even if the argument could change the outcome. See, <em>e. g., Santiago </em>v. <em>Rumsfeld, </em>425 F. 3d 549, 552, n. 1 (CA9 2005); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cervini, </em>379 F. 3d 987, 994, n. 5 (CA10 2004). But courts also recognize that the rule is not inflexible, see, <em>e. g., Santiago, supra, </em>at 552, n. 1, and sometimes they depart from it, see, <em>e. g., United States Nat. Bank of Ore. </em>v. <em>Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., </em>508 U. S. 439, 448 (1993) (\u201cAfter giving the parties ample opportunity to address the issue, the Court of Appeals acted without any impropriety in refusing to accept what in effect was a stipulation on a question of law\u201d (citing <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Hocking Valley R. Co., </em>243 U. S. 281, 289 (1917))); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moyer, </em>282 F. 3d 1311, 317-1318 (CA10 2002); <em>Dorris </em>v. <em>Absher, </em>179 F. 3d 420, 425-426 (CA6 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">A reviewing court will generally address an argument <em>sua sponte </em>only to correct the most patent and serious errors. See, <em>e. g., id., </em>at 426 (concluding that the error, if overlooked, would result in \u201ca miscarriage of justice\u201d); <em>Consumers Union of U. S., Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>510 F. 2d 656, 662 (CADC 1974) (balancing \u201cconsiderations of judicial orderliness and efficiency against the need for the greatest possible accuracy in judicial decisionmaking\u201d). Because the prejudicial effect of the error and the impact of error correction on judicial resources are matters best determined by the reviewing court, the court\u2019s decision to go beyond the arguments made by the parties is committed to its sound discretion. See <em>United States Nat. Bank of Ore., supra, </em>at 448 (reviewing an appellate court\u2019s decision to address an argument <em>sua sponte </em>for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">This authority provides a good model for our decision in this case. The Court has not persuaded me that the interests at stake when a reviewing court awards a nonappealing party additional relief are qualitatively different from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>interests at stake when a reviewing court raises an issue <em>sua sponte. </em>Authority on the latter point recognizes that the interest of the public and the Judiciary in correcting grossly prejudicial errors of law may sometimes outweigh other interests normally furthered by fidelity to our adversarial tradition. I would recognize the same possibility here. And just as reviewing courts enjoy discretion to decide for themselves when to raise and decide arguments <em>sua sponte, </em>I would grant them substantial latitude to decide when to enlarge an appellee\u2019s judgment in the absence of a cross-appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The approach I advocate is not out of step with our precedent. The Court has never decided whether the cross-appeal requirement is \u201csubject to exceptions [or] an unqualified limit on the power of appellate courts.\u201d <em>Neztsosie, </em>526 U. S., at 480. That question was reserved in <em>Neztsosie, ibid., </em>even as the Court recognized that lower courts had reached different conclusions, see <em>ibid., </em>n. 2. I would simply confirm what our precedent had assumed: that there are exceptional circumstances when it is appropriate for a reviewing court to correct an error for the benefit of a party that has not cross-appealed the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Indeed, the Court has already reached the very result that it claims to disavow today. We have long held that a sentencing court confronted with new circumstances may impose a stiffer sentence on remand than the defendant received prior to a successful appeal. See <em>Chaffin </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Stynchcombe, </em>412 U. S. 17, 23 (1973); <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U. S. 711, 719-720 (1969), overruled on other grounds, <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>490 U. S. 794 (1989). The Court makes no effort to explain the analytical difference between those cases and this one. If a sentencing court may rely on new circumstances to justify a longer sentence on remand, why cannot one of the new circumstances be the court\u2019s discovery (by dint of appellate review) that its first sentence was based on an error of law?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Even today, the Court refuses to decide whether the cross-appeal requirement admits of exceptions in appropriate cases. While calling the rule \u201c\u2018inveterate and certain,\u2019\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 245 (quoting <em>Morley Constr. Co., </em>300 U. S., at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>191), the Court allows that \u201cthere might be circumstances in which it would be proper for an appellate court to initiate plain-error review,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 248; see also <em>ante, </em>at 244, n. 2. The Court\u2019s mandate is limited to a single class of cases\u2014 sentencing appeals, and then only when the appeal is brought by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Court justifies the asymmetry in its decision by pointing to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3742(b), which provides that \u201c[t]he Government may not further prosecute [the] appeal without the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.\u201d According to the majority, \u201c[i]t would severely undermine Congress\u2019 instruction were appellate judges to \u2018sally forth\u2019 on their own motion to take up errors adverse to the Government when the designated Department of Justice officials have not authorized an appeal from the sentence the trial court imposed.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 246 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The problem with this argument is that \u00a7 3742(b) does not apportion authority over sentencing appeals between the Executive and Judicial Branches. By its terms, \u00a7 3742(b) simply apportions that authority <em>within </em>an executive department. It provides that \u201c[t]he Government\u201d may not \u201cprosecute\u201d the appeal without approval from one of the listed officials. It says nothing about the power of the courts to correct error in the absence of a Government appeal. Had Congress intended to restrict the power of the courts, the statute would not stop \u201c[t]he Government\u201d from \u201cprosecutting]\u201d unauthorized appeals; instead, it would stop \u201cthe Court of Appeals\u201d from \u201cdeciding\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The design that the Court imputes to the drafters of \u00a7 3742(b) is inconsistent with the text in another important respect. Suppose that the District Court imposes a sentence below the range set forth in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and the Government files an authorized appeal on the ground that the sentence is unreasonable. Suppose further that the reviewing court discovers, to the surprise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>both parties, that the District Court made a further error by overlooking a mandatory minimum to which the defendant was subject. The mandatory minimum would raise the defendant\u2019s sentence beyond what even the Government had wanted. Under the majority\u2019s theory, see <em>ante, </em>at 246, the reviewing court should not remand for imposition of the mandatory minimum, since the decision to seek the higher sentence belonged to the Government alone. But that conclusion is plainly at odds with the text of the statute, which imposes no limits on sentencing review once the named officials have signed off on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Section 3742(b)\u2019s limited effect on sentencing review implies that the statute was not designed to prevent judicial encroachment on the prerogatives of the Executive. It is more likely that Congress wanted to withhold from the Executive the power to force the courts of appeals to entertain Government appeals that are not regarded as sufficiently important by the leadership of the Department of Justice. Allowing the courts of appeals, in their discretion, to remedy errors not raised in a cross-appeal in no way trenches on the authority of the Executive. Section 3742(b) may have also been designed to serve the Executive\u2019s institutional interests. Congress may have wanted to ensure that the Government maintained a consistent legal position across different sentencing appeals. Or perhaps Congress wanted to maximize the impact of the Government\u2019s sentencing appeals by giving high-level officials the authority to nix meritless or marginal ones. These institutional interests of the Executive do not undermine the Judiciary\u2019s authority to correct unlawful sentences in the absence of a Government appeal, and they do not justify the Court\u2019s decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">For the reasons given above, I would hold that the courts of appeals enjoy the discretion to correct error <em>sua sponte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>for the benefit of nonappealing parties. The Court errs in vacating the judgment of the Eighth Circuit, and I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> The Court argues that petitioner\u2019s original sentence was neither so fundamentally unfair nor so harmful to our system of justice as to warrant <em>sua sponte </em>correction by the Court of Appeals. <em>Ante, </em>at 254-255, n. 9. But these considerations, which may well support a conclusion that the Court of Appeals should not have exercised its authority in this case, cf. n. 3, <em>infra, </em>surely do not justify the Court\u2019s broad rule that <em>sua sponte </em>error correction on behalf of the Government is inappropriate in all eases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\"> The Court finds it \u201chard to imagine a case in which a district court, after a court of appeals vacated a criminal sentence, could properly increase the sentence based on an error the appeals court left uncorrected because of the cross-appeal rule.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 254, n. 8. Happily, we need not imagine such cases, since they come before our courts every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">For examples, we have no further to look than the sentencing cases remanded en masse following our recent decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U. S. 220 (2005). In <em>Booker\u2019s </em>wake, it was common for newly convicted defendants to appeal their sentences, claiming that they received enhancements that they would not have received under the advisory guidelines. Many of those cases were remanded for resentencing, and some defendants wound up with even longer sentences on remand. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Singletary, </em>458 F. 3d 72, 77 (CA2) (affirming a sentence lengthened by 12 months following a <em>Booker </em>remand), cert. denied, 549 U. S. 1047 (2006); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reinhart, </em>442 F. 3d 857, 860-861 (CA5 2006) (affirming a sentence lengthened from 210 months to 235 months following a <em>Booker </em>remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">These cases represent straightforward applications of the cross-appeal rule: The Government had not cross-appealed the sentence, so the reviewing court did not order the defendant\u2019s sentence lengthened. And yet the sentence <em>was </em>ultimately lengthened when the error was corrected on remand. The Court fails to explain the conceptual distinction between those cases and this one. If the Court permits sentencing courts to correct unappealed errors on remand, why does it not permit the courts of appeals to do the same on appeal?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-5\"> Neither the parties nor our <em>amicus </em>have addressed whether, under the assumption that the Court of Appeals enjoys discretion to initiate error correction for the benefit of a nonappealing party, the Eighth Circuit abused that discretion in this case. As framed by petitioner, the question presented asked only whether the cross-appeal requirement is subject to exceptions. Because the parties have not addressed the fact-bound subsidiary question, I would affirm without reaching it. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>International Business Machines Corp., </em>517 U. S. 843, 855, n. 3 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
