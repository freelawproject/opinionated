Because history and precedent make clear that such an assignee has long been permitted to bring suit, we conclude that the assignee does have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">When a payphone customer makes a long-distance call with an access code or 1-800 number issued by a long-distance communications carrier, the customer pays the carrier (which completes that call), but not the payphone operator (which connects that call to the carrier in the first place). In these circumstances, the long-distance carrier is required to compensate the payphone operator for the customer\u2019s call. See 47 U. S. C. \u00a7 226; 47 CFR \u00a7 64.1300 (2007). The payphone operator can sue the long-distance carrier in court for any compensation that the carrier fails to pay for these \u201cdial-around\u201d calls. And many have done so. See <em>Global Crossing Telecommunications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Metrophones Telecommunications, Inc., </em>550 U. S. 45 (2007) (finding that the Communications Act of 1934 authorizes such suits).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Because litigation is expensive, because the evidentiary demands of a single suit are often great, and because the resulting monetary recovery is often small, many payphone operators assign their dial-around claims to billing and collection firms called \u201caggregators\u201d so that, in effect, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>aggregators can bring suit on their behalf. See Brief for Respondents 3. Typically, an individual aggregator collects claims from different payphone operators; the aggregator promises to remit to the relevant payphone operator <em>(i. e., </em>the assignor of the claim) any dial-around compensation that is recovered; the aggregator then pursues the claims in court or through settlement negotiations; and the aggregator is paid a fee for this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The present litigation involves a group of aggregators who have taken claim assignments from approximately 1,400 payphone operators. Each payphone operator signed an Assignment and Power of Attorney Agreement (Agreement) in which the payphone operator \u201cassigns, transfers and sets over to [the aggregator] for purposes of collection all rights, title and interest of the [payphone operator] in the [payphone operator\u2019s] claims, demands or causes of action for \u2018Dial-Around Compensation\u2019 . . . due the [payphone operator] for periods since October 1, 1997.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 114. The Agreement also \u201cappoints\u201d the aggregator as the payphone operator\u2019s \u201ctrue and lawful attorney-in-fact.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Agreement provides that the aggregator will litigate \u201cin the [payphone operator\u2019s] interest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 115. And the Agreement further stipulates that the assignment of the claims \u201cmay not be revoked without the written consent of the [aggregator].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The aggregator and payphone operator then separately agreed that the aggregator would remit all proceeds to the payphone operator and that the payphone operator would pay the aggregator for its services (typically via a quarterly charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">After signing the agreements, the aggregators (respondents here) filed lawsuits in federal court seeking dial-around compensation from Sprint, AT&amp;T, and other long-distance carriers (petitioners here). AT&amp;T moved to dismiss the claims, arguing that the aggregators lack standing to sue under Article III of the Constitution. The District Court initially agreed to dismiss, <em>APCC Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>254 F. Supp. 2d 135, 140-141 (DC 2003), but changed its mind in light of a \u201clong line of cases and legal treatises that recognize a well-established principle that assignees for collection purposes are entitled to bring suit where [as here] the assignments transfer absolute title to the claims.\u201d <em>APCC Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp., </em>281 F. Supp. 2d 41, 45 (DC 2003). After consolidating similar cases, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed that the aggregators have standing to sue, but held that the relevant statutes do not create a private right of action. <em>APCC Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Sprint Communications Co., </em>418 F. 3d 1238 (2005) <em>(per curiam). </em>This Court granted the aggregators\u2019 petition for certiorari on the latter statutory question, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Global Crossing, supra. APCC Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sprint Communications Co., </em>550 U. S. 901 (2007). On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the orders of the District Court allowing the litigation to go forward. 489 F. 3d 1249, 1250 (2007) <em>(per curiam). </em>The long-distance carriers then asked us to consider the standing question. We granted certiorari, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We begin with the most basic doctrinal principles: Article III, \u00a72, of the Constitution restricts the federal \u201cjudicial Power\u201d to the resolution of \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d That case-or-controversy requirement is satisfied only where a plaintiff has standing. See, <em>e. g., Daimler Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Cuno, </em>547 U. S. 332 (2006). And in order to have Article III standing, a plaintiff must adequately establish: (1) an injury in fact <em>(i. e., </em>a \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d invasion of a \u201clegally protected interest\u201d); (2) causation (i <em>e., </em>a \u201c \u2018fairly ... trace[able]\u2019\u201d connection between the alleged injury in fact and the alleged conduct of the defendant); and (3) redress-ability <em>(i. e., </em>it is \u201c \u2018likely\u2019 \u201d and not \u201cmerely \u2018speculative\u2019 \u201d that the plaintiff\u2019s injury will be remedied by the relief plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>tiff seeks in bringing suit). <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U. S. 555, 560-561 (1992) (calling these the \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum\u201d requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In <em>some </em>sense, the aggregators clearly meet these requirements. They base their suit upon a concrete and particularized \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d namely, the carriers\u2019 failure to pay dial-around compensation. The carriers \u201ccaused\u201d that injury. And the litigation will \u201credress\u201d that injury \u2014 if the suits are successful, the long-distance carriers will pay what they owe. The long-distance carriers argue, however, that the aggregators lack standing because it was the payphone operators (who are not plaintiffs), not the aggregators (who are plaintiffs), who were \u201cinjured in fact\u201d and that it is the payphone operators, not the aggregators, whose injuries a legal victory will truly \u201credress\u201d: The aggregators, after all, will remit all litigation proceeds to the payphone operators. Brief for Petitioners 18. Thus, the question before us is whether, under these circumstances, an assignee has standing to pursue the assignor\u2019s claims for money owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We have often said that history and tradition offer a meaningful guide to the types of cases that Article III empowers federal courts to consider. See, <em>e. g., Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment, </em>523 U. S. 83, 102 (1998) (\u201cWe have always taken [the case-or-controversy requirement] to mean cases and controversies of the sort <em>traditionally </em>amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>GTE Sylvania, Inc. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc., </em>445 U. S. 375, 382 (1980) (\u201cThe purpose of the case-or-controversy requirement is to limit the business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form <em>historically viewed </em>as capable of resolution through the judicial process\u201d (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>307 U. S. 433, 460 (1939) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) (in crafting Article III, \u201cthe framers . . . gave merely the outlines of what were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>them the familiar operations of the English judicial system and its manifestations on this side of the ocean before the Union\u201d). Consequently, we here have carefully examined how courts have historically treated suits by assignors and assignees. And we have discovered that history and precedent are clear on the question before us: Assignees of a claim, including assignees for collection, have long been permitted to bring suit. A clear historical answer at least demands reasons for change. We can find no such reasons here, and accordingly we conclude that the aggregators have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We must begin with a minor concession. Prior to the 17th century, English law would not have authorized a suit like this one. But that is because, with only limited exceptions, English courts refused to recognize assignments at all. See, <em>e. g., Lampet\u2019s Case, </em>10 Co. Rep. 46b, 48a, 77 Eng. Rep. 994, 997 (K. B. 1612) (stating that \u201cno possibility, right, title, nor thing in action, shall be granted or assigned to strangers\u201d (footnote omitted)); <em>Penson &amp; Higbed\u2019s Case, </em>4 Leo. 99, 74 Eng. Rep. 756 (K. B. 1590) (refusing to recognize the right of an assignee of a right in contract); see also 9 J. Murray, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 47.3, p. 134 (rev. ed. 2007) (noting that the King was excepted from the basic rule and could, as a result, always receive assignments).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Courts then strictly adhered to the rule that a \u201cchose in action\u201d\u2014an interest in property not immediately reducible to possession (which, over time, came to include a financial interest such as a debt, a legal claim for money, or a contractual right)\u2014simply \u201ccould not be transferred to another person by the strict rules of the ancient common law.\u201d See 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *442. To permit transfer, the courts feared, would lead to the \u201cmultiplying of contentions and suits,\u201d <em>Lampet\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at 48a, 77 Eng. Rep., at 997, and would also promote \u201cmaintenance,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>officious in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>termeddling with litigation, see Holdsworth, History of the Treatment of <em>Choses </em>in Action by the Common Law, 33 Harv. L. Rev. 997, 1006-1009 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">As the 17th century began, however, strict anti-assignment rules seemed inconsistent with growing commercial needs. And as English commerce and trade expanded, courts began to liberalize the rules that prevented assignments of choses in action. See 9 Corbin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47.3, at 134 (suggesting that the \u201cpragmatic necessities of trade\u201d induced \u201cevolution of the common law\u201d); Holdsworth, <em>supra, </em>at 1021-1022 (the \u201ccommon law\u201d was \u201cinduced\u201d to change because of \u201cconsiderations of mercantile convenience or necessity\u201d); J. Ames, Lectures on Legal History 214 (1913) (noting that the \u201cobjection of maintenance\u201d yielded to \u201cthe modern commercial spirit\u201d). By the beginning of the 18th century, courts routinely recognized assignments of equitable (but not legal) interests in a chose in action: Courts of equity permitted suits by an assignee who had equitable (but not legal) title. And courts of law effectively allowed suits either by the assignee (who had equitable, but not legal title) or the assignor (who had legal, but not equitable title).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">To be more specific, courts of equity would simply permit an assignee with a beneficial interest in a chose in action to sue in his own name. They might, however, require the assignee to bring in the assignor as a party to the action so as to bind him to whatever judgment was reached. See, <em>e. g., Warmstrey </em>v. <em>Tanfield, </em>1 Ch. Rep. 29, 21 Eng. Rep. 498 (1628-1629); <em>Fashion </em>v. <em>Atwood, 2 </em>Ch. Cas. 36, 22 Eng. Rep. 835 (1688); <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Soame, 2 </em>Vern. 428, 428-429, 23 Eng. Rep. 874 (Ch. 1701); <em>Squib </em>v. <em>Wyn, </em>1 P. Wms. 378, 381, 24 Eng. Rep. 432, 433 (Ch. 1717); <em>Lord Carteret </em>v. <em>Paschal, </em>3 P. Wms. 197, 199, 24 Eng. Rep. 1028, 1029 (Ch. 1733); <em>Row </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>1 Ves. sen. 331, 332-333, 27 Eng. Rep. 1064, 1064-1065 (Ch. 1749). See also M. Smith, Law of Assignment: The Creation and Transfer of Choses in Action 131 (2007) (by the beginning of the 18th century, \u201cit became settled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>equity would recognize the validity of the assignment of both debts and of other things regarded by the common law as choses in action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Courts of law, meanwhile, would permit the assignee with an equitable interest to bring suit, but nonetheless required the assignee to obtain a \u201cpower of attorney\u201d from the holder of the legal title, namely, the assignor, and further required the assignee to bring suit <em>in the name of that assignor. </em>See, <em>e. g., </em>Cook, Alienability of Choses in Action, 29 Harv. L. Rev. 816, 822 (1916) (\u201c[C]ommon law lawyers were able, through the device of the \u2018power of attorney\u2019 ... to enable the assignee to obtain relief in common law proceedings by suing in the name of the assignor\u201d); 29 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 74:2, pp. 214-215 (4th ed. 2003). Compare, <em>e. g., Barrow </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>Cro. Eliz. 551, 78 Eng. Rep. 797 (K. B. 1653), and <em>South &amp; Marsh\u2019s Case, </em>3 Leo. 234, 74 Eng. Rep. 654 (Exch. 1686) (limiting the use of a power of attorney to cases in which the assignor owed the assignee a debt), with Holdsworth, <em>supra, </em>at 1021 (noting that English courts abandoned that limitation by the end of the 18th century). At the same time, courts of law would permit an assignor to sue <em>even when he had transferred away his beneficial interest. </em>And they permitted the assignor to sue in such circumstances precisely because the assignor retained legal title. See, <em>e. g., Winch </em>v. <em>Keeley, </em>1 T. R. 619, 99 Eng. Rep. 1284 (K. B. 1787) (allowing the bankrupt assignor of a chose in action to sue a debtor for the benefit of the assignee because the assignor possessed legal, though not equitable, title).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The upshot is that by the time Blackstone published volume II of his Commentaries in 1766, he could dismiss the \u201cancient common law\u201d prohibition on assigning choses in action as a \u201cnicety ... now disregarded.\u201d 2 Blackstone, <em>supra, </em>at *442.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Legal practice in the United States largely mirrored that in England. In the latter half of the 18th century and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>throughout the 19th century, American courts regularly \u201cexercised their powers in favor of the assignee,\u201d both at law and in equity. 9 Corbin on Contracts \u00a747.3, at 137. See, <em>e. g., McCullum </em>v. <em>Coxe, </em>1 Dall. 139 (Pa. 1785) (protecting assignee of a debt against a collusive settlement by the assignor); <em>Dennie </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 Root 113, 115 (Conn. Super. 1789) (assignee of a nonnegotiable note can bring suit \u201cin the name of the original promisee or his administrator\u201d); <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Beecker, </em>1 Johns. Cas. 411, 411-412, n. (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1800) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\u201cCourts of law . . . are, in justice, bound to protect the rights of the assignees, as much as a court of equity, though they may still require the action to be brought in the name of the assignor\u201d); <em>Riddle &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>5 Cranch 322 (1809) (assignees of promissory notes entitled to bring suit in equity). Indeed, \u00a7 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 specifically authorized federal courts to take \u201ccognizance of any suit to recover the contents of any promissory note or other chose in action in favour of an assignee\u201d so long as federal jurisdiction would lie if the assignor himself had brought suit. 1 Stat. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Thus, in 1816, Justice Story, writing for a unanimous Court, summarized the practice in American courts as follows: \u201cCourts of law, following in this respect the rules of equity, now take notice of assignments of choses in action, and exert themselves to afford them every support and protection.\u201d <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>1 Wheat. 233, 236. He added that courts of equity have \u201cdisregarded the rigid strictness of the common law, and protected the rights of the assignee of choses in action,\u201d and noted that courts of common law \u201cnow consider an assignment of a chose in action as substantially valid, only preserving, in certain cases, the form of an action commenced in the name of the assignor.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 237, n.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">It bears noting, however, that at the time of the founding (and in some States well before then) the law did permit the assignment of legal title to at least some choses in action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>In such cases, the assignee could bring suit on the assigned claim in his own name, in a court of law. See, <em>e. g., </em>Act of Oct. 1705, Ch. XXXIV, 3 Va. Stat. 378 (W. Hening ed. 1823) (reprinted 1969) (permitting any person to \u201cassign or transfer any bond or bill for debt over to any other person\u201d and providing that \u201cthe assignee or assignees, his and their executors and administrators by virtue of such assignment shall and may have lawfull power to commence and prosecute any suit at law in his or their own name or names\u201d); Act of May 28, 1715, Ch. XXVIII, Gen. Laws of Penn. 60 (J. Dunlop comp. 2d ed. 1849) (permitting the assignment of \u201cbonds, specialties, and notes\u201d and authorizing \u201cthe person or persons, to whom the said bonds, specialties or notes, are ... assigned\u201d to \u201ccommence and prosecute his, her or their actions at law\u201d); Patent Act of 1793, ch. 11, \u00a7 4, 1 Stat. 322 (\u201c[I]t shall be lawful for any inventor, his executor or administrator to assign the title and interest in the said invention, at anytime, and the assignee . . . shall thereafter stand in the place of the original inventor, both as to right and responsibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">By the 19th century, courts began to consider the specific question presented here: whether an assignee of a legal claim for money could sue when that assignee had promised to give all litigation proceeds back to the assignor. During that century American law at the state level became less formalistic through the merger of law and equity, through statutes more generously permitting an assignor to pass legal title to an assignee, and through the adoption of rules that permitted any \u201creal party in interest\u201d to bring suit. See 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1541, pp. 320-321 (2d ed. 1990) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller); see also 9 Corbin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47.3, at 137. The courts recognized that pre-existing law permitted an assignor to bring suit on a claim even though the assignor retained nothing more than naked legal title. Since the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>increasingly permitted the transfer of legal title to an assignee, courts agreed that assignor and assignee should be treated alike in this respect. And rather than abolish the assignor\u2019s well-established right to sue on the basis of naked legal title alone, many courts instead <em>extended the same right to an assignee. </em>See, <em>e. g., </em>Clark <em>&amp; </em>Hutchins, The Real Party in Interest, 34 Yale L. J. 259, 264-265 (1925) (noting that the changes in the law permitted both the assignee with \u201cnaked legal title\u201d and the assignee with an equitable interest in a claim to bring suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Thus, during the 19th century, most state courts entertained suits virtually identical to the litigation before us: suits by individuals who were assignees for collection only, <em>i. e., </em>assignees who brought suit to collect money owed to their assignors but who promised to turn over to those assignors the proceeds secured through litigation. See, <em>e. g., Webb &amp; Hepp </em>v. <em>Morgan, McClung &amp; Co., </em>14 Mo. 428, 431 (1851) (holding that the assignees of a promissory note for collection only can bring suit, even though they lack a beneficial interest in the note, because the assignment \u201ccreates in them such legal interest, that they thereby become the persons to sue\u201d); <em>Meeker </em>v. <em>Claghorn, </em>44 N.

See also Appendix, <em>infra </em>(collecting cases from numerous other States approving of suits by assignees for collection).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Of course, the dissent rightly notes, <em>some </em>States during this period of time refused to recognize assignee-forcollection suits, or otherwise equivocated on the matter. See <em>post, </em>at 309 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.). But so <em>many </em>States allowed these suits that by 1876, the distinguished procedure and equity scholar John Norton Pomeroy declared it \u201csettled by a <em>great preponderance </em>of authority, although there is some conflict\u201d that an assignee is \u201centitled to sue in his own name\u201d whenever the assignment vests \u201clegal title\u201d in the assignee, and notwithstanding \u201cany contemporaneous, collateral agreement by virtue of which he is to receive a part only of the proceeds ... or even is to thus account [to the assignor] for the <em>whole </em>proceeds.\u201d Remedies and Remedial Rights \u00a7 132, p. 159 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Other contemporary scholars reached the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>same basic conclusion. See, <em>e. g., </em>P. Bliss, A Treatise Upon the Law of Pleading \u00a7 51, p. 69 (2d ed. 1887) (stating that <em>\u201c[m]ost of the courts </em>have held that where negotiable paper has been indorsed, or other choses in action have been assigned, it does not concern the defendant for what purpose the transfer has been made\u201d and giving examples of States permitting assignees to bring suit even where they lacked a beneficial interest in the assigned claims (emphasis added)). See also Clark &amp; Hutchins, <em>supra, </em>at 264 <em>(\u201c[MJany, probably most, American jurisdictions\u201d </em>have held that \u201can assignee who has no beneficial interest, like an assignee for collection only, may prosecute an action in his own name\u201d (emphasis added)). Even Michael Ferguson\u2019s California Law Review Comment\u2014which the dissent cites as support for its argument about \u201cthe divergent practice\u201d among the courts, <em>post, </em>at 310 \u2014recognizes that <em>\u201c[a] majority of courts </em>has held that an assignee for collection only is a real party in interest\u201d entitled to bring suit. See Comment, The Real Party in Interest Rule Revitalized: Recognizing Defendant\u2019s Interest in the Determination of Proper Parties Plaintiff, 55 Cal. L. Rev. 1452, 1475 (1967) (emphasis added); see also <em>id., </em>at 1476, n. 118 (noting that even \u201c[t]he few courts that have waivered on the question have always ended up in the camp of the <em>majority\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">During this period, a number of federal courts similarly indicated approval of suits by assignees for collection only. See, <em>e. g., Bradford </em>v. <em>Jenks, </em>3 F. Cas. 1132, 1134 (No. 1,769) (CC Ill. 1840) (stating that the plaintiff, the receiver of a bank, could bring suit in federal court to collect on a note owed to that bank if he sued as the bank\u2019s <em>assignee, </em>not its receiver, but ultimately holding that the plaintiff could not sue as an assignee because there was no diversity jurisdiction); <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>18 F. Cas. 834 (No. 10,589) (CC Mich. 1847) (affirming judgment for the plaintiff, the endorsee of a bill of exchange, on the ground that, as endorsee, he had the \u201clegal right\u201d to bring suit notwithstanding the fact that the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ceeds of the litigation would be turned over to the endorser); <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>The Emma Graham, </em>17 F. Cas. 1012, 1013 (No. 9,940) (SD Ohio 1878) (permitting the assignee of a claim for injury to a \u201cfloat or barge\u201d to bring suit when, \u201cunder the assignment,\u201d the assignor\u2019s <em>creditors </em>would benefit from the litigation); <em>The Rupert City, </em>213 F. 263, 266-267 (WD Wash. 1914) (assignees of claims for collection only could bring suit in maritime law because \u201can assignment for collection . . . vest[s] such an interest in [an] assignee as to entitle him to sue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Even this Court long ago indicated that assignees for collection only can properly bring suit. For example, in <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Santa Cruz, </em>184 U. S. 302 (1902), the plaintiff sued to collect on a number of municipal bonds and coupons whose \u201clegal title\u201d had been vested in him but which were transferred to him \u201cfor collection only.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 324. The Court, in a unanimous decision, ultimately held that the federal courts could not hear his suit because the amount-in-controversy requirement of diversity jurisdiction would not have been satisfied if the bondholders and coupon holders had sued individually. See <em>id., </em>at 328-329. However, before reaching this holding, the Court expressly stated that the suit <em>could </em>properly be brought in federal court \u201cif the only objection to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is that the plaintiff was invested with the legal title to the bonds and coupons simply for purposes of collection.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Next, in <em>Spiller </em>v. <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co., </em>253 U. S. 117 (1920), a large number of cattle shippers assigned to Spiller (the secretary of a Cattle Raiser\u2019s Association) their individual reparation claims against railroads they said had charged them excessive rates. The Federal Court of Appeals held that Spiller could not bring suit because, in effect, he was an assignee for collection only and would be passing back to the cattle shippers any money he recovered from the litigation. In a unanimous decision, this Court reversed. The Court wrote that the cattle shippers\u2019 \u201cassignments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>absolute in form\u201d and \u201cplainly\u201d \u201cvest[ed] the legal title in Spiller.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 134. The Court conceded that the assignments did not pass \u201cbeneficial or equitable title\u201d to Spiller. <em>Ibid. </em>But the Court then said that \u201cthis was not necessary to support the right of the assignee to claim an award of reparation and enable him to recover it by action at law brought in his own name but for the benefit of the equitable owners of the claims.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court thereby held that Spiller\u2019s legal title alone was sufficient to allow him to bring suit in federal court on the aggregated claims of his assignors.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Similarly, in <em>Titus </em>v. <em>Wallick, </em>306 U. S. 282 (1939), this Court unanimously held that (under New York law) a plaintiff, an assignee for collection, had \u201cdominion over the claim for purposes of suit\u201d because the assignment purported to \u201c \u2018sell, assign, transfer and set over\u2019 the chose in action\u201d to the assignee. <em>Id., </em>at 289. More importantly for present purposes, the Court said that the assignment\u2019s \u201clegal effect was not curtailed by the recital that the assignment was for purposes of suit and that its proceeds were to be turned over or accounted for to another.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">To be clear, we do not suggest that the Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Waite, Spiller, </em>and <em>Titus </em>conclusively resolve the standing question before us. We cite them because they offer additional and powerful support for the proposition that suits by assignees for collection have long been seen as \u201camenable\u201d to resolution by the judicial process. <em>Steel Co., </em>523 U. S., at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Finally, we note that there is also considerable, more recent authority showing that an assignee for collection may properly sue on the assigned claim in federal court. See, <em>e. g., </em>6A Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1545, at 346-348 (noting that an assignee with legal title is considered to be a real party in interest and that as a result \u201cfederal courts have held that an assignee for purposes of collection who holds legal title to the debt according to the governing substantive law is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>real party in interest even though the assignee must account to the assignor for whatever is recovered in the action\u201d); 6 Am. Jur. 2d, Assignments \u00a7 184, pp. 262-263 (1999) (\u201cAn assignee for collection or security only is within the meaning of the real party in interest statutes and entitled to sue in his or her own name on an assigned account or chose in action, although he or she must account to the assignor for the proceeds of the action, even when the assignment is without consideration\u201d (footnote omitted)). See also <em>Rosenblum </em>v. <em>Dingfelder, </em>111 F. 2d 406, 407 (CA2 1940); <em>Staggers </em>v. <em>Otto Gerdau Co., </em>359 F. 2d 292, 294 (CA2 1966); <em>Dixie Portland Flour Mills, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dixie Feed &amp; Seed Co., </em>382 F. 2d 830, 833 (CA6 1967); <em>Klamath-Lake Pharmaceutical Assn. </em>v. <em>Klamath Medical Serv. Bur., </em>701 F. 2d 1276, 1282 (CA9 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The history and precedents that we have summarized make clear that courts have long found ways to allow assignees to bring suit; that where assignment is at issue, courts\u2014 both before and after the founding\u2014 have always permitted the party with legal title alone to bring suit; and that there is a strong tradition specifically of suits by assignees for collection. We find this history and precedent \u201cwell nigh conclusive\u201d in respect to the issue before us: Lawsuits by assignees, including assignees for collection only, are \u201ccases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.\u201d <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Stevens, </em>529 U. S. 765, 777-778 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Petitioners have not offered any convincing reason why we should depart from the historical tradition of suits by assignees, including assignees for collection. In any event, we find that the assignees before us satisfy the Article III <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>standing requirements articulated in more modern decisions of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Petitioners argue, for example, that the aggregators have not themselves suffered any injury in fact and that the assignments for collection \u201cdo not suffice to transfer the payphone operators\u2019 injuries.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 18. It is, of course, true that the aggregators did not originally suffer any injury caused by the long-distance carriers; the payphone operators did. But the payphone operators assigned their claims to the aggregators lock, stock, and barrel. See <em>APCC Servs., </em>418 F. 3d, at 1243 (there is \u201cno reason to believe the assignment is anything less than a complete transfer to the aggregator\u201d of the injury and resulting claim); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 114 (Agreement provides that each payphone operator \u201cassigns, transfers and sets over\u201d to the aggregator \u201call rights, title and interest\u201d in dial-around compensation claims). And within the past decade we have expressly held that an assignee can sue based on his assign- or\u2019s injuries. In <em>Vermont Agency, supra, </em>we considered whether a <em>qui tarn </em>relator possesses Article III standing to bring suit under the False Claims Act, which authorizes a private party to bring suit to remedy an injury (fraud) that the United States, not the private party, suffered. We held that such a relator does possess standing. And we said that is because the Act \u201ceffect[s] a partial assignment of the Government\u2019s damages claim\u201d and that assignment of the \u201cUnited States\u2019 injury in fact suffices to confer standing on [the relator].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 773, 774. Indeed, in <em>Vermont Agency </em>we stated quite unequivocally that \u201cthe assignee of a claim has standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by the assignor.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Petitioners next argue that the aggregators cannot satisfy the redressability requirement of standing because, if successful in this litigation, the aggregators will simply remit the litigation proceeds to the payphone operators. But petitioners misconstrue the nature of our redressability inquiry. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>That inquiry focuses, as it should, on whether the <em>injury </em>that a plaintiff alleges is likely to be redressed through the litigation \u2014 not on what the plaintiff ultimately intends to do with the money he recovers. See, <em>e. g., id., </em>at 771 (to demonstrate redressability, the plaintiff must show a \u201csubstantial likelihood that the requested relief will remedy <em>the alleged injury in fact\u201d </em>(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added)); <em>Lujan, </em>504 U. S., at 561 (\u201c[I]t must be likely . . . that the <em>injury </em>will be redressed by a favorable decision\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added)). Here, a legal victory would unquestionably redress the <em>injuries </em>for which the aggregators bring suit. The aggregators\u2019 injuries relate to the failure to receive the required dial-around compensation. And if the aggregators prevail in this litigation, the long-distance carriers would write a check to the aggregators for the amount of dial-around compensation owed. What does it matter what the aggregators do with the money afterward? The injuries would be redressed whether the aggregators remit the litigation proceeds to the payphone operators, donate them to charity, or use them to build new corporate headquarters. Moreover, the statements our prior cases made about the need to show redress of the <em>injury </em>are consistent with what numerous authorities have long held in the assignment context, namely, that an assignee for collection may properly bring suit to redress the injury originally suffered by his assignor. Petitioners might disagree with those authorities. But petitioners have not provided us with a good reason to reconsider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The dissent argues that our redressability analysis \u201ccould not be more wrong,\u201d because \u201c[w]e have never approved federal-court jurisdiction over a claim where the entire relief requested will run to a party not before the court. Never.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 302. But federal courts routinely entertain suits which will result in relief for parties that are not themselves directly bringing suit. Trustees bring suits to benefit their trusts; guardians ad litem bring suits to benefit their wards; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>receivers bring suit to benefit their receiverships; assignees in bankruptcy bring suit to benefit bankrupt estates; executors bring suit to benefit testator estates; and so forth. The dissent\u2019s view of redressability, if taken seriously, would work a sea change in the law. Moreover, to the extent that trustees, guardians ad litem, and the like have some sort of \u201cobligation\u201d to the parties whose interests they vindicate through litigation, see <em>post, </em>at 304-305, n. 2, the same is true in respect to the aggregators here. The aggregators have a <em>contractual </em>obligation to litigate \u201cin the [payphone operator\u2019s] interest.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 115a. (And if the aggregators somehow violate that contractual obligation, say, by agreeing to settle the claims against the long-distance providers in exchange for a kickback from those providers, each payphone operator would be able to bring suit for breach of contract.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Petitioners also make a further conceptual argument. They point to cases in which this Court has said that a party must possess a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in a case in order to have standing under Article III. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962). And petitioners add that, because the aggregators will not actually benefit from a victory in this case, they lack a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the litigation\u2019s outcome. The problem with this argument is that the general \u201cpersonal stake\u201d requirement and the more specific standing requirements (injury in fact, redressability, and causation) are flip sides of the same coin. They are simply different descriptions of the same judicial effort to ensure, in every case or controversy, \u201cthat concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>549 U. S. 497, 517 (2007) (\u201cAt bottom, the gist of the question of standing is whether petitioners have such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Courts, during the past two centuries, appear to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>found that \u201cconcrete adverseness\u201d where an assignee for collection brings a lawsuit. And petitioners have provided us with no grounds for reaching a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Petitioners make a purely functional argument, as well. Read as a whole, they say, the assignments in this litigation constitute nothing more than a contract for legal services. We think this argument is overstated. There is an important distinction between simply hiring a lawyer and assigning a claim to a lawyer (on the lawyer\u2019s promise to remit litigation proceeds). The latter confers a property right (which creditors might attach); the former does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Finally, we note, as a practical matter, that it would be particularly unwise for us to abandon history and precedent in resolving the question before us. Were we to agree with petitioners that the aggregators lack standing, our holding could easily be overcome. For example, the Agreement could be rewritten to give the aggregator a tiny portion of the assigned claim itself, perhaps only a dollar or two. Or the payphone operators might assign all of their claims to a \u201cDial-Around Compensation Trust\u201d and then pay a trustee (perhaps the aggregator) to bring suit on behalf of the trust. Accordingly, the far more sensible course is to abide by the history and tradition of assignee suits and find that the aggregators possess Article III standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Petitioners argue that, even if the aggregators have standing under Article III, we should nonetheless deny them standing for a number of prudential reasons. See <em>Elk Grove Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Newdow, </em>542 U. S. 1, 11 (2004) (prudential standing doctrine \u201cembodies judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">First, petitioners invoke certain prudential limitations that we have imposed in prior cases where a plaintiff has sought to assert the legal claims of third parties. See, <em>e. g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin, </em>422 U. S. 490, 501 (1975) (expressing a \u201creluctance to exert judicial power when the plaintiff\u2019s claim to relief rests on the legal rights of third parties\u201d); <em>Arlington Heights </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em>429 U. S. 252, 263 (1977) (\u201cIn the ordinary case, a party is denied standing to assert the rights of third persons\u201d); <em>Secretary of State of Md. </em>v. <em>Joseph H. Munson Co., </em>467 U. S. 947, 955 (1984) (a plaintiff ordinarily \u201c \u2018cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">These third-party eases, however, are not on point. They concern plaintiffs who seek to assert not their own legal rights, but the legal rights of others. See, <em>e. g., Warth, supra, </em>at 499 (plaintiff \u201cgenerally must assert his own <em>legal rights </em>and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the <em>legal rights </em>or interests of third parties\u201d (emphasis added)); see also <em>Kowalski </em>v. <em>Tesmer, </em>543 U. S. 125 (2004) (lawyers lack standing to assert the constitutional rights of defendants deprived of appointed counsel on appeal); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>499 U. S. 400 (1991) (permitting a criminal defendant to assert rights of juror discriminated against because of race); <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>429 U. S. 190 (1976) (permitting beer vendors to assert rights of prospective male customers aged 18 to 21 who, unlike females of the same ages, were barred from purchasing beer). Here, the aggregators are suing based on <em>injuries </em>originally suffered by third parties. But the payphone operators assigned to the aggregators all \u201crights, title and interest\u201d in claims based on those injuries. Thus, in the litigation before us, the aggregators assert what are, due to that transfer, <em>legal rights of their own. </em>The aggregators, in other words, are asserting first-party, not third-party, legal rights. Moreover, we add that none of the third-party cases cited by petitioners involved assignments or purported to overturn the longstanding doctrine permitting an assignee to bring suit on an assigned claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Second, petitioners suggest that the litigation here simply represents an effort by the aggregators and the payphone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>operators to circumvent Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\u2019s class-action requirements. But we do not understand how \u201ccircumvention\u201d of Rule 23 could constitute a basis for denying standing here. For one thing, class actions are permissive, not mandatory. More importantly, class actions constitute but one of several methods for bringing about aggregation of claims, <em>i. e., </em>they are but one of several methods by which multiple similarly situated parties get similar claims resolved at one time and in one federal forum. See Rule 20(a) (permitting joinder of multiple plaintiffs); Rule 42 (permitting consolidation of related cases filed in the same district court); 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1407 (authorizing consolidation of pretrial proceedings for related cases filed in multiple federal districts); \u00a7 1404 (making it possible for related cases pending in different federal courts to be transferred and consolidated in one district court); D. Herr, Annotated Manual for Complex Litigation \u00a720.12, p. 279 (4th ed. 2007) (noting that \u201c[r]elated cases pending in different federal courts may be consolidated in a single district\u201d by transfer under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1404(a)); J. Tidmarsh &amp; R. Trangsrud, Complex Litigation and the Adversary System 473-524 (1998) (section on \u201cTransfer Devices that Aggregate Cases in a Single Venue\u201d). Because the federal system permits aggregation by other means, we do not think that the aggregators should be denied standing simply because the payphone operators chose one aggregation method over another.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Petitioners also point to various practical problems that could arise because the aggregators, rather than the payphone operators, are suing. In particular, they say that the payphone operators may not comply with discovery requests served on them, that the payphone operators may not honor judgments reached in this case, and that petitioners may not be able to bring, in this litigation, counterclaims against the payphone operators. See Brief for Petitioners 46-48. Even assuming all that is so, courts have long permitted assignee lawsuits notwithstanding the fact that such problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>could arise. Regardless, courts are not helpless in the face of such problems. For example, a district court can, if appropriate, compel a party to collect and to produce whatever discovery-related information is necessary. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1), 30-31, 33-36. That court might grant a motion to join the payphone operators to the case as \u201crequired\u201d parties. See Rule 19. Or the court might allow the carriers to file a third-party complaint against the payphone operators. See Rule 14(a). And the carriers could always ask the Federal Communications Commission to find administrative solutions to any remaining practical problems. Cf. 47 U. S. C. \u00a7 276(b)(1)(A) (authorizing the FCC to \u201cprescribe regulations\u201d that \u201censure that all payphone service providers are fairly compensated for each and every completed [dial-around] call\u201d). We do not say that the litigation before us calls for the use of any such procedural device.

See <em>Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment, </em>523 U. S. 83, 102-103 (1998). But regardless of how the test is articulated, \u201cthe point has always been the same: whether a plaintiff <em>\u2018personally </em>would benefit in a tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 103, n. 5 (quoting <em>Warth, supra, </em>at 508; emphasis added). An assignee who has acquired the bare legal right to prosecute a claim but no right to the substantive recovery cannot show that he has a personal stake in the litigation. The Court\u2019s decision today is unprecedented. <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Stevens, </em>529 U. S. 765 (2000), does not support it. <em>Vermont Agency, </em>in recognizing that a <em>qui tarn </em>relator as assignee of the United States had standing to sue, did not dispense with the essential requirement of Article III standing that the plaintiff have a \u201cconcrete private interest in the outcome of [the] suit.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 772 (quoting <em>Lujan, supra, </em>at 573; internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Vermont Agency, </em>the <em>qui tarn </em>relator\u2019s bounty was sufficient to establish standing because it represented a \u201cpartial assignment of the Government\u2019s damages claim,\u201d encompassing both a legal right to assert the claim <em>and </em>a stake in the recovery. 529 U. S., at 773. Thus, it was clear that the False Claims Act gave the \u201crelator himself an interest <em>in the lawsuit,\u201d </em>in addition to \u201cthe right to retain a fee out of the recovery.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Here, respondents are authorized to bring suit on behalf of the payphone operators, but they have no claim to the recovery. Indeed, their take is not tied to the recovery in any way. Respondents receive their compensation based on the number of payphones and telephone lines operated by their clients, see App. 198, not based on the measure of dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ages ultimately awarded by a court or paid by petitioners as part of a settlement. Respondents received the assignments only as a result of their willingness to assume the obligation of remitting any recovery to the assignors, the payphone operators. That is, after all, the entire point of the arrangement. The payphone operators assigned their claims to respondents \u201cfor purposes of collection,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 114; respondents never had any share in the amount collected. The absence of any right to the substantive recovery means that respondents cannot benefit from the judgment they seek and thus lack Article III standing. \u201cWhen you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.\u201d Bob Dylan, Like A Rolling Stone, on Highway 61 Revisited (Columbia Records 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">To be sure, respondents doubtless have more than just a passing interest in the litigation. As collection agencies, respondents must demonstrate that they are willing to make good on their threat to pursue their clients\u2019 claims in litigation. Even so, \u201can interest that is merely a \u2018byproduct\u2019 of the suit itself cannot give rise to a cognizable injury in fact for Article III standing purposes.\u201d <em>Vermont Agency, supra, </em>at 773. The benefit respondents would receive \u2014 the general business goodwill that would result from a successful verdict, the ability to collect dial-around compensation for their clients more effectively \u2014 is nothing more than a byproduct of the current litigation. Such an interest cannot support their standing to sue in federal court. Cf. <em>Steel Co., supra, </em>at 107 (the costs of investigating and prosecuting a substantive claim do not give rise to standing to assert the claim); <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>476 U. S. 54, 70 (1986) (an interest in recovering attorney\u2019s fees does not confer standing to litigate the underlying claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The undeniable consequence of today\u2019s decision is that a plaintiff need no longer demonstrate a personal stake in the outcome of the litigation. Instead, the majority has replaced the personal stake requirement with a completely im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>personal one. The right to sue is now the exact opposite of a personal claim \u2014 it is a marketable commodity. By severing the right to recover from the right to prosecute a claim, the Court empowers <em>anyone </em>to bring suit on any claim, whether it be the first assignee, the second, the third, or so on. But, as we have said in another context, standing is not \u201ccommutative.\u201d <em>Cuno, </em>547 U. S., at 352. Legal claims, at least those brought in federal court, are not fungible commodities.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The source of the Court\u2019s mistake is easy to identify. The Court goes awry when it asserts that the standing inquiry focuses on whether the <em>injury </em>is likely to be redressed, not whether the <em>complaining party\u2019s </em>injury is likely to be redressed. See <em>ante, </em>at 286-287. That could not be more wrong. We have never approved federal-court jurisdiction over a claim where the entire relief requested will run to a party not before the court. Never. The Court commits this mistake by treating the elements of standing as separate strands rather than as interlocking and related elements meant to ensure a personal stake. Our cases do not condone this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The Court expressly rejected such an argument in <em>Vermont Agency, </em>where the relator argued that he was \u201csuing to remedy an injury in fact suffered by the United States.\u201d 529 U. S., at 771. We dismissed the argument out of hand, noting that \u201c[t]he. Art. Ill judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury <em>to the complaining party.\u201d Id., </em>at 771-772 (quoting <em>Warth, </em>422 U. S., at 499; emphasis in <em>Vermont Agency, </em>internal quotation marks omitted). Although the Court\u2019s analysis in that section of the opinion concerned the right of the relator to assert the United States\u2019 <em>injury, </em>the Court treated it as axiomatic that any \u201credress\u201d must also redound to the benefit of the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In <em>Steel Co., </em>the Court similarly rejected a basis for standing that turned on relief sought \u2014 the imposition of civil penalties \u2014 that was \u201cpayable to the United States Treasury,\u201d but not to the plaintiff. 523 U. S., at 106. We observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the plaintiff sought \u201cnot remediation of its <em>own </em>injury,\u201d but merely the \u201cvindication of the rule of law.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). Importantly, the Court recognized that \u201c[rjelief that does not remedy the injury suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court; that is the very essence of the redressability requirement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 107. Again, the Court\u2019s emphasis on the <em>party\u2019s </em>injury makes clear that the basis for rejecting standing in <em>Steel Co. </em>was the fact that the remedy sought would not benefit the party before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The majority\u2019s view of the Article III redressability requirement is also incompatible with what we said in <em>Raines, </em>521 U. S. 811. In that case, we held that individual Members of Congress lacked standing to contest the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. We observed that the Congressmen \u201cdo not claim that they have been deprived of something to which they <em>personally </em>are entitled.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 821. Rather, the Members sought to enforce a right that ran to their office, not to their person. \u201cIf one of the Members were to retire tomorrow, he would no longer have a claim; the claim would be possessed by his successor instead. The claimed injury thus runs (in a sense) with the Member\u2019s seat, a seat which the Member holds ... as trustee for his constituents, not as a prerogative of personal power.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We therefore held that the individual Members did \u201cnot have a sufficient \u2018personal stake\u2019 in th[e] dispute\u201d to maintain their challenge. <em>Id., </em>at 830. See also <em>Warth, supra, </em>at 506 (denying standing where \u201cthe record is devoid of any indication\u201d that the requested \u201crelief would benefit petitioners\u201d); <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U. S. 26, 39, 42 (1976) (denying standing to plaintiffs who did not \u201cstand to profit in some <em>personal </em>interest\u201d because it was \u201cpurely speculative\u201d whether the relief sought \u201cwould result in <em>these respondents\u2019 </em>receiving the hospital services they desire\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The majority finds that respondents have a sufficient stake in this litigation because the substantive recovery will initially go to them, and \u201c[w]hat does it matter what the ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>gregators do with the money afterward?\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 287. The majority\u2019s assertion implies, incorrectly, that respondents have, or ever had, a choice of what to do with the recovery. It may be true that a plaintiff\u2019s <em>independent </em>decision to pledge his recovery to another, as in respondents\u2019 hypothetical of an <em>\u201coriginal </em>owner of a claim who signs a collateral agreement with a charity obligating herself to donate every penny she recovers in [the] litigation,\u201d Brief for Respondents 21, would not divest the plaintiff of Article III standing. But respondents never had the right to direct the disposition of the recovery; they have only the right to sue. The hypothetical plaintiff who chooses to pledge her recovery to charity, by contrast, will secure a personal benefit from the recovery. Unlike respondents\u2019 claims, the hypothetical plaintiff\u2019s pre-existing claim is not tied in any way to her separate agreement to direct her recovery to charity. She has more than the right to sue; she has the right to exercise her independent authority to direct the proceeds as she sees fit. In that situation, the Article III requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate a personal stake in the outcome of the litigation is satisfied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The Court believes that these standing principles, embodying a \u201ccore component derived directly from the Constitution,\u201d <em>Allen, </em>468 U.

The Court chooses to elevate expediency above the strictures imposed by the Constitution. That is a tradeoff the Constitution does not allow. Cf. <em>Raines, supra, </em>at 820 (\u201c[W]e must put aside the natural urge to proceed directly to the merits of this important dispute and to \u2019settle\u2019 it for the sake of convenience and efficiency\u201d). Perhaps it is true that a \u201cdollar or two,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 289, would give respondents a sufficient stake in the litigation. Article III is worth a dollar. And in any case, the ease with which respondents can comply with the requirements of Article III is not a reason to abandon our precedents; it is a reason to adhere to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Given all this, it is understandable that the majority opts to minimize its reliance on modern standing principles and to retreat to a broad, generalized reading of the historical tradition of assignments. But that history does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The first problem lies in identifying the relevant tradition. Much of the majority\u2019s historical analysis focuses on the generic (and undisputed) point that common law and equity courts eventually permitted assignees to sue on their assigned claims. See <em>ante, </em>at 275-279. I would treat that point as settled as much by <em>stare decisis, </em>see <em>Vermont Agency, </em>529 U. S., at 773, as by the historic practice of the King\u2019s Bench and Chancery. But the general history of assignments says nothing about the particular aspect of suits brought on assigned claims that is relevant to this case: whether an assignee who has acquired the legal right to sue, but no right to any substantive recovery, can maintain an action in court. On that precise question, the historical sources are either nonexistent or equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">None of the English common-law sources on which the majority relies establishes that assignments <em>of this sort </em>would be permitted either at law or in equity. As the majority\u2019s discussion makes clear, both systems permitted suits brought on assignments \u2014 either in equity by an assignee having a beneficial interest in the litigation, or at law by an assignee who had a power of attorney and sued in the name of the assignor. See <em>ante, </em>at 276-277. But at all times, suits based on assignments remained subject to the prohibition on champerty and maintenance. See 7 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 535-536 (1926).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By the 18th cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tury, an assignment no longer constituted maintenance <em>per se, </em>see <em>id., </em>at 536, but it appears to have been an open question whether an assignment of the \u201c[b]are [r]igh[t] to [litigate\u201d would fail as \u201c[s]avouring\u201d of champerty and maintenance, see M. Smith, Law of Assignment: The Creation and Transfer of Choses in Action 318, 321 (2007). In order to sustain an assignment of the right to sue, the assignment had to include the transfer of a property interest to which the right of action was incident or subsidiary. <em>Id., </em>at 321-322; see also <em>Prosser </em>v. <em>Edmonds, </em>1 Y. &amp; C. Exch. 481, 160 Eng. Rep. 196 (1835); <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Burrell, </em>35 Beav. 257, 55 Eng. Rep. 894 (1866); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 1040h, pp. 234-235 (8th ed. 1861); R. Megarry &amp; R Baker, Snell\u2019s Principles of Equity 82 (25th ed. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">American courts as well understood the common-law rule to require a transfer of interest to the assignee \u2014 over and above the \u201cnaked right to bring a suit\u201d \u2014 that gave the assignee a \u201cvaluable right of property.\u201d <em>Traer </em>v. <em>Clews, </em>115 U. S. 528, 541 (1885). A New York court, surveying the English sources, concluded that \u201can assignment to the plaintiff of the assignor\u2019s right to maintain and prosecute an action for the specific performance of defendants\u2019 agreement, amounts to nothing more than an assertion that the assignor has undertaken to assign to the plaintiff a bare right to litigate for the former\u2019s benefit exclusively.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>1 Misc. 364, 367, 20 N. Y. S. 720, 722 (Ct. Common Pleas 1892). To secure standing in a court of equity, the court held, \u201cit must appear that the assignee\u2019s successful prosecution of the action is susceptible of <em>personal </em>enjoyment <em>by him </em>.. . .\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">So while there is no doubt that at common law, courts of law and equity sought ways of protecting the rights of assignees, they did not do so to the exclusion of the age-long objection to maintenance, which could be found when the assignee lacked a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the litigation. During the common-law period at least, it re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>mained an open question whether an assignee for collection, who by agreement took nothing from the suit, had a sufficient interest in the assigned debt to support his right to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">To be sure, the assignments at issue here purport to give respondents \u201call rights, title and interest\u201d in the payphone operators\u2019 claims for dial-around compensation. App. to Pet. for Cert. 114. But when severed from the right to retain any of the substantive recovery, it is not clear that common-law courts of law or equity would have treated the assigned right to litigate as incidental or subsidiary to the interest represented by the claim itself. Cf. 7 Holdsworth, <em>supra, </em>at 538 (\u201c[I]t was not till certain classes of rights . . . became more freely, assignable in equity, that it became necessary to distinguish between the cases in which assignment was permitted and cases in which it was not; and it is for this reason that we find very little clear authority on these questions till quite modern times\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">I do not take the majority\u2019s point to be that the common-law tradition supplies the answer to this question. As the majority concedes, it was not until the 19th century that \u201ccourts began to consider the specific question presented here.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 279. But even granting this starting point, the Court\u2019s recitation of the 19th-century tradition fails to account for the deep divergence in practice regarding the right of assignees with no stake in the substantive recovery to maintain an action in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The majority concedes that <em>\u201csome </em>States during this period of time refused to recognize assignee-for-collection suits,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 281, but that refusal was substantially more widespread than the majority acknowledges. See <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Deverill, </em>20 Wis. 142 (1865); <em>Bostwick </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>113 Ind. 448, 16 N. E. 378 (1888); <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>99 Ala. 483,12 So. 374 (1893); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ginn, </em>66 Ohio St. 316, 64 N. E. 123 (1902); <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Harford, </em>99 Me. 426, 59 A. 529 (1904); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Mask, </em>158 N. C. 436, 74 S. E. 343 (1912). These courts concluded that assignees having no legal or beneficial interest to vindicate could not sue on the assigned claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Several more States, including some enlisted by the majority, only eventually recognized the right of assignees for collection to sue after taking inconsistent positions on the issue. In fact, the rule regarding assignees for collection only was so unsettled that the Kansas Supreme Court reversed itself twice in the span of 19 years. Compare <em>Krapp </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>33 Kan. 106, 5 P. 372 (1885) (assignees for collection only may sue as the real party in interest), with <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Price, </em>64 Kan. 191, 67 P. 553 (1902) (assignees for collection only may not sue), with <em>Manley </em>v. <em>Park, </em>68 Kan. 400, 75 P. 557 (1904) (assignees for collection only may sue again). During this period, many other courts reversed course on the flinty problem posed by assignees for collection only. See <em>Hoagland </em>v. <em>Van Etten, </em>23 Neb. 462, 36 N. W. 755 (1888), overruled by <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Musick, </em>147 Neb. 1018, 25 N. W. 2d 908 (1947); <em>State ex rel. Freebourn </em>v. <em>Merchants\u2019 Credit Serv., Inc., </em>104 Mont. 76, 66 P. 2d 337 (1937), overruled by <em>Rae </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>112 Mont. 159, 114 P. 2d 1060 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The majority\u2019s survey of 19th-century judicial practice thus ignores a substantial contrary tradition during this period. That tradition makes clear that state courts <em>did not </em>regularly \u201centertai[n] suits virtually identical to the litigation before us.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 280. In reality, all that the majority\u2019s cases show is that the question whether assignees for collection could maintain an action in court was hotly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>tested \u2014 a live issue that spawned much litigation and diverse published decisions. The confusion was much remarked on by courts of this period, even those that ultimately sided with the Court\u2019s understanding of the prevailing practice. See, <em>e. g., Gomer </em>v. <em>Stockdale, </em>5 Colo. App. 489, 492, 39 P. 355, 356 (1895) (\u201cThere is much controversy in the various states respecting that almost universal code provision, that a suit must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest\u201d); <em>Compton </em>v. <em>Atwell, </em>207 F.\u20192d 139, 140-141 (CADC 1953) (\u201c[W]hether an assignee for collection only is the real party in interest... has produced a variance of judicial opinion\u201d and \u201chas so divided other courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Commentators have also called attention to the divergent practice. As the majority notes, John Norton Pomeroy observed that \u201cthere is some conflict\u201d on the question whether an assignee for collection obligated to \u201caccount for the whole proceeds ... is entitled to sue in his own name.\u201d Remedies and Remedial Rights \u00a7 132, p. 159 (1876) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Comment, The Real Party in Interest Rule Revitalized: Recognizing Defendant\u2019s Interest in the Determination of Proper Parties Plaintiff, 55 Cal. L. Rev. 1452, 1475 (1967) (\u201cNowhere do the courts manifest more confusion than in deciding whether an assignee for collection only is a real party in interest\u201d); Note, 51 Mich. L. Rev. 587, 588 (1953) (observing that \u201c[t]here is, however, little agreement among the courts as to the meaning and purpose of [real party in interest] provisions\u201d and noting that they have been construed \u201cto prevent the owner of the bare legal title to a chose in action from suing\u201d). Indeed, notable legal commentators of the period argued against permitting suits by assignees for collection. See, <em>e. g., </em>1 J. Kerr, Law of Pleading and Practice \u00a7 586, pp. 791-792 (1919) (\u201c[T]he party in whom the legal interest is vested is not always the real party in interest. The real party in interest\u2019 is the party who would be benefited or injured by the judgment in the cause. . . . The rule should be restricted to parties whose interests are in issue, and are to be affected by the decree\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>This unsettled and conflicting state of affairs is understandable given the transformation in the understanding of the common-law prohibition on suits by assignees with no beneficial interest. The immediate cause for this transformation was the merger of law and equity, and the creation of real party in interest provisions intended to reconcile the two forms of actions. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>44 N. Y. 228, 231 (1870) (noting that New York code provision allowing assignees to sue as the real party in interest \u201cabolishe[d] the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity\u201d); see <em>ante, </em>at 279. The fusion of law and equity forced courts to confront the novel question of what to do with assignees for collection only, who could not sue at law in their own name, and who could not recover on a bill in equity for the lack of any beneficial interest to enforce. Were such assignees, under the new system, real parties in interest who could bring suit? It is not surprising that courts took conflicting positions on this question, a question for which the historical tradition did not provide an answer. Given this, it is difficult to characterize a practice as showing what sort of cases and controversies were <em>\u201ctraditionally </em>amenable to . . . the judicial process,\u201d <em>Steel Co., </em>523 U. S., at 102 (emphasis added), when the practice was a self-conscious <em>break </em>in tradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In <em>Vermont Agency, </em>by contrast, the Court relied on a long and unbroken tradition of informer statutes that reached back to the 14th century and prevailed up to the \u201cperiod immediately before and after the framing of the Constitution.\u201d 529 U. S., at 776. The Court noted that the American Colonies \u201cpass[ed] several informer statutes expressly authorizing <em>qui tarn </em>suits,\u201d and that the First Congress itself \u201cenacted a considerable number of informer statutes.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This tradition provided relevant evidence of what the Framers in 1787 would have understood the terms \u201ccase\u201d and \u201ccontroversy\u201d to mean. See <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>307 U. S. 433, 460 (1939) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) (the Article III \u201c[j]udicial power could come into play only in matters that were the traditional concern of the courts at West<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>minster and only if they arose in ways that to the expert feel of lawyers constituted \u2018Cases\u2019 or \u2018Controversies\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">There is certainly no comparable tradition here. The belated innovations of the mid- to late-19th-century courts come too late to provide insight into the meaning of Article III. Although we have sometimes looked to cases postdating the founding era as evidence of common-law traditions, we have never done so when the courts self-consciously confronted novel questions arising from a break in the received tradition, or where the practice of later courts was so divergent. A belated and equivocal tradition cannot fill in for the fundamental requirements of Article III where, as here, those requirements are so plainly lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Nor do our own cases establish that we \u201clong ago indicated that assignees for collection only can properly bring suit.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 288. (If the majority truly believed that, one would expect the cases to be placed front and center in the Court\u2019s analysis, rather than as an afterthought.) None addressed the requirements of Article III, and so none constitutes binding precedent. See <em>Steel Co., supra, </em>at 91 (\u201c[D]rive-by jurisdictional rulings of this sort... have no precedential effect\u201d); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>518 U. S. 343, 352, n. 2 (1996) (\u201c[W]e have repeatedly held that the existence of unaddressed jurisdictional defects has no precedential effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>In <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Santa Cruz, </em>184 U. S. 302 (1902), we addressed the then-existing statutory provision that barred jurisdiction over suits \u201cimproperly or collusively made or joined ... for the purpose of creating a case cognizable or removable under this act.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 325. We held that a plaintiff who took legal title of multiple bonds \u201cfor purposes of collection\u201d could not satisfy the statute when the bonds individually did not meet the amount in controversy requirement. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court did not say that the \u201csuit <em>could </em>properly be brought in federal court,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 283, if the only objection was the limitation placed on the plaintiff\u2019s assignment; instead, the Court remarked that such a limited assignment would not violate the <em>statutory </em>prohibition on suits that are \u201cimproperly or collusively made or joined,\u201d <em>Waite, supra, </em>at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In <em>Spiller </em>v. <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co., </em>253 U. S. 117 (1920), the plaintiff, secretary of the Cattle Raisers\u2019 Association, sued to enforce an order of reparations issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which found that the defendant railroads had charged excessive shipping rates to the members of the association. The question before the Court was the validity of the lower court\u2019s ruling that the assignments to the plaintiff\u2014which reserved a beneficial interest in the assignors, the individual members of the association\u2014 did not vest legal title in the secretary \u201cso as [to] authorize the Commission to make the award of damages in his name.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 134. We concluded that the agency was authorized to issue the reparations order in the name of the plaintiff because the assignments were \u201cabsolute in form.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We then concluded that \u201cbeneficial or equitable title\u201d was not necessary for the plaintiff \u201cto claim an award of reparation\u201d and enforce that award in his own name in court. <em>Ibid. </em>In other words, the Court addressed merely the question whether it was appropriate for a federal agency (not bound by the constraints of Article III) to enter an award in the plaintiff\u2019s name. In no way did the Court endorse the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>of an assignee for collection to sue as an initial matter in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Nor did the Court address Article III standing requirements in <em>Titus </em>v. <em>Wallick, </em>306 U. S. 282 (1939). There, we found that an assignment \u201cfor purposes of suit,\u201d where the assignee had an obligation to account for the proceeds (in part) to another, did not render the assignment invalid under New York <em>state law. Id., </em>at 289. Thus, we held that the Ohio courts had failed to give full faith and credit to an earlier, valid New York court judgment. <em>Id., </em>at 292. If we had been presented with the Article III question, we would likely have found it significant that the plaintiff-assignee stood to take the balance of any recovery after the proceeds were used to discharge the debts of the assignor (plaintiff\u2019s brother) and the plaintiff\u2019s wife. <em>Id., </em>at 286. But in any event, the Court\u2019s conclusion that the assignment was valid under New York law, where the restrictions of Article III do not operate, does not support the view that suits by assignees for collection are permissible in federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">When we have looked to history to confirm our own Article III jurisdiction, we have relied on a firmly entrenched historical tradition that served to confirm the application of modern standing principles. See <em>Vermont Agency, </em>529 U. S., at 774-778. The Court\u2019s decision today illustrates the converse approach. It relies on an equivocal and contradictory tradition to override the clear application of the case-or-controversy requirement that would otherwise bar respondents\u2019 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">But perhaps we should heed the counsels of hope rather than despair. The majority, after all, purports to comply with our Article III precedents, see <em>ante, </em>at 285-287, so those precedents at least live to give meaning to \u201cthe judiciary\u2019s proper role in our system of government\u201d another day, <em>Raines, </em>521 U. S., at 818 (internal quotation marks omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>What is more, the majority expressly and repeatedly grounds its finding of standing on its conclusion that \u201chistory and precedent are clear\u201d that these types of suits \u201chave long been permitted,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 275, and that there is \u201ca strong tradition\u201d of such suits \u201cduring the past two centuries,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 285, 288. This conclusion is, for the reasons we have set forth, achingly wrong \u2014 but at least the articulated test is clear and daunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Finally, there is the majority\u2019s point that all this fuss could have been avoided for a dollar, see <em>ante, </em>at 289 \u2014 a price, by this point, that most readers would probably be happy to contribute. The price will be higher in future standing cases.

Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1548, pp. 373-374 (2d ed. 1990). A receiver \u201cis considered to be an officer of the court, and therefore not an agent of the parties, whose appointment is incident to other proceedings in which some form of primary relief is sought.\u201d 12 <em>id., </em>\u00a72981, at 9-10 (2d ed. 1997) (footnote omitted). Trustees hold legal title to the assets in the trust estate and have an independent fiduciary obligation to sue to preserve those assets. The trustee\u2019s discharge of its legal obligation is an independent, personal benefit that supports the trustee\u2019s standing to sue in federal court. The majority\u2019s response that assignees for collection only have a <em>\u201ccontractual </em>obligation to litigate,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 288, is unavailing, because the contractual obligation to sue and remit the proceeds of any recovery was a condition of the assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>ment of the claim in the first place. The majority\u2019s reasoning is perfectly circular: A suit pursuant to a contract to remit proceeds satisfies Article III because there is a contract to remit proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">In any event, the majority cannot dispute the point that suits by trustees, guardians ad litem, executors, and the like make up a settled, continuous practice \u201cof the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.\u201d <em>Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment, </em>523 U. S. 83, 102 (1998). As shown below, the same cannot be said for suits by assignees for collection only. See <em>infra, </em>at 309-312.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\"> Blaekstone defined maintenance as the \u201cofficious intermeddling in a suit that no way belongs to one, by maintaining or assisting either party with money or otherwise, to prosecute or defend it____ This is an offence against public justice, as it keeps alive strife and contention, and perverts the remedial process of the law into an engine of oppression.\u201d 4 W. Blaekstone, Commentaries *134-*135. Champerty \u201cis a species of maintenance, . . . being a bargain with a plaintiff or defendant <em>campum partite, </em>to divide the land or other matter sued for between them, if they prevail at law; whereupon the champertor is to carry on the party\u2019s suit at his own expense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at *135.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> The fact that a bankrupt assignor could sue at law to recover debts for the benefit of an assignee creditor, see <em>ante, </em>at 277 (citing <em>Winch </em>v. <em>Keeley, </em>1 T. R. 619, 99 Eng. Rep. 1284 (K. B. 1787)), says nothing about the issue in this case. It is of course true that one has standing to sue when the result of a favorable judgment will be the discharge of a debt or other legal obligation. The only legal obligation respondents seek to discharge is the obligation to remit the proceeds of the litigation to the payphone operators. But as explained above, a party lacking the independent right to direct the disposition of the proceeds cannot demonstrate the personal stake required to invoke the authority of an Article III court. See <em>supra, </em>at 304.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\"> The statutes from the American Colonies add nothing to the majority\u2019s historical argument. See <em>ante, </em>at 278-279. Exceptions (some created by statute) to the general rule against assignments at law arose early in the common-law period, including exceptions for executors and administrators of estates, assignees in bankruptcy, negotiable instruments, and assignments involving the sovereign. See 29 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 74:2, pp. 214-215 (4th ed. 2003). What none of these exceptions provides for, however, are suits brought by assignees for collection <em>only </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>assignees who have no share in the substantive recovery. Such assignees, as the majority acknowledges, did not attract the attention of courts until the 19th century. See <em>ante, </em>at 279.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
