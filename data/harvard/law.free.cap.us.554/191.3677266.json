See <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>430 U. S. 387, 398-399 (1977); <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>475 U. S. 625, 629, n. 3 (1986). The question here is whether attachment of the right also requires that a public prosecutor (as distinct from a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>officer) be aware of that initial proceeding or involved in its conduct. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Although petitioner Walter Rothgery has never been convicted of a felony,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a criminal background check disclosed an erroneous record that he had been, and on July 15, 2002, Texas police officers relied on this record to arrest him as a felon in possession of a firearm. The officers lacked a warrant, and so promptly brought Rothgery before a magistrate, as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 14.06(a) (Vernon Supp. 2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Texas law has no formal label for this initial appearance before a magistrate, see 41 G. Dix &amp; R. Dawson, Texas Practice Series: Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 15.01 (2d ed. 2001), which is sometimes called the \u201carticle 15.17 hearing,\u201d see, <em>e. g., Kirk </em>v. <em>State, </em>199 S. W. 3d 467, 476-477 (Tex. App. 2006); it combines the Fourth Amendment\u2019s required probable-cause determination<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with the setting of bail, and is the point at which the arrestee is formally apprised of the accusation against him, see Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 15.17(a) (Vernon Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Rothgery\u2019s article 15.17 hearing followed routine. The arresting officer submitted a sworn \u201cAffidavit Of Probable Cause\u201d that described the facts supporting the arrest and \u201ccharge[d] that. . . Rothgery . . . eommit[ted] the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon\u20143rd degree felony [Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 46.04],\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a. After reviewing the affidavit, the magistrate \u201cdetermined that probable cause existed for the arrest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 34a. The magistrate informed Rothgery of the accusation, set his bail at $5,000, and committed him to jail, from which he was released after posting a surety bond. The bond, which the Gillespie County deputy sheriff signed, stated that \u201cRothgery stands charged by complaint duly filed . . . with the offense of a . . . felony, to wit: Unlawful Possession of a Firearm by a Felon.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 39a. The release was conditioned on the defendant\u2019s personal appearance in trial court \u201cfor any and all subsequent proceedings that may be had relative to the said charge in the course of the criminal action based on said charge.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Rothgery had no money for a lawyer and made several oral and written requests for appointed counsel,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which went unheeded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The following January, he was indicted by a Texas grand jury for unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, resulting in rearrest the next day, and an order increasing bail to $15,000. When he could not post it, he was put in jail and remained there for three weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On January 23, 2003, six months after the article 15.17 hearing, Rothgery was finally assigned a lawyer, who promptly obtained a bail reduction (so Rothgery could get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>out of jail), and assembled the paperwork confirming that Rothgery had never been convicted of a felony. Counsel relayed this information to the district attorney, who in turn filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Rothgery then brought this 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 action against respondent Gillespie County (County), claiming that if the County had provided a lawyer within a reasonable time after the article 15.17 hearing, he would not have been indicted, rearrested, or jailed for three weeks. The County\u2019s failure is said to be owing to its unwritten policy of denying appointed counsel to indigent defendants out on bond until at least the entry of an information or indictment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rothgery sees this policy as violating his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The District Court granted summary judgment to the County, see 413 F. Supp. 2d 806, 807 (WD Tex. 2006), and the Court of Appeals affirmed, see 491 F. 3d 293, 294 (CA5 2007). The Court of Appeals felt itself bound by Circuit precedent, see <em>id., </em>at 296-297 (citing <em>Lomax </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>629 F. 2d 413 (CA5 1980), and <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>625 F. 2d 1206 (CA5 1980)), to the effect that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not attach at the article 15.17 hearing, because \u201cthe relevant prosecutors were not aware of or involved in Rothgery\u2019s arrest or appearance before the magistrate on July 16, 2002,\u201d and \u201c[t]here is also no indication that the officer who filed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>probable cause affidavit at Rothgery\u2019s appearance had any power to commit the state to prosecute without the knowledge or involvement of a prosecutor,\u201d 491 F. 3d, at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. 1061 (2007), and now vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The Sixth Amendment right of the \u201caccused\u201d to assistance of counsel in \u201call criminal prosecutions\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is limited by its terms: \u201cit does not attach until a prosecution is commenced.\u201d <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991); see also <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U. S. 412, 430 (1986). We have, for purposes of the right to counsel, pegged commencement to \u201c \u2018the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u2014 whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment,\u2019\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>467 U. S. 180, 188 (1984) (quoting <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U. S. 682, 689 (1972) (plurality opinion)). The rule is not \u201cmere formalism,\u201d but a recognition of the point at which \u201cthe government has committed itself to prosecute,\u201d \u201cthe adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified,\u201d and the accused \u201cfinds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.\u201d <em>Kirby, supra, </em>at 689. The issue is whether Texas\u2019s article 15.17 hearing marks that point, with the consequent state obligation to appoint counsel within a reasonable time once a request for assistance is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">When the Court of Appeals said no, because no prosecutor was aware of Rothgery\u2019s article 15.17 hearing or involved in it, the court effectively focused not on the start of adversar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ial judicial proceedings, but on the activities and knowledge of a particular state official who was presumably otherwise occupied. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">As the Court of Appeals recognized, see 491 F. 3d, at 298, we have twice held that the right to counsel attaches at the initial appearance before a judicial officer, see <em>Jackson, </em>475 U. S., at 629, n. 3; <em>Brewer, </em>430 U. S., at 399. This first time before a court, also known as the \u201c\u2018preliminary arraignment\u2019\u201d or \u201c\u2018arraignment on the complaint,\u2019\u201d see 1 W. La-Fave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 1.4(g), p. 135 (3d ed. 2007), is generally the hearing at which \u201cthe magistrate informs the defendant of the charge in the complaint, and of various rights in further proceedings,\u201d and \u201cdetermine[s] the conditions for pretrial release,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>Texas\u2019s article 15.17 hearing is an initial appearance: Rothgery was taken before a magistrate, informed of the formal accusation against him, and sent to jail until he posted bail. See <em>supra, </em>at 195-196.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Brewer </em>and <em>Jackson </em>control.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The <em>Brewer </em>defendant surrendered to the police after a warrant was out for his arrest on a charge of abduction. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>was then \u201carraigned before a judge ... on the outstanding arrest warrant,\u201d and at the arraignment, \u201c[t]he judge advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>[v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966),] rights and committed him to jail.\u201d <em>Brewer, </em>430 U. S., at 391. After this preliminary arraignment, and before an indictment on the abduction charge had been handed up, police elicited incriminating admissions that ultimately led to an indictment for first-degree murder. Because neither of the defendant\u2019s lawyers had been present when the statements were obtained, the Court found it \u201cclear\u201d that the defendant \u201cwas deprived of. . . the right to the assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 397-398. In plain terms, the Court said that \u201c[t]here can be no doubt in the present case that judicial proceedings had been initiated\u201d before the defendant made the incriminating statements. <em>Id., </em>at 399. Although it noted that the State had conceded the issue, the Court nevertheless held that the defendant\u2019s right had clearly attached for the reason that \u201c[a] warrant had been issued for his arrest, he had been arraigned on that warrant before a judge in a ... courtroom, and he had been committed by the court to confinement in jail.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>In <em>Jackson, </em>the Court was asked to revisit the question whether the right to counsel attaches at the initial appearance, and we had no more trouble answering it the second time around. <em>Jackson </em>was actually two consolidated cases, and although the State conceded that respondent Jackson\u2019s arraignment \u201crepresented the initiation of formal legal proceedings,\u201d 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3, it argued that the same was not true for respondent Bladel. In briefing us, the State explained that \u201c[i]n Michigan, any person charged with a felony, after arrest, must be brought before a Magistrate or District Court Judge without unnecessary delay for his initial arraignment.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bladel, </em>O. T. 1985, No. 84-1539, p. 24. The State noted that \u201c[w]hile [Bladel] had been arraigned . . . , there is also a second arraignment in Michigan procedure ... , at which time defendant has his first opportunity to enter a plea in a court with jurisdiction to render a final decision in a felony case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 25. The State contended that only the latter proceeding, the \u201carraignment on the information or indictment,\u201d Y. Kamisar, W. LaFave, J. Israel, <em>&amp; </em>N. King, Modern Criminal Procedure 28 (9th ed. 1999) (emphasis deleted), should trigger the Sixth Amendment right.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ant\u2019s rights,\u201d the State insisted, \u201care fully protected in the context of custodial interrogation between initial arraignment and preliminary examination by the Fifth Amendment right to counsel\u201d and by the preliminary examination itself.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Bladel </em>Brief, <em>supra, </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We flatly rejected the distinction between initial arraignment and arraignment on the indictment, the State\u2019s argument being \u201cuntenable\u201d in light of the \u201cclear language in our decisions about the significance of arraignment.\u201d <em>Jackson, supra, </em>at 629, n. 3. The conclusion was driven by the same considerations the Court had endorsed in <em>Brewer: </em>by the time a defendant is brought before a judicial officer, is informed of a formally lodged accusation, and has restrictions imposed on his liberty in aid of the prosecution, the State\u2019s relationship with the defendant has become solidly adversarial. And that is just as true when the proceeding comes before the indictment (in the case of the initial arraignment on a formal complaint) as when it comes after it (at an arraignment on an indictment).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>399 U. S. 1, 8 (1970) (plurality opinion) (right to counsel applies at preindictment preliminary hearing at which the \u201csole purposes . . . are to determine whether there is sufficient evidence against the accused to warrant presenting his case to the grand jury, and, if so, to fix bail if the offense is bailable\u201d); cf. <em>Owen </em>v. <em>State, </em>596 So. 2d 985, 989, n. 7 (Fla. 1992) (\u201cThe term \u2018arraign\u2019 simply means to be called before a court officer and charged with a crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Our latest look at the significance of the initial appearance was <em>McNeil, </em>501 U. S. 171, which is no help to the County. In <em>McNeil, </em>the State had conceded that the right to counsel attached at the first appearance before a county court commissioner, who set bail and scheduled a preliminary examination. See <em>id., </em>at 173; see also <em>id., </em>at 175 (\u201cIt is undisputed, and we accept for purposes of the present case, that at the time petitioner provided the incriminating statements at issue, his Sixth Amendment right had attached . . . \u201d). But we did more than just accept the concession; we went on to reaffirm that \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at the first formal proceeding against an accused,\u201d and observed that \u201cin most States, at least with respect to serious offenses, free counsel is made available at that time . .. .\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 180-181.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">That was 17 years ago, the same is true today, and the overwhelming consensus practice conforms to the rule that the first formal proceeding is the point of attachment. We are advised without contradiction that not only the Federal Government, including the District of Columbia, but 43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>States take the first step toward appointing counsel \u201cbefore, at, or just after initial appearance.\u201d App. to Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>1a; see <em>id., </em>at la-7a (listing jurisdictions);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Brief for American Bar Association as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>5-8 (describing the ABA\u2019s position for the past 40 years that counsel should be appointed \u201ccertainly no later than the accused\u2019s initial appearance before a judicial officer\u201d). And even in the remaining seven States (Alabama, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia) the practice is not free of ambiguity. See App. to Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>5a-7a (suggesting that the practice in Alabama, Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia might actually be consistent with the majority approach); see also n. 7, <em>supra. </em>In any event, to the extent these States have been denying appointed counsel on the heels of the first appearance, they are a distinct minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The only question is whether there may be some arguable justification for the minority practice. Neither the Court of Appeals in its opinion, nor the County in its briefing to us, has offered an acceptable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The Court of Appeals thought <em>Brewer </em>and <em>Jackson </em>could be distinguished on the ground that \u201cneither case addressed the issue of prosecutorial involvement,\u201d and the cases were thus \u201cneutral on the point,\u201d 491 F. 3d, at 298. With <em>Brewer </em>and <em>Jackson </em>distinguished, the court then found itself bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>by Circuit precedent that \u201c \u2018an adversary criminal proceeding has not begun in a case where the prosecution officers are unaware of either the charges or the arrest.\u2019 \u201d 491 F. 3d, at 297 (quoting <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>625 F. 3d 1206, 1208 (CA5 1980)). Under this standard of prosecutorial awareness, attachment depends not on whether a first appearance has begun adversary judicial proceedings, but on whether the prosecutor had a hand in starting it. That standard is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Neither <em>Brewer </em>nor <em>Jackson </em>said a word about the prosecutor\u2019s involvement as a relevant fact, much less a controlling one. Those cases left no room for the factual enquiry the Court of Appeals would require, and with good reason: an attachment rule that turned on determining the moment of a prosecutor\u2019s first involvement would be \u201cwholly unworkable and impossible to administer,\u201d <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478, 496 (1964) (White, J., dissenting), guaranteed to bog the courts down in prying enquiries into the communication between police (who are routinely present at defendants\u2019 first appearances) and the State\u2019s attorneys (who are not), see Brief for Petitioner 39-41. And it would have the practical effect of resting attachment on such absurd distinctions as the day of the month an arrest is made, see Brief for Brennan Center of Justice et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>10 (explaining that \u201cjails may be required to report their arrestees to county prosecutor offices on particular days\u201d (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 2.19 (Vernon 2005))); or \u201cthe sophistication, or lack thereof, of a jurisdiction\u2019s computer intake system,\u201d Brief for Brennan Center, <em>supra, </em>at 11; see also <em>id., </em>at 10-12 (noting that only \u201c[s]ome Texas counties . . . have computer systems that provide arrest and detention information simultaneously to prosecutors, law enforcement officers, jail personnel, and clerks. Prosecutors in these jurisdictions use the systems to pre-screen cases early in the process before an initial appearance\u201d (citing D. Carmichael, M. Gilbert, &amp; M. Voloudakis, Texas A&amp;M U., Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Policy Research Inst., Evaluating the Impact of Direct Electronic Filing in Criminal Cases: Closing the Paper Trap 2-3 (2006), online at http://www.courts.state.tx.us/tfid/pdf/ FinalReport7-12-06wackn. pdf (as visited June 19, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file))).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">It is not that the Court of Appeals believed that any such regime would be desirable, but it thought originally that its rule was implied by this Court\u2019s statement that the right attaches when the government has \u201ccommitted itself to prosecute.\u201d <em>Kirby, </em>406 U. S., at 689 (plurality opinion). The Court of Appeals reasoned that because \u201cthe decision not to prosecute is the quintessential function of a prosecutor\u201d under Texas law, 491 F. 3d, at 297 (internal quotation marks omitted), the State could not commit itself to prosecution until the prosecutor signaled that it had.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">But what counts as a commitment to prosecute is an issue of federal law unaffected by allocations of power among state officials under a State\u2019s law, cf. <em>Moran, </em>475 U. S., at 429, n. 3 (\u201c[T]he type of circumstances that would give rise to the right would certainly have a federal definition\u201d), and under the federal standard, an accusation filed with a judicial officer is sufficiently formal, and the government\u2019s commitment to prosecute it sufficiently concrete, when the accusation prompts arraignment and restrictions on the accused\u2019s liberty to facilitate the prosecution, see <em>Jackson, </em>475 U. S., at 629, n. 3; <em>Brewer, </em>430 U. S., at 399; <em>Kirby, supra, </em>at 689 (plurality opinion); see also n. 9, <em>supra. </em>From that point on, the defendant is \u201cfaced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law\u201d that define his capacity and control his actual ability to defend himself against a formal accusation that he is a criminal. <em>Kirby, supra, </em>at 689 (plurality opinion). By that point, it is too late to wonder whether he is \u201caccused\u201d within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and it makes no practical sense to deny it. See Grano, <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis: </em>A Need to Reconsider the Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tional Premises Underlying the Law of Confessions, 17 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1, 31 (1979) (\u201c[I]t would defy common sense to say that a criminal prosecution has not commenced against a defendant who, perhaps incarcerated and unable to afford judicially imposed bail, awaits preliminary examination on the authority of a charging document filed by the prosecutor, less typically by the police, and approved by a court of law\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). All of this is equally true whether the machinery of prosecution was turned on by the local police or the state attorney general. In this case, for example, Rothgery alleges that after the initial appearance, he was \u201cunable to find any employment for wages\u201d because \u201call of the potential employers he contacted knew or learned of the criminal charge pending against him.\u201d Original Complaint in No. 1:04-CV-00456-LY (WD Tex., July 15, 2004), p. 5. One may assume that those potential employers would still have declined to make job offers if advised that the county prosecutor had not filed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The County resists this logic with the argument that in considering the significance of the initial appearance, we must ignore prejudice to a defendant\u2019s pretrial liberty, reasoning that it is the concern, not of the right to counsel, but of the speedy-trial right and the Fourth Amendment. See Brief for Respondent 47-51. And it cites <em>Gouveia, </em>467 U. S. 180, in support of its contention. See Brief for Respondent 49; see also Brief for State of Texas et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>8-9. We think the County\u2019s reliance on <em>Gouveia </em>is misplaced, and its argument mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The defendants in <em>Gouveia </em>were prison inmates, suspected of murder, who had been placed in an administrative detention unit and denied counsel up until an indictment was filed. Although no formal judicial proceedings had taken place prior to the indictment, see 467 U. S., at 185, the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>argued that their administrative detention should be treated as an accusation for purposes of the right to counsel because the Government was actively investigating the crimes. We recognized that \u201cbecause an inmate suspected of a crime is already in prison, the prosecution may have little incentive promptly to bring formal charges against him, and that the resulting preindictment delay may be particularly prejudicial to the inmate,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 192, but we noted that statutes of limitation and protections of the Fifth Amendment guarded against delay, and that there was no basis for \u201cdeparting] from our traditional interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in order to provide additional protections for [the inmates],\u201d <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Gouveia\u2019s holding that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached has no application here. For one thing, <em>Gouveia </em>does not affect the conclusion we reaffirmed two years later in <em>Jackson, </em>that bringing a defendant before a court for initial appearance signals a sufficient commitment to prosecute and marks the start of adversary judicial proceedings. (Indeed, <em>Jackson </em>refutes the County\u2019s argument that Fifth Amendment protections at the early stage obviate attachment of the Sixth Amendment right at initial appearance. See <em>supra, </em>at 201-202.) And since we are not asked to extend the right to counsel to a point earlier than formal judicial proceedings (as in <em>Gouveia), </em>but to defer it to those proceedings in which a prosecutor is involved, <em>Gouveia </em>does not speak to the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The County also tries to downplay the significance of the initial appearance by saying that an attachment rule unqualified by prosecutorial involvement would lead to the conclusion \u201cthat the State has statutorily committed to prosecute <em>every </em>suspect arrested by the police,\u201d given that \u201cstate law requires [an article 15.17 hearing] for every arrestee.\u201d Brief for Respondent 24 (emphasis in original). The answer, though, is that the State has done just that, subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>option to change its official mind later. The State may rethink its commitment at any point: it may choose not to seek indictment in a felony case, say, or the prosecutor may enter <em>nolle prosequi </em>after the case gets to the jury room. But without a change of position, a defendant subject to accusation after initial appearance is headed for trial and needs to get a lawyer working, whether to attempt to avoid that trial or to be ready with a defense when the trial date arrives.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">A third tack on the County\u2019s part, slightly different from the one taken by the Fifth Circuit, gets it no further. The County stipulates that \u201cthe properly formulated test is not . . . merely whether prosecutors have had any involvement in the case whatsoever, but instead whether the State has objectively committed itself to prosecute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 31. It then informs us that \u201c[pjrosecutorial involvement is merely one form of evidence of such commitment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Other sufficient evidentiary indications are variously described: first (expansively) as \u201cthe filing of formal charges ... by information, indictment or formal complaint, or the holding of an adversarial preliminary hearing to determine probable cause to file such charges,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>(citing <em>Kirby, </em>406 U. S., at 689 (plurality opinion)); then (restrictively) as a court appearance following \u201carrest ... on an indictment or information,\u201d Brief for Respondent 32. Either version, in any event, runs up against <em>Brewer </em>and <em>Jackson: </em>an initial appearance following a charge signifies a sufficient commitment to prosecute regardless of a prosecutor\u2019s participation, indictment, information, or what the County calls a \u201cformal\u201d complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">So the County is reduced to taking aim at those cases. <em>Brewer </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>we are told, are \u201cvague\u201d and thus of \u201climited, if any, precedential value.\u201d Brief for Respondent 33, 35; see also <em>id., </em>at 32, n. 13 (asserting that <em>Brewer </em>and <em>Jackson </em>\u201cneither provide nor apply an analytical frame<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>work for determining attachment\u201d). And, according to the County, our cases <em>(Brewer </em>and <em>Jackson </em>aside) actually establish a \u201cgeneral rule that the right to counsel attaches at the point that [what the County calls] formal charges are filed,\u201d Brief for Respondent 19, with exceptions allowed only in the case of \u201ca very limited set of specific preindictment situations,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 23. The County suggests that the latter category should be limited to those appearances at which the aid of counsel is urgent and \u201c 'the dangers to the accused of proceeding without counsel\u2019 \u201d are great. <em>Id., </em>at 28 (quoting <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>487 U. S. 285, 298 (1988)). Texas\u2019s article 15.17 hearing should not count as one of those situations, the County says, because it is not of critical significance, since it \u201callows no presentation of witness testimony and provides no opportunity to expose weaknesses in the government\u2019s evidence, create a basis for later impeachment, or even engage in basic discovery.\u201d Brief for Respondent 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We think the County is wrong both about the clarity of our cases and the substance that we find clear. Certainly it is true that the Court in <em>Brewer </em>and <em>Jackson </em>saw no need for lengthy disquisitions on the significance of the initial appearance, but that was because it found the attachment issue an easy one. The Court\u2019s conclusions were not vague; <em>Brewer </em>expressed \u201cno doubt\u201d that the right to counsel attached at the initial appearance, 430 U. S., at 399, and <em>Jackson </em>said that the opposite result would be \u201cuntenable,\u201d 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">If, indeed, the County had simply taken the cases at face value, it would have avoided the mistake of merging the attachment question (whether formal judicial proceedings have begun) with the distinct \u201ccritical stage\u201d question (whether counsel must be present at a postattachment proceeding unless the right to assistance is validly waived). Attachment occurs when the government has used the judicial machinery to signal a commitment to prosecute as spelled out in <em>Brewer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>and <em>Jackson. </em>Once attachment occurs, the accused at least<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is entitled to the presence of appointed counsel during any \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the postattachment proceedings; what makes a stage critical is what shows the need for counsel\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, counsel must be appointed within a reasonable time after attachment to allow for adequate representation at any critical stage before trial, as well as at trial itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The County thus makes an analytical mistake in its assumption that attachment necessarily requires the occurrence or imminence of a critical stage. See Brief for Respondent 28-30. On the contrary, it is irrelevant to attachment that the presence of counsel at an article 15.17 hearing, say, may not be critical, just as it is irrelevant that counsel\u2019s presence may not be critical when a prosecutor walks over to the trial court to file an information. As we said in <em>Jackson, </em>\u201c[t]he question whether arraignment signals the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings ... is distinct from the question whether the arraignment itself is a critical stage requiring the presence of counsel.\u201d 475 U. S., at 630, n. 3. Texas\u2019s article 15.17 hearing plainly signals attachment, even if it is not itself a critical stage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Our holding is narrow. We do not decide whether the 6-month delay in appointment of counsel resulted in prejudice to Rothgery\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, and have no occasion to consider what standards should apply in deciding this. We merely reaffirm what we have held before and what an overwhelming majority of American jurisdictions understand in practice: a criminal defendant\u2019s initial appearance before a judicial officer, where he learns the charge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction, marks the start of adversary judicial proceedings that trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Because the Fifth Circuit came to a different conclusion on this threshold issue, its judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\"> \u201c[F]elony charges . . . had been dismissed after Rothgery completed a diversionary program, and both sides agree that [he] did not have a felony conviction.\u201d 491 F. 3d 293, 294 (CA5 2007) (case below).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-9\"> A separate article of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure requires prompt presentment in the case of arrests under warrant as well.

See 491 F. 3d, at 295, n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\"> Rothgery does not challenge the County\u2019s written policy for appointment of counsel, but argues that the County was not following that policy in practice.

See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 1.051(j) (Vernon Supp. 2007). See also Brief for Texas Association of Counties et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>13 (asserting that Rothgery \u201cwas statutorily entitled to the appointment of counsel within three days after having requested it\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\"> The Sixth Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> The Court of Appeals did not resolve whether the arresting officer\u2019s formal accusation would count as a \u201cformal complaint\u201d under Texas state law. See 491 F. 3d, at 298-300 (noting the confusion in the Texas state courts). But it rightly acknowledged (albeit in considering the separate question whether the complaint was a \u201cformal charge\u201d) that the constitutional significance of judicial proceedings cannot be allowed to founder on the vagaries of state criminal law, lest the attachment rule be rendered utterly \u201cvague and unpredictable.\u201d <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>553 U. S. 164, 175 (2008). See 491 F. 3d, at 300 (\u201c[W]e are reluctant to rely on the formalistic question of whether the affidavit here would be considered a \u2018complaint\u2019 or its functional equivalent under Texas case law and Article 15.04 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedures \u2014 a question to which the answer is itself uncertain. Instead, we must look to the specific circumstances of this case and the nature of the affidavit filed at Rothgery\u2019s appearance before the magistrate\u201d (footnote omitted)). What counts is that the complaint filed with the magistrate accused Rothgery of committing a particular crime and prompted the judicial officer to take legal action in response (here, to set the terms of bail and order the defendant locked up).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b228-5\"> The dissent says that <em>\u201cBrewer\u2019s </em>attachment holding is indisputably no longer good law\u201d because \u201cwe have subsequently held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is \u201c'offense specific,\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>post, </em>at 230 (opinion of Thomas, J.)

It is true that <em>Brewer </em>appears to have assumed that attachment of the right with respect to the abduction charge should prompt attachment for the murder charge as well. But the accuracy of the dissent\u2019s assertion ends there, for nothing in <em>Cobb\u2019s </em>conclusion that the right is offense specific casts doubt on <em>Brewer\u2019s </em>separate, emphatic holding that the initial appearance marks the point at which the right attaches. Nor does <em>Cobb </em>reflect, as the dissent suggests, see <em>post, </em>at 230-231, a more general disapproval of our opinion in <em>Brewer. </em>While <em>Brewer </em>failed even to acknowledge the issue of offense specificity, it spoke clearly and forcefully about attachment. <em>Cobb </em>merely declined to follow <em>Brewer\u2019s </em>unmentioned assumption, and thus it lends no support to the dissent\u2019s claim that we should ignore what <em>Brewer </em>explicitly said.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b229-5\"> The State continued to press this contention at oral argument.

In Texas, the defendant is notified of his right to a preliminary hearing, which in Texas is called an \u201cexamining trial,\u201d at the article 15.17 hearing. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 15.17(a). The examining trial in Texas is optional only, and the defendant must affirmatively request it. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> The County, in its brief to this Court, suggests that although <em>Brewer </em>and <em>Jackson </em>spoke of attachment at the initial appearance, the cases might actually have turned on some unmentioned fact. As to <em>Brewer, </em>the County speculates that an information might have been filed before the defendant\u2019s initial appearance. See Brief for Respondent 34-36. But as Rothgery points out, the initial appearance in <em>Brewer </em>was made in municipal court, and a felony information could not have been filed there. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 11. As to <em>Jackson, </em>the County suggests that the Court might have viewed Michigan\u2019s initial arraignment as a significant proceeding only because the defendant could make a statement at that hearing, and because respondent Bladel did in fact purport to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>a plea of not guilty. See Brief for Respondent 36-37. But this attempt to explain <em>Jackson </em>as a narrow holding is impossible to square with <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>sweeping rejection of the State\u2019s claims. It is further undermined by the fact that the magistrate in Bladel\u2019s case, like the one in Texas\u2019s article 15.17 hearing, had no jurisdiction to accept a plea of guilty to a felony charge.

As I interpret our precedents, the term \u201cattach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ment\u201d signifies nothing more than the beginning of the defendant\u2019s prosecution. It does not mark the beginning of a substantive entitlement to the assistance of counsel. I write separately to elaborate on my understanding of the term \u201cattachment\u201d and its relationship to the Amendment\u2019s substantive guarantee of \u201cthe Assistance of Counsel for [the] defence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The Sixth Amendment provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d The Amendment thus defines the scope of the right to counsel in three ways: It provides <em>who </em>may assert the right (\u201cthe accused\u201d); <em>when </em>the right may be asserted (\u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions\u201d); and <em>what </em>the right guarantees (\u201cthe right... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">It is in the context of interpreting the Amendment\u2019s answer to the second of these questions\u2014when the right may be asserted\u2014that we have spoken of the right \u201cattaching.\u201d In <em>Kirby </em>v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 688 (1972), a plurality of the Court explained that \u201ca person\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him.\u201d A majority of the Court elaborated on that explanation in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>434 U. S. 220 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\u201cIn <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>the plurality opinion made clear that the right to counsel announced in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>attaches only to corporeal identifications conducted at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u2014whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment. This is so because the initiation of such proceedings marks the commencement of the \u2018criminal prosecutions\u2019 to which alone the explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable. Thus, in <em>Kirby </em>the plurality held that the prosecution\u2019s evidence of a robbery victim\u2019s one-on-one stationhouse identification of an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>counseled suspect shortly after the suspect\u2019s arrest was admissible because adversary judicial criminal proceedings had not yet been initiated.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 226-227 (some internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">When we wrote in <em>Kirby </em>and <em>Moore </em>that the Sixth Amendment right had \u201cattached,\u201d we evidently meant nothing more than that a \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n]\u201d had begun. Our cases have generally used the term in that narrow fashion. See <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>532 U. S. 162, 167 (2001); <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991); <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>494 U. S. 344, 353 (1990); <em>Satterwhite </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>486 U. S. 249, 254-255 (1988); <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>475 U. S. 625, 629, and n. 3 (1986); <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U. S. 412, 428 (1986); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>467 U. S. 180, 188 (1984); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U. S. 477, 480, n. 7 (1981); <em>Doggett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>505 U. S. 647, 663, n. 2 (1992) (Thomas, J., dissenting); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>487 U. S. 285, 303-304 (1988) (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>413 U. S. 300, 322 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment). But see <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>451 U. S. 454, 469 (1981) (\u201c[W]e have held that the right to counsel granted by the Sixth Amendment means that a person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him ...\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>430 U. S. 387, 398 (1977) (\u201c[T]he right to counsel granted by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments means at least that a person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him .. . \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Because pretrial criminal procedures vary substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, there is room for disagreement about when a \u201cprosecution\u201d begins for Sixth Amendment purposes. As the Court notes, however, we have previously held that \u201carraignments\u201d that were functionally indistinguishable from the Texas magistration marked the point at which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201cattached.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>at 198-199 (discussing <em>Jackson, supra, </em>and <em>Brewer, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">It does not follow, however, and I do not understand the Court to hold, that the county had an obligation to appoint an attorney to represent petitioner within some specified period after his magistration. To so hold, the Court would need to do more than conclude that petitioner\u2019s criminal prosecution had begun. It would also need to conclude that the assistance of counsel in the wake of a Texas magistration is part of the substantive guarantee of the Sixth Amendment. That question lies beyond our reach, petitioner having never sought our review of it. See Pet. for Cert. i (inviting us to decide whether the Fifth Circuit erred in concluding \u201cthat adversary judicial proceedings . . . had not commenced, and petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights had not attached\u201d). To recall the framework laid out earlier, we have been asked to address only the <em>when </em>question, not the <em>what </em>question. Whereas the temporal scope of the right is defined by the words \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\u201d the right\u2019s substantive guarantee flows from a different textual font: the words \u201cAssistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In interpreting this latter phrase, we have held that \u201cdefence\u201d means defense at trial, not defense in relation to other objectives that may be important to the accused. See <em>Gouveia, supra, </em>at 190 (\u201c[T]he right to counsel exists to protect the accused during trial-type confrontations with the prosecutor . . . \u201d); <em>Ash, supra, </em>at 309 (\u201c[T]he core purpose of the counsel guarantee was to assure \u2018Assistance\u2019 at trial . . . \u201d). We have thus rejected the argument that the Sixth Amendment entitles the criminal defendant to the assistance of appointed counsel at a probable-cause hearing. See <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U. S. 103, 122-123 (1975) (observing that the Fourth Amendment hearing \u201cis addressed only to pretrial custody\u201d and has an insubstantial effect on the defendant\u2019s trial rights). More generally, we have rejected the notion that the right to counsel entitles the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>to a \u201cpreindictment private investigator.\u201d <em>Gouveia, supra, </em>at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">At the same time, we have recognized that certain pretrial events may so prejudice the outcome of the defendant\u2019s prosecution that, as a practical matter, the defendant must be represented at those events in order to enjoy genuinely effective assistance at trial. See, <em>e. g., Ash, supra, </em>at 309-310; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967). Thus, we have held that an indigent defendant is entitled to the assistance of appointed counsel at a preliminary hearing if \u201csubstantial prejudice . . . inheres in the . . . confrontation\u201d and \u201ccounsel [may] help avoid that prejudice.\u201d <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>399 U. S. 1, 9 (1970) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>White </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 59, 60 (1963) <em>(per curiam). </em>We have also held that the assistance of counsel is guaranteed at a pretrial lineup, since \u201cthe confrontation compelled by the State between the accused and the victim or witnesses to a crime to elicit identification evidence is peculiarly riddled with innumerable dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even crucially, derogate from a fair trial.\u201d <em>Wade, supra, </em>at 228. Other \u201ccritical stages\u201d of the prosecution include pretrial interrogation, a pretrial psychiatric exam, and certain kinds of arraignments. See <em>Harvey, supra, </em>at 358, n. 4 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>Estelle, supra, </em>at 470-471; <em>Coleman, supra, </em>at 7-8 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Weaving together these strands of authority, I interpret the Sixth Amendment to require the appointment of counsel only after the defendant\u2019s prosecution has begun, and then only as necessary to guarantee the defendant effective assistance at trial. Cf. <em>McNeil, supra, </em>at 177-178 (\u201cThe purpose of the Sixth Amendment counsel guarantee \u2014 and hence the purpose of invoking it \u2014 is to protec[t] the unaided layman at critical confrontations with his expert adversary, the government, <em>after </em>the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified with respect to a particular alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>crime\u201d (emphasis and alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted)). It follows that defendants in Texas will not necessarily be entitled to the assistance of counsel within some specified period after their magistrations. See <em>ante, </em>at 212 (opinion of the Court) (pointing out the \u201canalytical mistake\u201d of assuming \u201cthat attachment necessarily requires the occurrence or imminence of a critical stage\u201d). Texas counties need only appoint counsel as far in advance of trial, and as far in advance of any pretrial \u201ccritical stage,\u201d as necessary to guarantee effective assistance at trial. Cf. <em>ibid. </em>(\u201c[C]ounsel must be appointed within a reasonable time after attachment <em>to allow for adequate representation at any critical stage before trial, as well as at trial itself </em>\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The Court expresses no opinion on whether Gillespie County satisfied that obligation in this case. Petitioner has asked us to decide only the limited question whether his magistration marked the beginning of his \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n]\u201d within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Because I agree with the Court\u2019s resolution of that limited question, I join its opinion in full.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b246-6\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"A6u\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The Court holds today \u2014 for the first time after plenary consideration of the question \u2014 that a criminal prosecution begins, and that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel therefore attaches, when an individual who has been placed under arrest makes an initial appearance before a magistrate for a probable-cause determination and the setting of bail. Because the Court\u2019s holding is not supported by the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment or any reasonable interpretation of our precedents, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">The Sixth Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d The text of the Sixth Amendment thus makes clear that the right to counsel arises only upon initiation of a \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n].\u201d For that reason, the Court has repeatedly stressed that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel \u201cdoes not attach until a prosecution is commenced.\u201d <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>467 U. S. 180, 188 (1984) (\u201c[T]he literal language of the Amendment . . . requires the existence of both a \u2018criminal prosecutio[n]\u2019 and an \u2018accused\u2019 \u201d). Echoing this refrain, the Court today reiterates that \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment right of the \u2018accused\u2019 to assistance of counsel in \u2018all criminal prosecutions\u2019 is limited by its terms.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 198 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Given the Court\u2019s repeated insistence that the right to counsel is textually limited to \u201ccriminal prosecutions,\u201d one would expect the Court\u2019s jurisprudence in this area to be grounded in an understanding of what those words meant when the Sixth Amendment was adopted. Inexplicably, however, neither today\u2019s decision nor any of the other numerous decisions in which the Court has construed the right to counsel has attempted to discern the original meaning of \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n].\u201d I think it appropriate to examine what a \u201ccriminal proseeutio[n]\u201d would have been understood to entail by those who adopted the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">There is no better place to begin than with Blackstone, \u201cwhose works constituted the preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation.\u201d <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>527 U. S. 706, 715 (1999). Blackstone devoted more than 100 pages of his Commentaries on the Laws of England to a discussion of the \u201cregular and ordinary method of proceeding in the courts of criminal jurisdiction.\u201d 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *289 (hereinafter Blackstone).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">At the outset of his discussion, Blackstone organized the various stages of a criminal proceeding \u201cunder twelve gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>eral heads, following each other in a progressive order.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The first six relate to pretrial events: \u201c1. Arrest; 2. Commitment and bail; 3. <em>Prosecution; </em>4. Process; 5. Arraignment, and it\u2019s incidents; 6. Plea, and issue.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the first significant fact is that Blackstone did not describe the entire criminal process as a \u201cprosecution,\u201d but rather listed prosecution as the third step in a list of successive stages. For a more complete understanding of what Blackstone meant by \u201cprosecution,\u201d however, we must turn to chapter 23, entitled \u201cOf the Several Modes of Prosecution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at *301. There, Blackstone explained that \u2014 after arrest and examination by a justice of the peace to determine whether a suspect should be discharged, committed to prison, or admitted to bail, <em>id., </em>at *296 \u2014 the \u201cnext step towards the punishment of offenders is their <em>prosecution, or the manner of their formal </em>accusation,\u201d <em>id., </em>at *301 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Blackstone thus provides a definition of \u201cprosecution\u201d: the manner of an offender\u2019s \u201cformal accusation.\u201d The modifier \u201cformal\u201d is significant because it distinguishes \u201cprosecution\u201d from earlier stages of the process involving a different kind of accusation: the allegation of criminal conduct necessary to justify arrest and detention. Blackstone\u2019s discussion of arrest, commitment, and bail makes clear that a person could not be arrested and detained without a \u201ccharge\u201d or \u201caccusation,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>an allegation, supported by probable cause, that the person had committed a crime. See <em>id., </em>at *289-*3Q0. But the accusation justifying arrest and detention was clearly preliminary to the \u201cformal accusation\u201d that Blackstone identified with \u201cprosecution.\u201d See <em>id., </em>at *290, *318.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">By \u201cformal accusation,\u201d Blackstone meant, in most cases, \u201cindictment, the most usual and effectual means of prosecution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at *302. Blackstone defined an \u201cindictment\u201d as \u201ca written accusation of one or more persons of a crime or misdemeanor, preferred to, and presented upon oath by, a grand jury.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis deleted). If the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>was \u201csatisfied of the truth of the accusation,\u201d it endorsed the indictment, <em>id., </em>at *305-*306, which was then \u201cpublicly delivered into court,\u201d <em>id., </em>at *306, \u201cafterwards to be tried and determined,\u201d <em>id., </em>at *303, \u201cbefore an officer having power to punish the [charged] offence,\u201d 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1771).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In addition to indictment, Blackstone identified two other \u201cmethods of prosecution at the suit of the king.\u201d 4 Blackstone *312. The first was presentment, which, like an indictment, was a grand jury\u2019s formal accusation \u201cof an offence, inquirable in the Court where it [was] presented.\u201d 5 G. Jacob, The Law-Dictionary 278-279 (1811). The principal difference was that the accusation arose from \u201cthe notice taken by a grand jury of any offence from their own knowledge or observation\u201d rather than from a \u201cbill of indictment laid before them.\u201d 4 Blackstone *301. The second was information, \u201cthe only species of proceeding at the suit of the king, without a previous indictment or presentment by a grand jury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at *308. After an information was filed, it was \u201ctried,\u201d <em>id., </em>at *309, in the same way as an indictment: \u201cThe same notice was given, the same process was issued, the same pleas were allowed, the same trial by jury was had, the same judgment was given by the same judges, as if the prosecution had originally been by indictment,\u201d <em>id., </em>at *310.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">From the foregoing, the basic elements of a criminal \u201cprosecution\u201d emerge with reasonable clarity. \u201cProsecution,\u201d as Blackstone used the term, referred to \u201cinstituting a criminal suit,\u201d <em>id., </em>at *309, by filing a formal charging document\u2014an indictment, presentment, or information \u2014 upon which the defendant was to be tried in a court with power to punish the alleged offense. And, significantly, Blackstone\u2019s usage appears to have accorded with the ordinary meaning of the term. See 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (defining \u201cprosecution\u201d as \u201c[t]he institution or commencement and continuance of a criminal suit; the process of exhibiting formal charges against an of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>fender before a legal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment,\u201d and noting that <em>\u201c[prosecutions </em>may be by presentment, information or indictment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">With Blackstone as our guide, it is significant that the Framers used the words \u201ccriminal prosecutions\u201d in the Sixth Amendment rather than some other formulation such as \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d or \u201ccriminal cases.\u201d Indeed, elsewhere in the Bill of Rights we find just such an alternative formulation: In contrast to the Sixth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment refers to \u201ccriminal case[s].\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 (\u201cNo person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In <em>Counselman </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>142 U. S. 547 (1892), the Court indicated that the difference in phraseology was not accidental. There the Court held that the Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled to be a witness against oneself \u201cin any criminal case\u201d could be invoked by a witness testifying before a grand jury. The Court rejected the argument that there could be no \u201ccriminal case\u201d prior to indictment, reasoning that a \u201ccriminal case\u201d under the Fifth Amendment is much broader than a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id., </em>at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The following Term, the Court construed the phrase \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d in a statutory context, and this time the Court squarely held that a \u201cprosecution\u201d does not encompass preindictment stages of the criminal process. In <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>148 U. S. 107 (1893), the Court considered Revised Statute \u00a7643, which authorized removal to federal court of any \u201c\u2018criminal prosecution\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018commenced in any court of a State\u2019 \u201d against a federal officer. <em>Id., </em>at 115. The respondent, a deputy marshal, had been arrested by Virginia authorities on a warrant for murder and was held in county jail awaiting his appearance before a justice of the peace \u201cwith a view to a commitment to await the action of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>grand jury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 118. He filed a petition for removal of \u201c \u2018said cause\u2019 \u201d to federal court. <em>Ibid. </em>The question before the Court was whether a \u201c \u2018criminal prosecution\u2019 \u201d had \u201c \u2018commenced\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of the statute at the time the respondent filed his removal petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The Court held that a criminal prosecution had not commenced, and that removal was therefore not authorized by the terms of the statute. The Court noted that under Virginia law murder could be prosecuted only \u201cby indictment found in the county court,\u201d and that \u201ca justice of the peace, upon a previous complaint, [could] do no more than to examine whether there [was] good cause for believing that the accused [was] guilty, and to commit him for trial before the court having jurisdiction of the offence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, where \u201cno indictment was found, or other action taken, in the county court,\u201d there was as yet no \u201c \u2018criminal prosecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 119. The appearance before the justice of the peace did not qualify as a \u201cprosecution\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cProceedings before a magistrate to commit a person to jail, or to hold him to bail, in order to secure his appearance to answer for a crime or offence which the magistrate has no jurisdiction himself to try, before the court in which he may be prosecuted and tried, are but preliminary to the prosecution, and are no more a commencement of the prosecution, than is an arrest by an officer without a warrant for a felony committed in his presence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The foregoing historical summary is strong evidence that the term \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n]\u201d in the Sixth Amendment refers to the commencement of a criminal suit by filing formal charges in a court with jurisdiction to try and punish the defendant. And on this understanding of the Sixth Amendment, it is clear that petitioner\u2019s initial appearance before the magistrate did not commence a \u201ccriminal prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tio[n].\u201d No formal charges had been filed. The only document submitted to the magistrate was the arresting officer\u2019s affidavit of probable cause. The officer stated that he \u201cha[d] good reason to believe\u201d that petitioner was a felon and had been \u201cwalking around [an] RV park with a gun belt on, carrying a pistol, handcuffs, mace spray, extra bullets and a knife.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a. The officer therefore \u201ccharge[d]\u201d that petitioner had \u201ccommitted] the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon \u2014 3rd degree felony.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The magistrate certified that he had examined the affidavit and \u201cdetermined that probable cause existed for the arrest of the individual accused therein.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 34a. Later that day, petitioner was released on bail, and did not hear from the State again until he was indicted six months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The affidavit of probable cause clearly was not the type of formal accusation Blackstone identified with the commencement of a criminal \u201cprosecution.\u201d Rather, it was the preliminary accusation necessary to justify arrest and detention\u2014 stages of the criminal process that Blackstone placed before prosecution. The affidavit was not a pleading that instituted a criminal prosecution, such as an indictment, presentment, or information; and the magistrate to whom it was presented had no jurisdiction to try and convict petitioner for the felony offense charged therein. See <em>Teal </em>v. <em>State, </em>230 S. W. 3d 172, 174 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (\u201cThe Texas Constitution requires that, unless waived by the defendant, the State must obtain a grand jury indictment in a felony case\u201d); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Arts. 4.05, 4.11(a) (Vernon 2005). That is most assuredly why the magistrate informed petitioner that charges <em>\u201cwill be </em>filed\u201d in district court. App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The original meaning of the Sixth Amendment, then, cuts decisively against the Court\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s right to counsel attached at his initial appearance before the magistrate. But we are not writing on a blank slate: This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Court has a substantial body of.more recent precedent construing the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As the Court notes, our cases have \u201cpegged commencement\u201d of a criminal prosecution, <em>ante, </em>at 198, to \u201cthe initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings \u2014 whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment,\u201d <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U. S. 682, 689 (1972) (plurality opinion). The Court has repeated this formulation in virtually every right-to-counsel case decided since <em>Kirby. </em>Because <em>Kirby\u2019s </em>formulation of the attachment test has been accorded such precedential significance, it is important to determine precisely what <em>Kirby </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u201cIn a line of constitutional cases in this Court stemming back to the Court\u2019s landmark opinion in <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U. S. 45 [(1932)], it has been firmly established that a person\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him. See <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra; Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458 [(1938)]; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>368 U. S. 52 [(1961)]; <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U. S. 335 [(1963)]; <em>White </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 59 [(1963) <em>(per curiam)]; Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U. S. 201 [(1964)]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218 [(1967)]; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U. S. 263 [(1967)]; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>399 U. S. 1 [(1970)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">\u201cThis is not to say that a defendant in a criminal case has a constitutional right to counsel only at the trial itself. The <em>Powell </em>case makes clear that the right attaches at the time of arraignment, and the Court has recently held that it exists also at the time of a preliminary hearing. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra. </em>But the point is that, while members of the Court have differed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>as to existence of the right to counsel in the contexts of some of the above cases, <em>all </em>of those cases have involved points of time at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings \u2014 whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 688-689 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">It is noteworthy that <em>Kirby </em>did not purport to announce anything new; rather, it simply catalogued what the Court had previously held. And the point of the plurality\u2019s discussion was that the criminal process contains stages <em>prior to </em>commencement of a criminal prosecution. The holding of the case was that the right to counsel did not apply at a station house lineup that took place <em>\u201cbefore </em>the defendant had been indicted or otherwise formally charged with any criminal offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><em>Kirby </em>gave five examples of events that initiate \u201cadversary judicial criminal proceedings\u201d: formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, and arraignment. None of these supports the result the Court reaches today. I will apply them <em>seriatim. </em>No indictment or information had been filed when petitioner appeared before the magistrate. Nor was there any other formal charge. Although the plurality in <em>Kirby </em>did not define \u201cformal charge,\u201d there is no reason to believe it would have included an affidavit of probable cause in that category. None of the cases on which it relied stood for that proposition. Indeed, all of them\u2014with the exception of <em>White </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 59 (1963) <em>(per curiam), </em>and <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>399 U. S. 1 (1970)\u2014involved postindictment proceedings. See <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U. S. 45, 49 (1932) (postindictment arraignment); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 460 (1938) (trial); <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>368 U. S. 52, 53, n. 3 (1961) (postindictment arraignment); <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U. S. 335, 337 (1963) (trial); <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U. S. 201 (1964) (postindictment interrogation); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>219-220 (1967) (postindictment lineup); <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U. S. 263, 269 (1967) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Nor was petitioner\u2019s initial appearance a preliminary hearing. The comparable proceeding in Texas is called an \u201cexamining trial.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>at 202, n. 12. More importantly, petitioner\u2019s initial appearance was unlike the preliminary hearings that were held to constitute \u201ccritical stages\u201d in <em>White </em>and <em>Coleman, </em>because it did not involve entry of a plea, cf. <em>White, supra, </em>at 60, and was nonadversarial, cf. <em>Coleman, supra, </em>at 9. There was no prosecutor present, there were no witnesses to cross-examine, there was no case to discover, and the result of the proceeding was not to bind petitioner over to the grand jury or the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Finally, petitioner\u2019s initial appearance was not what <em>Kirby </em>described as an \u201carraignment.\u201d An arraignment, in its traditional and usual sense, is a postindietment proceeding at which the defendant enters a plea. See, <em>e. g., </em>W. LaFave, J. Israel, &amp; N. King, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 1.3(n), pp. 19-20 (4th ed. 2004); 4 Blackstone *322. Although the word \u201carraignment\u201d is sometimes used to describe an initial appearance before a magistrate, see LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.3(j), at 16, that is not what <em>Kirby </em>meant when it said that the right to counsel attaches at an \u201carraignment.\u201d Rather, it meant the traditional, postindictment arraignment where the defendant enters a plea. This would be the most reasonable assumption even if there were nothing else to go on, since that is the primary meaning of the word, especially when used unmodified.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">But there is no need to assume. <em>Kirby </em>purported to describe only what the Court had already held, and none of the cases <em>Kirby </em>cited involved an initial appearance. Only two of the cases involved arraignments, and both were postindictment arraignments at which the defendant entered a plea. <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>at 53, n. 3; <em>Powell, </em>287 U. S., at 49. And the considerations that drove the Court\u2019s analysis in those cases are not present here. See <em>id., </em>at 57 (emphasizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>that \u201cfrom the time of their arraignment until the beginning of their trial, when consultation, thoroughgoing investigation and preparation were vitally important, the defendants did not have the aid of counsel\u201d); <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>at 53-55 (emphasizing that the defendant entered a plea and was required to raise or waive certain defenses). Kirby\u2019s inclusion of \u201carraignment\u201d in the list of adversary judicial proceedings that trigger the right to counsel thus provides no support for the view that the right to counsel attaches at an initial appearance before a magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">It is clear that when <em>Kirby </em>was decided in 1972 there was no precedent in this Court for the conclusion that a criminal prosecution begins, and the right to counsel therefore attaches, at an initial appearance before a magistrate. The Court concludes, however, that two subsequent decisions\u2014 <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>430 U. S. 387 (1977), and <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>475 U. S. 625 (1986)\u2014stand for that proposition. Those decisions, which relied almost exclusively on <em>Kirby, </em>cannot bear the weight the Court puts on them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">In <em>Brewer, </em>the defendant challenged his conviction for murdering a 10-year-old girl on the ground that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated when detectives elicited incriminating statements from him while transporting him from Davenport, Iowa, where he had been arrested on a warrant for abduction and \u201carraigned before a judge ... on the outstanding arrest warrant,\u201d to Des Moines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>where he was to be tried. 430 U. S., at 390-391. The principal issue was whether the defendant had waived his right to have counsel present during police questioning when he voluntarily engaged one of the detectives in a \u201cwide-ranging conversation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 392. He subsequently agreed to lead the detectives to the girl\u2019s body in response to the so-called \u201c\u2018Christian burial speech,\u2019\u201d in which one of the detectives told the defendant that \u201c \u2018the parents of this little girl should be entitled to a Christian burial for the little girl who was snatched away from them on Christmas [E]ve and murdered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 392-393. Not surprisingly, the parties vigorously disputed the waiver issue, and it sharply divided the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In contrast, the question whether the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached was neither raised in the courts below nor disputed before this Court. Nonetheless, the Court, after quoting <em>Kirby\u2019s </em>formulation of the test, offered its conelusory observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cThere can be no doubt in the present case that judicial proceedings had been initiated against Williams before the start of the automobile ride from Davenport to Des Moines. A warrant had been issued for his arrest, he had been arraigned on that warrant before a judge in a Davenport courtroom, and he had been committed by the court to confinement in jail. The State does not contend otherwise.\u201d 430 U. S., at 399.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\"><em>Brewer\u2019s </em>cursory treatment of the attachment issue demonstrates precisely why, when \u201can issue [is] not addressed by the parties,\u201d it is \u201cimprudent of us to address it... with any pretense of settling it for all time.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Stevedore Co. </em>v. <em>Rambo, </em>521 U. S. 121, 136 (1997). As an initial matter, the Court\u2019s discussion of the facts reveals little about what happened at the proceeding. There is no indication, for example, whether it was adversarial or whether the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>was required to enter a plea or raise or waive any defenses\u2014 facts that earlier cases such as <em>Hamilton, White, </em>and <em>Coleman </em>had found significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Even assuming, however, that the arraignment in <em>Brewer </em>was functionally identical to the initial appearance here, <em>Brewer </em>offered no reasoning for its conclusion that the right to counsel attached at such a proceeding. One is left with the distinct impression that the Court simply saw the word \u201carraignment\u201d in <em>Kirby\u2019s </em>attachment test and concluded that the right must have attached because the defendant had been \u201carraigned.\u201d There is no indication that <em>Brewer </em>considered the difference between an arraignment on a warrant and an arraignment at which the defendant pleads to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The Court finds it significant that <em>Brewer </em>expressed \u201c \u2018no doubt\u2019\u201d that the right had attached. <em>Ante, </em>at 211 (quoting 430 U. S., at 399). There was no need for a \u201clengthy disquisitio[n],\u201d the Court says, because <em>Brewer </em>purportedly \u201cfound the attachment issue an easy one.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 211. What the Court neglects to mention is that <em>Brewer\u2019s </em>attachment holding is indisputably no longer good law. That is because we have subsequently held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is \u201coffense specific,\u201d meaning that it attaches only to those offenses for which the defendant has been formally charged, and not to \u201cother offenses \u2018closely related factually\u2019 to the charged offense.\u201d <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>532 U. S. 162, 164 (2001). Because the defendant in <em>Brewer </em>had been arraigned only on the abduction warrant, there is no doubt that, under <em>Cobb, </em>his right to counsel had not yet attached with respect to the murder charges that were subsequently brought. See 532 U. S., at 184 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting that under the majority\u2019s rule, \u201c[the defendant\u2019s] murder conviction should have remained undisturbed\u201d). But the Court in <em>Cobb </em>did not consider itself bound by <em>Brewer\u2019s </em>implicit holding on the attachment question. See 532 U. S., at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>169 (\u201cConstitutional rights are not defined by inferences from opinions which did not address the question at issue\u201d). And here, as in <em>Cobb, Brewer </em>did not address the fact that the arraignment on the warrant was not the same type of arraignment at which the right to counsel had previously been held to attach, and the parties did not argue the question. <em>Brewer </em>is thus entitled to no more precedential weight here than it was in <em>Cobb.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Nor does <em>Jackson </em>control. In <em>Jackson, </em>as in <em>Brewer, </em>the attachment issue was secondary. The question presented was \u201cnot whether respondents had a right to counsel at their postarraignment, custodial interrogations,\u201d 475 U. S., at 629, but \u201cwhether respondents validly waived their right to counsel,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 630. And, as in <em>Brewer, </em>the Court\u2019s waiver holding was vigorously disputed. See 475 U. S., at 637-642 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); see also <em>Cobb, supra, </em>at 174-177 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (questioning Jackson\u2019s vitality). Unlike in <em>Brewer, </em>however, the attachment question was at least contested in <em>Jackson</em>\u2014but barely. With respect to respondent Jackson, the State conceded the issue. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>at 629, n. 3. And with respect to respondent Bladel, the State had conceded the issue below, see <em>People </em>v. <em>Bladel, </em>421 Mich. 39, 77, 365 N. W. 2d 56, 74 (1984) (Boyle, J., dissenting), and raised it for the first time before this Court, devoting only three pages of its brief to the question, see Brief for Petitioner in <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bladel, </em>O. T. 1985, No. 84-1539, pp. 24-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The Court disposed of the issue in a footnote. See <em>Jackson, supra, </em>at 629-630, n. 3. As in <em>Brewer, </em>the Court did not describe the nature of the proceeding. It stated only that the respondents were \u201carraigned.\u201d 475 U. S., at 627-628. The Court phrased the question presented in terms of \u201carraignment,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 626 (\u201cThe question presented by these two cases is whether the same rule applies to a defendant who has been formally charged with a crime and who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>requested appointment of counsel at his arraignment\u201d), and repeated the words \u201carraignment\u201d or \u201cpostarraignment\u201d no fewer than 35 times in the course of its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">There is no way to know from the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jackson </em>whether the arraignment at issue there was the same type of arraignment at which the right to counsel had been held to attach in <em>Powell </em>and <em>Hamilton. </em>Only upon examination of the parties\u2019 briefs does it become clear that the proceeding was in fact an initial appearance. But <em>Jackson </em>did not even acknowledge, much less \u201cflatly rejec[t] the distinction between initial arraignment and arraignment on the indictment.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 202. Instead, it offered one sentence of analysis\u2014\u201cIn view of the clear language in our decisions about the significance of arraignment, the State\u2019s argument is untenable\u201d\u2014followed by a string citation to four cases, each of which quoted <em>Kirby. </em>475 U. S., at 629-630, n. 3. For emphasis, the Court italicized the words \u201cor arraignment\u201d in <em>Kirby\u2019s </em>attachment test. 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The only rule that can be derived from the face of the opinion in <em>Jackson </em>is that if a proceeding is called an \u201carraignment,\u201d the right to counsel attaches.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That rule would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>not govern this case because petitioner\u2019s initial appearance was not called an \u201carraignment\u201d (the parties refer to it as a \u201cmagistration,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 4; Brief for Respondent 5). And that would, in any case, be a silly rule. The Sixth Amendment consequences of a proceeding should turn on the substance of what happens there, not on what the State chooses to call it. But the Court in <em>Jackson </em>did not focus on the substantive distinction between an initial arraignment and an arraignment on the indictment. Instead, the Court simply cited <em>Kirby </em>and left it at that. In these circumstances, I would recognize <em>Jackson </em>for what it was\u2014 a cursory treatment of an issue that was not the primary focus of the Court\u2019s opinion. Surely Jackson\u2019s footnote must yield to our reasoned precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">And our reasoned precedents provide no support for the conclusion that the right to counsel attaches at an initial appearance before a magistrate. <em>Kirby </em>explained why the right attaches \u201cafter the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201cThe initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far from a mere formalism. It is the starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice. For it is only then that the government has committed itself to prosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified. It is then that a defendant finds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>is this point, therefore, that marks the commencement of the \u2018criminal prosecutions\u2019 to which alone the explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.\u201d 406 U. S., at 689-690 (plurality opinion).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">None of these defining characteristics of a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d applies to petitioner\u2019s initial appearance before the magistrate. The initial appearance was not an \u201cadversary\u201d proceeding, and petitioner was not \u201cfaced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society.\u201d Instead, he stood in front of a \u201c \u2018little glass window,\u2019 \u201d filled out various forms, and was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Brief for Respondent 5. The State had not committed itself to prosecute \u2014 only a prosecutor may file felony charges in Texas, see Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Arts. 2.01, 2.02 (Vernon 2005), and there is no evidence that any prosecutor was even aware of petitioner\u2019s arrest or appearance. The adverse positions of government and defendant had not yet solidified \u2014 the State\u2019s prosecutorial officers had not yet decided whether to press charges and, if so, which charges to press. And petitioner was not immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law \u2014 shortly after the proceeding he was free on bail, and no further proceedings occurred until six months later when he was indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Moreover, the Court\u2019s holding that the right to counsel attaches at an initial appearance is untethered from any interest that we have heretofore associated with the right to counsel. The Court has repeatedly emphasized that \u201c[t]he purpose of the constitutional guaranty of a right to counsel is to protect an accused from conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his legal and constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>304 U. S., at 465. The \u201ccore purpose\u201d of the right, the Court has said, is to \u201cassure \u2018Assistance\u2019 at trial, when the accused [is] confronted with both the intricacies of the law and the advocacy of the public prosecutor.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>413 U. S. 300, 309 (1973). The Court has extended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the right to counsel to pretrial events only when the absence of counsel would derogate from the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. See, <em>e. g., Wade, </em>388 U. S., at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Neither petitioner nor the Court identifies any way in which petitioner\u2019s ability to receive a fair trial was undermined by the absence of counsel during the period between his initial appearance and his indictment. Nothing during that period exposed petitioner to the risk that he would be convicted as the result of ignorance of his rights. Instead, the gravamen of petitioner\u2019s complaint is that if counsel had been appointed earlier, he would have been able to stave off indictment by convincing the prosecutor that petitioner was not guilty of the crime alleged. But the Sixth Amendment protects against the risk of erroneous <em>conviction, </em>not the risk of unwarranted <em>prosecution. </em>See <em>Gouveia, </em>467 U. S., at 191 (rejecting the notion that the \u201cpurpose of the right to counsel is to provide a defendant with a preindictment private investigator\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Petitioner argues that the right to counsel is implicated here because restrictions were imposed on his liberty when he was required to post bail. But we have never suggested that the accused\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel \u201cfor his defence\u201d entails a right to use counsel as a sword to contest pretrial detention. To the contrary, we have flatly rejected that notion, reasoning that a defendant\u2019s liberty interests are protected by other constitutional guarantees. See <em>id., </em>at 190 (\u201cWhile the right to counsel exists to protect the accused during trial-type confrontations with the prosecutor, the speedy trial right exists primarily to protect an individual\u2019s liberty interest,\u201d including the interest in reducing the \u201c \u2018impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In sum, neither the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel nor our precedents interpreting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>scope of that right supports the Court\u2019s holding that the right attaches at an initial appearance before a magistrate. Because I would affirm the judgment below, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\"> The Court also relies on <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>501 U. S. 171 (1991), to support its assertion that the right to counsel attaches upon an initial appearance before a magistrate. <em>Ante, </em>at 203. But in <em>McNeil, </em>the Court expressed no view whatsoever on the attachment issue. Rather, it noted that the issue was \u201cundisputed,\u201d and \u201caccept[ed] for purposes of the present case, that... [the defendant\u2019s] Sixth Amendment right had attached.\u201d 501 U. S., at 175. We do not ordinarily give weight to assumptions made in prior cases about matters that were not in dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> The Court asserts that <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>\u201cconclusion was driven by the same considerations the Court had endorsed in <em>Brewer,\u201d </em>namely, that \u201cby the time a defendant is brought before a judicial officer, is informed of a formally lodged accusation, and has restrictions imposed on his liberty in aid of the prosecution, the State\u2019s relationship with the defendant has become solidly adversarial.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 202. But <em>Jackson </em>said nothing of the sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Moreover, even looking behind the opinion, <em>Jackson </em>does not support the result the Court reaches today. Respondent Bladel entered a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea at his arraignment, see Brief for Petitioner in <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bladel, </em>O. T. 1985, No. 84-1539, p. 4, and both <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>368 U. S. 52 (1961), and <em>White </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 59 (1963) <em>(per curiam), </em>had already held that a defendant has a right to counsel when he enters a plea. The Court suggests that this fact is irrelevant because the magistrate in Bladel\u2019s case \u201chad no jurisdiction to accept a plea of guilty to a felony charge.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 203, n. 13. But that distinction does not appear in either <em>Hamilton </em>or <em>White. </em>See <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>at 55 (\u201cOnly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>presence of counsel could have enabled this accused to know all the defenses available to him and to plead intelligently\u201d); <em>White, supra, </em>at 60 (\u201c[P]etitioner entered a plea before the magistrate and that plea was taken at a time when he had no counsel\u201d). Thus, the most that <em>Jackson </em>can possibly be made to stand for is that the right to counsel attaches at an initial appearance where the defendant enters a plea. And that rule would not govern this case because petitioner did not enter a plea at his initial appearance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
