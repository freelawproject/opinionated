S. C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>creates an exemption for employer actions \u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d by the ADEA but \u201cbased on reasonable factors other than age\u201d (RFOA). \u00a7 623(f)(1). The question is whether an employer facing a disparate-impact claim and planning to defend on the basis of RFOA must not only produce evidence raising the defense, but also persuade the factfinder of its merit. We hold that the employer must do both.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The National Government pays private companies to do some of the work maintaining the Nation\u2019s fleet of nuclear-powered warships. One such contractor is respondent KAPL, Inc. (Knolls), the operator of the Government\u2019s Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, which has a history dating back to the first nuclear-powered submarines in the 1950s. The United States Navy and the Department of Energy jointly fund Knolls\u2019s operations, decide what projects it should pursue, and set its annual staffing limits. In recent years, Knolls has been charged with designing prototype naval nuclear reactors and with training Navy personnel to run them.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The demands for naval nuclear reactors changed with the end of the Cold War, and for fiscal year 1996 Knolls was ordered to reduce its work force. Even after 100 or so employees chose to take the company\u2019s ensuing buyout offer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Knolls was left with 30-some jobs to cut.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioners (Meacham, for short) are among those laid off in the resulting \u201cinvoluntary reduction in force.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 6. In order to select those for layoff, Knolls told its managers to score their subordinates on three scales, \u201cperformance,\u201d \u201cflexibility,\u201d and \u201ccritical skills.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The scores were summed, along with points for years of service, and the totals determined who should be let go.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Of the 31 salaried employees laid off, 30 were at least 40 years old.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Twenty-eight of them sued, raising both disparate-treatment (discriminatory intent) and disparate-impact (discriminatory result) claims under the ADEA and state law, alleging that Knolls \u201cdesigned and implemented its workforce reduction process to eliminate older employees and that, regardless of intent, the process had a discriminatory impact on ADEA-protected employees.\u201d <em>Meacham </em>v. <em>Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, </em>381 F. 3d 56, 61 (CA2 2004) <em>(Meacham I). </em>To show a disparate impact, the workers relied on a statistical expert's testimony to the effect that results so skewed according to age could rarely occur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>by chance;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the scores for \u201cflexibility\u201d and \u201ccriticality,\u201d over which managers had the most discretionary judgment, had the firmest statistical ties to the outcomes. <em>Id., </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The jury found for Meacham on the disparate-impact claim (but not on the disparate-treatment claim). The Court of Appeals affirmed, after examining the verdict through the lens of the so-called \u201cburden shifting\u201d scheme of inference spelled out in <em>Wards Cove Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Atonio, </em>490 U. S. 642 (1989). See <em>Meacham I, supra, </em>at 74-76.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After Knolls sought certiorari, we vacated the judgment and remanded for further proceedings in light of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>City of Jackson, </em>544 U. S. 228 (2005), decided while Knolls\u2019s petition was pending, see 544 U. S. 957 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">On remand, the same Court of Appeals panel ruled in favor of Knolls, over a dissent. 461 F. 3d 134 (CA2 2006) <em>(Meacham II) </em>(case below). The majority found its prior ruling \u201cuntenable\u201d because it had applied the <em>Wards Cove </em>\u201cbusiness necessity\u201d standard rather than a \u201creasonableness\u201d test, contrary to <em>City of Jackson; </em>and on the latter standard, Meacham, the employee, had not carried the burden of persuasion. 461 F. 3d, at 140-141, 144 (internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In dissent, Judge Pooler took issue with the majority for confusing business justifications under <em>Wards Cove </em>with the statutory RFOA exemption, which she read to be an affirmative defense with the burden of persuasion falling on defendants. 461 F. 3d, at 147, 149-152.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Meacham sought certiorari, noting conflicting decisions assigning the burden of persuasion on the reasonableness of the factor other than age; the Court of Appeals in this case placed it on the employee (to show the non-age factor unreasonable), but the Ninth Circuit in <em>Criswell </em>v. <em>Western Airlines, Inc., </em>709 F. 2d 544, 552 (1983), had assigned it to the employer (to show the factor was a reasonable one). In fact it was in <em>Criswell </em>that we first took up this question, only to find it not well posed in that case. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Criswell, </em>472 U. S. 400, 408, n. 10 (1985). We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. 1162 (2008), and now vacate the judgment of the Second Circuit and remand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The ADEA\u2019s general prohibitions against age discrimination, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7623(a)-(c), (e), are subject to a separate provision, \u00a7 623(f), creating exemptions for employer practices \u201cotherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e).\u201d The RFOA exemption is listed in \u00a7 623(f) alongside one for bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ): \u201cIt shall not be unlawful for an employer ... to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e)... where age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business, or where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age ....\u201d \u00a7 623(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Given how the statute reads, with exemptions laid out apart from the prohibitions (and expressly referring to the prohibited conduct as such), it is no surprise that we have already spoken of the BFOQ and RFOA provisions as being among the ADEA\u2019s \u201cfive affirmative defenses,\u201d <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>469 U. S. 111, 122 (1985). After looking at the statutory text, most lawyers would accept that characterization as a matter of course, thanks to the familiar principle that \u201c[w]hen a proviso . .. carves an exception out of the body of a statute or contract those who set up such exception must prove it.\u201d <em>Javierre </em>v. <em>Central Altagracia, </em>217 U. S. 502, 508 (1910) (opinion for the Court by Holmes, J.); see also <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Morton Salt Co., </em>334 U. S. 37, 44-45 (1948) (\u201c[T]he burden of proving justification or exemption under a special exception to the prohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims its benefits . . . \u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>First City Nat. Bank of Houston, </em>386 U. S. 361, 366 (1967) (citing <em>Morton Salt Co., supra, </em>at 44-45). That longstanding convention is part of the backdrop against which the Congress writes laws, and we respect it unless we have compelling reasons to think that Congress meant to put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the burden of persuasion on the other side. See <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Weast, </em>546 U. S. 49, 57-58 (2005) (\u201cAbsent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We have never been given any reason for a heterodox take on the RFOA clause\u2019s nearest neighbor, and our prior cases recognize that the BFOQ clause establishes an affirmative defense against claims of disparate treatment. See, <em>e.g., City of Jackson, </em>544 U. S., at 233, n. 3; <em>Western Air Lines, Inc., supra, </em>at 414-419, and nn. 24, 29. We have likewise given the affirmative defense construction to the exemption in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 for pay differentials based on \u201cany other factor other than sex,\u201d <em>Corning Glass Works </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>417 U. S. 188, 196 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted); and there, we took account of the particular weight given to the interpretive convention already noted, when enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), <em>id., </em>at 196-197 (\u201c[T]he general rule [is] that the application of an exemption under the [FLSA] is a matter of affirmative defense on which the employer has the burden of proof\u201d). This focus makes the principle of construction the more instructive in ADEA cases: \u201cin enacting the ADEA, Congress exhibited both a detailed knowledge of the FLSA provisions and their judicial interpretation and a willingness to depart from those provisions regarded as undesirable or inappropriate for incorporation,\u201d <em>Lorillard </em>v. <em>Pons, </em>434 U. S. 575, 581 (1978). And we have remarked and relied on the \u201csignificant indication of Congress\u2019 intent in its directive that the ADEA be enforced in accordance with the \u2018powers, remedies, and procedures\u2019 of the FLSA.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 580 (quoting 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 626(b); emphasis deleted); see also <em>Fogerty </em>v. <em>Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U. S. 517, 528 (1994) (applying reasoning of Lorillard); <em>Thurston, supra, </em>at 126 (same). As against this interpretive background, there is no hint in the text that Congress meant \u00a7 623(f)(1) to march out of step with either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the general or specifically FLSA default rules placing the burden of proving an exemption on the party claiming it.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">With these principles and prior cases in mind, we find it impossible to look at the text and structure of the ADEA and imagine that the RFOA clause works differently from the BFOQ clause next to it. Both exempt otherwise illegal conduct by reference to a further item of proof, thereby creating a defense for which the burden of persuasion falls on the \u201cone who claims its benefits,\u201d <em>Morton Salt Co., supra, </em>at 44-45, the \u201cparty seeking relief,\u201d <em>Schaffer, supra, </em>at 57-58, and here, \u201cthe employer,\u201d <em>Corning Glass Works, supra, </em>at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">If there were any doubt, the stress of the idiom \u201cotherwise prohibited,\u201d prefacing the BFOQ and RFOA conditions, would dispel it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The implication of affirmative defense is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>underscored by contrasting \u00a7 623(f)(1) with the section of the ADEA at issue in <em>Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio </em>v. <em>Betts, </em>492 U. S. 158 (1989), and by the way Congress responded to our decision there. In <em>Betts, </em>we said the issue was whether a provision in a former version of \u00a7 623(f)(2), one about employee benefit plans, merely \u201credefine[d] the elements of a plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case,\u201d or instead \u201cestablished] a defense\u201d to what \u201cotherwise would be a violation of the Act.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 181.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the provision contained no \u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d kind of language, we said that it \u201cappears on first reading to describe an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We nonetheless thought that this more natural view (which we had taken in <em>Thurston) </em>was overridden by evidence of legislative history, by the peculiarity of a pretext-revealing condition in the phrasing of the provision (that a benefit plan \u201cnot [be] a subterfuge to evade the purposes\u201d of the ADEA), and by the parallel with a prior case construing an \u201canalogous provision of Title VII\u201d of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (analogous because it also contained a pretext-revealing condition). 492 U. S., at 181. A year later, however, Congress responded to <em>Betts </em>by enacting the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, 104 Stat. 978, avowedly to \u201crestore the original congressional intent\u201d that the ADEA\u2019s benefits provision be. read as an affirmative defense, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 101. What is instructive on the question at hand is that, in clarifying that \u00a7 623(f)(2) specifies affirmative defenses, Congress not only set the burden in so many words but also added the phrase \u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d as a part of the preface (just as in the text of \u00a7 623(f)(1)). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Congress thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>confirmed the natural implication that we find in the \u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d language in \u00a7 623(f)(1): it refers to an excuse or justification for behavior that, standing alone, violates the statute\u2019s prohibition. The amendment in the aftermath of <em>Betts </em>shows that Congress understands the phrase the same way we naturally read it, as a clear signal that a defense to what is \u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d is an affirmative defense, entirely the responsibility of the party raising it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Knolls ventures that, regardless, the RFOA provision should be read as mere elaboration on an element of liability. Because it bars liability where action is taken for reasons \u201cother than age,\u201d the argument goes, the provision must be directed not at justifying age discrimination by proof of some extenuating fact but at negating the premise of liability under \u00a7 623(a)(2), \u201cbecause of. . . age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The answer to this argument, however, is <em>City of Jackson, </em>where we confirmed that the prohibition in \u00a7 623(a)(2) extends to practices with a disparate impact, inferring this result in part from the presence of the RFOA provision at issue here.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We drew on the recognized distinction between disparate-treatment and disparate-impact forms of liability, and explained that \u201cthe very definition of disparate impact\u201d was that \u201can employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be liable under the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employee\u2019s age.\u201d 544 U. S., at 236, n. 6 (plurality opinion); <em>id., </em>at 243 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (expressing agreement with \u201call of the Court\u2019s reasoning\u201d in the plurality opinion, but finding it a basis for deference to the EEOC rather than for independent judicial decision). We emphasized that these were the kinds of employer activities, \u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d by \u00a7 623(a)(2), that were mainly what the statute meant to test against the RFOA condition: because \u201c[i]n disparate-impact cases . . . the allegedly \u2018otherwise prohibited\u2019 activity is not based on age,\u201d it is \u201cin cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 239 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Thus, in <em>City of Jackson, </em>we made it clear that in the typical disparate-impact case, the employer\u2019s practice is \u201cwithout respect to age\u201d and its adverse impact (though \u201cbecause of age\u201d) is \u201cattributable to a nonage factor\u201d; so action based on a \u201cfactor other than age\u201d is the very premise for disparate-impact liability in the first place, not a negation of it or a defense to it. The RFOA defense in a disparate-impact case, then, is not focused on the asserted fact that a non-age factor was at work; we assume it was. The focus of the defense is that the factor relied upon was a \u201creasonable\u201d one for the employer to be using. Reasonableness is a justification categorically distinct from the factual condition \u201cbecause of age\u201d and not necessarily correlated with it in any particular way: a reasonable factor may lean more heavily on older workers, as against younger ones, and an unreasonable factor might do just the opposite.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The Court of Appeals majority rejected the affirmative defense reading and arrived at its position on the burden of proof question by a different route: because it read our decision in <em>City of Jackson </em>as ruling out the so-called \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d enquiry in ADEA cases, the court concluded that the RFOA defense \u201creplaces\u201d it and therefore must conform to its burden of persuasion resting on the complaining party. But the court\u2019s premise (that <em>City of Jackson </em>modified the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d enquiry) is mistaken; this alone would be reason enough to reject its approach. And although we are now satisfied that the business necessity test should have no place in ADEA disparate-impact cases, we agree with the Government that this conclusion does not stand in the way of our holding that the RFOA exemption is an affirmative defense. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae 25-27.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">To begin with, when the Court of Appeals further inferred from the <em>City of Jackson </em>reference to <em>Wards Cove </em>that the <em>Wards Cove </em>burden of persuasion (on the employee, for the business necessity enquiry) also applied to the RFOA defense, it gave short shrift to the reasons set out in Part II-A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>supra, </em>for reading RFOA as an affirmative defense (with the burden on the employer). But we think that even on its own terms, <em>City of Jackson </em>falls short of supporting the Court of Appeals\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Although <em>City of Jackson </em>contains the statement that \u201c <em>Wards Cove\u2019s </em>pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII\u2019s identical language remains applicable to the ADEA,\u201d 544 U. S., at 240, <em>City of Jackson </em>made only two specific references to aspects of the <em>Wards Cove </em>interpretation of Title VII that might have \u201cremain[ed] applicable\u201d in ADEA cases. One was to the existence of disparate-impact liability, which <em>City of Jackson </em>explained was narrower in ADEA cases than under Title VII. The other was to a plaintiff-employee\u2019s burden of identifying which particular practices allegedly cause an observed disparate impact, which is the employee\u2019s burden under both the ADEA and the pre-1991 Title VII. See 544 U. S., at 241. Neither of these references, of course, is at odds with the view of RFOA as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">If, indeed, <em>City of Jackson\u2019s </em>reference to <em>Wards Cove </em>could be read literally to include other aspects of the latter case, beyond what mattered in <em>City of Jackson </em>itself, the untoward consequences of the broader reading would rule it out. One such consequence is embraced by Meacham, who argues both that the Court of Appeals was wrong to place the burden of persuasion for the RFOA defense on the employee, and that the court was right in thinking that <em>City of Jackson </em>adopted the <em>Wards Cove </em>burden of persuasion on what Meacham views as one element of an ADEA impact claim. For Meacham takes the position that an impact plaintiff like himself has to negate business necessity in order to show that the employer\u2019s actions were \u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d; only then does the RFOA (with the burden of persuasion on the employer) have a role to play. To apply both tests, however, would force the parties to develop (and the court or jury to follow) two overlapping enquiries: first, whether the employment practice at issue (based on a factor other than age) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>supported by a business justification; and second, whether that factor is a reasonable one. Depending on how the first enquiry proceeds, a plaintiff might directly contest the force of the employer\u2019s rationale, or else try to show that the employer invoked it as a pretext by pointing (for example) to alternative practices with less of a disparate impact. See <em>Wards Cove, </em>490 U. S., at 658 (\u201cfirst, a consideration of the justifications an employer offers for his use of these practices; and second, the availability of alternative practices to achieve the same business ends, with less racial impact\u201d); see also <em>id., </em>at 658-661. But even if the plaintiff succeeded at one or the other, in Meacham\u2019s scheme the employer could still avoid liability by proving reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Here is what is so strange: as the Government says, \u201c[i]f disparate-impact plaintiffs have already established that a challenged practice is a pretext for intentional age discrimination, it makes little sense then to ask whether the discriminatory practice is based on reasonable factors <em>other than age.\u201d </em>Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>26 (emphasis in original). Conversely, proving the reasonableness defense would eliminate much of the point a plaintiff would have had for showing alternatives in the first place: why make the effort to show alternative practices with a less discriminatory effect (and besides, how would that prove pretext?), when everyone knows that the choice of a practice relying on a \u201creasonable\u201d non-age factor is good enough to avoid liability?<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At the very least, developing the reasonableness defense would be substantially redundant with the direct contest over the force of the business justification, especially when both enquiries deal with the same, narrowly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>specified practice. It is not very fair to take the remark about <em>Wards Cove </em>in <em>City of Jackson </em>as requiring such a wasteful and confusing structure of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Nor is there any good way to read the same line from <em>City of Jackson </em>as implying that the burden of proving any business-related defense falls on the plaintiff; most obviously, this would entail no longer taking the BFOQ clause to be an affirmative defense, which <em>City of Jackson </em>confirmed that it is, see 544 U. S., at 233, n. 3. What is more, <em>City of Jackson </em>could not have had the RFOA clause in mind as \u201cidentical\u201d to anything in Title VII (for which a Wards <em>Cove\u2019s </em>reading might be adopted), for that statute has no like-worded defense. And as <em>Wards Cove </em>did not purport to construe any statutory defenses under Title VII, only an over-reading of <em>City of Jackson </em>would find lurking in it an assumption that <em>Wards Cove </em>has anything to say about statutory defenses in the ADEA (never mind one that Title VII does not have).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">As mentioned, where <em>City of Jackson </em>did get help from our prior reading of Title VII was in relying on <em>Wards Cove </em>to repeat that a plaintiff falls short by merely alleging a disparate impact, or \u201cpointing] to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.\u201d <em>City of Jackson, </em>544 U. S., at 241. The plaintiff is obliged to do more: to \u201cisolat[e] and identif[y] the <em>specific </em>employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Wards Cove, supra, </em>at 656; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). The aim of this requirement, as <em>City of Jackson </em>said, is to avoid the \u201cresult [of] employers being potentially liable for \u2018the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances.\u2019\u201d 544 U. S., at 241 (quoting <em>Wards Cove, supra, </em>at 657; some internal quotation marks omitted). And as the outcome in that case shows, the requirement has bite: one sufficient reason for rejecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>employees\u2019 challenge was that they \u201cha[d] done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue [was] relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers,\u201d and \u201cha[d] not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that ha[d] an adverse impact on older workers.\u201d <em>City of Jackson, supra, </em>at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Identifying a specific practice is not a trivial burden, and it ought to allay some of the concern raised by Knolls\u2019s <em>amici, </em>who fear that recognizing an employer\u2019s burden of persuasion on an RFOA defense to impact claims will encourage strike suits or nudge plaintiffs with marginal cases into court, in turn inducing employers to alter business practices in order to avoid being sued. See, <em>e. g., </em>Brief for General Electric Co. as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>18-31. It is also to the point that the only thing at stake in this case is the gap between production and persuasion; nobody is saying that even the burden of production should be placed on the plaintiff. Cf. <em>Schaffer, </em>546 U. S., at 56 (burden of persuasion answers \u201cwhich party loses if the evidence is closely balanced\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 58 (\u201cIn truth, however, very few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise\u201d). And the more plainly reasonable the employer\u2019s \u201cfactor other than age\u201d is, the shorter the step for that employer from producing evidence raising the defense, to persuading the factfinder that the defense is meritorious. It will be mainly in cases where the reasonableness of the nonage factor is obscure for some reason, that the employer will have more evidence to reveal and more convincing to do in going from production to persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">That said, there is no denying that putting employers to the work of persuading factfinders that their choices are reasonable makes it harder and costlier to defend than if employers merely bore the burden of production; nor do we doubt that this will sometimes affect the way employers do business with their employees. But at the end of the day, amici\u2019s concerns have to be directed at Congress, which set the balance where it is, by both creating the RFOA exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>tion and writing it in the orthodox format of an affirmative defense. We have to read it the way Congress wrote it.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">As we have said before, Congress took account of the distinctive nature of age discrimination, and the need to preserve a fair degree of leeway for employment decisions with effects that correlate with age, when it put the RFOA clause into the ADEA, \u201csignificantly narrow[ing] its coverage.\u201d <em>City of Jackson, </em>544 U. S., at 233. And as the outcome for the employer in <em>City of Jackson </em>shows, \u201cit is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 241. In this case, we realize that the Court of Appeals showed no hesitation in finding that Knolls prevailed on the RFOA defense, though the court expressed its conclusion in terms of Meacham\u2019s failure to meet the burden of persuasion. Whether the outcome should be any different when the burden is properly placed on the employer is best left to that court in the first instance. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-5\"> The naval reactors program had lowered Knolls\u2019s staffing limit by 108 people; as Knolls also had to hire 35 new employees for work existing personnel could not do, a total of 143 jobs would have to go.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-6\"> The \u201cperformance\u201d score was based on the worker\u2019s two most recent appraisals.

One of them the Government has disavowed as overtaken by our decision in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>City of Jackson, </em>544 U. S. 228 (2005), Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>16, n. 1 (noting that 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(d) (2007) \u201ctakes a position that does not survive\u201d <em>City of Jackson), </em>for the regulation seems to require a showing of business necessity as a part of the RFOA defense. Compare 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(d) (\u201cWhen an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment... on the grounds that it is a \u2018factor other than\u2019 age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity\u201d) with <em>City of Jackson, supra, </em>at 243 (\u201cUnlike the business necessity test, which asks whether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such requirement\u201d). And the second regulation would take a bit of stretching to cover disparate-impact cases, for its text speaks in terms of disparate treatment. See 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(e) (concerning use of the RFOA defense against an \u201cindividual claim of discriminatory treatment\u201d). The EEOC has lately proposed rulemaking that would revise both of these regulations, eliminating any reference to \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d and placing the burden of proof on the employer \u201c[w]henever the exception of \u2018a reasonable factor other than age\u2019 is raised.\u201d 73 Fed.

As represented by the Solicitor General of the United States in a brief signed by the Commission\u2019s General Counsel, the Commission takes the position that the reasonable-factor-other-than-age provision is an affirmative defense on which the employer bears the burden of proof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>and that, in disparate-impact suits brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), that provision replaces the business-necessity test of <em>Wards Cove Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Atonio, </em>490 U. S. 642 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Neither position was contrived just for this case. Indeed, the Commission has arguably held its view on the burden-of-proof point for nearly 30 years. See 44 Fed. Reg. 68858, 68861 (1979). Although its regulation applied only to cases involving \u201cdiscriminatory treatment,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(e) (2007), even if that covers only disparate treatment, see <em>ante, </em>at 93, n. 9, the logic of its extension to disparate-impact claims is obvious and unavoidable. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>16, n. 1. At the very least, the regulation does not contradict the Commission\u2019s current position: It does not say that the employer bears the burden of proof <em>only </em>in discriminatory-treatment cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The Commission\u2019s view on the business-necessity test is newly minted, but that does not undermine it. The Commission has never expressed the contrary view that the fact-finder must consider both business necessity <em>and </em>reasonableness when an employer applies a factor that has a disparate impact on older workers. In fact, before <em>Smith </em>v. <em>City of Jackson, </em>544 U. S. 228 (2005), the Commission had not even considered the relationship between the two standards, because it used to treat the two as <em>identical. </em>See 29 CFR \u00a7 1625.7(d). After <em>City of Jackson </em>rejected that equation, see 544 U. S., at 243, the Commission decided that the business-necessity standard plays no role in ADEA disparate-impact claims, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>25-27, and has even proposed new rules setting forth that position, see 73 Fed. Reg. 16807-16809 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Because administration of the ADEA has been placed in the hands of the Commission, and because the agency\u2019s positions on the questions before us are unquestionably reasonable (as the Court\u2019s opinion ably shows), I defer to the agency\u2019s views. See <em>Raymond B. Yates, M. D., P. C. Profit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Sharing Plan </em>v. <em>Hendon, </em>541 U. S. 1, 24-25 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). I therefore concur in the Court\u2019s judgment to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b132-4\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"AFs\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">I write separately to note that I continue to believe that disparate-impact claims are not cognizable under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>City of Jackson, </em>544 U. S. 228, 247-268 (2005) (O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in judgment). Moreover, I disagree with the Court\u2019s statement that the \u201creasonable factors other than age\u201d (RFQA) exception, \u00a7 623(f)(1), is principally relevant in disparate-impact cases. Compare <em>City of Jackson, supra, </em>at 251-253 (opinion concurring in judgment), with <em>ante, </em>at 95-96 (citing <em>City of Jackson, supra, </em>at 239 (plurality opinion)). I therefore join only Parts I and II-A of the Court\u2019s opinion because I agree that the RFOA exception is an affirmative defense \u2014 when it arises in disparate-treatment cases. Here, although the Court of Appeals erred in placing the burden of proof on petitioners, I would nonetheless affirm because the only claims at issue are disparate-impact claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
