S. C. \u00a7 441a (2006 ed.). <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the usual circumstances, the same restrictions apply to all the competitors for a seat and their authorized committees. Contributions from individual donors during a 2-year election cycle are subject to a cap, which is currently set at $2,300. See \u00a7\u00a7 441a(a)(1)(A), (c); 72 Fed. Reg. 5295 (2007). In addition, no funds may be accepted from an individual whose aggregate contributions to candidates and their committees during the election cycle have reached the legal limit, currently $42,700. See 2 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 441a(a)(3)(A), (c); 72 Fed. Reg. 5295. A candidate also may not accept general election coordinated expenditures by national or state political party committees that exceed an imposed limit. See 2 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 441a(c), (d).

S. C. \u00a7 441a-1(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> part of the so-called \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Amendment,\u201d fundamentally alters this scheme when, as a result of a candidate\u2019s expenditure of personal funds, the \u201copposition personal funds amount\u201d (OPFA) exceeds $350,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The OPFA, in simple terms, is a statistic that compares the expenditure of personal funds by competing candidates and also takes into account to some degree certain other fundraising.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See \u00a7 441a-1(a). When a candidate\u2019s expenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA to pass the $350,000 mark (for convenience, such candidates will be referred to as \u201cself-financing\u201d), a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into play. The self-financing candidate remains subject to the limitations noted above, but the candidate\u2019s opponent (the \u201cnon-self-financing\u201d candidate) may receive individual contributions at treble the normal limit <em>(e.g., </em>$6,900 rather than the current $2,300), even from individuals who have reached the normal aggregate contributions cap, and may accept coordinated party expenditures without limit. See \u00a7\u00a7 441a-1(a)(1)(AMC). Once the non-self-financing candidate\u2019s receipts exceed the OPFA, the prior limits are revived. \u00a7 441a-1(a)(3). A candidate who does not spend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>contributions received under the asymmetrical limits must return them. \u00a7 441a-1(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In order to calculate the OPFA, certain information is needed about the self-financing candidate\u2019s campaign assets and personal expenditures. Section 319(b) thus requires self-financing candidates to make three types of disclosures. First, within 15 days after entering a race, a candidate must file a \u201c[declaration of intent\u201d revealing the amount of personal funds the candidate intends to spend in excess of $350,000. 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441a-1(b)(1)(B). A candidate who does not intend to cross this threshold may simply declare an intent to spend no personal funds. 11 CFR \u00a7 400.20(a)(2) (2008). Second, within 24 hours of crossing or becoming obligated to cross the $350,000 mark, the candidate must file an \u201c[i]nitial notification.\u201d 2 U. S. C. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(C). Third, the candidate must file an \u201c[additional notification\u201d within 24 hours of making or becoming obligated to make each additional expenditure of $10,000 or more using personal funds. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(D). The initial and additional notifications must provide the date and amount of each expenditure from personal funds, and all notifications must be filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), all other candidates for the seat, and the national parties of all those candidates. \u00a7 441a-1(b)(1)(E). Failure to comply with the reporting requirements may result in civil and criminal penalties. \u00a7\u00a7 437g(a)(5)-(6), (d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">A non-self-financing candidate and the candidate\u2019s committee face less extensive disclosure requirements. Within 24 hours after receiving an \u201cinitial\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d notification filed by a self-financing opponent, a non-self-financing candidate must provide notice to the FEC and the national and state committees of the candidate\u2019s party if the non-self-financing candidate concludes based on the newly acquired information that the OPFA has passed the $350,000 mark. 11 CFR \u00a7 400.30(b)(2). In addition, when the additional contributions that a non-self-financing candidate is authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>to receive pursuant to the asymmetrical limitations scheme equals the OPFA, the non-self-financing candidate must notify the FEC and the appropriate national and state committees within 24 hours. \u00a7 400.31(e)(1)(ii). The non-self-financing candidate must also provide notice regarding any refunds of \u201cexcess funds\u201d (funds received under the increased limits but not used in the campaign). \u00a7\u00a7 400.50, 400.54. For their part, political parties must notify the FEC and the candidate they support within 24 hours of making any expenditures that exceed the normal limit for coordinated party expenditures. \u00a7 400.30(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Appellant Jack Davis was the Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives from New York\u2019s 26th Congressional District in 2004 and 2006. In both elections, he lost to the incumbent. In his brief, Davis discloses having spent $1.2 million, principally his own funds, on his 2004 campaign. Brief for Appellant 4. He reports spending $2.3 million in 2006, all but $126,000 of which came from personal funds. <em>Id., </em>at 13. His opponent in 2006 spent no personal funds. Indeed, although the OPFA calculation provided the opportunity for Davis\u2019 opponent to raise nearly $1.5 million under \u00a7 319(a)\u2019s asymmetrical limits, Davis\u2019 opponent adhered to the normal contribution limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Davis\u2019 2006 candidacy began in March 2006, when he filed with the FEC a \u201cStatement of Candidacy\u201d and, in compliance with \u00a7 319(b), declared that he intended to spend $1 million in personal funds during the general election. Two months later, in anticipation of this expenditure and its \u00a7 319 consequences, Davis filed suit against the FEC, requesting that \u00a7 319 be declared unconstitutional and that the FEC be enjoined from enforcing it during the 2006 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">After Davis declared his candidacy but before he filed suit, the FEC\u2019s general counsel notified him that it had reason to believe that he had violated \u00a7319 by failing to report per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>sonal expenditures during the 2004 campaign. The FEC proposed a conciliation agreement under which Davis would pay a substantial civil penalty. Davis responded by agreeing to toll the limitations period for an FEC enforcement action until resolution of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Davis filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and a three-judge panel was convened. BCRA \u00a7 403, 116 Stat. 113, note following 2 U. S. C. \u00a7 437h. While Davis requested that the case be decided before the general election campaign began on September 12, 2006, the FEC opposed the request, asserting the need for extensive discovery, and the request was denied. Ultimately, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Ruling on those motions, the District Court began by addressing Davis\u2019 standing <em>sua sponte. </em>The court concluded that Davis had standing, but rejected his claims on the merits and granted summary judgment for the FEC. 501 F. Supp. 2d 22 (2007). Davis then invoked BCRA\u2019s exclusive avenue for appellate review\u2014direct appeal to this Court. Note following \u00a7 437h. We deferred full consideration of our jurisdiction, 552 U. S. 1135 (2008), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Like the District Court, we must first ensure that we have jurisdiction to hear Davis\u2019 appeal. Article III restricts federal courts to the resolution of cases and controversies. <em>Arizonans for Official English </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>520 U. S. 43, 64 (1997). That restriction requires that the party invoking federal jurisdiction have standing \u2014 the \u201cpersonal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation.\u201d <em>Friends of Earth, Inc. </em>v. <em>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., </em>528 U. S. 167, 189 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). But it is not enough that the requisite interest exist at the outset. \u201cTo qualify as a case fit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>federal-court adjudication, \u2018an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arizonans for Official English, supra, </em>at 67. The FEC argues that Davis\u2019 appeal fails to present a constitutional case or controversy because Davis lacks standing and because his claims are moot. We address each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">As noted, the requirement that a claimant have \u201cstanding is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.\u201d <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992); see also <em>Arizonans for Official English, supra, </em>at 64. To qualify for standing, a claimant must present an injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s challenged behavior; and likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling. <em>Lujan, supra, </em>at 560-561.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The District Court held, and the parties do not dispute, that Davis possesses standing to challenge the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 319(b). When Davis filed suit, he had already declared his 2006 candidacy and had been forced by \u00a7 319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to spend more than $350,000 in personal funds. At that time, Davis faced the imminent threat that he would have to follow up on that disclosure with further notifications after he in fact passed the $350,000 mark. Securing a declaration that \u00a7 319(b)\u2019s requirements are unconstitutional and an injunction against their enforcement would have spared him from making those disclosures. That relief also would have removed the real threat that the FEC would pursue an enforcement action based on alleged violations of \u00a7 319(b) during his 2004 campaign. As a result, Davis possesses standing to challenge \u00a7 319(b)\u2019s disclosure requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The fact that Davis has standing to challenge \u00a7 319(b) does not necessarily mean that he also has standing to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>the scheme of contribution limitations that applies when \u00a7 319(a) comes into play. \u201c[Standing is not dispensed in gross.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>518 U. S. 343, 358, n. 6 (1996). Rather, \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press\u201d and \u201c'for each form of relief\u2019\u201d that is sought. <em>Daimler Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Cuno, </em>547 U. S. 332, 352 (2006) (quoting <em>Friends of Earth, supra, </em>at 185).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In light of these principles, the FEC argues that Davis lacks standing to attack \u00a7 319(a)\u2019s asymmetrical limits. When Davis commenced this action, his opponent had not yet qualified for the asymmetrical limits, and later, when his opponent did qualify to take advantage of those limits, he chose not to do so. Accordingly, the FEC argues that \u00a7 319(a) did not cause Davis any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">While the proof required to establish standing increases as the suit proceeds, see <em>Lujan, supra, </em>at 561, the standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed. <em>Friends of Earth, supra, </em>at 180; <em>Arizonans for Official English, supra, </em>at 68, n. 22. As noted above, the injury required for standing need not be actualized. A party facing prospective injury has standing to sue where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct. <em>Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>461 U. S. 95, 102 (1983); see also <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Farm Workers, </em>442 U. S. 289, 298 (1979) (A plaintiff may challenge the prospective operation of a statute that presents a realistic and impending threat of direct injury). Davis faced such an injury from the operation of \u00a7 319(a) when he filed suit. Davis had declared his candidacy and his intent to spend more than $350,000 of personal funds in the general election campaign whose onset was rapidly approaching. Section 319(a) would shortly burden his expenditure of personal funds by allowing his opponent to receive contributions on more favorable terms, and there was no indication that his opponent would forgo that opportunity. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>deed, the record at summary judgment indicated that most candidates who had the opportunity to receive expanded contributions had done so. App. 89. In these circumstances, we conclude that Davis faced the requisite injury from \u00a7 319(a) when he filed suit and has standing to challenge that provision\u2019s asymmetrical contribution scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The FEC\u2019s mootness argument also fails. This case closely resembles <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., </em>551 U. S. 449 (2007). There, Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL), a nonprofit, ideological advocacy corporation, wished to run radio and TV ads within 30 days of the 2004 Wisconsin primary, contrary to a restriction imposed by BCRA. WRTL sued the FEC, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Although the suit was not resolved before the 2004 election, we rejected the FEC\u2019s claim of mootness, finding that the case \u201cfit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 462. That \u201cexception applies where \u2018(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Kemna, </em>523 U. S. 1, 17 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">In <em>WRTL, </em>\u201cdespite BCRA\u2019s command that the cas[e] be expedited \u2018to the greatest possible extent,\u2019 \u201d WRTL\u2019s claims could not reasonably be resolved before the election concluded. 551 U. S., at 462 (quoting \u00a7 403(a)(4), 116 Stat. 114, note following 2 U. S. C. \u00a7 437h). Similarly, in this case despite BCRA\u2019s mandate to expedite and Davis\u2019 request that his case be resolved before the 2004 general election season commenced, Davis\u2019 case could not be resolved before the 2006 election concluded, demonstrating that his claims are capable of evading review.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>As to the second prong of the exception, even though WRTL raised an as-applied challenge, we found its suit capable of repetition where \u201cWRTL credibly claimed that it planned on running \u2018materially similar\u2019 future\u201d ads subject to BCRA\u2019s prohibition and had, in fact, sought an injunction that would permit such an ad during the 2006 election. 551 U. S., at 463 (some internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the FEC conceded in its brief that Davis\u2019 \u00a7 319(a) claim would be capable of repetition if Davis planned to self-finance another bid for a House seat. Brief for Appellee 14, 20-21, and n. 5. Davis subsequently made a public statement expressing his intent to do so. See Reply Brief 16 (citing Terreri, Democrat Davis Confirms He\u2019ll Run Again for Congress, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, Mar. 27, 2008, p. 5B). As a result, we are satisfied that Davis\u2019 facial challenge is not moot.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">We turn to the merits of Davis\u2019 claim that the First Amendment is violated by the contribution limits that apply when \u00a7 319(a) comes into play. Under this scheme, as previously noted, when a candidate spends more than $350,000 in personal funds and creates what the statute apparently regards as a financial imbalance, that candidate\u2019s opponent may qualify to receive both larger individual contributions than would otherwise be allowed and unlimited coordinated party expenditures. Davis contends that \u00a7 319(a) unconstitutionally burdens his exercise of his First Amendment right to make unlimited expenditures of his personal funds because making expenditures that create the imbalance has the effect of enabling his opponent to raise more money and to use that money to finance speech that counteracts and thus diminishes the effectiveness of Davis\u2019 own speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">If \u00a7 319(a) simply raised the contribution limits for all candidates, Davis\u2019 argument would plainly fail. This Court has previously sustained the facial constitutionality of limits on discrete and aggregate individual contributions and on coordinated party expenditures. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>424 U. S. 1, 23-35, 38, 46-47, and n. 53 (1976) <em>(per curiam); Federal Election Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., </em>533 U. S. 431, 437, 465 (2001) <em>(Colorado II). </em>At the same time, the Court has recognized that such limits implicate First Amendment interests and that they cannot stand unless they are \u201cclosely drawn\u201d to serve a \u201csufficiently important interest,\u201d such as preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption. See, <em>e. g., McConnell </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>540 U. S. 93, 136, 138, n. 40 (2003); <em>Colorado II, supra, </em>at 456; <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em>528 U. S. 377, 387-388 (2000); <em>Buckley, supra, </em>at 25-30, 38. When contribution limits are challenged as too restrictive, we have extended a measure of deference to the judgment of the legislative body that enacted the law. See, <em>e. g., Randall </em>v. <em>Sorrell, </em>548 U. S. 230, 248 (2006) (plurality opinion); <em>Nixon, supra, </em>at 396-397; <em>Buckley, supra, </em>at 30, 111, 103-104. But we have held that limits that are too low cannot stand. <em>Randall, </em>548 U. S., at 246-262; <em>id., </em>at 263 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">There is, however, no constitutional basis for attacking contribution limits on the ground that they are too high. Congress has no constitutional obligation to limit contributions at all; and if Congress concludes that allowing contributions of a certain amount does not create an undue risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption, a candidate who wishes to restrict an opponent\u2019s fundraising cannot argue that the Constitution demands that contributions be regulated more strictly. Consequently, if \u00a7 319(a)\u2019s elevated contribution limits applied across the board, Davis would not have any basis for challenging those limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Section 319(a), however, does not raise the contribution limits across the board. Rather, it raises the limits only for the non-self-financing candidate and does so only when the self-financing candidate\u2019s expenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA threshold to be exceeded. We have never upheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes different contribution limits for candidates who are competing against each other, and we agree with Davis that this scheme impermissibly burdens his First Amendment right to spend his own money for campaign speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In <em>Buckley, </em>we soundly rejected a cap on a candidate\u2019s expenditure of personal funds to finance campaign speech. We held that a \u201ccandidate . . . has a First Amendment right to engage in the discussion of public issues and vigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election\u201d and that a cap on personal expenditures imposes \u201ca substantial,\u201d \u201ccleajr],\u201d and \u201cdirecft]\u201d restraint on that right. 424 U. S., at 52-53. We found that the cap at issue was not justified by \u201c[t]he primary governmental interest\u201d proffered in its defense, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cthe prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political process.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 53. Far from preventing these evils, \u201cthe use of personal funds,\u201d we observed, \u201creduces the candidate\u2019s dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which . . . contribution limitations are directed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We also rejected the argument that the expenditure cap could be justified on the ground that it served \u201c[t]he ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elective office.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 54. This putative interest, we noted, was \u201cclearly not sufficient to justify the . . . infringement of fundamental First Amendment rights.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\"><em>Buckley\u2019s </em>emphasis on the fundamental nature of the right to spend personal funds for campaign speech is instructive. While BCRA does not impose a cap on a candidate\u2019s expend\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ture of personal funds, it imposes an unprecedented penalty-on any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right. Section 319(a) requires a candidate to choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations. Many candidates who can afford to make large personal expenditures to support their campaigns may choose to do so despite \u00a7 319(a), but they must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden if they make that choice. See <em>Day </em>v. <em>Holahan, </em>34 F. 3d 1356, 1359-1360 (CA8 1994) (concluding that a Minnesota law that increased a candidate\u2019s expenditure limits and eligibility for public funds based on independent expenditures against her candidacy burdened the speech of those making the independent expenditures); Brief for Appellee 29 (conceding that \u201c[\u00a7]319 does impose some consequences on a candidate\u2019s choice to self-finance beyond certain amounts\u201d). Under \u00a7 319(a), the vigorous exercise of the right to use personal funds to finance campaign speech produces fundraising advantages for opponents in the competitive context of electoral politics. Cf. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Util. Comm\u2019n of Cal., </em>475 U. S. 1,14 (1986) (plurality opinion) (finding infringement on speech rights where if the plaintiff spoke it could \u201cbe forced ... to help disseminate hostile views\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The resulting drag on First Amendment rights is not constitutional simply because it attaches as a consequence of a statutorily imposed choice. In <em>Buckley, </em>we held that Congress \u201cmay engage in public financing of election campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure limitations\u201d even though we found an independent limit on overall campaign expenditures to be unconstitutional. 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65; see <em>id., </em>at 54-58. But the choice involved in <em>Buckley </em>was quite different from the choice imposed by \u00a7 319(a). In <em>Buckley, </em>a candidate, by forgoing public financing, could retain the unfettered right to make unlimited per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>sonal expenditures. Here, \u00a7 319(a) does not provide any way in which a candidate can exercise that right without abridgment. Instead, a candidate who wishes to exercise that right has two choices: abide by a limit on personal expenditures or endure the burden that is placed on that right by the activation of a scheme of discriminatory contribution limits. The choice imposed by \u00a7 319(a) is not remotely parallel to that in <em>Buckley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Because \u00a7 319(a) imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech, that provision cannot stand unless it is \u201cjustified by a compelling state interest,\u201d <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., </em>479 U. S. 238, 256 (1986); see also, <em>e. g., McConnell, </em>540 U. S., at 205; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce, </em>494 U. S. 652, 657-658 (1990); <em>id., </em>at 680 (Scalia, J., dissenting); <em>id., </em>at 701, 702-703 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm., </em>470 U.

S. 765, 786 (1978); <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>518 U. S. 604, 609 (1996) <em>(Colorado I) </em>(principal opinion); <em>id., </em>at 640-641 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). No such justification is present here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The burden imposed by \u00a7 319(a) on the expenditure of personal funds is not justified by any governmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption. The <em>Buckley </em>Court reasoned that reliance on personal funds <em>re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number><em>duces </em>the threat of corruption, and therefore \u00a7 319(a), by discouraging use of personal funds, disserves the anticorruption interest. Similarly, given Congress\u2019 judgment that liberalized limits for non-self-financing candidates do not unduly imperil anticorruption interests, it is hard to imagine how the denial of liberalized limits to self-financing candidates can be regarded as serving anticorruption goals sufficiently to justify the resulting constitutional burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The Government maintains that \u00a7319(a)\u2019s asymmetrical limits are justified because they \u201clevel electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth.\u201d Brief for Appellee 34. \u201cCongress enacted Section 319,\u201d the Government writes, \u201cto reduce <em>the natural advantage </em>that wealthy individuals possess in campaigns for federal office.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 33 (emphasis added). Our prior decisions, however, provide no support for the proposition that this is a legitimate government objective. See <em>Nixon, </em>528 U. S., at 428 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\u201c \u2018[Preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption are the only legitimate and compelling government interests thus far identified for restricting campaign finances\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm., supra, </em>at 496-497)); <em>Randall, </em>548 U. S., at 268 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (noting \u201cthe interests the Court has recognized as compelling, <em>i. e., </em>the prevention of corruption or the appearance thereof\u201d). On the contrary, in <em>Buckley, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he interest in equalizing the financial resources of candidates\u201d did not provide a \u201cjustification for restricting\u201d candidates\u2019 overall campaign expenditures, particularly where equalization \u201cmight serve ... to handicap a candidate who lacked substantial name recognition or exposure of his views before the start of the campaign.\u201d 424 U. S., at 56-57. We have similarly held that the interest \u201cin equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections\u201d cannot support a cap on expenditures for \u201cexpress advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates,\u201d as \u201cthe concept that govern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>merit may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 48-49; see also <em>McConnell, supra, </em>at 227 (noting, in assessing standing, that there is no legal right to have the same resources to influence the electoral process). Cf. <em>Austin, supra, </em>at 705 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (rejecting as \u201cantithetical to the First Amendment\u201d \u201cthe notion that the government has a legitimate interest in restricting the quantity of speech to equalize the relative influence of speakers on elections\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The argument that a candidate\u2019s speech may be restricted in order to \u201clevel electoral opportunities\u201d has ominous implications because it would permit Congress to arrogate the voters\u2019 authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for office. See <em>Bellotti, supra, </em>at 791-792 (\u201c[T]he people in our democracy are entrusted with the responsibility for judging and evaluating the relative merits of conflicting arguments\u201d and \u201cmay consider, in making their judgment, the source and credibility of the advocate\u201d). Different candidates have different strengths. Some are wealthy; others have wealthy supporters who are willing to make large contributions. Some are celebrities; some have the benefit of a well-known family name. Leveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election. The Constitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress, the power to choose the Members of the House of Representatives, Art. I, \u00a7 2, and it is a dangerous business for Congress to use the election laws to influence the voters\u2019 choices. See <em>Bellotti, supra, </em>at 791, n. 31 (The \u201c[g]overnment is forbidden to assume the task of ultimate judgment, lest the people lose their ability to govern themselves\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Finally, the Government contends that \u00a7 319(a) is justified because it ameliorates the deleterious effects that result from the tight limits that federal election law places on indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>vidual campaign contributions and coordinated party expenditures. These limits, it is argued, make it harder for candidates who are not wealthy to raise funds and therefore provide a substantial advantage for wealthy candidates. Accordingly, \u00a7 319(a) can be seen, not as a legislative effort to interfere with the natural operation of the electoral process, but as a legislative effort to mitigate the untoward consequences of Congress\u2019 own handiwork and restore \u201cthe \u2018normal relationship\u2019 between a candidate\u2019s financial resources and the level of popular support for his candidacy.\u201d Brief for Appellee 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Whatever the merits of this argument as an original matter, it is fundamentally at war with the analysis of expenditure and contributions limits that this Court adopted in <em>Buckley </em>and has applied in subsequent cases. The advantage that wealthy candidates now enjoy and that \u00a7 319(a) seeks to reduce is an advantage that flows directly from Buckley\u2019s disparate treatment of expenditures and contributions. If that approach is sound\u2014and the Government does not urge us to hold otherwise<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2014it is hard to see how undoing the consequences of that decision can be viewed as a compelling interest. If the normally applicable limits on individual contributions and coordinated party contributions are seriously distorting the electoral process, if they are feeding a \u201cpublic perception that wealthy people can buy seats in Congress,\u201d Brief for Appellee 34, and if those limits are not needed in order to combat corruption, then the obvious remedy is to raise or eliminate those limits. But the unprece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>dented step of imposing different contribution and coordinated party expenditure limits on candidates vying for the same seat is antithetical to the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The remaining issue that we must consider is the constitutionality of \u00a7319(b)\u2019s disclosure requirements. \u201c[W]e have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U. S., at 64. As a result, we have closely scrutinized disclosure requirements, including requirements governing independent expenditures made to further individuals\u2019 political speech. <em>Id., </em>at 75. To survive this scrutiny, significant encroachments \u201ccannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 64. Instead, there must be \u201ca \u2018relevant correlation\u2019 or 'substantial relation\u2019 between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed,\u201d and the governmental interest \u201cmust survive exacting scrutiny.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(footnotes omitted). That is, the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights. <em>Id., </em>at 68, 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The \u00a7 319(b) disclosure requirements were designed to implement the asymmetrical contribution limits provided for in \u00a7 319(a), and as discussed above, \u00a7 319(a) violates the First Amendment. In light of that holding, the burden imposed by the \u00a7 319(b) requirements cannot be justified, and it follows that they too are unconstitutional.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">In sum, we hold that \u00a7\u00a7 319(a) and (b) violate the First Amendment.

I agree completely with the District Court\u2019s opinion, specifically its adherence to our decision in <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>540 U. S. 93 (2003). While I would affirm for the reasons given by the District Court, I believe it appropriate to add these additional comments on the premise that underlies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>constitutional prohibition on expenditure limitations, and on my reasons for concluding that the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment represents a modest, sensible, and plainly constitutional attempt by Congress to minimize the advantages enjoyed by wealthy candidates vis-a-vis those who must rely on the support of others to fund their pursuit of public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">According to the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>424 U. S. 1, 18 (1976) <em>(per curiam), </em>the vice that condemns expenditure limitations is that they \u201cimpose direct quantity restrictions\u201d on political speech.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A limitation on the amount of money that a candidate is permitted to spend, the <em>Buckley </em>Court concluded, \u201creduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 19. Accordingly, the Court determined that any regulation of the quantity of money spent on campaigns for office ought to be viewed as a direct regulation of speech itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Justice White firmly disagreed with the <em>Buckley </em>Court\u2019s holding on expenditure limitations, explaining that such regulations should be analyzed, not as direct restrictions on speech, but rather as akin to time, place, and manner regulations, which will be upheld \u201cso long as the purposes they serve are legitimate and sufficiently substantial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 264 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Although I did not participate in the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckley, </em>I have since been persuaded that Justice White \u2014 who maintained his steadfast opposition to <em>Buckley\u2019s </em>view of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>penditure limits, see, <em>e. g., Federal Election Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm., </em>470 U. S. 480, 507-512 (1985) (dissenting opinion)\u2014was correct. Indeed, it was <em>Buckley </em>that represented a break from 65 years of established practice, as well as a probable departure from the views of the Framers of the relevant provisions of the Constitution itself. See <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Sorrell, </em>548 U. S. 230, 274, 280-281 (2006) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In my view, a number of purposes, both legitimate and substantial, may justify the imposition of reasonable limitations on the expenditures permitted during the course of any single campaign. For one, such limitations would \u201cfree candidates and their staffs from the interminable burden of fundraising.\u201d <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>518 U. S. 604, 649 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Moreover, the imposition of reasonable limitations would likely have the salutary effect of improving the quality of the exposition of ideas. After all, orderly debate is always more enlightening than a shouting match that awards points on the basis of decibels rather than reasons. Quantity limitations are commonplace in any number of other contexts in which high-value speech occurs. Litigants in this Court pressing issues of the utmost importance to the Nation are allowed only a fixed time for oral debate and a maximum number of pages for written argument. As listeners and as readers, judges need time to reflect on the merits of an issue; repetitious arguments are disfavored and are usually especially unpersuasive. Indeed, experts in the art of advocacy agree that \u201clawyers go on for too long, and when they do it doesn\u2019t help their case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It seems to me that Congress is entitled to make the judgment that voters deserve the same courtesy and the same opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>nity to reflect as judges; flooding the airwaves with slogans and sound bites may well do more to obscure the issues than to enlighten listeners. At least in the context of elections, the notion that rules limiting the quantity of speech are just as offensive to the First Amendment as rules limiting the content of speech is plainly incorrect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">If, as I have come to believe, Congress could attempt to reduce the millionaire candidate\u2019s advantage by imposing reasonable limits on <em>all </em>candidates\u2019 expenditures, it follows <em>a fortiori </em>that the eminently reasonable scheme before us today survives constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Even accepting the <em>Buckley </em>Court\u2019s holding that expenditure limits as such are uniquely incompatible with the First Amendment, it remains my firm conviction that the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment represents a good-faith attempt by Congress to regulate, within the bounds of the Constitution, one particularly pernicious feature of many contemporary political campaigns.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">It cannot be gainsaid that the twin rationales at the heart of the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment \u2014 reducing the importance of wealth as a criterion for public office and countering the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>ception that seats in the United States Congress are available for purchase by the wealthiest bidder \u2014 are important Government interests. It is also evident that Congress, in enacting the provision, crafted a solution that was carefully tailored to those concerns. Davis insists, however, that the Government\u2019s interests are insufficiently weighty to justify what he believes are intrusions upon his rights under the First Amendment and the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, and that, regardless of the strength of the justifications offered, Congress\u2019 solution is not sufficiently tailored to addressing the twin concerns it has identified. His arguments are unpersuasive on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The thrust of Davis\u2019 First Amendment challenge is that by relaxing the contribution limits applicable to the opponent of a self-funding candidate, the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment punishes the candidate who chooses to self-fund. Extrapolating from the zero-sum nature of a political race, Davis insists that any benefit conferred upon a self-funder\u2019s opponent thereby works a detriment to the self-funding candidate. Accordingly, he argues, the scheme burdens the self-funding candidate\u2019s First Amendment right to speak freely and to participate fully in the political process.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">But Davis cannot show that the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment causes him \u2014 or any other self-funding candidate \u2014 any First Amendment injury whatsoever. The Millionaire\u2019s Amendment quiets no speech at all. On the contrary, it does no more than assist the opponent of a self-funding candidate in his attempts to make his voice heard; this amplification in no way mutes the voice of the millionaire, who remains able to speak as loud and as long as he likes in support of his campaign. Enhancing the speech of the millionaire\u2019s opponent, far from contravening the First Amendment, actually advances its core principles. If only one candidate can make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>himself heard, the voter\u2019s ability to make an informed choice is impaired.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And the self-funding candidate\u2019s ability to engage meaningfully in the political process is in no way undermined by this provision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Even were we to credit Davis\u2019 view that the benefit conferred on the self-funding candidate\u2019s opponent burdens the self-funder\u2019s First Amendment rights, the purposes of the amendment surely justify its effects. The Court is simply wrong when it suggests that the \u201cgovernmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 740, is the sole governmental interest sufficient to support campaign finance regulations. See <em>ante, </em>at 741-743. It is true, of course, that in upholding the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971\u2019s (FECA) limits on the size of contributions to political campaigns, the <em>Buckley </em>Court held that preventing both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption were Government interests of sufficient weight that they justified any infringement upon First Amendment freedoms that resulted from FECA\u2019s contribution limits; the Court explained that, \u201c[t]o the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo </em>from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined. ... Of almost equal concern ... is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.\u201d 424 U. S., at 26-27. It is also true that the Court found that same interest insufficient to justify FECA\u2019s expenditure limitations. <em>Id., </em>at 45-46, 52-56. But it does not follow that the <em>Buckley </em>Court concluded that <em>only </em>the interest in combating corruption and the appearance of corruption can justify congressional regulation of campaign financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Indeed, we have long recognized the strength of an independent governmental interest in reducing both the influence of wealth on the outcomes of elections, and the appearance that wealth alone dictates those results. In case after case, we have held that statutes designed to protect against the undue influence of aggregations of wealth on the political process \u2014 where such statutes are responsive to the identified evil \u2014 do not contravene the First Amendment. See, <em>e.g., Austin </em>v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce, </em>494 U. S. 652, 660 (1990) (upholding statute designed to combat \u201cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas\u201d); <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., </em>479 U. S. 238, 257 (1986) (\u201cTh[e] concern over the corrosive influence of concentrated corporate wealth reflects the conviction that it is important to protect the integrity of the marketplace of political ideas. . . . Direct corporate spending on political activity raises the prospect that resources amassed in the economic marketplace may be used to provide an unfair advantage in the political marketplace\u201d); cf. <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>395 U. S. 367, 390 (1969) (upholding constitutionality of several components of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s \u201cfair coverage\u201d requirements, and explaining that \u201c[i]t is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>truth will ultimately prevail, rather than to countenance monopolization of that market\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Although the focus of our cases has been on aggregations of corporate rather than individual wealth, there is no reason that their logic \u2014 specifically, their concerns about the corrosive and distorting effects of wealth on our political process \u2014 is not equally applicable in the context of individual wealth. For, as we explained in <em>McConnell, </em>\u201cCongress\u2019 historical concern with the \u2018political potentialities of wealth\u2019 and their \u2018untoward consequences for the democratic process\u2019. .. has long reached beyond corporate money,\u201d 540 U. S., at 116 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Automobile Workers, </em>352 U. S. 567, 577-578 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Minimizing the effect of concentrated wealth on our political process, and the concomitant interest in addressing the dangers that attend the perception that political power can be purchased, are, therefore, sufficiently weighty objectives to justify significant congressional action. And, not only was Congress motivated by proper and weighty goals in crafting the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment, the details of the scheme it devised are genuinely responsive to the problems it identified. The statute\u2019s \u201cOpposition Personal Funds Amount\u201d formula permits a self-funding candidate to spend as much money as he wishes, while taking into account fund-raising by the relevant campaigns; it thereby ensures that a candidate who happens to enjoy a significant fundraising advantage against a self-funding opponent does not reap a windfall as a result of the enhanced contribution limits. Rather, the self-funder\u2019s opponent may avail himself of the enhanced contribution limits only until parity is achieved, at which point he becomes again ineligible for contributions above the normal maximum. See \u00a7\u00a7 441a-1(a)(1)(A)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">It seems uncontroversial that \u201cthere is no good reason to allow disparities in wealth to be translated into disparities in political power. A well-functioning democracy distinguishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>between market processes of purchase and sale on the one hand and political processes of voting and reason-giving on the other.\u201d Sunstein, Political Equality and Unintended Consequences, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 1390 (1994). In light of that clear truth, Congress\u2019 carefully crafted attempt to reduce the distinct advantages enjoyed by wealthy candidates for congressional office does not offend the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Davis\u2019 equal protection argument, which the Court finds unnecessary to address, <em>ante, </em>at 744, n. 9, fares no better. He claims that by permitting only the self-funder\u2019s opponent to avail himself of the increased contribution limits, the statute creates an unwarranted disparity between the self-funder and his opponent. But, as we explained in <em>McConnell, </em>\u201cCongress is fully entitled to consider . . . real-world differences . . . when crafting a system of campaign finance regulation.\u201d 540 U. S., at 188. And <em>Buckley </em>itself acknowledged, in the course of upholding FECA\u2019s public financing scheme, that \u201cthe Constitution does not require Congress to treat all declared candidates the same.\u201d 424 U. S., at 97. It blinks reality to contend that the millionaire candidate is situated identically to a nonmillionaire opponent, and Congress was under no obligation to indulge any such fiction. Accordingly, Davis has failed to establish that he was deprived of the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">In sum, I share Judge Wright\u2019s view that nothing in the Constitution \u201cprevents us, as a political community, from making certain modest but important changes in the kind of process we want for selecting our political leaders,\u201d Wright, Politics and the Constitution: Is Money Speech? 85 Yale L. J. 1001, 1005 (1976). In my judgment, the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment represents just such a change. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\"> The <em>Buckley </em>Court invalidated two different types of limits on campaign expenditures: limits on the amount of \u201cpersonal or family resources\u201d a candidate could spend on his own campaign, 424 U. S., at 51-54, and overall limits on campaign expenditures, <em>id,., </em>at 54-60.

But campaign expenditures are not <em>themselves </em>\u201ccore political speech\u201d; they merely may <em>enable </em>such speech (as well as its repetition <em>ad nauseam). </em>In my judgment, it is simply not the case that the First Amendment \u201cprovides the same measure of protection\u201d to the use of money to enable speech as it does to speech itself. <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em>528 U.

In neither event is his engagement in the political process in any sense impeded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer</author>\n<p id=\"AYe\">joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Agreeing with the Court that appellant Jack Davis has standing and that this case is not moot, I join Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion.
