This court granted Williams a certificate of appealability only on the issue whether her counsel was ineffective for not filing a notice of appeal at her request. The district court rejected this claim on the ground that it was barred by the appeal waiver in Williams\u2019s plea agreement. The Government additionally argues that Williams\u2019s counsel was not ineffective even if he didn\u2019t file a notice of appeal at Williams\u2019s request because all of the issues Williams sought to raise in a direct appeal were barred by the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-23\">As the appeal waiver in the plea agreement specifically excepted ineffective assistance of counsel claims, Williams\u2019s claim was not barred by the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. White, </em>307 F.3d 336, 343 n. 4 (5th Cir.2002) (acknowledging defendant\u2019s ability to exclude specific claims from appeal waiver). The Government\u2019s alternative argument is also without merit as the failure to file a requested notice of appeal is per se ineffective assistance of counsel even if a direct appeal would be barred by an appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Tapp, </em>491 F.3d 263, 265-66 (5th Cir.2007). As the district court did not make a factual determination whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Williams\u2019s counsel failed to file a requested notice of appeal, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for a factual determination on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b943-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
