Gardner argues that the sentence, which was the statutory maximum and above the Guidelines sentencing range of 10 to 16 months of imprisonment, was unreasonable. We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">We review a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen we review a sentence for reasonableness, we do not, as the district court did, determine the exact sentence to be imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe must evaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d <em>id., </em>there are also \u201csentences outside the range of reasonableness that do not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a) ... that ... the district court may not impose,\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006). We have stated that \u201cwhen imposing a sentence falling far outside of the Guidelines range, based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u2018[a]n extraordinary reduction must be supported by extraordinary circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. McVay, </em>447 F.3d 1348, 1357 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Dalton, </em>404 F.3d 1029, 1033 (8th Cir.2005)) (second alteration in original). The same is true for an extraordinary upward variance. <em>See United States v. Valdes, </em>500 F.3d 1291, 1292 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">The extraordinary upward variance of Gardner\u2019s sentence, from the Guidelines range of 10 to 16 months of imprisonment to 36 months of imprisonment \u2014 more than double the high end of the advisory range, was not supported by extraordinary circumstances. The district court relied on \u201cthe significant level of [Gardner\u2019s] involvement in the scheme\u201d and the need for deterrence to justify the upward variance. Neither of these circumstances are sufficiently extraordinary to justify the extraordinary variance imposed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">Although the district court stated that the facts \u201cprobably ... did not support an aggravating role enhancement,\u201d it relied on Gardner\u2019s role as a \u201ccritical participant\u201d to justify the upward variance. Gardner\u2019s sentence was nine months longer than a sentence at the high end of the advisory Guidelines range, had the district court applied the maximum aggravating-role enhancement of four levels. <em>See </em>United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.1 &amp; Sentencing Table (Nov.2006). If Gardner\u2019s role in the scheme was insufficient to warrant an aggravating-role enhancement, then Gardner\u2019s role surely was not so extraordinary that it supported the upward variance imposed by the district court. In the absence of any extraordinary circumstances, Gardner\u2019s extraordinary variance was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1288 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Because the sentence imposed was unreasonable, we</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">VACATE AND REMAND FOR RE-SENTENCING.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
