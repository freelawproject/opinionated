The district court determined that Espericueta\u2019s claims should have been brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and that Espericueta had not shown that he was entitled to bring his claims under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Espericueta argues that he was entitled to raise his claims under \u00a7 2241 because (1) he was factually and actually innocent of the firearms possession on which an enhancement of his sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines was based; and (2) his remedies under \u00a7 2255 are inadequate or ineffective because he has already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion and his claims do not meet the standard for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Because Espericueta\u2019s challenge to the sentencing court\u2019s application of the Guidelines is not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that the offenses of which he was convicted no longer qualify as violations of law, he has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that he was not entitled to bring his claims under the \u00a7 2255 savings clause was erroneous. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Furthermore, a prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion, or the inability to meet the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, does not make the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate or ineffective. See <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Espericueta also argues that because the district court determined that he failed to meet the <em>Reyes-Requena </em>test, the application of \u00a7 2255 to his case impermissibly violated his constitutional rights under the First Amendment and the Suspension Clause to file a habeas petition. <em>Reyes-Requena </em>is binding precedent, and the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 does not unconstitutionally suspend a prisoner\u2019s right to seek a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, </em>305 F.3d 343, 346-47 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b830-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
