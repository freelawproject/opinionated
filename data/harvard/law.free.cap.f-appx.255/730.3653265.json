Tchakounte asserts that his right to due process was violated because a pretrial hearing before the Immigration Judge was not recorded or its contents otherwise made part of the record. We have independently reviewed the record with respect to this claim and find that Tchakounte has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the failure to record the hearing. <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320 (4th Cir.2002); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.9 (2007). Next, we find no abuse of discretion in the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of a continuance for adjudication of Tchakounte\u2019s second 1-130 petition. <em>See Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231-33 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
