We affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-26\">1. Moore\u2019s complaint raised claims related to his 2002 arrest and subsequent confinement from August 2002 to October 2002 and from December 2003 to May 2004. Moore did not file his complaint until November 14, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-27\">2. Moore argues on appeal only that he raised a claim for malicious prosecution that he asserts did not accrue until the charges against him were dismissed on November 16, 2005. A claim of malicious prosecution standing alone does not violate the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>States Constitution. <em>Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 942 (5th Cir.2003) (en banc).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-4\">3. Moore thus fails to present a cognizable federal claim. We may affirm the district court on any alternative basis supported by the record. <em>Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
