Pursuant to the plea agreement, Imeh waived the ability to appeal his sentence, and agreed to cooperate with the government. The government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts in the indictment. Imeh never filed a timely notice of appeal. However, he did eventually file a <em>pro se </em>motion to file an untimely notice of appeal, arguing that he instructed his original attorney to file an appeal, but his attorney never did. The district court denied Imeh\u2019s motion stating that Imeh had waived all appellate rights in his plea agreement. Imeh appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to file an untimely notice of appeal. We review the district court\u2019s denial for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 846 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-19\">Imeh\u2019s plea agreement provided specifically that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-20\">Defendant is aware that 18 U.S.C. 3742 affords a defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>waives the right to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined.... Defendant is aware that 28 U.S.C. 2255 affords the right to contest or \u201ccollaterally attack\u201d a conviction or sentence after the conviction or sentence has become final. The defendant waives the right to contest his conviction or sentence by means of any post-conviction proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Based on the language in his plea agreement and his plea colloquy with the district court, Imeh only waived the right to appeal his sentence. <em>See United States v. Palmer, </em>456 F.3d 484, 487-89 (5th Cir.2006). He retained the right to challenge his conviction on direct appeal. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, Imeh had not waived all appellate rights, and the district court improperly relied on this ground in denying his motion. Still, Imeh must provide a legal basis for his motion in order to show an abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4) provides that a district court may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal \u201cupon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause.\u201d Imeh\u2019s motion claimed that his original attorney failed to file a timely notice of appeal despite Imeh\u2019s request to do so. We have recognized that failure to file a timely notice of appeal after being instructed to do so by a client constitutes ineffective assistance, and thus excusable neglect. <em>Clark, </em>193 F.3d at 846-47 (5th Cir.1999). Because the district court disposed of Imeh\u2019s motion on waiver grounds, no evidence has been heard on whether Imeh\u2019s counsel performed ineffectively in failing to file a timely notice. Therefore, we VACATE the district court\u2019s order denying the motion and REMAND for further proceedings to evaluate whether Imeh can establish excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Imeh\u2019s appointed appellate counsel has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief as required by <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), claiming that Imeh has no nonfrivolous grounds for appeal. This court\u2019s independent review of counsel\u2019s brief and the record discloses a nonfrivolous issue as to whether the district court\u2019s failure to admonish Imeh during the rearraignment about its authority to order restitution constitutes reversible plain error. An appeal focusing on the district court\u2019s failure to admonish under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) concerns the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s plea, and thus the issue of conviction. <em>See United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386, 394 (5th Cir.2000). Therefore, assuming Imeh is able to file a new notice of appeal, Imeh has not waived his ability to appeal this issue through his prior waiver of appellate rights concerning sentencing. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is DENIED. If Imeh files a notice of appeal as to his conviction, counsel is ORDERED to submit a brief addressing this issue and any other non-frivolous issues counsel deems appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b864-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
