Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-60 (4th Cir.2005). <em>See United States v. Gelin, </em>No. 04-4486, 2006 WL 521745 (4th Cir. Mar. 3, 2006) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Debreus, </em>No. 04-4517, 2005 WL 1822432 (4th Cir. Aug. 3, 2005) (unpublished). The district court was instructed to first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines and make all factual findings appropriate for that determination. The court was then instructed to consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), and then impose a sentence. The court ordered Debreus be sentenced to life imprisonment, as the court had ordered during the initial sentencing procedure. The sentence was within the guidelines. With respect to Gelin, the court accepted an argument concerning the enhancement for Gelin\u2019s role in the offense, lowered by two levels Gelin\u2019s offense level and sentenced him to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">Debreus contends his life sentence is so severe, the evidence supporting the enhancements must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Otherwise, he claims his sentence violates the Sixth and Eighth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-18\">This court will affirm a sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). A sentence that falls within the properly calculated advisory guidelines range is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">We find there is no support for Debreus\u2019 argument. Because the sentence was based upon the properly calculated guidelines range of imprisonment and the district court was aware the guidelines were advisory and imposed sentence after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find it reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Gelin argues that the enhancements to his offense level were based upon testimonial hearsay not subject to cross-examination in violation of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). He further claims his Fifth Amendment right to due process was violated because the hearsay did not have the indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission at trial of testimonial statements that are not subject to cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. None of the courts to have considered the effect of <em>Crawford post-Booker </em>have concluded that the rule announced in <em>Crawford </em>applies at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Katzopoulos, </em>437 F.3d 569, 576 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201cThough the cases may be a broad signal of the future, there is nothing specific in <em>Blakely, Booker, </em>or <em>Crawford </em>that would cause this Court to reverse its long-settled rule of law that [the] Confrontation Clause permits the admission of testimonial hearsay at sentencing proceedings.\u201d); <em>United States v. Beydoun, </em>469 F.3d 102, 108 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Luciano, </em>414 F.3d 174, 179 (1st Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>413 F.3d 239, 243 (2d Cir.2005) (same). Accordingly, we find Gelin\u2019s <em>Crawford </em>argument without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">With respect to Gelin\u2019s Fifth Amendment argument, the sentencing court may consider any relevant information, including hearsay evidence, provided that the information has \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>See United States v. Uwaeme, </em>975 F.2d 1016, 1021 (4th Cir.1992); <em>see also U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 6A1.3(a) (2003). We find there was no error when the court considered statements in the PSR from persons who purchased crack cocaine from Gelin. The statements were reasonably reliable. Gelin fails to show how the statements were not reliable. Accordingly, Gelin\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">We affirm Debreus\u2019 and Gelin\u2019s sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
