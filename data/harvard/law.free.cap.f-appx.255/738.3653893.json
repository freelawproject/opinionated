He received a sentence of 115 months\u2019 imprisonment. Davis\u2019 counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding there are no meritorious issues for appeal but raising as potential issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>whether the district court fully complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and whether Davis\u2019 sentence was reasonable. Although advised of his right to do so, Davis has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Counsel first raises the issue of whether the district court fully complied with Rule 11, but identifies no error in the Rule 11 proceeding. After a thorough review of the record, we find the district court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Davis next questions whether his sentence was reasonable. This Court will affirm a sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">In the presentence report, because Davis had at least two prior convictions for controlled substances, his offense level was 24. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (2006). He received a two-level enhancement because the firearm involved in the offense was stolen, USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A), and a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. Thus, his total offense level was 28. With a criminal history category VI, Davis\u2019 advisory guideline range was 140 to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, because the statute under which he was convicted called for a maximum sentence of 10 years, his guideline range was 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. After the district court sustained Davis\u2019 objection to the obstruction of justice enhancement and applied a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, the court established Davis\u2019 guideline range at 92 to 115 months. After considering and examining the sentencing guidelines and the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors, the district court sentenced Davis to 115 months\u2019 imprisonment. We find the district court\u2019s imposition of a 115-month sentence, which was within the advisory guidelines range and below the statutory maximum, was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Davis, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If he requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Davis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
