Ovalles was one of eight crew members of a small \u201cgo-fast\u201d vessel transporting approximately 1250\u2014 1625 kilograms of cocaine. On appeal, Ovalles argues that the district court erred by denying him a mitigating-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, to reflect his minimal or minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense for clear error, and the defendant bears the burden of establishing his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937-39 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>Under the Guidelines, a minor participant is entitled to a two-level reduction and is someone who is \u201cless culpable than most other particip\u00e1nts, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), cmt. (n.5). A minimal participant is entitled to a four-level reduction and is someone who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(a), cmt. (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">To determine whether a mitigating-role reduction applies, a district court must first consider the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable at sentencing. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. The district court may also consider the defendant\u2019s role relative to that of other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>This inquiry is limited to identifiable participants who were involved in the relevant conduct, and \u201cthe conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In the instant case, Ovalles argues that the relevant conduct for which he was sentenced is a broader criminal conspiracy involving a large number of unknown participants who were not on the vessel. However, Ovalles was held accountable only for the quantity of drugs estimated to be on board the vessel. As Ovalles\u2019s actual conduct was equivalent to the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable, he may not point to a larger criminal conspiracy in order to justify a mitigating-role reduction. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Ovalles was less culpable than most of the other individuals on the go-fast vessel. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in denying Ovalles a mitigating-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">.
