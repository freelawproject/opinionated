For the reasons that follow, we will summarily vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">On April 26, 2007, Appellant filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in the District Court. On May 1, 2007, the District Court clerk\u2019s office entered an administrative order informing Appellant that his action could not proceed because his motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>was filed on an out-of-date form. The order provided that Appellant\u2019s complaint would be dismissed unless, within thirty days, he either properly completed an <em>in forma pauperis </em>application or paid the filing fee. A current <em>in forma pauperis </em>form was enclosed with the order. On June 7, 2007, thirty-seven days after the entry of the administrative order, the District Court dismissed Appellant\u2019s complaint without prejudice because Appellant neither submitted a revised <em>in forma pauperis </em>application nor paid the filing fee. The next day, the District Court received Appellant\u2019s revised motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>On June 21, 2007, the District Court denied Appellant\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>as moot. Appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-16\">\u201cOrdinary, an order that dismisses a complaint or denies an <em>informa pauper-is </em>motion without prejudice is neither final nor appealable.\u201d <em>Redmond v. Gill, </em>352 F.3d 801, 803 (3d Cir.2003). Here, the District Court dismissed Appellant\u2019s complaint without prejudice because he had failed to comply with the requirements set forth in the administrative order. The day after the dismissal of his complaint, the District Court received Appellant\u2019s revised <em>in forma pauperis </em>application. Instead of re-opening Appellant\u2019s case, the District Court denied his <em>in forma pauperis </em>motion as moot. Because the denial of Appellant\u2019s motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>as moot has the effect of terminating the action, the order is final and appealable. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-17\">The District Court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant\u2019s complaint was without prejudice; accordingly, the District Court\u2019s order contemplates the re-filing of Appellant\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>application in compliance with the requirements set forth in the May 1, 2007 administrative order. Appellant\u2019s revised <em>in forma pauperis </em>ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>plication was sent prior to the entry of the order dismissing his complaint and was received by the District Court one day after the dismissal of his complaint. Upon consideration of Appellant\u2019s current situation as a <em>pro se </em>inmate, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to construe Appellant\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>application as a motion to reopen the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
