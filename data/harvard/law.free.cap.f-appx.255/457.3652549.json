He asserted that five defendants \u2014 Sallie Mae, Inc., Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc., United Student Aid Funds, Inc., and Danny Brewer, as \u201cowner/official\u201d of Pioneer, as well as the United States Department of Education (\u201cDOE\u201d) \u2014 falsely reported to the National Student Loan Data System that he had taken out educational loans in 1990 or 1991 and defaulted on them. Anyakora argued that he had not taken out any loans prior to 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The district court dismissed Anyakora\u2019s HEA claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim because that the HEA statute does not provide for a private cause of action, either express or implied. It then dismissed his \u201cperipheral\u201d theories of \u201cfraud, racketeering, discrimination, negligence, denial of due process, \u00a7 1983, etc.,\u201d based on its conclusion that these were simply HEA violations pled in other terms, and therefore precluded under <em>McCulloch v. PNC Bank Inc., </em>298 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2002). It also concluded that the various other claims that Anyakora asserted should be dismissed without prejudice because they were too poorly pled to confer subject matter jurisdiction or to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court then dismissed the claims against Brewer for lack of personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, the court dismissed the claims against the DOE for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) because the DOE had not consented to a suit or waived its sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">Upon review of the record and parties\u2019 briefs, we find no error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\">. Anyakora fails to challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s finding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Brewer until his reply brief. Accordingly, Anyakora has abandoned any challenge to this finding. <em>See Williams v. Obstfeld, </em>314 F.3d 1270, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that arguments not raised in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are considered abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-16\">. As for the other arguments Anyakora raises on appeal, we find that they lack merit and warrant no further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
