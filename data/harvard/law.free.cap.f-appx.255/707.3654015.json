Plaintiffs allege that when the Board certified the International Union, United Automobile and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) as their exclusive bargaining representative without entertaining their objections during the certification proceeding, the Board deprived them of their liberty and property interests without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The district court granted the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of standing and subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm, albeit on somewhat different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Plaintiffs are employees of Thomas Built Buses, Inc. (TBB). TBB has a relationship with UAW that the district court described as \u201cinteresting\u201d \u2014 it appears that for some time, TBB has been assisting UAW in its organizing efforts at the TBB plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">In June 2005, UAW requested that the NLRB conduct a certification election at the TBB plant, in which TBB employees would vote to determine whether UAW would become the exclusive representative of the TBB employees. One day prior to the election, TBB circulated a memorandum that implied that non-union employees would soon be subject to higher benefit costs. On the day of the election, UAW recirculated the original memorandum, with the addition of the headline \u201cDID YOU SEE THIS? THE COST OF BEING NON-UNION JUST WENT UP!\u201d After the election, the unofficial tally was 714 in favor of UAW and 504 opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Plaintiffs argue that TBB\u2019s circulation of the benefits change memorandum one day prior to the election constitutes objectionable conduct and provides grounds for setting aside the election results. After the election, Plaintiffs sought to intervene in the representation proceeding before the NLRB through which the Board would officially certify UAW as the representative of the TBB employees. Plaintiffs also filed objections to the certification with the NLRB\u2019s Regional Director. But Plaintiffs did not file a charge alleging that TBB or UAW engaged in unfair labor practices. The NLRB denied Plaintiffs\u2019s motion to intervene, refused to consider the objections filed with the Regional Director, and certified UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative of TBB.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">Instead of filing an unfair labor practices charge against TBB and/or UAW, Plaintiffs brought this action against the NLRB, claiming that the Board\u2019s certification of UAW as their exclusive representative deprived them of protected liberty and property interests without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The district court granted the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding a lack of standing and no subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA, or Act) empowers the Board to investigate questions of representation and, where necessary, to direct elections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>by secret ballot and to certify the results of such elections. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159(e) (West 1998 &amp; Supp.2007). The typical parties to a representation proceeding are the employer and the union, and the Board does not normally allow individual employees to intervene in representation proceedings. <em>See </em>NLRB, Casehandling Manual, Part Two, Representation Proceedings \u00a7 11194.4 (2007), <em>available at </em>http://www. nlrb.gov/Publications/Manuals. It is unsurprising, then, that the Board denied Plaintiffs\u2019s motion to intervene in the representation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The NLRA also empowers the Board to prevent any person or entity from engaging in any unfair labor practice affecting commerce. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 152(1), 160(a). An employer\u2019s contribution of support to a labor organization constitutes an unfair labor practice within the meaning of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 158(a)(2); <em>see also ILGWU v. NLRB, </em>366 U.S. 731, 738, 81 S.Ct. 1603, 6 L.Ed.2d 762 (1961). Thus, in this case, if TBB\u2019s circulation of the benefits change memorandum constitutes a \u201ccontribution of support\u201d to UAW, then TBB\u2019s actions fall within the definition of an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Moreover, \u201cany person,\u201d not just an employer or union, may file a charge alleging that a person or entity has engaged in unfair labor practices. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.9. The General Counsel of the Board has the final authority to decide whether to pursue the investigation of a charge and initiate the adjudication of a complaint under section 160 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 153(d); <em>see also NLRB v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers, </em>484 U.S. 112, 108 S.Ct. 413, 98 L.Ed.2d 429 (1987). The Board adjudicates the merits of unfair labor practice charges brought by the General Counsel. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(b) \u2014 (d). If the Board finds that an employer or union has committed an unfair labor practice, it may issue a final order setting aside its previous certification of a union. <em>See Lunardi-Central Distributing Co., </em>161 NLRB 1443 at 1444-45 (1966). Any party to a Board proceeding aggrieved by this final order may obtain review of the order in the courts of appeals. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Therefore, in the case at hand, Plaintiffs could have filed an unfair labor practices charge with the Board. If the General Counsel initiated the adjudication of charges, the Board could have held that TBB or UAW committed unfair labor practices and set aside its previous certification of UAW as the exclusive representative of the TBB employees. Alternatively, if the Board held that no unfair labor practice had been committed, the Plaintiffs could have appealed the Board\u2019s final decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">Plaintiffs, however, chose not to file an unfair labor practices charge with the Board. Instead, Plaintiffs ask us to declare that the process that the NLRA establishes to address unfair labor practices violates their constitutional rights, despite the fact that they failed to pursue this process. As our sister courts have repeatedly held, a plaintiff may not bypass a seemingly adequate administrative process and then complain of that process\u2019s constitutional inadequacy in federal court. <em>See, e.g., Farhat v. Jopke, </em>370 F.3d 580, 596 (6th Cir.2004); <em>Santana v. City of Tulsa, </em>359 F.3d 1241, 1244 (10th Cir.2004); <em>Krentz v. Robertson, </em>228 F.3d 897, 904 (8th Cir.2000); <em>Alvin v. Suzuki, </em>227 F.3d 107, 116 (3d Cir.2000); <em>Cotton v. Jackson, </em>216 F.3d 1328, 1331 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Rathjen v. Litchfield, </em>878 F.2d 836, 840 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Dusanek v. Hannon, </em>677 F.2d 538, 543 (7th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Even assuming that Plaintiffs have suffered the deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest, which is not at all clear, their failure to avail themselves of their right to file an unfair labor practices charge means that they have failed to state a due process claim. As Judge Becker explained in <em>Alvin, </em>\u201cto state a claim for failure to provide due process, a plaintiff must have taken advantage of the processes that are available to him or her, unless those processes are unavailable or patently inadequate.\u201d 227 F.3d at 116. This is so because a due process violation \u201cis not complete\u201d when the asserted deprivation occurs; rather it is only complete when the government \u201cfails to provide due process.\u201d <em>Zinermon v. Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 126, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990). Accordingly, where \u201cthere is a process on the books that appears to provide due process, the plaintiff cannot skip that process and use the federal courts as a means to get back what he wants.\u201d <em>Alvin, </em>227 F.3d at 116. As in <em>Alvin, </em>here \u201ca procedural due process violation cannot have occurred\u201d because \u201cthe governmental actor provides apparently adequate procedural remedies and the plaintiff has not availed himself of those remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 126, 110 S.Ct. 975).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Because Plaintiffs did not file an unfair labor practices charge complaining of TBB\u2019s unlawful assistance to UAW, they have failed to state a due process claim. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court dismissing this action is</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">. Some of these cases deal with state, rather than administrative, procedures; however, the principle that a plaintiff may not complain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>of procedures he or she has not pursued is the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">. <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), on which Plaintiffs heavily rely, involves an entirely different statutory scheme, not governing asserted employment rights, but entitlement to social security benefits. Eldridge \"raised at least a colorable claim that because of his physical condition and dependency upon the disability benefits,\u201d a pre-termination evidentiary hearing not permitted by administrative procedures was constitutionally required. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 96 S.Ct. 893. Despite Eldridge's failure to avail himself of other administrative remedies, these particular allegations permitted him to bring this due process claim in federal court. Plaintiffs make no remotely similar allegations here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
