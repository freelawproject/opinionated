The district court sentenced Alonso to 65 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and ordered payment of a $100 statutory assessment. On appeal, Alonso asserts error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of his <em>Alford </em>plea, contending that the evidence of his guilt was not \u201coverwhelming\u201d and claiming the court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing on his objection to the presentence report. We find no merit to his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s finding that a factual basis exists to support an <em>Alford </em>plea. <em>United States v. Morrow, </em>914 F.2d 608, 611 (4th Cir.1990). Our review of the record reveals that the prosecutor filed a written summary and orally proffered a statement of facts in support of the <em>Alford </em>plea, and responded to questions from the district court during Alonso\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing. In addition, the district court accepted Alonso\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea following a thorough Rule 11 colloquy. Alonso\u2019s challenges to the presentence report related to his continued claim of innocence, rather to any issue that had any impact on the calculation of his advisory guidelines range, and the district court adequately resolved Alonso\u2019s challenges to the presentence report when it adopted the presentence report for purposes of determining the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">We therefore affirm Alonso\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b790-11\"> <em>See North Carolina v.
