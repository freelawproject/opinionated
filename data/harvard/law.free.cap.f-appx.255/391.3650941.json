Smith also challenges his sentence of 140 years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Smith argues the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions, and also claims that the district court improperly determined the Sentencing Guidelines range and imposed an unreasonable sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>433 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>547 U.S. 1047, 126 S.Ct. 1635, 164 L.Ed.2d 346 (2006). \u201cIt is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt,\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>20 F.3d 445, 453 (11th Cir.1994), because \u201c[a] jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence,\u201d <em>United States v. Vera, </em>701 F.2d 1349, 1357 (11th Cir.1983). To the extent that some of Smith\u2019s sufficiency challenges were not raised below \u2014 in moving for a judgment of acquittal, Smith did not argue that the evidence failed to establish the requisite interstate commerce nexus \u2014 our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Bichsel, </em>156 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir.1998). Plain error is only found where: (1) there is an error; (2) the error is obvious; (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The standards of review for Smith\u2019s sentencing claims are straightforward. We accept a district court\u2019s factual findings under the Guidelines, unless those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.2005). We deferentially review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Even so, we do not presume reasonable a sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1185 (11th Cir.2006). However, we ordinarily expect a sentence within the guideline range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787-88 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">The relevant facts are these. On February 22, 2006, in a superseding indictment, Smith and Jamail Hogan, who is Smith\u2019s half-brother, were charged with: (1) conspiring to obstruct commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2 (Count One); (2) carjacking with serious bodily injury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2119, 2119(2) and 2 (Count Two); (3) three counts of carrying and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), and 2 (Counts Three, Eight, and Ten); (4) three counts of obstructing commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2 (Counts Four, Six, and Nine); (5) three counts of carrying and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), 924(c)(l)(A)(iii), and 2 (Counts Five, Seven, and Twelve); and (6) attempting to obstruct commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2 (Count Eleven). Smith pled not guilty to all charges and proceeded to a jury trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">At trial, Smith made no opening statement and presented no evidence, instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>choosing to assert his theory of defense\u2014 that although he drove the getaway car to some of the armed robberies, he remained in the car and did not know that his two companions were robbing the stores \u2014 solely through cross-examination of three of the government\u2019s eighteen witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The government presented the following evidence. In the evening of November 26, 2005, around 5:00 p.m., Mark Baron was visiting a friend at the Sunshine Motel in Winter Haven, Florida, when Hogan and another man, both wearing bandanas and hats to conceal their faces, kicked in the door to the motel room. One of the men hit Baron twice in the head with a handgun and demanded the keys to Baron\u2019s truck, which was parked just outside. Baron threw the keys to the man and ran from the hotel. As he ran away, he heard a gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">A few hours later, at approximately 8:00 p.m., Hogan and the other man, both again wearing bandanas and gloves, robbed the Speedy Food Mart, which was right down the road from the Sunshine Hotel in Winter Haven, at gunpoint. The store clerk, Suvi Cyriac, testified that when the robbers approached the store, he was outside talking to some regular customers. Cyriac saw two masked people, both of whom were wearing gloves, coming toward him, one of whom had a gun. One of the men hit the store clerk, Suvi Cyriac, in the face, fracturing his jaw, and shot at him when he had difficulty opening the register. Because one of the robbers had tried to force the register open, it was jammed and Cyriac was unable to open it. Instead, Cyriac gave the robbers some boxes with rolled coins and banded currency, totaling about $1000 to $2000. Cyriac had three fractures to his jaw, and his mouth had to be wired shut for two months after the robbery. The government presented the store\u2019s surveillance camera photos of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">On the following night, at approximately 9:55 p.m., Hogan and another man entered the Island Foods convenience store in Haines City, Florida, and robbed the store at gunpoint. The perpetrators were wearing hooded coats and gloves. The government presented surveillance photos of the robbery. Before leaving with $50 from the cash register, one of the men fired a shot into the floor of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">On that same night, at 10:30 p.m., about fifteen miles from Haines City, Hogan and the other man robbed a Circle K convenience store, again wearing gloves and at gunpoint. This incident was recorded on a surveillance camera video, which was presented to the jury. Crime scene technicians successfully lifted a shoeprint from the counter over which the perpetrators had jumped.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">About five days later, on December 2, 2005, at approximately 12:15 p.m., Hogan told his supervisor at Homes of Merit home manufacturing plant that he needed to leave work early. After Hogan clocked out, the supervisor saw him walk out of the plant toward a white car waiting to pick him up. At approximately 2:00 p.m., Hogan and another person, both wearing bandanas to conceal their faces, attempted to rob Bill\u2019s Market convenience store, which is about one block away from Homes of Merit. One of the perpetrators carried a gun and the other had a club or a baton. The attempted robbery was caught on tape. Although Hogan and the other perpetrator had covered their faces, Raj Bhasakran, one of the store clerks, recognized Hogan, as he was a frequent customer. Hogan shot the other clerk, Remesh Desai, through the chest with a .380-cali-ber round, and then fled the stox\u2019e, without any money. Three weeks later, Desai died.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The government presented the testimony of four eyewitnesses who were in the parking lot or in the store next to Bill\u2019s Market. These witnesses consistently testified that they saw two perpetrators, one of whom was carrying a gun and the other a club or a board or a baton, exit Bill\u2019s Market and run to a white Chevy Cavalier. The witnesses all testified that they saw nobody else near the Cavalier. The perpetrator with the gun got into the driver\u2019s seat, and the other one got into the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle. Less than two hours after the robbery, a crime scene investigator recovered shoe impressions from the sandy area in front of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">That night, Polk County Sheriffs Office deputies stopped and arrested Hogan after one deputy observed him speeding down the highway in the white Cavalier. During a search of the Cavalier, deputies found a .380-caliber handgun lying on the back seat; nine live, .380-caliber bullets; a black, side-handle baton; a red, hooded sweatshirt; a ski mask; a camouflage glove; a pair of jean shorts; and a black bandana. Deputies also found two live rounds of ammunition and a black \u201cdo rag\u201d on Hogan\u2019s person, and seized sneakers and a \u201cDirty South\u201d sweatshirt, which Hogan had been wearing when arrested. The soles of Hogan\u2019s sneakers matched one of the shoe impressions taken from Bill\u2019s Market. A .380-caliber shell casing recovered from the Sunshine Motel, a projectile recovered from the Island Foods Store, and a spent casing and projectile recovered from Bill\u2019s Market all had been fired from the handgun taken from the Cavalier.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">During a search of Hogan\u2019s residence a few hours later, law enforcement agents found more .380-caliber ammunition, another camouflage glove, a blue latex glove, one white and one cream ski cap, a white \u201cdo rag,\u201d a white baseball cap, another \u201cDirty South\u201d sweatshirt, and two pairs of sneakers. Agents also found Mark Baron\u2019s set of keys to his truck, his business card holder, and the hands-free earphone for his cellular telephone, which had been in his truck. The soles of one pair of sneakers found in Hogan\u2019s residence matched one of the shoe impressions taken from the Circle K and one taken from Bill\u2019s Market. The soles of the other seized sneakers matched shoeprints taken from the Speedy Food Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">While being interviewed by law enforcement agents after his arrest, Hogan received a call from Smith on his cellular telephone. One of the interviewing agents, Detective Edwin Moran of the Polk County Sheriffs Office, answered Hogan\u2019s cell phone and asked Smith to come to the Polk County Sheriffs Office, ostensibly to pick up the white Cavalier. In fact, Detective Moran testified, since the Cavalier matched the description of the vehicle at Bill\u2019s Market earlier that day <em>and </em>was registered in Smith\u2019s name, Moran wanted to question Smith about the robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">After he arrived and was advised of his rights, Smith first acknowledged that the car was his, and when he was informed that a gun had been found in the car, he responded that the gun belonged to his brother. Smith also recounted his actions earlier during the day, initially denying that he was at Bill\u2019s Market, despite that Detective Moran had told Smith that he (Moran) was investigating an incident at Bill\u2019s Market. When Moran told Smith that witnesses had seen his car parked on a dirt road next to Bill\u2019s Market, Smith recanted his original story and stated that he had driven Hogan and another man to Bill\u2019s Market. Smith claimed that he had stood next to the vehicle while Hogan and the other man went into the store. Smith told agents that Hogan and the other man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>subsequently came running out of the store and had jumped into the car. Smith said that he did not realize anything was wrong until one of the store employees came running out of the store. Moran also asked Smith about the other items found in the Cavalier, including a red \u201cDirty South\u201d sweatshirt. Smith claimed that he had loaned it to the unknown man who had gone into Bill\u2019s Market with Hogan. Smith further stated that the baton or club found in the Cavalier was his father\u2019s and that he had taken the baton from the garage of his house and put it in his car sometime during the previous week.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Smith further stated that he had driven Hogan and another man he knew as \u201cPooky\u201d to the Speedy Food Mart robbery on November 26th, <em>and </em>the November 27th robberies at the Circle K and the Island Foods Store. Again, Smith claimed that he had not participated in any of the robberies. He said during all of the armed robberies, he had remained in the car and had not known that the robberies were taking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">At the end of the government\u2019s case-in-chief, Smith moved for a judgment of acquittal based on numerous grounds, including that the government had presented no evidence linking him to the Sunshine Motel carjacking, or placing him inside of any of the stores during the robberies. According to Smith\u2019s argument, the government\u2019s evidence showed only that an unidentified person had committed the robberies with Hogan. As for Smith\u2019s statement to law enforcement that he had driven Hogan to the sites of the robberies, Smith contended that the statement was insufficient to allow the jury to infer intent to commit the charged crimes. The district court overruled Smith\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Smith rested without presenting any evidence. The jury found Smith guilty of Counts One, Six, Seven, Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve, all of which related to the robberies at the Island Foods Store and Circle K on November 27th and at Bill\u2019s Market on December 2nd. The jury found Smith not guilty of Counts Two, Three, Four, Five, and Eight, all of which related to the incidents on November 26th \u2014 the carjacking at the Sunshine Motel and the robbery at the Speedy Food Mart. He then proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The presentence investigation report (\u00abPSi\u201d) fjj-gt noted the applicable mandatory m\u00ednimums, which included 10 years as to Count Seven and 25 years as to Counts Ten and Twelve, with the sentences for each count to run consecutively. The PSI then separated some of Smith\u2019s convictions into groups for purposes of calculating the Guidelines range. The first group included Counts One and Six, both of which related to the Island Foods Store robbery. The second group included Counts One and Nine, both of which related to the robbery of Circle K. The third group related to the attempted robbery of Bill\u2019s Market and included Counts One and Eleven. The PSI stated that, according to the medical examiner, Desai died as a result of the gun shot wound he suffered during the robbery of Bill\u2019s Market. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Dl.l(b)(l), Counts Seven, Ten, and Twelve, which all involved the use of firearms, were not grouped.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The PSI computed a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1, for groups one and two, and a base offense level of 43, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2A 1.1(a), 2B3.1(c)(l), for group three, due in large part to Desai\u2019s death. The PSI stated that Smith had no prior convictions and recommended a criminal history category I. Smith faced an advisory Guidelines range of <em>life </em>imprisonment, but the PSI noted that after taking account of the applicable statutory m\u00e1ximums, the total Guidelines range was 140 years\u2019 imprisonment. Fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>nally, the PSI noted that Smith was 20 years old, had been attending college, and had no history of alcohol or illicit substance abuse. Neither party filed objections to the PSI. Moreover, at sentencing, Smith did not object to the factual statements or the recommended Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s application of the Guidelines and then heard mitigating and aggravating evidence. The district court invited victims in attendance to speak and Hiren Desai, Desai\u2019s son, requested justice for his father\u2019s death. Next, Smith\u2019s mother apologized to the victims and requested mercy. Smith\u2019s step-father stated that Smith was a good kid and requested leniency. Smith\u2019s father stated that Smith was a wonderful and respectful son, who unknowingly became involved in the ci\u2019imes, and requested mercy. The district court also accepted letters from Smith\u2019s college professors, his high school counselor, and a senior home where he had volunteered. Finally, Smith made a statement on his own behalf. He explained that he was not a \u201cviolent monster\u201d and that he was just helping Hogan by giving him a ride. Smith stated that he sympathized with the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Defense counsel argued that a 140-year term was unwarranted and would be especially devastating and leave no hope, in light of Smith\u2019s age and the fact that he had no prior criminal record. Recognizing that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924 required a <em>minimum </em>sentence of 60 consecutive years for Counts Seven, Ten, and Twelve, Smith requested that the district court exercise its discretion to impose a below-Guidelines sentence, as to the remaining counts (One, Six, Nine, and Eleven), for which he faced an advisory range of 80 years. Smith reiterated his positive contributions to society and family support. The government objected to a below-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The district court recognized that nothing in Smith\u2019s background would have predicted his involvement in charged crimes, and the court characterized Smith as mild and unaggressive. The court also opined that Hogan was more aggressive and was the leader. After stating that it had considered the \u00a7 3553 factors and had accorded advisory consideration to the Guidelines range, the district court sentenced Smith to a total term of 1,680 months\u2019 incarceration, which represented the following consecutive sentences: the statutory maximum of 240 months for each of Counts One, Six, Nine, and Eleven; the statutory minimum of 120 months\u2019 for Count Seven; and the statutory minimum of 300 months for each of Counts Ten and Twelve. Neither party objected to the sentence or the manner in which it was announced. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">First, Smith challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. He argues that the only evidence connecting him to the crimes was his statement to law enforcement that he had driven Hogan and an unknown person to and from the scenes of the three armed robberies for which the jury found him guilty. Smith contends that his \u201cmere presence\u201d at the crime scenes cannot support the conspiracy convictions. Although Smith cites <em>United States v. Gray, </em>260 F.3d 1267 (11th Cir.2001), and acknowledges that \u201cthe law ... is clear that only a minimal effect upon commerce is necessary to form the interstate commerce nexus required under the Hobbs Act\u201d to invoke federal jurisdiction through the Commerce Clause, he also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the robberies lacked the requisite interstate commerce nexus without citation to supporting authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Section 2 of Title 18 of the United States Code provides that whoever aids or abets the commission of an offense against the United States, including violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951, 924, is punishable as a principal to the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. .\u00a7 2. In order to support a conviction for conspiracy under \u00a7 2, the government must prove knowing participation and an agreement. <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>53 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cMere presence, guilty knowledge, even sympathetic observation\u201d are insufficient to support a conviction for conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>Although mere presence is inadequate to establish guilt, \u201cwe have held that \u2018it is material, highly probative, and not to be discounted.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gamboa, </em>166 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201ca jury may find knowledgeable voluntary participation from presence when the presence is such that it would be unreasonable for anyone other than a knowledgeable participant to be present.\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz-Valdez, </em>773 F.2d 1541, 1546 (11th Cir.1985) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Section 1951 of Title 18 of the United States Code, part of the Hobbs Act, requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant obstructed or affected interstate commerce by robbery, conspired to do so, or threatened or committed physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of the robbery or conspiracy. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. We have specifically held that robbery \u201cis undeniably an economic crime,\u201d whose relationship to \u201ccommerce is clear, direct, and unattentuated.\u201d <em>United States v. Gray, </em>260 F.3d at 1267, 1274 (11th Cir.2001). The type of evidence required for the Government to satisfy its burden of proof concerning the interstate commerce nexus under the Hobbs Act differs depending on whether the defendant is charged with inchoate offenses of conspiracy and attempt, on one hand, or a substantive offense. <em>United States v. Le, </em>256 F.3d 1229, 1232 (11th Cir.2001). Where a defendant is charged with attempt or conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act, \u201cthe interstate nexus may be demonstrated by evidence of potential impact on interstate commerce or by evidence of actual, <em>de minimis </em>impact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). In the case of a substantive Hobbs Act offense, the \u201cimpact on commerce does not need to be substantial; all that is required is minimal impact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Section 924(c) requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant carried, brandished, or discharged a firearm during a crime of violence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). A defendant may be criminally liable under \u00a7 924, if he could reasonably foresee that his co-conspirator would use or carry a firearm in connection with a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>137 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">We first consider the sufficiency of the evidence to support Smith\u2019s convictions for the armed robberies at the Circle K and the Islands Food Store on November 27th and at Bill\u2019s Market on December 2nd. In his statement to Detective Moran, Smith <em>admitted </em>to being present, as the driver, at these three armed robberies. Notably, the car observed outside of Bill\u2019s Market, in which the two perpetrators fled the scene, was registered to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The two robberies on November 27th occurred a mere 35 minutes apart. During this short time span, according to Smith\u2019s story, he drove his brother and someone he knew only as \u201cPooky\u201d to two convenience stores, but remained outside and did not know that anything unusual was taking place inside of the stores, despite that the perpetrators of both of these crimes wore masks, or otherwise concealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>their faces, and gloves. The jury readily could have inferred that it would not be reasonable for Smith, even if present at these crimes solely as the getaway driver, to have had no idea that a crime had been committed, in light of the disguises the perpetrators must have been wearing when they exited the Cavalier and entered the stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">As for the Bill\u2019s Market incident, which resulted in Desai\u2019s death, at first, Smith claimed he was not at Bill\u2019s Market earlier in the day. Only after Detective Moran told him that his car had been seen outside of the Market did Smith recant his initial claim and then suggest that, in fact, he was present but had remained outside, standing by the car. Notably, the four eyewitnesses who saw the two perpetrators fleeing Bill\u2019s Market, one with a gun and the other with a club or baton, consistently said that they saw nobody else in the area around the car. Moreover, the witnesses all said that they saw the perpetrator with the gun sit in the driver\u2019s seat, thus undermining Smith\u2019s suggestion that he was the driver and had remained outside of the store while Hogan and an unknown person committed the crime. Smith also admitted to Moran that one of the sweatshirts found in the Cavalier, and worn by one of the perpetrators of the Bill\u2019s Market robbery, belonged to him. And, again, during this robbery the perpetrators wore masks, or otherwise concealed their faces, and gloves. Finally, Smith said that the baton carried during the Bill\u2019s Market robbery, in fact, belonged to his father. Smith said that he had put the baton in his car sometime during the prior week. Given all of these circumstances, a reasonable jury could have found Smith guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, either as one of the perpetrators who went into the store, or as an aider and abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">On this record, a reasonable jury could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Smith\u2019s participation was instrumental in the perpetration of the armed robberies, and thus the jury also could reasonably infer his participation in the conspiracy and conclude that he committed the conspiracy offenses. The jury readily could have chosen to reject Smith\u2019s theory of defense, which, again, was that he remained in the car during the robberies and did not know what was happening inside the stores. Indeed, the jury\u2019s split verdict indicates that it followed the district court\u2019s instructions and carefully considered each count individually and its related evidence. In fact, the record fully supports the jury\u2019s verdict on two theories. First, Smith committed the robberies with Hogan, and his suggestion that \u201cPooky\u201d was present on November 27th and another unknown person accompanied Hogan into Bill\u2019s Market on December 2nd was fabricated. Alternatively, even if \u201cPooky\u201d and the unknown other perpetrator existed, Smith was a knowing participant, by his own admission, as the getaway driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">As for the charges for carrying a firearm, which was brandished or used during a crime of violence, during his interview with Detective Moran, Smith admitted to driving Hogan to and from each of the armed robberies for which he was convicted <em>and </em>that he was aware that his brother had a gun. The jury could reasonably conclude that Smith, at the very least, saw the firearm when driving Hogan to and from the multiple crime scenes and that it was reasonably foreseeable the firearm would be used during the robberies. Moreover, the government presented abundant evidence that each store robbed was engaged in interstate commerce and, thus, that each act had at least a <em>de minimis, </em>actual impact sufficient to establish the required interstate commerce nexus. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>In short, Smith has not shown reversible error based on the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We likewise are unpersuaded by Smith\u2019s sentencing claims. First, we find no error in the calculation of the advisory Guidelines range. Where a defendant does not object to statements in the PSI, the district court may rely on those undisputed statements, even in the absence of supporting evidence. <em>See United States v. Hedges, </em>175 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.1999). Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2A 1.1(a), 2B3.1(c), an offense level of 43 is applied if a victim is killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S .C. \u00a7 1111. Section 1111, in turn, defines murder as \u201cthe unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Every murder ... committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any ... robbery ... is murder in the first degree.\u201d 18 U.S .C. \u00a7 lili. Given the PSI\u2019s undisputed factual finding that Desai died as a result of the gunshot wound he received in the course of the Bill\u2019s Market robbery, we discern no error in the assignment of an offense level of 43 or in the calculation of the advisory Guidelines range based on that offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">As for the reasonableness of Smith\u2019s ultimate sentence, we begin our analysis by observing that the sentence imposed was a low-end Guidelines sentence. Although we do not presume reasonable a sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1185 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787-88 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">When reviewing reasonableness, we consider the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2006). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense, (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (5) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Before imposing sentence, the district court considered the PSI and the advisory Guidelines range, as well as mitigating statements from Smith\u2019s mother and step-father, Smith\u2019s own statement of remorse, and numerous letters in support of mitigation. The court stated that despite the mitigating evidence and Smith\u2019s lack of a criminal history, the court saw no reason to depart from the recommended range. On this record, Smith has not met his burden to establish his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">. Additionally, Smith argues that the district court's factual determinations at sentencing, made by a preponderance of the evidence, violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005). We also will not review Smith\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, made for the first time on direct appeal, given the insufficiency of the record. <em>See United States v. Verbitskaya, </em>406 F.3d 1324, 1337 (11th Cir.2005) (\"Except in the rare instance when the record is sufficiently developed, we will not address claims for ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal.\"), cert. <em>denied, </em>546 U.S. 1096, 126 S.Ct. 1095, 163 L.Ed.2d 864 (2006). As for Smith's request to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), it is well-settled that we are powerless to do that and are <em>bound </em>to follow Supreme Court precedent. <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1275-76 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006). Finally, we are unpersuaded by Smith's suggestion that his sentence, which exceeded neither the statutory range nor the Guidelines range, violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution as cruel and unusual. punishment. <em>Cf. United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cIn general, a sentence imposed within the limits imposed by statute is neither excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>nor cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">.
