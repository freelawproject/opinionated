He also alleged they retaliated against him because he submitted grievances and filed this action. Lent-worth appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s granting the prison officials\u2019 motion to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">Our review is <em>de novo. See, e.g., In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Whittaker v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>206 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir.2000). Prison officials violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, constituting an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). Pursuant to our review, and contrary to Lentworth\u2019s assertion, the district court did not misapply Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (summary judgment) and did not fail to consider Dr. Ashbury\u2019s opinion concerning his medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-18\">Lentworth received a considerable amount of medical treatment. His complaints regarding the treatment he received and the delay attendant to such treatment do not establish deliberate indifference. <em>See Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Furthermore, Lentworth failed to exhaust his deliberate-indifference claim regarding his toe injury. <em>See Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 516 (5th Cir.2004). The district court did not err in dismissing Lentworth\u2019s deliberate-indifference claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-19\">Lentworth challenges the district court\u2019s determination that the prison officials did not retaliate against him. He contends Dr. David Potter\u2019s remark regarding Lent-worth\u2019s complaints of inadequate medical care establishes retaliation. Lentworth asserts: M. Halvorsen, Barbara Enns, and Charles Martinez retaliated against him by falsely accusing him of being verbally abusive; and prison officials retaliated against him by placing him in a cell with another inmate who had a history of violence against inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>To state a valid claim for retaliation under \u00a7 1988, a prisoner must allege (1) his invocation of a specific constitutional right, (2) the defendant\u2019s intent to retaliate against the prisoner for his exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory adverse act, and (4) causation. <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999). Dr. Potter\u2019s remark does not constitute actionable retaliation. <em>See Morris v. Powell, </em>449 F.3d 682, 686 (5th Cir.) (\u201cRetaliation against a prisoner is actionable only if it is capable of deterring a person of ordinary firmness from further exercising his constitutional rights.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 596, 166 L.Ed.2d 443 (2006). Lent-worth did not establish causation with respect to his claims of false disciplinary reports; he did not show: absent the grievance, Halvorsen, Enns, and Martinez would not have filed a disciplinary report for verbal abuse. <em>See Jones, </em>188 F.3d at 324-25. Lentworth did not present proper summary judgment evidence in support of his retaliation claim concerning his cell mate. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>276 F.3d 193, 197 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Lentworth also contends James D. Mooneyham and Vikki Wright were informed of these various retaliatory acts but did not take corrective action. A supervisory official may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 if he \u201caffirmatively participate^] in acts that cause constitutional deprivation\u201d or \u201cimplement[s] unconstitutional policies that causally result in plaintiffs injury\u201d. <em>Baker v. Putnal, </em>75 F.3d 190, 199 (5th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Mouille v. City of Live Oak, Tex., </em>977 F.2d 924, 929 (5th Cir.1992)). Lentworth does not allege Mooneyham and Wright were personally involved in the retaliation or implemented an unconstitutional policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Lentworth asserts the district court erred by neglecting to address his claim that Wright, Potter, and Mooneyham did not initiate a unit transfer after they knew his health was at risk. Lentworth did not establish supervisory liability under \u00a7 1983, and he has no constitutional right with respect to housing. <em>See Tighe v. Wall, </em>100 F.3d 41, 42 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Baker, </em>75 F.3d at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b934-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
