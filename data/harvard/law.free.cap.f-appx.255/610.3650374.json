R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6). Appellant Mary Lula alleged in her complaint that NetApp violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-l <em>et seq., </em>the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d) of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, <em>et seq., </em>and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\u201cPHRA\u201d), 43 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 951 <em>et seq. </em>Lula argues on appeal that she properly complied with Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(a) and that the District Court erred when granting NetApp\u2019s motion to dismiss. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">When reviewing a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6), a court must \u201caccept as true all allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom, and view them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Rocks v. City of Philadelphia, </em>868 F.2d 644, 645 (3d Cir.1989). Lula alleged the following pertinent facts in her complaint. In May 2004, Lula was offered a employment with NetApp as either a Sales Representative or Senior Sales Representative. Lula believed that the restrictions and conditions imposed on the offer of employment were too burdensome and declined to accept the job offer. Lula also alleged that these restrictions were not placed on a different position within the company and were therefore discriminatory because this other position was occupied by a young male. Lula did not allege that these restrictions were not imposed on other candidates who applied for the position that she was offered. In October 2004, NetApp once again requested that Lula submit her resume for consideration of a separate opening for Sales Representative. The position was immediately deactivated. Lula alleged that NetApp deactivated this additional position because, although she was qualified, she was unacceptable to NetApp because of her age, gender, and a prior action she had filed to enforce her civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-16\">Lula presents two issues on appeal. First, she asserts that a cognizable legal claim exists under Title VII, the ADEA, or the PHRA when a potential employee rejects a job offer because that employee believes the terms of the employment are discriminatory. We disagree. In order to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, the ADEA, or the PHRA, an individual must show that he or she: (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was qualified for the position sought; (3) was subject to an adverse employment action despite being qualified; and, (4) under circumstances that raise an inference of discriminatory action, the employer continued to seek out individuals with qualifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>cations similar to plaintiff to fill the position. Sar<em>ullo v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>352 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir.2003). Here, Lula was not subject to an adverse employment action. This Court declines to extend the definition of an adverse employment action to include job offers. There is no cognizable cause of action based on a job applicant\u2019s rejection of a job offer she finds undesirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Lula\u2019s second argument on appeal is that a legal cognizable claim exists for failure to hire under Title VII, the ADEA, or the PHRA when a potential employee was not hired because the company \u201cdeactivated\u201d that position and did not fill it. Again, we disagree. The Supreme Court addressed employment discrimination in a hiring situation in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and held that, in order for such an action to be valid, a plaintiff who is qualified for the position must be rejected for the position, and thereafter the position must remain open. <em>Id. </em>at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Here, as Lula\u2019s complaint specifically alleges the position did not remain open and was immediately deactivated. Accordingly, under <em>McDonnell, </em>no cause of action exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Because no set of facts would allow Lula to prove a prima facie case of discrimination, the District Court correctly granted NetApp\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O\u2019Brien &amp; Frankel, </em>20 F.3d 1250, 1261 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
