Gay, Jr., Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Western District of Texas, San Antonio, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b905-13\">Donna F. Coltharp, Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office, Western District of Texas, San Antonio, TX, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b905-15\">Before REAVLEY, SMITH, and BARKSDALE, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b905-16\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">Tomas Gausin-Ceniseros having pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry following deportation, the district court sentenced him, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), to 120 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-18\">In claiming the sentence is unreasonable, Gausin contends: his previous crimes were accounted for by the Sentencing Guidelines; and the sentence imposed by the district court, which represents an upward deviation from the 77-96 month advisory guideline range, was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-23\">The district court gave fact-specific reasons, consistent with the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), for its determination that a sentence above the advisory guideline range was warranted. The court\u2019s comments establish it: was aware of the correctly calculated guideline range; and took into consideration the abuse Gausin suffered as a child. On the other hand, the district court determined Gausin had continued to commit violent offenses after receiving lenient treatment in the past, and there was a need to impress upon Gausin the seriousness of his offense and to protect society and Gausin\u2019s family from further criminal conduct. The record does not establish the district court failed to account for a factor that should have received great weight, gave significant weight to an irrelevant factor, or committed a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-09 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, Gausin has failed to show the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-24\">In the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Gausin challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors, rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate\u201d. <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"Asq\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b905-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
