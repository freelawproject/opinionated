Robinson, federal prisoner # 04307-003, was convicted and sentenced for conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine and phenylacetone. Robinson now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition in which he challenged the validity of his indictment on the basis that it did not allege the quantity of drugs for which he was sentenced. The district court dismissed the petition, finding that Robinson was attempting to collaterally attack his conviction and sentence and that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was therefore the correct procedural vehicle for Robinson\u2019s claims. Because Robinson challenges the validity of his sentence in his \u00a7 2241 petition but has failed to demonstrate that his claims fall within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255, the district court did not err in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901-04 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b901-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
