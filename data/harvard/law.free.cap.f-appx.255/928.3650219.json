BL Dev. Corp., </em>415 F.3d 399, 401 (5th Cir.2005). Such judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cWe resolve doubts in favor of the nonmoving party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>and make all reasonable inferences in favor of that party.\u201d <em>Dean v. City of Shreveport, </em>438 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir.2006). No genuine issue of material fact exists if the summary-judgment evidence is such that no reasonable juror could find in favor of the nonmovant. <em>E.g., Jenkins v. Methodist Hosps. of Dallas, Inc., </em>478 F.3d 255, 260 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 181, 169 L.Ed.2d 35 (2007). Essentially for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s comprehensive report and recommendation, adopted by the district court, summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Regarding the summary-judgment record, Appellants contend the district court erred by excluding documents from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s investigation of their charges. Appellants fail, however, to show the district court abused its discretion. <em>See Kona Tech. Corp. v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., </em>225 F.3d 595, 602 (5th Cir.2000) (stating evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>McClure v. Mexia Ind. Sch. Dish., </em>750 F.2d 396, 400 (5th Cir.1985) (finding EEOC determinations are not an exception to hearsay when \u201cthe sources of information or other circumstances indicate the lack of trustworthiness\u201d) (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(c)); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.CivP. 56; Fed.R.Evid. 802, 803, 807. (Along this line, Appellants\u2019 brief cites neither authority nor the record for this issue.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Appellants maintain summary judgment was not proper because genuine issues of material fact exist on: whether Noble exercised reasonable care to prevent the sexually harassing behavior, from mid-November to mid-December 2003; and whether Appellants unreasonably failed to take advantage of any corrective opportunities Noble provided. <em>See Casiano v. AT&amp;T Corp., </em>213 F.3d 278, 284 (5th Cir.2000) (explaining <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense). Appellants\u2019 summary-judgment evidence, however, failed to establish a material fact issue. <em>See, e.g., Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075-76 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc) (explaining burden on nonmovant on Rule 56 summary-judgment motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b958-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
