The decision denied asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d). No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision in this case, not the BIA\u2019s, because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). An IJ\u2019s factual determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum \u201cmust be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cUnder this highly deferential test, we affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee\u201d: a person unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground, including political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status with specific and credible evidence. <em>At Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). We have explained that \u201conly in a rare case does the record compel the conclusion that an applicant for asylum suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1239 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Vasquez testified that he became a \u201ccollaborator\u201d with Colombia\u2019s Liberal Party in 1997 and that he organized meetings for Liberal Party ideas to be discussed. At the end of 1997, Vasquez began to receive threatening telephone calls from persons claiming to be members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (the \u201cFARC\u201d), who warned Vasquez to suspend his activities and to quit spreading his ideas. Two FARC members approached Vasquez in public, displayed guns, and told him that they were giving him his last warning. Later, Vasquez was forced into a car at gunpoint by persons who told Vasquez that he did not pay attention to the calls and threats. After the police pursued the vehicle, it crashed; and the kidnappers fled. Vasquez\u2019s wife then received additional threatening telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Vasquez, his wife, and their son left Colombia for the United States in June 2000. His wife and son returned to Colombia in September or October 2000; and Vasquez went back to Colombia in December 2000 because his family, home, and work remained there. Vasquez and his family lived with Vasquez\u2019s mother-in-law for a few months but then returned to their former home. Vasquez left for the United States again in February 2001; and he later applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Vasquez asserts that the IJ erred in determining that he had not presented sufficient credible evidence to show past persecution or a reasonable fear of future persecution based on his political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>opinion through his involvement with the Liberal Party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Substantial evidence supports the determination that Vasquez failed to meet his burden that he had been persecuted or that he faced a well-founded fear of future persecution, on a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Vasquez\u2019s claims of harassment \u2014 unaccompanied by physical harm \u2014 do not compel us to reverse the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the FARC\u2019s alleged conduct failed to demonstrate past persecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (explaining that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution\u201d) (internal quotation omitted); <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237-38 (concluding that anonymous threats and a condolence note signed by the FARC about the alien\u2019s death did not amount to persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the conclusion that Vasquez failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. As we have discussed, the past acts of the FARC against Vasquez did not constitute persecution. And Vasquez and his family first left Colombia in June 2000 after being threatened by the FARC; but instead of applying for asylum at that time, they voluntarily returned to Colombia later that year. In Colombia, Vasquez eventually moved back to his home where he had received threatening telephone calls from the FARC. In the light of all of these circumstances, Vasquez has failed to establish that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Colombia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Therefore, the evidence does not compel us to conclude that Vasquez is eligible for asylum. Because he has not satisfied the less stringent standard for asylum, we also deny his petition for review of claims for withholding of removal and for CAT relief. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>75 U.S.L.W. 3121 (U.S. Sept. 12, 2006) (No. 06-367).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">. On appeal, Vasquez does not assert that he was persecuted based on his affiliation with the Catholic Church, a claim that he raised in his asylum application; therefore, this claim is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2005) (explaining that petitioner abandons issue by failing to offer argument on that issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">. We note that Vasquez\u2019s claim that he was forced into a car by FARC members, who drove him until the car crashed a short time later, is distinct from the situation described in our recent decision in <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>05-15875 (11th Cir. Dec. 21, 2006). In that case, we concluded that the record compelled the conclusion that Ruiz was persecuted by the FARC because, among other reasons, he was held captive by the FARC for the \"extended time\u201d of 18 days. <em>Ruiz, </em>manuscript op. at 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b381-15\">. And we note that, although the IJ did not make a \"clean\u201d credibility determination, <em>see Yang v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005), the IJ did conclude that Vasquez's credibility was \"in question\u201d because of, among other things, some discrepancies between Vasquez's asylum application and his testimony during his asylum hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
