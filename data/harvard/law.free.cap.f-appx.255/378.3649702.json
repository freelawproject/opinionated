Plaintiff also alleged that his access to adequate medical care for squa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>mous cell carcinoma was delayed during this 10-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The district court concluded that Plaintiff raised a claim of false imprisonment and that, although the FTCA waives the federal government\u2019s sovereign immunity for some torts, the FTCA exempts false imprisonment claims from this waiver. Therefore, the district court determined that the FTCA barred Plaintiffs claim; and it dismissed his case. On appeal, Plaintiff argues that the district court should have considered that the federal government has waived sovereign immunity for false imprisonment claims involving law enforcement officers; and he contends that BOP officials are law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We' review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) for failure to state a claim; and we view the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cA complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the prisoner can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Harmon v. Berry, </em>728 F.2d 1407, 1409 (11th Cir.1984). \u201cPro <em>se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u201cThe FTCA operates as a limited waiver of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity. Unless the United States may be held liable pursuant to the terms of the statute, the sovereign\u2019s immunity remains intact, and no subject matter jurisdiction exists.\u201d <em>Bennett v. United States, </em>102 F.3d 486, 488 n. 1 (11th Cir.1996) (internal citation omitted). We strictly construe the FTCA\u2019s exceptions to sovereign immunity. <em>See Phillips v. United States, </em>260 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.2001). The provision of the FTCA at issue here \u2014 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) \u2014 excepts \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of ... false imprisonment\u201d from its waiver of sovereign immunity but does allow for recovery on false imprisonment claims \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government....\u201d For section 2680(h), \u201c \u2018investigative or law enforcement officer\u2019 means any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Plaintiff asserts that he can proceed with his false imprisonment claim because this claim concerns the acts of BOP officials, who are law enforcement officers. BOP officials do have authority to make arrests for violations of certain federal laws, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3050; and at least one of our sister circuits has concluded that a BOP official is a law enforcement officer under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). <em>See Chapa v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>339 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201c[A]s defined in [section] 2680(h), a BOP official is a federal law enforcement officer.\u201d). Because claims for false imprisonment \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government\u201d are included in the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, the district court erred in not considering whether Plaintiff had presented such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Therefore, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing Plaintiffs complaint and remand for proceedings consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-12\">. Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration before the district court; and reconsideration was denied. Plaintiff appealed the order denying his motion for reconsideration. Although we have jurisdiction to review only those judgments or orders that the notice of appeal specifies, either expressly or implicitly, <em>see Club Car, Inc. v. Club Car (Quebec) Import, Inc., </em>362 F.3d 775, 785 (11th Cir.2004), \"an appeal is not lost if a mistake is made in designating the judgment appealed from where it is clear that the overriding intent was effectively to appeal\u201d the original judgment, <em>Kicklighter v. Nails by Jannee, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 734, 738-39 n. 1 (5th Cir.1980) (internal quotation omitted), at least where appeal of that judgment is timely. Because Plaintiff is a <em>pro se </em>litigant, and because it appears he intended to appeal the order of dismissal, we will construe Plaintiff's notice of appeal to include that order. Plaintiff offers no argument on the denial of his motion for reconsideration; so that claim is abandoned. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-18\">. We also deny Plaintiffs motion to supplement the record because the documents that Plaintiff has submitted do not relate to facts necessary to decide the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
