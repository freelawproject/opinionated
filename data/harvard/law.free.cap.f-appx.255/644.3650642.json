For the reasons that follow, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s orders and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-18\">Fain filed a civil rights complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that Appellees violated his due process rights by fabricating evidence and falsifying documents for use at his parole eligibility hearings, by relying on the fabricated evidence in denying his parole, and by intentionally concealing the fact that such evidence was used at his eligibility hearings. The District Court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Fain\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) &amp; 1915A for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fain filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court also denied. Fain appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-22\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2) is plenary. <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-23\">The District Court construed Fain\u2019s complaint as asserting that his due process rights were violated at his parole revocation hearing and concluded that Fain must raise his claims in a habeas petition because any challenge to the revocation of his parole would necessarily imply the invalidity of his confinement. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Fain asserts, however, because his complaint is challenging the constitutionality of his parole review hearings, not the validity of his parole revocation hearing, his claims do not necessarily imply the invalidity of his confinement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-24\">An inmate may file a \u00a7 1983 action for procedural challenges if the action would not necessarily spell immediate or speedier release for the prisoner. <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). Fain\u2019s complaint is challenging the validity of his parole review hearings, not his parole revocation hearing. In his motion for reconsideration, Fain reiterates that, contrary to the District Court\u2019s interpretation, his complaint does not challenge the validity of his parole revocation hearing, which he concedes was proper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, in his motion for reconsideration, Fain concedes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>that, even without the allegedly fabricated evidence, the Parole Review Board still could have denied him parole at his review hearing. We agree. The Parole Review Board bases its decision to grant or deny parole on numerous factors. <em>See </em>N.J. A.D.C. 10A:71-3.11. Accordingly, Fain\u2019s complaint does not necessarily imply the invalidity of his confinement and may be filed pursuant to \u00a7 1983. <em>See Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. at 81, 125 S.Ct. 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">For the foregoing reason, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s orders and remand for further proceedings. Fain\u2019s motion for sanctions is denied. <em>See Martin v. Brown, </em>63 F.3d 1252, 1265 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-19\">. Even if the claims in Fain's complaint were unclear, the District Court should have informed Fain that he had leave to amend his complaint, especially in light of Fain\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>for reconsideration. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
