Goree, Texas prisoner # 1334846, appeals the dismissal without prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Goree argues that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s (TDCJ) grievance procedure was not the proper means to address his complaints and that the 1-60 complaint procedure was an appropriate alternative which satisfied the exhaustion requirement. He also argues that the unsanitary conditions at the Travis County jail and the absence of durable utensils and drinking cups violated his Eighth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-25\">After the district court\u2019s judgment, the Supreme Court held \u201cthat failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>--- U.S. ---, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). As this action was dismissed prior to service on the defendants, and it is not clear from the complaint that Goree exhausted his administrative remedies, the district court erred by sua sponte dismissing Goree\u2019s suit. <em>See Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>The district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
