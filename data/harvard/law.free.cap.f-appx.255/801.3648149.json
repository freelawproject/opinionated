Capul\u00edn argues that the evidence is insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed either offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">The Government presented no evidence that Capul\u00edn had actual possession of the marijuana. Therefore, in order to find Capul\u00edn guilty of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and importation of marijuana, there must be some evidence to support \u201cat least a plausible inference\u201d that Capul\u00edn had some knowledge of and access to the marijuana. <em>See United States v. Hinojosa, </em>349 F.3d 200, 203-04 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">A review of the record indicates that a reasonable trier of fact could have plausibly inferred that Capul\u00edn knew that the individuals with whom he crossed into the United States were transporting marijuana; that Capul\u00edn had access to the marijuana; and that Capul\u00edn knowingly participated in bringing the marijuana into the United States. The jury heard testimony from one of the smugglers that Capul\u00edn was the group\u2019s guide. The jury also heard Border Patrol agents testify that Capul\u00edn admitted he was traveling with the group, admitted he knew that the group was carrying marijuana, and admitted he was carrying food for the group. Based on Capulin\u2019s own testimony, it was clear that the group he was traveling with was the same group that Border Patrol agents observed crossing the Rio Grande river from Mexico into the United States with numerous duffel bags. Capul\u00edn described how he and the group brought the duffel ' bags across the river by boat. The duffel bags Capulin\u2019s group transported across the Rio Grande were the same bags seized by Border Patrol agents and which contained more than 290 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">Based on the record, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that Capul\u00edn constructively possessed more than 100 kilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute it and knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>participated in its importation. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>226 F.3d 340, 343 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, Capulin\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b832-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
