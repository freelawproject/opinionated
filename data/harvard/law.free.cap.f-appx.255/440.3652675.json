Lerma was one of four deck hands and took turns with the other deck hands driving the vessel in three-hour shifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-22\">When the United States Coast Guard (\u201cUSCG\u201d) came upon the vessel, one of the crew members instructed the others to pour gasoline on the vessel and set it on fire in an attempt to destroy the cocaine. The USCG boarded the vessel and extinguished the fire, but not before Lerma and another crew member sustained second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>and third degree burns that required medical attention at a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Lerma was indicted and pled guilty to both counts. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) set Lerma\u2019s base offense level at 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), based on the 5,000 kilograms of cocaine found on the vessel. The PSI recommended a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. With a criminal history category of I, the resulting guideline range was 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Lerma objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to include a two-level safety-valve reduction and a two-level mitigating-role reduction. At sentencing, the district court overruled Lerma\u2019s objections and imposed a 168-month sentence on both counts, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Lerma filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ANI\">A. Safety-Valve Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">On appeal, Lerma argues that the district court erred when it denied him a two-level reduction under the safety-valve provision of the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Under the safety-valve provision, if a defendant convicted of certain drug crimes satisfies certain criteria, a district court shall impose a sentence without regard to any statutory mandatory minimum, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, and also give a two-level reduction in the defendant\u2019s offense level, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(9). A defendant has the burden of proving his eligibility for safety-valve relief. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997). Among the criteria that must be met, the defendant must prove that \u201cthe offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to <em>any </em>person.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">Here, it is undisputed that two people sustained serious bodily injury during the offense. Lerma and one of his co-defendants were seriously burned and required hospitalization. Lerma admits these burns constituted serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-15\">Lerma points out that he sustained injuries and that he has already endured pain and suffering as a result of his injuries. He also argues that he saved another co-defendant\u2019s life by helping him put on a life jacket and pushing him overboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">The plain language of \u00a7 501.2(a)(3) states that a defendant is precluded from safety-valve relief if the offense resulted in serious bodily injury to <em>any </em>person. Thus, the injuries to Lerma\u2019s co-defendant alone preclude the relief. Furthermore, nothing in \u00a7 5C1.2 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) provides for safety-valve relief where a co-defendant sustains serious injury, but the defendant also saved a co-defendant\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-17\">Because Lerma did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 501.2(a)(3), the district court correctly denied Lerma a two-level safety-valve reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-18\">B. Mitigating-Role Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b472-19\">Lerma contends that the district court should have awarded him a two-level mitigating-role reduction because he was merely a crew member aboard the vessel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>If the defendant was a minor participant in the criminal activity, the district court decreases the offense level by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. If the defendant was a minimal participant in the criminal activity, the district court decreases the offense level by four levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a). A minimal participant is one who \u201cplays a minimal role in concerted activity\u201d and the phrase \u201cis intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4. The defendant has the burden to establish his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction applies, the district court considers two principles: (1) the defendant\u2019s role in the offense compared to the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level; and (2) the defendant\u2019s role compared to that of other participants in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45. \u201c[I]n the drug courier context ... the amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct .... [and] may be dispositive \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 in the extreme case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. Additionally, \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Here, Lerma was held accountable for only the amount of cocaine found on board the vessel. Thus, Lerma\u2019s relevant conduct was identical to his actual conduct in the importation scheme. Furthermore, the amount of drugs Lerma and his co-defendants were transporting \u2014 5,000 kilograms \u2014 was substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In addition, Lerma did not show that he was less culpable than most of the other identifiable participants in the offense. Lerma was one of four deck hands on the vessel. As part of his job, Lerma took shifts driving the vessel. While Lerma and the other deck hands may have been less culpable than the captain of the vessel or the \u201cload guard,\u201d we cannot say Lerma was a minor participant. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (explaining that it is possible for there to be no minor participants in a conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Lerma\u2019s contention that the district court failed to \u201cmake a specific comparison\u201d to Lerma\u2019s co-defendants is without merit. The district court stated on the record that Lerma was \u201csimilarly situated with the other defendants.... \u201d In any event, the district court is not required to compare each identifiable participant to the defendant on the record. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940 (\u201c[A] district court is not required to make any specific findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Thus, the district court did not clearly err in denying Lerma a mitigating-role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-14\">.
