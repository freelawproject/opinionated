Huertas wished to file a complaint in the District Court without paying the filing fees. Accordingly, he submitted an application to proceed <em>informa pauper-is. </em>In his application, he reported a monthly income of $1927.90 (Social Security benefits and disability benefits from the Veterans Administration) and a balance of $952.60 in a money market account. He did not report any expenses. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Court denied Huertas\u2019s application, noting that he had available funds to pay the filing fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Huertas appeals. He has filed an application to appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>He reports a similar monthly income and slightly higher account balance. Unlike in the District Court, Huertas\u2019s application includes a listing of his monthly expenses. Also, in a supplemental filing in response to our request, Huertas provides a detailed accounting of many of his expenses. His expenses are approximately equal to his monthly income.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We will grant Huertas\u2019s application, but we will summarily affirm, resolving the apparent contradiction in the process. Essentially, on appeal, Huertas met his burden to show that he is not able to pay the fees, while, in the District Court, he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">We have jurisdiction over Huertas\u2019s appeal because the District Court\u2019s order denying leave to proceed <em>informa pauper-is </em>is a final, collateral order appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie, </em>239 F.3d 307, 311 (3d Cir.2001). We review the District Court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jones v. Zimmerman, </em>752 F.2d 76, 78 (3d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The decision to grant <em>informa pauperis </em>turns on whether an applicant is \u201ceconomically eligible\u201d for such status. <em>Sinwell v. Shapp, </em>536 F.2d 15, 19 (3d Cir.1976) (citation omitted). A person need not be \u201cabsolutely destitute\u201d to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, Adkins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 339, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948); however, an affiant must show the inability to pay the fees on appeal, <em>see Walker v. People Express Airlines, Inc., </em>886 F.2d 598, 601 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Huertas <em>in forma pauperis </em>status on the basis of his affidavit. In the District Court, Huertas described his monthly income and an account balance. Unlike in his application to us (and in his response to our order), he did not list any expenses or liabilities in his application to the District Court. Given the information that Huertas provided, it cannot be said that the District Court abused its discretion in concluding that Huertas had funds available to pay the requisite fees. Accordingly, although we grant Huertas\u2019s application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
