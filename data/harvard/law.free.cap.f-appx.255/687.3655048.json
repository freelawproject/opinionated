In that complaint, Shemonsky alleged that Judge John J. Thomas, who presided over appellant\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding, improperly dismissed that action. Shemonsky sought unspecified monetary damages. Concluding that Judge Thomas is immune from suit, the District Court dismissed Shemonsky\u2019s complaint. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The District Court was correct to conclude that Shemonsky\u2019s claims against Judge Thomas are barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity. It is a well-established principle that judges are absolutely immune from suits for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 when they act in a judicial capacity. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (citation omitted) (\u201cA judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the \u2018clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d). Because the act that Shemonsky complains of \u2014 dismissal of his bankruptcy action \u2014 was performed by Judge Thomas in his official capacity, Judge Thomas is entitled to judicial immunity. <em>See Gallas v. Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, </em>211 F.3d 760, 768-69 (3d Cir.2000). As the District Court properly advised, should Shemonsky wish to challenge the dismissal of the bankruptcy action referenced in the complaint, the appropriate remedy is an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Having found no merit to this appeal, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
