The district court\u2019s calculation of the quantity of drugs involved in an offense is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). For guideline purposes, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that, with the related conduct, Driver possessed 156.2 grams of crack.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Considering Agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Coffindaffer\u2019s testimony about the reliability of the informants, and the corroborating testimony of Officers Caruthers and Broadwater, the district court did not clearly err, and did not violate due process, in finding that the information in the presentence report concerning other quantities of crack possessed or sold by Driver was sufficiently reliable. <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>1 F.3d 341, 343-44 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Young, </em>981 F.2d 180, 184-86 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Driver argues that the district court erred in holding him accountable for uncharged relevant conduct that does not fall within the definition contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. The district court\u2019s finding is a factual determination reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 118 (5th Cir.1995). Driver was directly involved in the possession and sale of additional quantities of crack cocaine during the fall and winter of 2005 at the Bideker St. location, which was part of the same course of conduct under section lB1.3(a)(2). The district court did not clearly err in finding that this was relevant conduct. <em>See United States v. Bethley, </em>973 F.2d 396, 400-01 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Driver argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. He contends that the district court never stated why it denied acceptance of responsibility. He argues that the district court could not properly deny acceptance of responsibility because he denied uncharged relevant conduct. This court accords \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the sentencing court\u2019s refusal to credit a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. <em>Vital, </em>68 F.3d at 121. Having already determined that the conduct of distributing additional quantities of crack was relevant conduct, the district court\u2019s denial of acceptance of responsibility for the reason that Driver had falsely denied to the probation officer this relevant conduct is entitled to this court\u2019s \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>See Vital, </em>68 F.3d at 120-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. . R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-15\">. The maximum statutory sentence for selling 1.56 grams of crack is 20 years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-16\">. Based of Driver\u2019s Criminal History Category of VI and a Total Offense Level of 34 (between 150 and 500 grams of crack), his Guideline Imprisonment Range was between 262 and 327 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5A, Sentencing Table. Since the guideline range was higher that the maximum statutory term of imprisonment of 20 years, his guideline range was reduced to 240 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). Additionally, Driver\u2019s 240 month sentence would have been within the guideline range even if the district court had found that he possessed as little as fifty grams of crack. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5A, Sentencing Table (a Total Offense Level of 32 and a Criminal History Category of VI produces a guideline range between 210 and 262 months).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b949-7\">.
