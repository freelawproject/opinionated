We will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-16\">Chen entered the United States without inspection in 2003. He was placed in removal proceedings and applied for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Chen testified that his parents were Falun Gong practitioners. One day when his parents were out practicing Falun Gong, government officials came to his parents\u2019 house looking for them. The officers looked around the house and then left a summons for Chen\u2019s parents to appears later that day at a public security office. Chen went to tell his uncle, who warned Chen\u2019s parents. Chen returned to the family home. The next day, the government officials returned and became angry when Chen said he did not know where his parents were. One of the officials slapped Chen in the face and threatened that Chen would be arrested and held if his parents did not surrender. Chen left for his uncle\u2019s house, where he stayed for a week. He then moved to his aunt\u2019s house in a nearby town where he stayed for about three months before leaving China.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-17\">The IJ stated that he was \u201cnot convinced that the respondent has submitted a truthful or credible claim,\u201d but found in the alternative, that even if Chen were credible, he had not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. A.R. 30, 33. The BIA explicitly adopted the holding that Chen \u201cfailed to met the burdens of proof on his claims of persecution and torture, even assuming that he testified credibly. A.R. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-18\">We agree that the incident during which Chen was threatened with arrest does not rise to the level of persecution. We further agree that Chen did not present evidence that he was likely to be persecuted in the future. Chen testified that he does not practice Falun Gong.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>record also shows that he was able to live with relatives in a nearby village for several months without any problems. Further, the IJ\u2019s finding that Chen left China legally undercuts his claim that he will be persecuted or tortured for leaving illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Chen argued in his brief to the BIA that his attorney was ineffective, but the BIA found that Chen had not properly presented his claim, as he had not complied with the requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also Lu, </em>259 F.3d at 132 <em>(Lozada </em>requirements are a \u201creasonable exercise of the Board\u2019s discretion\u201d). We therefore do not reach Chen\u2019s ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Chen also belatedly attempts to raise a claim that he will be persecuted because, if he marries, he wants to have at least three children. Besides being highly speculative, this claim was not raised before the IJ and BIA and is therefore not exhausted. <em>Abdulrahman, </em>330 F.3d at 594-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-15\">.
