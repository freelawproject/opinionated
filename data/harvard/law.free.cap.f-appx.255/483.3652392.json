On appeal, Pizano-Rico argues that his sentence is unreasonable because: (1) the court failed to consider adequately the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); (2) the court failed to apply the \u201cparsimony principle\u201d of section 3553(a); and (3) a sentence at or below the low end of the guidelines range would serve as an adequate deterrent, protect the general public, and comport with Congress\u2019s intent to punish offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We review a final sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1229 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we must consider the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\"><em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">When applying these factors to a particular sentence, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[,]\u201d and \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors because \u2018[o]ur review is not de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">While the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is not required to discuss each factor. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>Where the court imposes a within-guidelines sentence, the district court need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">Although we do not presume reasonable a sentence that is within the guidelines range, <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.2007), we have explained that \u201cthe use of the Guidelines remains central to the sentencing process.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 787. Accordingly, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose\u201d and the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>able in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">At sentencing, the government pointed out that Pizano-Rico had been previously convicted of criminal offenses on seven separate occasions, three of which were felonies. (R. 5-4.) After being deported to Mexico in 2003, Pizano-Rico was discovered in the United States in August 2005, in Gainesville, Georgia, upon his arrest for choking a woman about the neck. (R. 5-5, 4-6.) Due to Pizano-Rico\u2019s total offense level of twenty-one and criminal history category of V, the applicable guideline range was 70-87 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u201cThe \u2018parsimony provision\u2019 provides a sentence shall be \u2018sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [3553(a)(2)].\u201d\u2019 <em>United States v. Lazo, </em>227 Fed.Appx. 882, 884 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). In fashioning Pizano-Rico\u2019s sentence, the district court explicitly stated that it had \u201cconsidered not only the guidelines, but took into consideration the statutory provisions of 3553, as well, and believe[d] a sentence in the guideline range in this instance meets all of the requirements of a fair and just sentence in this case.\u201d (R. 5-9.) More particularly, the court found that Pizano-Rico\u2019s \u201cprior record is not good at all in this case, and he continues to return to this country when deported, which reflects very poorly upon his ability to adhere to conditions of the law.\u201d (R. 5-9.) It is clear, therefore, that the district court found that an 87-month sentence was \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to effectuate the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a), namely, to provide just punishment for the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, and to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Pizano-Rico fails to carry his burden of proving that the sentence imposed was unreasonable in light of the pertinent section 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
