Green contends that the district court erred by applying a four-level increase to his offense level for possessing a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense, possession of cocaine, under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). We review its factfindings for clear error and will disturb them only if we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-17\">In calculating the guideline range for a firearm possession offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), a four-level increase to the base offense level is required \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance .of the evidence the facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement. <em>United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 175, 169 L.Ed.2d 119 (2007), we addressed the meaning of the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). <em>Id. </em>at 1280. We concluded that the phrase \u201cshould be given its ordinary and natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>meaning,\u201d and we \u201cexpressly rejected a more restrictive interpretation\u201d that would require \u201cthe firearm to serve a purpose related to the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). We also noted that in previous cases applying other guideline provisions that include the phrase \u201cin connection with,\u201d we have held that \u201cin certain circumstances, mere possession of a firearm can be enough to apply a sentencing enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Here, the district court found that Green may have intended to commit a robbery with the firearm and that he may have possessed the cocaine to \u201cembolden\u201d himself \u201cprior to committing the robbery.\u201d The district court also found that Green may have possessed the firearm in order to protect \u201cthe small amount of drugs that he kept for his personal use.\u201d In light of Green\u2019s criminal history, which includes previous convictions for robbery and drug trafficking, as well as the stun gun, ski mask, and ammunition found in the car at the time of Green\u2019s arrest, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s factfindings are clearly erroneous. Those findings are based on reasonable inferences drawn from undisputed facts, and are sufficient to warrant the \u201cin connection with\u201d enhancement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">We find additional support for this conclusion in <em>United States v. Hardin, </em>139 F.3d 813, 815 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998), where we affirmed without discussion a \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement of a defendant\u2019s sentence for possessing a firearm in connection with possessing methamphetamine. Our recent decision in <em>Smith </em>further bolsters our conclusion. There, we held that \u201ca preponderance of the evidence supported the district court\u2019s finding that [the defendant] possessed the ammunition in connection with the other felony offenses of either cocaine possession or resisting arrest, or both\u201d where the only connection between the firearm and cocaine possession chai'ges was that the defendant committed them simultaneously. <em>Smith, </em>480 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-14\">. This provision is now codified in subsection (b)(6) of the same guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (Nov.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
