Mina, Belalcazar-Vallealla, Vallecilla-Velez, and Murillo-Cuero also appeal their sentences imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The defendants present three arguments. First, all of the defendants contend that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Second, four defendants contend that they were entitled to minor role reductions in their sentences. Third, three defendants argue that their sentences are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>A. The Defendants Waived Their Argument That Their Convictions Are Invalid In Their Unconditional Guilty Pleas.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The defendants argue that their convictions are invalid because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The defendants contend that the district court erroneously concluded that the \u201cRio Mar I was, at the time it was interdicted by the United States Coast Guard, a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, [because] the government of [Colombia], the F/V Rio Mar I\u2019s flag nation, consented to the enforcement of United States law by the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a), (c)(1)(C), (f). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The problem for each defendant is that each entered an unconditional plea of guilty. We review <em>de novo </em>whether a voluntary, unconditional plea of guilty waives the ability to appeal a particular issue. <em>See United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1320 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). \u201c[A] voluntary, unconditional guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects in the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The defendants\u2019 argument that jurisdiction did not exist over the Rio Mar I is different from a challenge to the authority of the district court over the case and controversy. Under the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, \u201c[i]t is unlawful for any person ... on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d knowingly to possess with the intent to distribute a controlled substance. 46 U.S.CApp. \u00a7 1903(a). Because the indictments of the defendants charged them with a violation of this law of the United States, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over their actions. <em>See McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1252 n. 11 (11th Cir.2001); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. The defendants waived the argument that the Rio Mar I was not a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States when they pleaded guilty unconditionally. <em>See Patti, </em>337 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">\n<em>B. The Argument of Mina, Belaleazar-Vallealla, Vallecilla-Velez, and Murillo-Cuero That They Were Entitled To A Minor Role Reduction Is Subject To An Enforceable Appeal Waiver.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">Mina, Belalcazar-Vallealla, VallecillaVelez, and Murillo-Cuero argue that the district court erred when it denied them a minor role reduction, but the government contends that an enforceable appeal waiver bars this argument. A defendant may waive his statutory right to appeal. <em>See United States v. Grinard-Henry, </em>399 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cWaiver will be enforced if the government demonstrates <em>either: </em>(1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant about the waiver during the plea colloquy, or (2) the record clearly shows that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Benitez-Zapata, </em>131 F.3d 1444, 1446 (11th Cir.1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">We agree with the government. The record establishes that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>court specifically questioned Mina, Belalcazar-Vallealla, Vallecilla-Velez, and Murillo-Cuero during the plea colloquy about the appeal waiver and adequately explained the significance of the waiver. Because Mina, Belaleazar-Vallealla, Vallecilla-Velez, and Murillo-Cuero knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal their sentences on this ground, we dismiss this portion of their appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\n<em>C. The Sentences of Mina, VallecillaVelez, and Belaleazar-Vallealla Are Reasonable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Three of the defendants challenge the reasonableness of their sentences. Mina argues that his sentence of 188 months of imprisonment is unreasonable because the government offered to recommend a sentence of eight years of imprisonment and Mina\u2019s history and characteristics support imposition of a lower sentence. VallecillaVelez argues that his sentence of 235 months of imprisonment is grossly disproportionate to similarly situated defendants. Belaleazar-Vallealla challenges his below-Guidelines sentence of 144 months of imprisonment and argues that his \u201csentence is disparate from the other similarly situated defendant.\u201d These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">-We review, a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen we review a sentence for reasonableness, we do not, as the district court did, determine the exact sentence to be imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe must evaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines.range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The transcript of the sentencing hearing establishes that the district court sentenced Mina, Vallecilla-Velez, and Belalcazar-Vallealla after careful consideration of their arguments in favor of mitigation, the Guidelines, and the sentencing factors of section 3553(a). Mina was sentenced at the low-end of the Guidelines range. Vallecilla-Velez\u2019s sentence was within the Guidelines-range and higher than the sentences of his codefendants because the district court determined that, unlike some of the other defendants, Vallecilla-Velez was not entitled to an reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Belalcazar-Vallealla\u2019s sentence was below the Guidelines range. The sentences of Mina, Vallecilla-Velez, and Belaleazar-Vallealla are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
