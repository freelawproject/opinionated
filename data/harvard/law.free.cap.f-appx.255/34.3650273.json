Boyd sued Wal-Mart after she slipped and fell in one of its stores. Wal-Mart filed for summary judgment, which the district court granted. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-21\">1. After shopping in Wal-Mart, Boyd was leaving the store with her daughter when she slipped and fell in a puddle of clear liquid that had accumulated somewhere between the customer-service area of the store and the front exit. As a result of her fall, Boyd badly injured her right knee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-22\">Boyd filed suit in Louisiana state court, alleging that Wal-Mart\u2019s negligence had caused her injury. WalMart removed the case to federal court and filed for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and Boyd appealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-23\">2. We review grants of summary judgment applying the same legal stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>dard as the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has explained, summary judgment is proper when the non-moving party cannot \u201cmake a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In such situations, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">B. Here, Boyd filed suit under Louisiana law, which places the burden on plaintiffs in slip-and-fall cases to prove, among other things, that \u201c[t]he merchant either created or had actual or constructive notice of the condition\u201d that caused the fall.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">In an attempt to meet her burden, Boyd argues that Wal-Mart had constructive notice of the liquid on its floor. To prove that Wal-Mart had such notice, Boyd must show that the liquid was on the floor \u201cfor such a period of time that it would have been discovered if [Wal-Mart] had exercised reasonable care.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>White v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court explained that because the constructive-notice requirement includes a temporal element\u2014 \u201cfor such a period of time\u201d \u2014 the plaintiff carries a burden beyond showing that the merchant acted unreasonably:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq\">A claimant who simply shows that the condition existed, without an additional showing that the condition existed for some time before the fall has not carried the burden of proving constructive notice.... Though the time period need not be specific in minutes or hours, constructive notice requires that the claimant prove the condition existed for some time period prior to the fall.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-12\">Boyd has not presented any evidence concerning the length of time the liquid was on the floor. Boyd instead argues that because Wal-Mart has no record of the last time it checked the floors, the liquid could have been there for hours. But providing evidence that the liquid was on the floor \u201cfor some time period prior to the fall\u201d is Boyd\u2019s burden, not WalMart\u2019s. Because Boyd did not meet that burden, the district court properly granted Wal-Mart summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b64-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
