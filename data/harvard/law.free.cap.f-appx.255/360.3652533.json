B.G. is a \u201cseverely emotionally disturbed\u201d eight-year-old boy who has been diagnosed with many conditions, including Mood Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, Impulse Control Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and Schizoaffective Disorder. His parents, L.G. and K.G., adopted him at birth. B.G. began exhibiting serious emotional, social, and behavioral problems at age three, and he has already been through many educational institutions and hospitals in New York and Florida during his short life. In June 2004, B.G. and his parents moved from New York to Florida, where they met with the School Board to discuss an individual education program for B.G. After significant consideration, including a review of the individual education program prepared by B.G.\u2019s previous school district in New York that had recommended placement in a residential facility, the School Board decided to place B.G. at Indian Ridge School, a therapeutic day school that serves the needs of severely emotionally disturbed students.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In July 2004, B.G. was hospitalized at Columbia Hospital after a violent episode at home with his parents. At the recommendation of B.G.\u2019s treating psychologist, B.G.\u2019s parents decided to enroll him in Sandy Pines Hospital, a residential behavioral health facility, rather than placing him at Indian Ridge as provided by the School Board\u2019s individual education program. B.G. was admitted into Sandy Pines on July 12, 2004, and discharged on October 11, 2004. His behavior at Sandy Pines was \u201cuncontrollable,\u201d and he did not show many signs of improvement outside the classroom. After his discharge from Sandy Pines, B.G. has been hospitalized a number of times and has been in and out of two therapeutic day schools. In January 2005, he was placed at Tampa Bay Academy, a residential facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1003.57(l)(e), B.G.\u2019s parents requested a due process hearing before the State of Florida, Division of Administrative Hearings, seeking reimbursement for costs incurred while B.G. attended Sandy Pines. On March 7, 2005, Administrative Law Judge Florence Snyder Rivas denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for reimbursement. Judge Rivas also denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request to keep the record open in order to hear new facts regarding B.G.\u2019s December 2004 hospitalization at the Fort Lauderdale Children\u2019s Hospital. She had confirmed with the plaintiffs at the start of the hearing that the only issue presented was the reimbursement of expenses related to B.G.\u2019s stay at Sandy Pines, whereas the new facts related to the broader matter of whether B.G.\u2019s individual education program should be modified to provide for residential treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In the district court, the plaintiffs again sought to supplement the record with new facts that occurred after B.G.\u2019s discharge from Sandy Pines. The district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request, finding that the new facts were beyond the scope of the due process hearing because they did not relate to whether the plaintiffs should be reimbursed for B.G.\u2019s stay at Sandy Pines. The court then granted summary judgment for the School Board, concluding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to reimbursement because: (1) they failed to show that B.G.\u2019s attendance at Indian Ridge did not provide a free appropriate public edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>cation; and (2) even if Indian Ridge did not provide a free appropriate public education, the plaintiffs could not show that Sandy Pines provided an appropriate education.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred by denying their motion to supplement the record with the following additional evidence: (1) records regarding B.G.\u2019s placement at Tampa Bay Academy; (2) medical records from his hospitalization at Fort Lauderdale Children\u2019s Hospital on December 1, 2004; (3) medical records from B.G.\u2019s hospitalizations at Columbia Pavilion Hospital in January 2005; (4) plaintiffs\u2019 request to update B.G.\u2019s individual education program and the School Board\u2019s response; (5) medical reports from Dr. Goldberg, the treating psychiatrist at Tampa Bay Academy; and (6) checks payable from B.G.\u2019s parents to Tampa Bay Academy. The plaintiffs contend that the new facts would have given the district court a fuller understanding of B.G.\u2019s condition at the time of the due process hearing, and that their inclusion would not change the proceedings from a review of the state administrative law judge\u2019s decision to a <em>de novo </em>trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion, and evidentiary rulings will be overturned only if the moving party establishes that the ruling resulted in a \u2018substantial prejudicial effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Piamba Cortes v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>177 F.3d 1272, 1305 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). Under an abuse of discretion standard, \u201cwe must affirm unless we at least determine that the district court has made a \u2018clear error of judgment,\u2019 or has applied an incorrect legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The IDEA provides that when reviewing the decision of the state administrative law judge, the district court \u201cshall hear additional evidence at the request of a party.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(ii). We have said that \u201c[a] trial court must make an independent ruling based on the preponderance of the evidence, but the Act contemplates that the source of the evidence generally will be the administrative hearing record, with some supplementation at trial.\u201d <em>Walker County Sch. Dist. v. Bennett ex rel. Bennett, </em>203 F.3d 1293, 1298 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">\u201cThe reasons for supplementation will vary; they might include gaps in the administrative transcript owing to mechanical failure, unavailability of a witness, an improper exclusion of evidence by the administrative agency, and evidence concerning relevant events occurring subsequent to the administrative hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe starting point for determining what additional evidence should be received, however, is the record of the administrative proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have cautioned that the district court \u201cmust be careful not to allow [additional] evidence to change the character of the hearing from one of review to a trial <em>de novo.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">\u201cThe philosophy of the [IDEA] is that plaintiffs are required to utilize the elaborate administrative scheme established by the Act before resorting to the courts to challenge the actions of the local school authorities.\u201d <em>N.B. v. Alachua County Sch. Bd., </em>84 F.3d 1376, 1378-79 (11th Cir.1996) (citation omitted, alteration in original). The appropriate administrative procedure in Florida is to request a due process hearing with a state administrative law judge in the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f), (i); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1003.57(e). If a party is aggrieved by the final decision of the state administrative law judge, then he can file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>civil action challenging the decision in state or federal court. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1003.57(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion here. First, the scope of the due process hearing was clearly limited to whether the School Board had to reimburse the plaintiffs for B.G.\u2019s placement at Sandy Pines from July 12, 2004, to October 11, 2004. At the outset of the due process hearing, Administrative Law Judge Rivas clarified with the parties that this reimbursement issue was the only one for decision at the hearing. The additional evidence the plaintiffs sought to have admitted went beyond the scope of that issue by focusing on events that occurred after B.G. was discharged from Sandy Pines. Therefore, it is not relevant, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Second, throughout the hearing, the plaintiffs repeatedly sought to keep the evidence and the issue limited to B.G.\u2019s hospitalization at Sandy Pines. For example, they objected when the School Board attempted to introduce evidence about the nature and extent of the educational and counseling services B.G. was receiving in November 2004 following his discharge from Sandy Pines. On the last day of the hearing, however, the plaintiffs had asked Judge Rivas to expand the hearing to include B.G.\u2019s placement in Tampa Bay Academy, which had occurred after his discharge from Sandy Pines.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Judge Rivas determined that the Tampa Bay placement constituted a new case and would therefore require a new due process hearing. She informed the plaintiffs that the proper procedure to follow would be to request a new due process hearing on that issue. The district court agreed with Judge Rivas that the evidence plaintiffs sought to admit was outside the scope of the hearing and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request to supplement the record. We agree. The plaintiffs themselves, by objecting to the School Board\u2019s post-Sandy Pines evidence, confirmed that the scope of the hearing was limited to reimbursement. Therefore, the additional evidence that the plaintiffs sought to exclude as not relevant is outside the scope of the hearing, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The plaintiffs next contend that the district court erred by giving some deference to the findings of fact in the state administrative law judge\u2019s decision, which they believe should have been given no weight. We review the district judge\u2019s deference to the state administrative law judge\u2019s findings only for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jefferson County Bd. of Educ. v. Breen, </em>853 F.2d 853, 857 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe extent of deference to be given the administrative findings of fact is an issue left to the discretion of the district court.\u201d). \u201c[T]he role of the district court is to review the administrative determinations\u201d of the state administrative law judge. <em>Doe v. Ala. State Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>915 F.2d 651, 657 n. 3 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cThe court must consider the administrative findings of fact, but is free to accept or reject them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Having reviewed the entire record, the district court determined that Judge Rivas had \u201crepeatedly clarified the scope of the hearing\u201d in order to ensure that all the issues were addressed. Furthermore, the court noted that Judge Rivas \u201calso showed an immense sensitivity to B.G.\u2019s parents throughout the hearing.... Simply because she ultimately ruled against Plaintiffs\u2019 position does not prove that she was biased against B.G.\u2019s parents.\u201d The district court acted within its discretion in granting some deference of Judge Rivas\u2019 findings of fact. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The plaintiffs also contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the School Board because there was a genuine issue of material fact about whether the Board\u2019s individual education program, which required that B.G. be placed in Indian Ridge, provided him with a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Cruz v. Publix Super Mkts., Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1379, 1382 (11th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivJP. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The IDEA guarantees disabled students a free appropriate public education. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A). A free appropriate public education is defined as \u201cspecial education and related services that (A) have been provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge; (B) meet the standards of the State educational agency; (C) include an appropi\u2019iate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school education in the State involved; and (D) are provided in conformity with [an] individualized education program.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The Supreme Court has held that an appropriate education consists of \u201caccess to specialized instruction and related services which are individually designed to provide educational benefit to the [disabled] child.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 201, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 3048, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982). It does not mean \u201ca potential-maximizing education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197 n. 21, 102 S.Ct. at 3046 n. 21. Rather, the substantive question is whether a placement is \u201creasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 102 S.Ct. at 3051. We have said that \u201cappropriate education\u201d means \u201cmaking measurable and adequate gains in the classroom. If \u2018meaningful gains\u2019 across settings means more than making measurable and adequate gains in the classroom, they are not required\u201d by the Act. <em>JSK v. Hendry County Sch. Bd., </em>941 F.2d 1563, 1573 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">A central principle of the IDEA is that the education of a disabled student \u201cwill be provided where possible in regular public schools, with the child participating as much as possible in the same activities as [nondisabled] children, but [it] also provides for placement in private schools at public expense where this is not possible.\u201d <em>Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ. of Mass., </em>471 U.S. 359, 369, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 2002, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985). Thus, the school board must use the least restrictive means to educate these students; a state is forbidden from funding a placement that fails to educate a child in the least restrictive environment. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">If the parents of a disabled child \u201cenroll the child in a private elementary school or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). However, \u201cparents who unilaterally change then- child\u2019s placement ... without the consent of state or local school officials, do so at their own financial risk. If the courts ultimately determine that the IEP proposed by the school officials was appropriate, the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ents would be barred from obtaining reimbursement.\u201d <em>Sch. Comm. of Burlington, </em>471 U.S. at 373-74, 105 S.Ct. at 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The Supreme Court has established a two-part test for reimbursement cases. First, the parents seeking reimbursement must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the school district has failed to offer a free appropriate public education to the student. <em>Schaffer v. Weast, </em>546 U.S. 49, 62, 126 S.Ct. 528, 537, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005); <em>Sch. Comm. of Burlington, </em>471 U.S. at 370, 105 S.Ct. at 2002. If the parents have shown that an appropriate education was not provided, then they, as the parties seeking relief, must show by a preponderance of the evidence that their alternative private school placement was proper under the IDEA. <em>Schaffer, </em>546 U.S. at 62, 126 S.Ct. at 537; <em>Sch. Comm. of Burlington, </em>471 U.S. at 370, 105 S.Ct. at 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In <em>Devine v. Indian River County School Board, </em>249 F.3d 1289 (11th Cir.2001), we affirmed the denial of a parental reimbursement claim for a severely impaired autistic student. The parents claimed that the student suffered from serious behavioral problems at home, and they decided to place him in a residential facility rather than the day school selected by the school district. <em>Id. </em>at 1292. We emphasized that the standard for an appropriate education is whether the student is making \u201cmeasurable and adequate gains in the classroom,\u201d not whether the child\u2019s progress in a school setting carried over to the home setting. <em>Id. </em>at 1293. And we concluded that because testimony from the student\u2019s teachers at the day school established that he was making progress at school and meeting most of the educational goals set for him, the school district was providing him with a free appropriate public education. <em>Id. </em>at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The plaintiffs argue that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the School Board\u2019s placement of B.G. at the Indian Ridge day school provided him with a free appropriate public education. They contend that the state administrative law judge and the district court ignored testimony from numerous witnesses indicating that because of B.G.\u2019s violent behavior at home, the only appropriate placement for him would be at a residential facility, such as Sandy Pines. We disagree, as did the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The plaintiffs first presented evidence that in early July 2004, B.G. had a violent episode at home, where he threw things, tried to smash a mirror over his mother\u2019s head, and ran out into th\u00e9 street in traffic. Although this behavior is alarming, we have said that a free appropriate public education consists of meaningful gains inside the classroom, and that the IDEA does not require that the student be able to generalize behaviors from the classroom to the home setting. <em>See JSK, </em>941 F.2d at 1573. Therefore, this evidence of B.G.\u2019s behavior at home does not establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact about whether he had been provided a free appropriate public education at Indian Ridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Next, the plaintiffs contend that B.G.\u2019s records from Sandy Pines demonstrate that he was an uncontrollable child who was violently unstable and had to be given powerful medication, called a PRN, many times because he would not calm down. Although the evidence does show that B.G. had tantrums and displayed manipulative behavior, once Sandy Pines personnel discovered that ignoring B.G.\u2019s behavior caused him to stop acting out, he began earning good grades and interacted well with his peers. Furthermore, Dr. Jeffrey Huttman, B.G.\u2019s therapist at Sandy Pines, and Karen Fleming, Sandy Pines\u2019 liaison, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>both testified that B.G. was an appropriate candidate for Indian Ridge because most of his bad behaviors occurred outside the school day. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence again related to B.G.\u2019s behavior outside the classroom, and the record shows that he was making progress inside the classroom, the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Indian Ridge provided B.G. with a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The plaintiffs finally argue that the testimony of Dr. Suanne Mallenbaum, B.G.\u2019s psychiatrist in New York who recommended that he be placed at Sandy Pines, demonstrates that Indian Ridge did not provide a free appropriate public education for him. However, Dr. Mallenbaum testified that she was not kept fully informed after the plaintiffs moved to Florida, had no access to B.G.\u2019s medical records after the move to Florida, and was basing her recommendation for residential placement primarily on the difficulties that B.G. was having with his parents at home. Because a free appropriate public education means that the student is making meaningful gains in the classroom, Dr. Mallenbaum\u2019s testimony regarding B.G.\u2019s at-home behavior does not raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Indian Ridge provided B.G. with a free appropriate public education. <em>See JSK, </em>941 F.2d at 1573.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Because all of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence relates to B.G.\u2019s behavior at home, and none of it shows that he was not making progress inside the classroom, the plaintiffs failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact about whether Indian Ridge provided B.G. with a free appropriate public education. All evidence indicates that it did. <em>See Devine, </em>249 F.3d at 1292-93 (denying a parental reimbursement claim for a severely impaired autistic student because the student was making progress at school, despite suffering from serious behavioral problems at home).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
