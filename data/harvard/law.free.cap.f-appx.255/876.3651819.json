Watson argues that the District Court erred when it denied his motion to suppress the evidence because the search warrant was not sufficiently particular with regard to the search and seizure of electronic data. Watson\u2019s argument is unavailing because the officers seized the electronic data in good faith reliance on the search warrant, and the evidence was subject to the \u201cplain view doctrine.\u201d <em>See United States v. Waldrop, </em>404 F.3d 365, 368 (5th Cir.2005) <em>United States v. Cavazos, </em>288 F.3d 706, 709 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>19 F.3d 984, 987-988 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-23\">Watson\u2019s argument that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the District Court imposed a Guideline sentence without adequate explanation is similarly unavailing. The District Court stated that it considered the Guidelines as advisory and that it considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Where, as here, a District Court sentences a defendant within a properly calculated Guidelines range, \u201clit-, tie explanation is required,\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005), and the sentence is presumptively reasonable, <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The facts of Watson\u2019s offense, the arguments at sentencing, and the District Court\u2019s written statement of reasons demonstrates that the District Court exercised its own legal decisionmaking authority in imposing the Guideline sentence in this case. This is legally sufficient. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468. Accordingly, the decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
