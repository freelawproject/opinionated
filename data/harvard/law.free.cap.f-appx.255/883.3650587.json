Nelson contends that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) unconstitutionally extended his prison term by failing to deport him by March 23, 2006. He claims the agencies are liable for his \u201cillegal ... incarceration\u201d and the stress they have caused his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">When an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>pro se </em>litigants must still brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Nelson does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that, because he had already been released and deported, his \u00a7 2241 petition was moot. Accordingly, Nelson has abandoned any challenge to the dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition as moot. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25; <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-22\">The denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Edwards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 995 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc). Under this standard, \u201c[i]t is not enough that the granting of relief might have been permissible, or even warranted-denial must have been so unwarranted as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). The only relief Nelson specifically requested from the district court was his immediate release from prison and deportation. He was released and deported. Thus, it cannot be said that the district court abused its discretion in denying Nelson\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
