Singh challenges the order on the grounds that the BIA abused its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s request for relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c) of the INA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For reasons that follow, we deny Singh\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Gurdarshan Singh, a native of India, was admitted into the United States in November 1986 as a non-immigrant visitor and became a lawful permanent resident in February 1992. Since entering the United States, Singh has resided in the Washington, D.C. area, where he has served as a spiritual leader for the Indian Sikh community. Singh also gave piano lessons to children in the Sikh community.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In 1996, Singh was accused of improperly touching one of his piano students, whom he had taught from 1989 until 1991. The alleged victim was between eleven and thirteen years of age during the relevant time period. In January 1997, Singh pled guilty to one count of Sexual Offense in the Fourth Degree in violation of Article 27, \u00a7 464(C) of the Maryland Code. <em>Recodified with new language without substantive change as </em>Md.Code Ann., Criminal Law \u00a7 3-305 (2002). On April 9, 1997, his plea was entered by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland. Singh was sentenced to one year imprisonment, which was suspended, and eighteen months probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In June 1997, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service filed a Notice to Appear against Singh, stating that he was removable (1) under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(I), as an alien who, after admission to the United States, was convicted of a crime of child abuse, and (2) under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien who, after admission to the United States, was convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), specifically, sexual abuse of a minor. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">After filing a motion for reconsideration in his state court criminal proceedings, in August 1997, Singh was resentenced to 360 days imprisonment, which was suspended, and his plea was amended to clarify that he was convicted of violating \u00a7 464(C)(a)(l) of the Maryland Code, which provided that: \u201cA person is guilty of a sexual offense in the fourth degree if the person engages: (1) in sexual contact with another person against the will and without the consent of the other person.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">At Singh\u2019s initial removal hearing in October 1997, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) orally declared Singh removable as an aggravated felon, and in May 1998, the IJ issued a written decision sustaining Singh\u2019s charge of deportability and ordering him removed to India. In June 1998, Singh filed a motion to reconsider his deportability status and also filed for deferral of removal under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cTorture Convention\u201d), which prohibits the return of an individual to a country where \u201csubstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>grounds\u201d exist for believing that he would be \u201cin danger of being subject to torture.\u201d Singh submitted evidence that he had been subject to persecution and torture in India and that he would \u201clikely be subject to torture\u201d should he return to India. The IJ denied Singh\u2019s motion to reconsider on two grounds: first, the motion was untimely, and second, even if the motion had been timely, Singh still stood \u201cconvicted of an aggravated felony.\u201d The IJ also held that she lacked authority to adjudicate Singh\u2019s Torture Convention claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">On appeal, Singh again contested his deportability status and also filed a motion to reopen \u2014 considered by the BIA a motion to remand \u2014 so that he could apply for relief under the Torture Convention. In August 1999, the BIA remanded to the IJ for adjudication of Singh\u2019s Torture Convention claim. Singh did not appeal the BIA\u2019s remand decision to this Court. On remand in February 2000, the IJ granted Singh\u2019s request for deferral of removal under the Torture Convention. Singh remained in the United States pursuant to the IJ\u2019s order deferring removal under the Torture Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Five years later, in April 2005, Singh filed a motion to reopen, seeking relief from deportation under former \u00a7 212(c) of the INA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), <em>repealed by </em>Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-597 (1996) (replacing \u00a7 212(c) with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b). The IJ denied this motion, finding that Singh was ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver \u201cbecause there is no counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a) for the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5); <em>In re Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, 729 (BIA 2005) (finding that \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d did not have a statutory counterpart of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a)), <em>remanded by Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88, 105 (2d Cir.2007) (remanding to the BIA for a determination of whether the offense of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d constituted a \u201ccrime of moral turpitude,\u201d a ground of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Singh filed a timely appeal with the BIA, which denied relief on the same \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d ground. The BIA additionally noted that it considered \u201cuntimely\u201d Singh\u2019s claim that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony. Singh then petitioned for review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">We affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s request for \u00a7 212(c) discretionary relief. Because the development of and interplay among \u00a7 212, the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), and IIRIRA is directly relevant to our appraisal of Singh\u2019s claim, we will preface our discussion of that claim with a brief discussion of the legal landscape.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">Aliens who have committed certain crimes generally may not be admitted to the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2) (2000). Section 212(a) of the INA enumerates such grounds, including the commission of certain crimes, that render an alien \u201cinadmissible\u201d to the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). Notwithstanding \u00a7 212(a), under former \u00a7 212(c) of the INA, the Attorney General had the authority to grant discretionary admission to aliens who had voluntarily left the United States, sought reentry, and were returning to a \u201clawful unrelinquished domicile\u201d of seven consecutive years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), <em>repealed by </em>Pub.L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-597 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">By its plain terms, \u00a7 212(c) discretionary relief applied only to lawful resident aliens who were denied admission to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>United States. However, the Second Circuit in 1976 read the Attorney General\u2019s authority under \u00a7 212(c) to extend discretionary relief to resident aliens who had not left the United States but were subject to deportation for offenses that were substantially similar to one of the grounds of inadmissibility set forth in \u00a7 212(a) of the INA. <em>Francis v. INS, </em>532 F.2d 268, 273 (2d Cir.1976); In <em>Matter of Silva, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 26, 30 (B.I.A.1976) (adopting the Second Circuit\u2019s position in <em>Francis).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Three statutes enacted since 1990 have narrowed the number of aliens eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. First, in 1990, Congress amended \u00a7 212(c) to exclude from eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief any alien convicted of an aggravated felony who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years. Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-649, \u00a7 511(a), 104 Stat. 4978, 5052 (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996)). Second, in April 1996, the passage of AEDPA further reduced the number of aliens eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief by identifying a broad range of offenses \u2014 including aggravated felony offenses \u2014 that would render an alien, regardless of the length of his sentence, ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. 1277 (1996) (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996)). Third and finally, in September 1996, Congress enacted IIRIRA, which repealed \u00a7 212(c) and replaced it with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, which gives the Attorney General the authority to cancel removal for a very narrow class of inadmissible or deportable aliens, but precludes such relief for anyone \u201cconvicted of any aggravated felony.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) (2000). In addition, \u00a7 321 of IIRIRA expanded the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Section 321 explicitly states that the amended definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d applies with respect to any \u201cconviction ... entered before, on, or after\u201d the enactment date of IIRIRA \u2014 September 30, 1996. <em>Id.; see also INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 319, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001); <em>Chuang v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>382 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1250 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Singh entered his guilty plea in January of 1997. As of April 24, 1996, AEDPA declared that aliens convicted of aggravated felonies, regardless of the length of their sentences, were ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c). <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. 1277 (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996)); <em>United States v. Velasco-Medina, </em>305 F.3d 839, 843 (9th Cir.2002). In addition, IIRIRA, enacted on September 30, 1996, added \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d to the definition of aggravated felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> IIRIRA \u00a7 321, <em>co</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>dified as </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Section 321 of IIRIRA also provided that its expanded definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d was to apply \u201cregardless of whether the conviction was entered before, on, or after September 30,1996.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Thus Singh pled guilty in January 1997, after the enactment of AEDPA, which made clear that \u00a7 212(c) relief was not available to legal permanent residents convicted of an aggravated felony, and after the enactment of \u00a7 321 of IIRIRA, which classified \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d and which provided that the expanded definition was to apply \u201cregardless of whether the conviction was entered before, on, or after\u201d the date of enactment of that provision. Therefore, under existing law, Singh was both deport-able and \u2014 because the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d in IIRIRA applied regardless of the date of conviction \u2014 ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Singh relies heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>St. Cyr </em>for his argument that he is entitled to \u00a7 212(c) relief. 533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271. In <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Supreme Court held that the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) by \u00a7 304 of IIRIRA did not apply to aliens who had entered a guilty plea prior to April 1, 1997 (IIRIRA\u2019s effective date) and who \u201cwould have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271. But the facts of <em>St. Cyr </em>are distinct from those here in one very key respect: respondent alien Enrico St. Cyr entered a guilty plea to an aggravated felony in March of 1996, <em>before </em>the passage of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d). <em>Id. </em>at 293, 315, 121 S.Ct. 2271. The alien in St. Cyr was \u201celigible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of [his] plea under the law then in effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271. By contrast, Singh entered a guilty plea <em>after </em>the passage of AEDPA and with full knowledge that IIRIRA \u00a7 321\u2019s amended definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d applied to convictions entered before, on, or after IIRIRA\u2019s enactment date.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">In fact, the law at the time of Singh\u2019s plea made perfectly clear that he belonged to that class of aggravated felons who were deportable and were ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief, regardless of whether their pleas were entered before or after IIRIRA\u2019s enactment. And thus, Singh could not have relied upon the possibility of \u00a7 212(c) relief when deciding to enter his plea. <em>See Velasco-Medina, </em>305 F.3d at 849-50 (noting that an alien who pled guilty to burglary in June 1996 had no \u201csettled expectations\u201d of \u00a7 212(c) relief when \u201cAEDPA had foreclosed \u00a7 212(c) relief for legal permanent residents convicted of aggravated felonies\u201d and when the alien \u201cwould have realized that if his conviction were recharacterized as an aggravated felony (as, in fact, it was by IIRIRA), he would have, under AEDPA, been ineligible for discretionary relief under \u00a7 212(c)\u201d). \u201cThere can be little doubt that, as a general matter, alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions.\u201d <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 289, 322, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (citing <em>Magana-Pizano v. INS, </em>200 F.3d 603, 612 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cThat an alien charged with a crime ... would factor the immigration consequences of conviction in deciding whether to plead or proceed to trial is well-documented.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">As heretofore stated, Singh was fully aware of the precise legal consequences of his plea as they pertained to his deportability; he can assert no reliance interest similar to that recognized in <em>St. Cyr. See Mbea v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 276, 281-282 (4th Cir.2007) (noting that reliance interests \u2014 at the time of plea \u2014 lie at the heart of <em>St. Cyr); Chambers v. Reno, </em>307 F.3d 284, 289 (4th Cir.2002) (same). Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Singh was plainly on notice at the time of his plea that no \u00a7 212(c) relief would or indeed could be forthcoming, his challenge to the BIA\u2019s order of removal fails. For the foregoing reasons, Singh\u2019s petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-12\">. Singh raises two additional claims, one of which we dismiss and one of which we decline to reach. Singh first contends that the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) erred in finding him removable as an aggravated felon. We do not have jurisdiction to hear this claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>because Singh did not appeal his deportability status to this court in 1999. Although Singh filed a timely appeal of the IJ\u2019s 1998 decision that he was removable from the United States as an aggravated felon to the BIA, he did not appeal the BIA's August 20, 1999 decision\u2014 which remanded to the IJ for consideration of Singh's newly raised claim that he was eligible for deferral of removal \u2014 to this court. Instead, Singh waited five years before filing a motion to reopen the question of whether he was properly found removable. This motion to reopen cannot substitute for a failure to file a timely appeal. We therefore dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Singh's claim that the IJ erred in finding him removable as an aggravated felon.</p>\n<p id=\"AKi\">Singh also raises an equal protection claim, on the grounds that, if we were to determine that his \"conviction did not render him deportable, and thus ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) ... it is unequal treatment to deny eligibility to an alien who committed an non-deportable crime and grant eligibility to an alien who committed a more serious, deportable, crime.\" Because we deny Singh\u2019s petition on independent grounds, we need not reach this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-5\">. The fact that Singh was sentenced to less than a year of imprisonment, <em>see supra </em>at .4 (Singh sentenced to 360 days suspended), does not affect his status as an aggravated felon under federal law. The provision defining \"sexual abuse of a minor\" as an \"aggravated felony\u201d imposes no additional requirement that the sentence for that crime be of any particular duration in order for the crime to qualify as an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Other crimes defined as \"aggravated felonies\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), however, do impose such a requirement. <em>See, e.g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(F) (defining a \"crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year\u201d as an aggravated felony); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) (defining \"a theft offense ... or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year\u201d as an aggravated felony). Thus, had Congress intended to impose a requirement that a sentence of a year of more be imposed in order for \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d to be classified as an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d it would and could have done so in the definitional statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
