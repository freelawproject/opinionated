No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). We granted a certif\u00edcate of appealability as to whether the district court erred in dismissing the petition as untimely. Grooms argues that his direct appeal concluded on December 9, 2005, that 90 days later on March 9, 2006, the statute of limitations began to run, and that he filed his petition before the one-year deadline expired. The state concedes in its brief that Grooms\u2019s federal habeas petition was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Hepburn v. Moore, </em>215 F.3d 1208, 1209 (11th Cir.2000) (\u00a7 2244(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The AEDPA establishes a one-year statute of limitations for filing \u00a7 2254 petitions, which begins to run following the latest of four events, one of which is the day that the judgment becomes final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The judgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d on the day which the U.S. Supreme Court issues a decision on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, denies certioraii, or after the expiration of the 90 days in which the petitioner could file a petition for certiorari. <em>Bond v. Moore, </em>309 F.3d 770, 773-74 (11th Cir.2002). The 90-day period applies to <em>per curiam </em>judgments from the Florida District Courts of Appeal. <em>See Chavers v. Sec\u2019y, Florida Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>468 F.3d 1273, 1274-75 (11th Cir.2006) (applying the 90-day period from the date of judgment of a Florida District Court of Appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">In this case, the Florida Second District Court of Appeal affirmed Grooms\u2019s conviction on December 9, 2005. <em>Grooms v. State, </em>916 So.2d 799 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005) (table). The district court erroneously found that January 8, 2006, was 90 days after December 9, 2005. The correct day to start the clock on the statute of limitations was March 9, 2006. Thus, Grooms\u2019s February 27, 2007, petition was timely because he filed it before the one-year deadline of March 9, 2007. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of dismissal and remand this case for further consideration of the \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
