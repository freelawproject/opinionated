We review the district court\u2019s rulings on motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards that governed the district court. <em>Williams v. BellSouth Telecomms. Inc., </em>373 F.3d 1132, 1134 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">This is an ERISA case. Hartford, the insurer and plan administrator, denied Hayes long-term disability benefits because Hartford concluded that Hayes was capable of working in a \u201clight to sedentary range\u201d occupation. The district court found, and the parties agree, that the framework for reviewing Hartford\u2019s decision is the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard. <em>Williams, </em>373 F.3d at 1137-38. The first prong of this standard is to conduct de novo review \u201cto determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u2018wrong\u2019 <em>(ie., </em>the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1138 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-18\">Here, we do not proceed past the first prong. Hartford concedes that Hayes has the physical ability to perform sedentary to light occupations, but only contends that Hayes, who was a commercially-licensed truck driver for ten years, does not have the intellectual ability for <em>any </em>occupation within the sedentary to light occupation range. Hartford produced evidence that Hayes had the education, training, or experience to perform various occupations within the sedentary to light occupational range, such as a loading inspector, truck safety inspector, or perishable-freight inspector. Upon a thorough consideration of the record, we agree with the district court; the evidence indicates that Hayes has the intellectual capacity to perform work in the sedentary to light occupational range.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-19\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
