The district court sentenced Hughes to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, four years of supervised release, and ordered payment of a $100 statutory assessment. Hughes appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence, alleging that the district court failed to take into account substantial evidence contrary to Deputy Win-slow\u2019s testimony, and failed to properly allocate to the Government the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. We find his challenges to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-19\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings made in consideration of a motion to suppress, <em>United States v. Brown, </em>401 F.3d 588, 592 (4th Cir.2005), and will uphold the denial of a motion to suppress if \u201cany reasonable view of the evidence, looked' at in the light most favorable to the government, will sustain the denial.\u201d <em>United States v. Bethea, </em>598 F.2d 331, 333-34 (4th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-20\">At the suppression hearing, Deputy Sheriff Edward Winslow testified that he conducted the search of Hughes\u2019 residence at which the firearm was found after he received the warrant, which issued at 3:10 p.m., and that in writing 12:35 p.m. on the property-inventory form, which time preceded the warrant\u2019s issuance by approximately three hours, he was stating the time at which he arrived at the premises and secured it while awaiting issuance of the warrant. On cross-examination, he attested that while he did not always follow this practice of writing on the inventory sheets the time he arrived at the premises, he did so on this occasion. Hughes\u2019 brother also testified at the suppression hearing. He attested that he witnessed two officers entering and exiting Hughes\u2019 home around 1 p.m. and that he talked with a female agent, identified as Agent Olson. Documentation introduced at the hearing supported the Government\u2019s position that Agent Olson was at the home on a prior occasion, and not at the occasion that is the subject of this appeal, and further contradicted Hughes\u2019 brother\u2019s recollection and testimony regarding other events of the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that Deputy Win-slow\u2019s testimony was more credible than that of Hughes\u2019 brother, or in its finding that the officer\u2019s testimony was a \u201ccorrect recitation of the events\u201d surrounding the search of Hughes\u2019 residence. There is no evidence that the district court failed to apply the proper standard of proof in considering Hughes\u2019 motion to suppress, or that it failed to consider all the evidence presented to it during the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hughes\u2019 motion to suppress, and further affirm Hughes\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
