On appeal, the defendant raises several assignments of error. The primary focus of most of the alleged errors concerns the admission of extrajudicial statements given to the police by two individuals who were unavailable to testify at trial. We address only the hearsay and Confrontation Clause issues because we find the other assignments of error to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">On the evening of February 8,1993, several people were drinking beer at the defendant\u2019s house. Those at the defendant\u2019s house included the defendant, Tina Adams, Rodney Canfield, William Davis, Brian Cook, and the victim, Timothy Sanders. At some point in the evening, the defendant, Mr. Can-field, Mr. Davis, and the victim got in the victim\u2019s car and drove to a remote area. Once at the area, the four men exited the car, and the defendant allegedly pulled out a gun, aimed it at the victim\u2019s head, and shot. After the shot, the victim fell to the ground, and the defendant handed Mr. Canfield the gun and told him to shoot the victim. It is disputed whether Mr. Canfield fired the weapon. In his statement, Mr. Canfield asserted he pretended the gun jammed and gave it back to the defendant. At that point, the victim was shot by either the defendant or Mr. Canfield. In spite of this injury, the victim was able to get up and run into the woods. Mr. Davis also ran into the woods. Mr. Davis testified he ran into the woods because he was afraid and did not want to be involved. The defendant and Mr. Canfield drove off in the victim\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">After returning to the defendant\u2019s house to retrieve a flashlight, the defendant and Mr. Canfield went to search for the victim. They found the victim lying along side a road, and either the defendant or Mr. Canfield fired two more shots into the defendant\u2019s head. The two men then placed the victim\u2019s body in the trunk of the car and returned to the defendant\u2019s house.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">In a statement given to the police, Robert Wasson, Jr., said that he arrived at the defendant\u2019s house before the defendant and Mr. Canfield returned for the first time to get a flashlight. Upon the defendant\u2019s and Mr. Canfield\u2019s second return to the house, Mr. Wasson was asked and agreed to follow the two men in a separate vehicle. The defendant and Mr. Canfield drove to Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>and disposed of the victim\u2019s body and then took the victim\u2019s car to another location in Maryland and burned it. After they disposed of the victim\u2019s body and the car, Mr. Wasson drove the defendant and Mr. Can-field back to the defendant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The victim\u2019s body and the car were discovered on February 9, 1993, and reported to the police. During the investigation of the murder, the police took several extrajudicial statements. At issue before the trial court were statements given by Mr. Canfield, Mr. Wasson, and Mr. Davis. Prior to trial, the defendant learned the State intended to introduce some of their statements as evidence, however, all three men would not testify at trial because both Mr. Canfield and Mr. Davis were invoking their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Mr. Was-son was unavailable for medical reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Before the trial began, the defendant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude any out-of-court statements given by witnesses who would not testify at the trial. At a pretrial conference, defense counsel called Sergeant Fred Wagoner of the West Virginia State Police to testify. Sergeant Wagoner stated that he questioned parts of Mr. Davis\u2019s statement but believed it was \u201ctrue and accurate to the best of [his] knowledge.\u201d Similarly, he agreed with defense counsel that with regard to Mr. Canfield\u2019s statement \u201cthere are parts of the statement which [he had] some doubt as to the truth and accuracy[.]\u201d Sergeant Wagoner also said he believed the statement given by Mr. Wasson was true.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court determined the statements the State sought to admit were admissible under Rule 804(b)(3) of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence as declarations against penal interests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Immediately prior to trial, the trial court granted Mr. Davis, along with Ms. Adams, transactional immunity, and they both testified at the trial. Mr. Canfield and Mr. Was-son did not testify. Defense counsel renewed his objections to the admission of Mr. Canfield\u2019s and Mr. Wasson\u2019s tape-recorded statements at the time they were played to the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These objections were overruled. Both statements implicate the defendant as the only person who shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">ADMISSIBILITY OF STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">The defendant argues the statements made by Mr. Canfield and Mr. Wasson are inadmissible for six reasons. First, the defendant contends the Confrontation Clause found in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14 of Article III of the West Virginia Constitution \u201cbars admission of evidence otherwise admissible under a hearsay exception if it bears no adequate indicia of reliability.\u201d Second, the defendant argues the statements do not fall under the Rule 804(b)(3) exception because the statements were not made against the declarants\u2019 penal interests with respect to the murder; instead, in their statements, the declarants implicate themselves as accessories after the fact, and they may not even have known they were incriminating them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>selves. Third, the statements do not meet the reliability test under Rule 804(b)(5) of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fourth, the statements bear no indicia of reliability and, therefore, are inadmissible under any of the hearsay exceptions contained in Rule 804 of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence. Fifth, the statements should not have been admitted as substantive evidence with no opportunity for cross-examination. Sixth, given the nature of the statements, the right to cross-examination was a crucial element of presenting an appropriate defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Before the disputed statements could be admitted, the trial judge was required to analyze the defendant\u2019s objections under both the hearsay rules and under the Confrontation Clause. If the statements are inadmissible under either of these provisions, they must be excluded. The defendant specifically argues that although portions of the statements given by Mr. Canfield and Mr. Wasson are self-inculpatory, the statements are not admissible against him pursuant to Rule 804(b)(3) under the analysis of <em>Williamson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994) (statement to drug enforcement agent incriminating another is not a statement against declarant\u2019s penal interest within the meaning of Rule 804(b)(3), even if it is included within a broader narrative that is generally self-incul-patory). He further argues the portions are not admissible under the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 817, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, 653 (1990) (hearsay evidence not falling within firmly rooted hearsay exception is \u201c \u2018presumptively unreliable and inadmissible for Confrontation Clause purposes,\u2019 \u201d <em>quoting Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 543, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2063, 90 L.Ed.2d 514, 528 (1986)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14 of Article III of the West Virginia Constitution guarantee an accused the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Davis v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347, 353 (1974); <em>State v. James Edward S., </em>184 W.Va. 408, 400 S.E.2d 843 (1990); <em>Naum v. Halbritter, </em>172 W.Va. 610, 309 S.E.2d 109 (1983); <em>State v. Foster, </em>171 W.Va. 479, 300 S.E.2d 291 (1983). \u201c[T]he mission of the Confrontation Clause is to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials,\u201d and the touchstone is whether there has been \u201c \u2018a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.\u201d\u2019 <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 89, 91 S.Ct. 210, 220, 27 L.Ed.2d 213, 227 (1970), <em>quoting California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 161, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1936, 26 L.Ed.2d 489, 499 (1970). <em>See Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 737, 107 S.Ct. 2658, 2663, 96 L.Ed.2d 631, 642 (1987) (\u201c[t]he right to cross-examination ... is essentially a \u2018functional\u2019 right designed to promote reliability in the truth-finding functions of a criminal trial\u201d). Clearly, an essential purpose of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure an opportunity for cross-examination. In exercising this right, an accused may cross-examine a witness to reveal possible biases, prejudices, or motives. <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 316, 94 S.Ct. at 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d at 354 (\u201cpartiality of a witness is subject to exploration at trial, and is \u2018always relevant as discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of his testimony.\u2019 <em>[Quoting </em>] 3A J. Wigmore <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 940, p. 775 (Chadbourn rev. 1970)).\u201d Thus, the introduction of extrajudicial statements at trial as direct and substantive evidence<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is circumscribed by the Confrontation Clause which places independent restrictions upon the admission of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In <em>James Edward S., supra, </em>we outlined some of these basic principles in Syllabus Points 2, 3, and 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201c2. The two central requirements for admission of extrajudicial testimony under the Confrontation Clause contained in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution are: (1) demonstrating the unavailability of the witness to testify; and (2) proving the reliability of the witness\u2019s out-of-court statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201c3. In order to satisfy its burden of showing that the witness is unavailable, the State must prove that it has made a good-faith effort to obtain the witness\u2019s attendance at trial. This showing necessarily requires substantial diligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\u2666 H* sfc * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">\u201c5. Even though the unavailability requirement has been met, the Confrontation Clause contained in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution mandates the exclusion of evidence that does not bear adequate indicia of reliability. Reliability can usually be inferred where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Here, the defendant does not claim the State failed to satisfy its burden of showing the two witnesses were unavailable. Rather, his attack is focused on the second part of the test that requires the State to prove the reliability of the out-of-court statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">In addition to the Confrontation Clause, third-party statements may be excluded on hearsay grounds. An extrajudicial statement is inadmissible under hearsay analysis if it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and it fails to qualify under any of the hearsay exemptions or exceptions. <em>See </em>W.Va.R.Evid. 801. In Syllabus Point 1 of <em>State v. Maynard, </em>183 W.Va. 1, 393 S.E.2d 221 (1990), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">\u201cGenerally, out-of-court statements made by someone other than the declarant while testifying are not admissible unless: 1) the statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but for some other purpose such as motive, intent, state-of-mind, identification or reasonableness of the party\u2019s action; 2) the statement is not hearsay under the rules [exemptions under Rule 801(d) ]; or 3) the statement is hearsay but falls within an exception provided for in the rules [exceptions under Rules 803 and 804].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">The Confrontation Clause and the hearsay rules, while not coextensive, \u201care generally designed to protect similar val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ues[.]\u201d <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 155, 90 S.Ct. at 1933, 26 L.Ed.2d at 495. As a result of their similarity and because they \u201cstem from the same roots,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> both this Court and the United States Supreme Court have held that for purposes of the Confrontation Clause \u201cno independent inquiry into reliability is required when the evidence \u2018falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2782, 97 L.Ed.2d 144, 157 (1987), <em>quoting Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 608 (1980); <em>State v. Walker, </em>188 W.Va. 661, 425 S.E.2d 616 (1992). Thus, we must determine whether the disputed extrajudicial statements admitted against the defendant are admissible under Rule 804(b)(3) and, if so, whether Rule 804(b)(3) is a firmly rooted hearsay exception or whether the statements are otherwise admissible under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The issue here involves third-party statements or confessions which implicate the defendant as well as the declarants. Rule 804(b)(3) modified common law by creating an important qualification to the admissibility of a statement of an unavailable declarant. <em>See Donnelly v. United States, </em>228 U.S. 243, 33 S.Ct. 449, 57 L.Ed. 820 (1913), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>228 U.S. 708, 33 S.Ct. 1024, 57 L.Ed. 1035 (1913) (common law did not recognize a declaration against \u201cpenal interest\u201d and evidence of a third party\u2019s confession against the accused was inadmissible).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under Rule 804(b)(3), a statement that tends to subject a declarant to \u201ccriminal liability\u201d may be admissible as well as declarations against a pecuniary or proprietary interest. While some courts boldly declare that Rule 804(b)(3) is a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception and that no \u201cindependent inquiry into reliability\u201d is required for the Confrontation Clause,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> most courts are more cautious. One such court is the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Williamson, supra, </em>the Supreme Court reviewed the issue solely as to admissibility under Rule 804(b)(3) and expressly refused to determine whether the statements were admissible under the Confrontation Clause or if the hearsay exception for statements against interest is firmly rooted. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u201c[W]e need not address [the defendant\u2019s] claim that the statements were also made inadmissible by the Confrontation Clause, ... and in particular we need not decide whether the hearsay exception for declarations against interest is \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 for Confrontation Clause purposes.... We note, however, that the very fact that a statement is genuinely self-inculpatory\u2014 which our reading of Rule 804(b)(3) requires \u2014 is itself one of the \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 that makes a statement admissible under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2437, 129 L.Ed.2d at 486. (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-11\"><em>Williamson, </em>a highly instructive ease in determining the contours of Rule 804(b)(3) and in clarifying its scope, was decided after the trial in the case <em>sub judice.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Supreme Court began by recognizing the penal interest exception requires that statements be inculpatory; where statements are self-exculpatory, they are not admissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">\u201cIn our view, the most faithful reading of Rule 804(b)(3) is that it does not allow admission of non-self-inculpatory statements, even if they are made within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory. The district court may not just assume for purposes of Rule 804(b)(3) that a statement is self-inculpatory because it is part of a fuller confession, and this is especially true when the statement implicates someone else.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2435,129 L.Ed.2d at 483.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Using the broad definition of \u201cstatement\u201d articulated in Rule 801(a)(1) \u2014 \u201can oral or written assertion\u201d \u2014 as a point of departure, <em>Williamson </em>went on to explain the significance of the term for purposes of Rule 804(b)(3). <em>Williamson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2434,129 L.Ed.2d at 482. Specifically, the Supreme Court concluded that the word \u201cstatement\u201d means \u201c \u2018a single declaration or remark,\u2019 \u201d rather than \u201c \u2018a report or narrative,\u2019\u201d reasoning that this \u201cnarrower reading\u201d is consistent with the principles underlying the rule. \u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2434-35,129 L.Ed.2d at 482, <em>quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2229, defn. 2(a) and (b) (1961). Thus, when ruling upon the admission of a narrative under this rule, a trial court must break down the narrative and determine the separate admissibility of each \u201c \u2018single declaration or remark.\u2019 \u201d This exercise is a \u201cfact-intensive inquiry\u201d that requires \u201ccareful examination of all the circumstances surrounding the criminal activity involved[.]\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2437, 129 L.Ed.2d at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">We adopt the Supreme Court\u2019s approach to Rule 804(b)(3), while retaining a separate Confrontation Clause analysis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, to satisfy the admissibility requirements under Rule 804(b)(3), a trial court must determine: (a) The existence of each separate statement in the narrative; (b) whether each statement was against the penal interest of the declarant; (c) whether corroborating circumstances exist indicating the trustworthiness of the statement<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; and (d) whether the declarant is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">Significantly, because the trial court in <em>Williamson </em>failed to conduct the appropriate analysis, the Supreme Court remanded the case without reaching the issue of whether the Confrontation Clause was violated. Here, we have the same problem. The trial court failed to analyze the independent statements comprising the declarants\u2019 narratives.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rather, it assessed the entire statements in their aggregate, ultimately concluding that they were admissible under Rule 804(b)(3). Given the context in which the statements were made, there is nothing in the record to demonstrate to us that the trial court conducted the fact-intensive inquiry required. It is important in this case to observe that at the time the declarants made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>their statements they were not subject to any sort of cross-examination and their lawyers were not even present during the interrogation. Furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the making of each of the statements are not identical. Therefore, because we are unable to evaluate the assertions comprising the declarants\u2019 statements, remand is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">If the trial court decides upon remand that the statements are admissible, it must then decide whether the statements satisfy the Confrontation Clause. To offer guidance, we direct the trial court to evaluate the statements as if we have decided that Rule 804(b)(3) is not a \u201cfirmly rooted exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The question left opened in <em>Williamson </em>with regard to the Confrontation Clause was resolved implicitly in West Virginia. In Syllabus Point 2, in part, of <em>State v. Mullens, </em>179 W.Va. 567, 371 S.E.2d 64 (1988), this Court, relying on <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063, 90 L.Ed.2d at 527, stated that \u201cabsent sufficient independent \u2018in-dicia of reliability\u2019 to rebut the presumption of unreliability\u201d the introduction of a third-party confession against a defendant is a violation of the Confrontation Clause. We repeated this holding in <em>State v. Marcum, </em>182 W.Va. 104, 386 S.E.2d 117 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">To conform the language of our cases with the more recent holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Wright, supra, </em>we now hold that hearsay of the nature disputed here must be rehable by virtue of its <em>inherent </em>trustworthiness. Thus, absent \u201c\u2018a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the admission of a third-party confession impheating a defendant violates the Confrontation Clause. The burden is squarely upon the prosecution to estabhsh the challenged evidence is so trustworthy that adversarial testing would add httle to its reliability. Furthermore, unless an affirmative reason arising from the circumstances in which the statement was made provides a basis for rebutting the presumption that a hearsay statement is not worthy of rehance at trial, the Confrontation Clause requires exclusion of the out-of-court statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The defendant argues that because the requisite \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d are lacking, the admission of the disputed statements violates the Confrontation Clause. The trial court concluded that no independent showing of reliability was necessary because it found the statements were admissible under Rule 804(b)(3), as a deeply rooted exception. Thus, the State made no effort to satisfy the requirements we outlined in <em>James Edward S., supra. </em>As we suggest above, if the trial court considers the statements admissible under Rule 804(b)(3) and <em>Williamson, </em>the trial court also must determine upon remand whether the statements are admissible under the Confrontation Clause. For that reason, we choose to elaborate on those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Even if the hearsay does not fit within an established exception, its admissibility is not barred by the Confrontation Clause if, considered apart from any corroborating evidence, there is \u201ca showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness[.]\u201d Consideration should be given to the totality of the circumstances \u201cthat surround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief\u2019 \u2014 so worthy of belief \u201c\u2018that the test of cross-examination would be a work of supererogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 819, 110 S.Ct. at 3149, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655, <em>quoting </em>5 Wig-more, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1420 at 251 (Chadbourn rev. 1974).

(Citations omitted). In <em>Wright, </em>the trial court admitted the hearsay of a two-and-one-half-year-old child, finding that (1) she had no motive to lie, and (2) the statements made to her doctor about daddy touching her with his pee-pee were not \u201cof the type \u2018that one would expect a child to fabricate.\u2019\u201d 497 U.S. at 826, 110 S.Ct. at 3152, 111 L.Ed.2d at 659, quoting the trial judge. The Supreme Court of Idaho found the presumptive unreliability of these statements to be unaffected by these findings and reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction. The United States Supreme Court agreed, holding that the circumstances found by the trial court offered \u201cno special reason for supposing that the incriminating statements were particularly trustworthy.\u201d 497 U.S. at 826, 110 S.Ct. at 3152, 111 L.Ed.2d at 659.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">In the light of <em>Wright </em>and its specific examples of testimony that failed to rebut the presumption of unreliability, the trial court specifically must examine whether the circumstances existing at the time a declarant gives a statement make the statement particularly worthy of belief so that the test of cross-examination would have been a work of supererogation. As \u201cno mechanical test prevails,\u201d <em>Swan v. Peterson, </em>6 F.3d 1373, 1379 (9th Cir.1993), the character of the guarantees of trustworthiness in this case must be weighed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">On appeal, we are not to second-guess a trial court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Swan, </em>6 F.3d at 1378. In cases that are open to reasonable differences, if the trial court applies the correct legal criteria, this Court is unlikely to substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. It is not our task to retry the case, to determine the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, or even to decide if the disputed statements are true. However, on the ultimate determination of trustworthiness, we act <em>de novo. See Swan, </em>6 F.3d at 1379. Our task under the Constitution is to determine if these presumptively unreliable statements were made under circumstances affirmatively establishing that they were so rehable that cross-examination of the declarants was \u201cof marginal utility.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 820, 110 S.Ct. at 3149, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Although our constitutional guarantee to the right of confrontation cannot be considered as absolute, it is not made of \u201csoft plastic.\u201d Nor should it be disregarded in the name of expediency. In most cases, only by cross-examination can the truth or falsity of a declarant\u2019s statement be determined. Thus, a trial court\u2019s assessment of whether a particular declarant is apt to lie is not enough; the trial court must not infringe upon a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial in which the opportunity to cross-examination is preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">As to the constitutional issue, the trial court failed to develop the circumstances surrounding the statements. We, therefore, refuse to attempt the impossible, that is to decide whether \u201csufficient independent \u2018indi-cia of reliability\u2019 [exist] to rebut the presumption of unreliability\u201d surrounding the admitted third-party statements.

First, the trial court must determine whether the statements are admissible under Rule 804(b)(3) and, particularly, under <em>Williamson. </em>If, and only if, the prerequisites of Rule 804(b)(3) and <em>Williamson </em>are met, the trial court must proceed to determine the admissibility of the statements under our Confrontation Clause analysis.
