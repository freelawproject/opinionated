The Justice Court granted the motion, concluding, in essence, that there was a legal impediment to conviction (CPL 170.30 [1] [f]), finding that defendants\u2019 proof in support of the motion established both their entitlement to an exclusion from the permit requirement and the People\u2019s inability to prove, on the facts, that defendants are legally responsible for the alleged illegal diversion of rainwater onto a neighbor\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Defendants\u2019 motion should have been denied. With rare exceptions <em>(e.g. </em>CPL 60.10), the CPLR is inapplicable to criminal proceedings (CPLR 101; CPL 1.10 [1]; <em>People v Knobel, </em>94 NY2d 226, 230 [1999]; <em>People v Crisp, </em>268 AD2d 247 [2000]; <em>People v Silva, </em>122 AD2d 750 [1986]; <em>see generally People ex rel. Hirschberg v Orange County Ct., </em>271 NY 151, 155 [1936]). The authority of a criminal court to dismiss an information pursuant to a pretrial motion <em>(see </em>CPL 170.30) does not include a motion for accelerated judgment available to civil court litigants <em>(see </em>CPLR 3211, 3212), and, in any event, the court had no authority to dismiss an accusatory instrument on the ground that, in its view, the People could not produce sufficient evidence to prevail at trial <em>(e.g. People v Asher, 16 </em>Misc 3d 89, 91 [App Term, 9th &amp; 10th Jud Dists 2007]). Thus, on this record, there were no grounds to dismiss the accusatory instrument upon defendants\u2019 pretrial motion <em>(see </em>CPL 170.30).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Accordingly, the order is reversed, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument is denied, the accusatory instrument is reinstated, and the matter is remanded to the Justice Court for all further proceedings thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Rudolph, EJ., Mol\u00eda and Scheinkman, JJ, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
