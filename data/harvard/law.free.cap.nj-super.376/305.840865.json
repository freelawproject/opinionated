Feit, Jr., and Joyce Unger Feit appeal from a summary judgment, which concluded that their homeowners\u2019 insurance carrier, Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company of New Jersey, had no duty to defend or indemnify the Feits in a civil action brought against them by Karen McClellan. McClellan\u2019s suit sought recovery of remediation costs allegedly caused by the Feits\u2019 misrepresentation that there were no underground oil storage tanks on residential property the Feits had sold to McClellan some five years earlier. The motion judge found that Prudential did not have to supply a defense to the McClellan action because the Feits\u2019 homeowners\u2019 policy excluded intentional acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We agree that the intentional misrepresentation claim was correctly excluded from coverage. We conclude, however, that a prior policy, which required a defense for the negligent misrepresentation claim that McClellan also asserted against the Feits, may have been controlling. Consequently, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Here is how the Feits coverage claim arose. The Feits were former owners of residential property in Voorhees. In 1996, the Feits sold the property to McClellan. Before selling the property, the Feits converted their oil heating system to gas and hired Atmostemp to \u201cclose and abandon\u201d their underground heating oil storage tank. Upon selling the home to McClellan, the Feits represented in the agreement of sale that \u201cSeller warrants that to the best of Seller\u2019s knowledge\u201d there were no underground fuel tanks on the property and that any tanks have been removed. The Feits then handwrote \u201cpermit 930698 9/28/93.\u201d The referenced permit had been issued by Voorhees Township and granted Atmostemp permission to abandon the underground tank. The referenced date was the date of abandonment. In the \u201cSeller\u2019s Statement To Buyer Regarding Residential Property,\u201d the Feits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>were asked whether they were \u201caware of any ... Underground storage tanks on the property.\u201d The Feits answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Almost five years later, when McClellan was selling the Voorhees property, an underground oil storage tank was discovered on the property. The tank had been leaking, so McClellan had to remove the tank and remediate the soil and underground water. She filed suit against the Feits to recover the remediation costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">McClellan\u2019s complaint alleged the Feits were aware of the presence of the underground tank on the property, but misrepresented by failing to notify or disclose this information to the buyer. In addition to misrepresentation, McClellan also alleged, among other claims, fraud, breach of contract, equitable fraud, failure to disclose a material fact, and breach of the Consumer Fraud statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">When the Feits purchased the Voorhees property, they obtained homeowners\u2019 insurance from Prudential and received the 1986 version of Prudential\u2019s [\u00b6] 3 homeowners\u2019 policy. In December 1994, a few years before the Feits\u2019 sale of the property to McClellan, Prudential amended its [\u00b6] 3 homeowners\u2019 insurance policy, and subsequently replaced the Feits\u2019 policy with the new 1994 version. There is no evidence in the record of any other amendment of the relevant homeowners\u2019 policy, and therefore, when the Feits sold the house to McClellan in 1996, the pertinent homeowners\u2019 insurance policy was the 1994 version.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Upon receiving McClellan\u2019s complaint, the Feits sought a defense from Prudential under their homeowners\u2019 policy. Prudential denied coverage. The insurance company took the position that the damages sought were not \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the policy. Even if \u201cproperty damage\u201d occurred during the policy period, Prudential contended that the claim did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. Prudential also asserted that the policy excluded coverage for intentional acts, and the date of the loss contained in McClellan\u2019s complaint fell outside the Feits\u2019 policy period, which ended on June 28, 1996 when the property was sold to McClellan.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">After Prudential declined to change its position upon the Feits\u2019 reconsideration request, the Feits joined Prudential in the McClellan suit as a third-party defendant. They alleged that the insurance company had exhibited bad faith, breached the insurance contract, breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and engaged in deceptive trade practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Eventually the dispute came before a motion judge on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment. The judge granted Prudential\u2019s summary judgment motion and denied the Feits\u2019 cross motion. The judge found no obligation to defend because the 1994 policy excluded intentional acts, and the judge determined that McClellan\u2019s complaint alleged \u201conly intentional acts.\u201d The judge also believed that the claim, which arose out of an agreement of sale, was excluded because the 1994 policy does \u201cnot cover for liability under any written or unwritten contract or agreement whether personal or in connection with any business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u201c[T]he duty to defend comes into being when the complaint states a claim constituting a risk insured against.\u201d <em>Danek v. Hommer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 77, 100 A.2d 198, 203 (App.Div. 1953), <em>aff'd </em>o.b., 15 <em>N.J. </em>573, 105 A.2d 677 (1954). In determining whether an insurer has a duty to defend, the court compares the allegations in the complaint with the language of the policy. <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 173, 607 A.2d 1255, 1259 (1992). The duty to defend arises when the allegations in the complaint correspond with the language of the policy, irrespective of the claim\u2019s actual merit. <em>Ibid. </em>\u2018When multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>alternative causes of action are stated, the duty to defend will continue until every covered claim is eliminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 607 A.2d at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Here, there is no question that McClellan alleged in her complaint an intentional misrepresentation. She stated the Feits \u201cintentionally acted to deprive [her] of relevant information with regard to the sale of real estate to her\u201d \u201cby actively and intentionally failing to disclose the presence of an underground oil storage tank.\u201d McClellan also alleged that defendants \u201cwere aware of the presence of the underground storage tank and that it had not been removed,\u201d but yet the Feits \u201caffirmatively told [McClellan] ... that there was no underground oil tank located on the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Both the 1986 and 1994 policies exclude coverage for intentional acts. The 1986 policy excluded \u201cproperty damage ... which is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d The 1994 policy excluded property damage \u201cwhich may reasonably be expected to result from the intentional act of the insured or which is in fact intended by the insured.\u201d Such exclusions are common and valid. <em>See Harleysville Ins. Cos. v. Garitta, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>223, 231, 785 A.2d 913, 918 (2001). The motion judge, therefore, correctly concluded that McClellan\u2019s intentional misrepresentation claim was barred from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Contrary to the motion judge\u2019s decision, however, McClellan\u2019s complaint, though not a model of clarity, can be read to allege negligent misrepresentation. Negligent misrepresentation constitutes \u201c[a]n incorrect statement, negligently made and justifiably relied on,\u201d which results in economic loss. <em>Kaufman v. i-Stat Corp., </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>94, 109, 754 A.2d 1188, 1195 (2000) (citation omitted). After reciting the basic facts upon which the misrepresentation was based, the complaint alleged in the fifth count that the Feits \u201cknew or should have known of the presence of the underground oil storage tank\u201d and its leakage. McClellan also alleged in the Eleventh Count of her complaint that Atmostemp, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>on behalf of the Feits, \u201cnegligently conducted the abandonment of the underground storage tank.\u201d When read with the generally alleged underlying facts regarding the Feits\u2019 failure to disclose, these counts constitute a claim that the Feits negligently misrepresented that the property did not contain a leaking underground oil storage tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">To determine whether a homeowners\u2019 policy provides coverage during a particular period, we examine the occurrence giving rise to the claim, rather than the date the claim was made. <em>E.g., Zuckerman v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>304, 310-11, 495 A.2d 395, 398 (1985). The occurrence or misrepresentation at issue here, as found by the motion judge, happened either at the time the parties entered into the agreement of sale, March 1996, or at the time of the sale itself, June 1996. Consequently, the 1994 policy applied to McClellan\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The 1994 policy covered \u201cproperty damage caused by an occurrence.\u201d The policy, however, excluded from the definition of an occurrence \u201cnegligent misrepresentations or omissions of any nature or kind in the sale of real or personal property.\u201d Although policy exclusions are usually strictly construed, exclusions will be applied as written, so long as the language is clear, unambiguous, and not violative of public policy. <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Brenner, </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>316, 321-22, 795 A.2d 286, 289 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The provision defining \u201coccurrence\u201d as not including negligent misrepresentations in connection with the sale of real estate appears clear and unambiguous. Furthermore, no party asserts any violation of public policy in connection with this exclusionary definition. Thus, the definition of occurrence in the policy is enforceable as written, <em>id. </em>at 321, 795 A.2d at 289, and the definition bars coverage for this claim, at least under the 1994 version of Prudential\u2019s HO 3 homeowners\u2019 insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The Feits argue, however, that it is the 1986 version of the homeowners\u2019 policy that applies because Prudential altered the coverage of that policy, without proper notice to the insured and in violation of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:1-20.2. The regulation the Feits rely upon, however, is not applicable. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:1-20.2(a)-(i) prohibits nonrenewal or cancellation of a policy unless the insurer mails or delivers notice to the insured not more than 120 days nor less than thirty days before expiration of the policy. These rules are not applicable to this dispute because the policy was renewed and not cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Regardless of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:1-20.2\u2019s inapplicability, notification of changes in renewal policies under some circumstances is still required. Although insurance companies may make changes when renewing policies, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:33B-33b, 17:29C-6(E); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:1-20.2(j), in order to fulfill the insured\u2019s expectations that the coverage provided by the renewed policy remains substantially identical to the prior policy, courts will void a reduction in coverage that was not called to the insured\u2019s attention. <em>Bauman v. Royal Indem. Co., </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>12, 25-26, 174 A.2d 585, 592 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">On a renewal, \u201c[a]bsent notification that there have been changes in the restrictions, conditions or limitations of the policy, the insured is justly entitled to assume that they remain the same and that his coverage has not in anywise been lessened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 174 A.2d at 592. Any reduction in coverage upon a renewal must be called to the insured\u2019s attention so that the insured can decide whether to continue the coverage or purchase new insurance. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 174 A.2d at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">When \u201cthe conditions for renewal coverage are made evident to the insured,\u201d the company can be certain that the renewal will be valid. <em>See Am. Cas. Co. v. Continisio, </em>17 F.3d 62, 66 (3d Cir. 1994). But, when the insured is not specifically and clearly informed of the change, the renewal will be ineffective. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>Millbrook Tax Fund, Inc. v. P.L. Henry &amp; Assocs., </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>49, 53-54, 779 A.2d 1120, 1122-23 (App.Div.2001) (involving reduction of a limited reporting period from one year to sixty days); <em>Skeete v. Dorvius, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311, 317-18, 845 A.2d 1265, 1269 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>456, 852 A.2d 192 (2004) (involving step-down uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In this case, Prudential attempted in the renewal to eliminate negligent misrepresentation coverage by adding occurrence language and specifically excluding negligent misrepresentation from the definition of occurrence. Because negligent misrepresentation was not even mentioned in the 1986 policy, its specific exclusion from coverage in the 1994 renewal renders the change material and requires proper notice. <em>See Bauman, supra, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>at 25-26, 174 A.2d at 591-92; <em>Skeete, supra, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 317-18, 845 A.2d at 1269; <em>Millbrook Tax Fund, Inc., supra, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 53-54, 779 A.2d at 1123-24; <em>Continisio, supra, </em>17 F.3d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The motion judge did not determine whether proper notice of the amended policy was provided the Feits, and we cannot decide this issue from the record. The record reflects that Prudential mailed to the Feits a standard cover letter with their renewal package in July or August 1995. The letter stated, in part, that the \u201cenclosed package reflects the recent ehange(s) made to [the named insured\u2019s] Homeowners policy.\u201d The renewal package apparently included the 1994 edition of the policy, but according to the document contained in the record, did not specifically notice or highlight the added definition of occurrence and the elimination of coverage for negligent misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Although the documents included in the record do not reveal whether Prudential brought these changes in the 1994 policy to the Feits\u2019 attention, according to Prudential\u2019s compliance analyst, the 1994 changes in the definition of occurrence would have been brought to the insureds\u2019 attention through \u201cspecial provisions\u201d in the renewal package. There were apparently two special provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sions in 1995, but we are uncertain as to the content of these special provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Considering this deficiency in the record, a remand seems in order. But, obviously, the remand would only be necessary if the Feits have correctly asserted that the 1986 policy covered negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The question of whether negligent misrepresentations are covered in homeowners\u2019 policies has raised difficult issues for courts. As we explained above, a negligent misrepresentation constitutes \u201c[a]n incorrect statement, negligently made and justifiably relied on, [and] may be the basis for recovery of damages for economic loss ... sustained as a consequence of that reliance.\u201d <em>H. Rosenblum, Inc. v. Adler, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>324, 334, 461 A.2d 138, 142-43 (1983); see also, <em>Kaufman, supra, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>at 109, 754 A.2d at 1195-96. Negligent misrepresentations are quite closely related to equitable and legal fraud. Equitable fraud requires \u201c\u2018(1) a material misrepresentation of a presently existing or past fact; (2) the maker\u2019s intent that the other party rely on it; and (3) detrimental reliance by the other party.\u2019 \u201d <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Lawson, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>125, 136-37, 827 A.2d 230, 237 (2003) (quoting <em>Liebling v. Garden State Indem., </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447, 453, 767 A.2d 515, 518 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>606, 782 A.2d 424 (2001)). The elements of legal fraud include \u201ca material representation of a presently existing or past fact, made with knowledge of its falsity and with the intention that the other party rely thereon, resulting in reliance by that party to his detriment.\u201d <em>Jewish Ctr. of Sussex County v. Whale, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>619, 624, 432 A.2d 521, 524 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Besides being closely related to equitable and legal fraud, some courts have determined that negligent misrepresentations are actually intentional wrongs because the insured intends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>other party rely on the misrepresentation. <em>E.g., Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Andrews, </em>915 F.2d 500, 502 (9th Cir.1990) (insured\u2019s misrepresentations in connection with the sale of property were not occurrences under the policy); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Chaney, </em>804 <em>F.Supp. </em>1219, 1221-22 (N.D.Cal.1992) (under California law, negligent misrepresentation is treated as a type of fraud and therefore cannot be an \u201caccident\u201d or an \u201coccurrence\u201d under an insurance policy); <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Canyon Creek, </em>786 <em>F.Supp. </em>821, 825 (N.D.Cal.1991) (negligent misrepresentations made in conjunction with the sale of property \u201cfalls within the rubric of fraud and not ordinary negligence\u201d and cannot qualify for insurance coverage); <em>Miller v. W. Gen. Agency, Inc., </em>41 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>1144, 49 Cal.Rptr.2d 55, 58 (1996) (misrepresentations causing investment or other economic loss are considered purposeful rather than accidental for purposes of insurance coverage); <em>Harding v. Wang, </em>729 So.2d 9, 11-12 (La.Ct.App.1999) (negligent failure to disclose termite damage when selling a house was not an accident or occurrence under homeowner\u2019s policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">There is also out-of-state support concluding that negligent misrepresentations are covered by homeowners\u2019 insurance policies. H. Brent Brennenstuhl, Annotation, <em>Negligent Misrepresentation as \u201cAccident\u201d or \u201cOccurrence\u201d Warranting Insurance Coverage, </em>58 A.L.R.5th 488 (1998). <em>E.g., Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Metro. Baptist Church, </em>967 <em>F.Supp. </em>217, 224 (S.D.Tex.1996) (negligent misrepresentation is an \u201coccurrence\u201d under Texas law); <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Youngblood, </em>549 So.2d 76, 78 (Ala.1989) (absent specific exclusion, insurer must defend claims for negligent and innocent or reckless misrepresentation); <em>Sheets v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>342 <em>Md. </em>634, 679 A.2d 540, 551 (1996) (negligent misrepresentation of condition of property was a covered occurrence or accident); <em>Lampert v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cos. Co., </em>85 S.W.3d 90, 94 (Mo.Ct.App.2002) (negligent misrepresentation of conditions in home\u2019s basement was covered by homeowners\u2019 policy); <em>Wood v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>980 S.W.2d 43, 45, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>52 (Mo.Ct.App.1998) (seller\u2019s negligent misrepresentation that residence was not in flood plain and had never flooded were covered under liability insurance).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">New Jersey has not as yet directly confronted this issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>SL Industries, Inc. v. American Motorists Insurance Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>188, 208, 607 A.2d 1266, 1276-77 (1992), however, our Supreme Court suggested that negligent misrepresentations could be included within homeowner insurance coverage. Specifically, the Court observed that \u201c[c]ourts generally have held that although the insurer must defend an insured who is accused of reckless, negligent, or innocent misrepresentations, no defense is required when the insured is accused of intentional misrepresentations.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The distinction arises because \u201c[a]n intent to misrepresent is sufficient to presume an intent to injure,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>whereas \u201c[a]n allegation of negligence presumes the absence of an intent to injure.\u201d <em>Voorhees, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 185, 607 A.2d at 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In this case, the misrepresentation appears based upon the Feits understanding of Atmostemp\u2019s function in \u201cabandoning\u201d the tank. The claim that the Feits should have known that the tank had leaked, was leaking, or would leak is grounded in negligence rather than intentional conduct. Although the Feits intended McClellan to rely on their statement that there was no underground tank on the property, the Feits specifically referenced the permit and date by which Atmostemp was supposed to have dealt with the tank. This reference supports an inference that the Feits lacked any intent to injure McClellan by the failure to disclose the true condition of the tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Prudential argues, however, that its 1986 policy was identical to the 1994 policy, except that the 1986 policy did not specifically exclude negligent misrepresentations. According to Prudential, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>negligent misrepresentations were also excluded in the 1986 policy. After reviewing the policies, however, we disagree with Prudential\u2019s assessment of the similarity between the two policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The 1986 policy covered personal liability claims brought against any insured \u201cfor damages because of ... property damage to which this coverage applies.\u201d The policy did not require that property damage be \u201ccaused by an occurrence\u201d or accident and did not even define occurrence. It did, however, define property damage as \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property, including loss of use of this property.\u201d The policy\u2019s personal liability coverage also did not apply \u201cto property damage to property owned by the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Here, the negligent misrepresentation by the Feits resulted in the purchase of the insured premises without disclosing and possibly remedying a buried fuel tank, which was leaking at the time of the misrepresentation or began leaking sometime thereafter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The leaking tank and perhaps the contaminated ground water can be considered damage to tangible property not owned by the insured, at least immediately after the alleged misrepresentation. Because the policy did not require that property damage be caused by an occurrence, there was no requirement under the 1986 policy that the damage to the tank or ground water be directly caused by the misrepresentation or occur during the policy term. Thus, McClellan\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim was brought against the Feits \u201cfor damages because of ... property damage to which\u201d personal liability coverage appears to apply under the 1986 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Prudential also argued that there was no coverage under the 1986 policy because McClellan\u2019s entire complaint arose from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the sale of a home, which is not covered. Here again, the 1994 policy clearly sets forth this exclusion by not covering liability \u201cunder any written or unwritten contract or agreement, whether personal or in connection with any business.\u201d The 1986 policy, however, is not so clear. That policy provides that \u201cPersonal Liability, does not apply to:\u201d \u201cliability assumed under any unwritten contract or agreement, or by contract or agreement in connection with any business of the insured.\u201d Here, liability was not \u201cassumed under any unwritten contract\u201d and the written contract in this case was personal and not connected with any business of the insured. The 1986 policy thus covered McClellan\u2019s claim or, at worst, was ambiguous in its \u201cPersonal Liability\u201d coverage. When the language of a policy is ambiguous, \u201cthe ambiguity is resolved in favor of the insured and in line with an insured\u2019s objectively-reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>Voorhees, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 175, 607 A.2d at 1260 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In view of the language used in the 1986 policy, which did not define either occurrence or accident, and considering the statements made by the Supreme Court in the 1992 <em>SL Industries </em>decision, we conclude that the 1986 policy covered the negligent misrepresentation claim. Therefore, we must remand to the trial court for a determination of whether at the time the Feits renewed their policy in 1995, Prudential successfully replaced the 1986 version of its homeowners\u2019 policy with the 1994 version, which clearly excluded negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">On the remand, if the trial court determines that the Feits received proper notice of the changes in the definition of occurrence, which reduced the coverage of their homeowner\u2019s policy, then the 1994 policy would be in effect at the time of the occurrence, and Prudential rightly refused to provide a defense to the Feits.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>If the Feits did not receive proper notice of the policy change, however, then the 1986 policy version remains in effect, the Feits would have been due a defense from Prudential, and the court should proceed to determine what fees and costs expended by the Feits are reimbursable by Prudential.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We acknowledge that Prudential asserted several additional reasons for disclaiming coverage of McClellan\u2019s claim and argued some of these reasons before the trial court. However, in opposition to the Feits\u2019 appeal, Prudential focused upon and briefed only the applicability of the 1994 homeowners\u2019 policy exclusion, and the inapplicability of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:1-20.2 to whatever notice requirements it may have had to replace the 1986 policy version with the 1994 version. With regard to the 1986 policy, therefore, Prudential has waived all other reasons for disclaimer that could have supported the motion judge\u2019s summary judgment. <em>State v. Lefante, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>584, 589-90, 103 A.2d 585, 587 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In addition, all of the Feits\u2019 other arguments seeking reversal of the judge\u2019s summary judgment, including indemnity, bad faith, punitive damage, and consumer fraud, have been analyzed and found wanting. They are all without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in this decision. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\"> Besides suing the Feits, McClellan also sued Atmostemp, along with the entities that had conducted the prior-to-closing inspection of the premises, the buyer\u2019s and sellers\u2019 real estate agents and their firms, and Voorhees Township. McClellan eventually settled with all defendants and executed a consent order that preserved the Feits\u2019 rights against Prudential.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\"> The Supreme Court granted certification in <em>Lemay v. Reilly, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>373, 845 A.2d 1255 (2004), to consider this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\"> There is some evidence in the record that the tank deteriorated by wear and tear and began leaking after the sale to McClellan. This evidence is not conclusive, however, as Prudential and plaintiff never joined issue on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
