We conclude that the insurer of the bus company remains solely responsible for the payment of medical expense benefits even though the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>bus passenger is insured under an automobile policy that provides personal injury protection benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Plaintiffs suffered personal injuries in accidents that occurred while they were passengers on buses insured by defendant United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. (USF&amp;G). Sottilare fell as she was getting off a bus; Schaefer slipped and fell in a bus bathroom; and Lee was injured when the bus in which she was riding was involved in an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">At the time of their accidents, plaintiffs were all named insureds under personal automobile insurance policies that provided personal injury protection (PIP) benefits, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. The policies that USF&amp;G issued to the owners of the buses in which plaintiffs suffered their accidents provided motor bus passenger medical expense benefits (MEB) coverage, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Plaintiffs incurred medical expenses as a result of their injuries and submitted claims for reimbursement to both USF&amp;G and their own automobile insurance companies. In all three cases, both insurers denied coverage, asserting that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were covered by the other insurer\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Consequently, plaintiffs were forced to bring these actions against USF&amp;G and their automobile insurers for declaratory judgments as to which insurer\u2019s coverage applied to their claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The cases were decided by three separate trial courts. Lee\u2019s action was brought before the court by an order to show cause. In the other two actions, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">The trial courts all determined that plaintiffs were entitled to MEB under the policies USF&amp;G issued to the bus companies and that the PIP provisions of plaintiffs\u2019 automobile policies did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>provide coverage because the accidents did not occur while plaintiffs were occupying, entering into, or alighting from automobiles. In <em>Lee, </em>the trial court also granted plaintiff\u2019s application for counsel fees and costs in the amount of $5448, but in <em>Sottilare </em>the court denied plaintiffs application for counsel fees and costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">In each of the three actions, USF&amp;G filed appeals from the trial courts\u2019 declarations that it has an obligation to pay MEB for plaintiffs\u2019 medical expenses and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not covered by their automobile policies. In <em>Sottilare, </em>plaintiff filed a cross-appeal from the court\u2019s denial of her application for counsel fees and costs. We consolidate the three appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We affirm the declaratory judgments that USF&amp;G is responsible for the payment of plaintiffs\u2019 MEB. We reverse the denial of Sottilare\u2019s application for counsel fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 to -35, commonly referred to as the \u201cNo Fault Act,\u201d requires \u201cevery standard automobile liability insurance policy\u201d to provide PIP benefits, which include reimbursement of medical expenses, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4(a), \u201cto the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustain bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. \u201cAutomobile\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">[A] private passenger automobile of a private passenger or station wagon type that is owned or hired and is neither used as a public or livery conveyance for passengers nor rented to others with a driver; and a motor vehicle with a pickup body, a delivery sedan, a van, or a panel truck or a camper type vehicle used for recreational purposes owned by an individual or by husband and wife who are residents of the same household, not customarily used in the occupation, profession or business of the insured other than farming or ranching.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-2(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Thus, for the purpose of determining eligibility for PIP benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4, the term \u201cautomobile\u201d does not include a bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In 1991, the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.6, which provides for the payment of no fault medical expense benefits up to $250,000 \u201cto any passenger who sustained bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into or alighting from a motor bus.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the same enactment, the Legislature provided that any bus passenger who brings suit against the owner or operator of a bus for non-economic damages is subject to the same \u201cverbal threshold\u201d that governs actions under the No Fault Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">It is clear on the face of these statutory provisions that a person who is injured while occupying, entering into or alighting from a bus is not entitled to PIP benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 because a bus is not included in the definition of an automobile set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(a) but is entitled to MEB benefits under <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.6. Nevertheless, USF&amp;G argues that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2, a section of the No Fault Act, requires responsibility for payment of the MEB of a person who is injured while a passenger on a bus and is insured under an automobile policy to be shifted from the bus\u2019s insurer to the passenger\u2019s automobile insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">\n<em>Primacy of coverages</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">Except as provided in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.3], the personal injury protection coverage of the named insured shall be the primary coverage for the named insured and any resident relative in the named insured\u2019s household who is not a named insured under an automobile insurance policy of his own. No person shall recover personal injury protection benefits under more than one automobile insurance policy for injuries sustained in any one accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>On its face, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2 is directed solely at determining which coverage is \u201cprimary\u201d when an injured insured is entitled to PIP benefits under multiple automobile policies. Because plaintiffs\u2019 accidents occurred while they were occupying or alighting from buses, plaintiffs are not entitled to PIP coverage under any automobile policy. Therefore, these cases do not involve any issue of the primacy of the PIP coverages of automobile policies governed by the legislative directive of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2 is limited by its plain terms to the determination of primacy of coverage for PIP benefits between automobile insurers, USF&amp;G argues that this provision should be read into <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.6 to impose primary liability for MEB on an injured bus passenger\u2019s automobile insurer. USF&amp;G contends that the omission of a provision comparable to <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-4.2 from the 1991 legislation requiring insurers of buses to provide MEB for persons injured while passengers on a bus was a \u201clegislative oversight\u201d subject to the court\u2019s remedial interpretation to effectuate the legislative intent in enacting <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.5 to -1.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In support of this argument, USF&amp;G relies upon <em>Park v. Park, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 707 A.2d 157 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>381, 718 A.2d 1210 (1998). In <em>Park, </em>we held that the deemer statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.4, under which automobile policies covering certain out-of-state vehicles are \u201cdeemed\u201d to include coverage satisfying New Jersey\u2019s mandates for liability, PIP and uninsured motorist coverage, should be construed to apply to the MEB coverage mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.6 even though the deemer statute was not amended to specifically reference <em>N.J.SA </em>17:28-1.6. In addition, we held that an insurer providing MEB benefits under <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.6 may seek reimbursement under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1, which permits insurers paying PIP benefits as a result of an automobile accident to recover those payments from a tortfeasor who was not required to maintain PIP protection other than for pedestrians, even though <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 also does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>specifically reference <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.6. In reaching this conclusion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">[T]he Legislature has followed the consistent scheme of subjecting all required PIP payments, by whatever statute mandated, to the reimbursement statute and all mandatory motor vehicle coverage, by whatever statute mandated, to the deemer statute. Were we not to assume that the failure of amendment of both the reimbursement and the deemer statute to accommodate the bus-passenger PIP statute was purely a matter of oversight, we would be ascribing to the Legislature a wholly incomprehensible and irrational carving out of this one area of mandated PIP coverage, entirely out of keeping with and inexplicable in terms of the firm legislative commitment to an integrated mandatory coverage scheme spanning at least a decade and a half. We think it plain that the coverage provisions of Chapters 6A and 6B of Title 39 and the coverage provisions of Chapter 28 of Title 17 constitute a harmonious legislative plan that must be read in <em>pari materia. </em>Excluding the bus-passenger PIP coverage from the reimbursement and deemer statutes would rend that harmony for no discernible reason of public policy, common sense or logic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">[Id. at 316-17, 707 A.2d at 159.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">However, we did not indicate in <em>Park </em>that every statutory provision governing PIP should be read into the statutes governing MEB. In fact, we took note of \u201cthe general reluctance of ... eourt[s] to declare an amendment by implication and that [courts] will do so only in the clearest cases,\u201d but concluded that <em>Park </em>was \u201cjust such a clear case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 707 A.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">In <em>Lymon v. Cape Transit Corp., </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 775 A.2d 41 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>608, 782 A.2d 426 (2001), we indicated that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4, which requires automobile insurers to provide PIP benefits to their insureds, and <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.6, which requires bus insurers to provide MEB benefits to bus passengers, are separate and distinct statutory enactments and that the statutes governing PIP, other than the deemer and reimbursement statutes involved in <em>Park, </em>should not be read into the statutes governing MEB. The plaintiff in <em>Lymon </em>was the driver of a car that was struck in the rear by a bus owned by defendants. Defendants did not qualify under the statutory provision that requires a driver of a car who receives PIP benefits to satisfy a \u201cverbal threshold\u201d for imposition of tort liability, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8, because their bus did not fit within the statutory definition of an \u201cautomobile.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(a). Nevertheless, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>fendants argued, relying upon <em>Park, </em>that the statutes governing PIP and MEB benefits \u201cshould be read as part of a unified plan,\u201d and, therefore, plaintiffs personal injury claim should be \u201csubject to the verbal threshold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 775 A.2d at 42. In rejecting this argument, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">The legislative mandate for PIP coverage in N.J.S.A 39:6A-8 is separate and apart from the mandate for PIP coverage for bus passengers in N.J.S.A 17:28-1.6 and -1.7. The legislative scheme in <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.6 and -1.7 is directed solely toward providing coverage for bus passengers; clearly plaintiff was not a passenger on defendants\u2019 bus. Further, the legislative scheme in <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-8 specifies that it encompasses only those vehicles that fit within the definition of \u201cautomobile\u201d contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-2. It is not disputed that defendants\u2019 bus does not fall within that statutory definition of automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 575-76, 775 A.2d at 42.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In <em>Coach USA Inc. v. Allstate N.J. Ins. Co., </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 806 A.2d 839 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>170, 814 A.2d 635 (2002), we reaffirmed the holding of <em>Park </em>that <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1, which governs the right of an insurer that pays PIP benefits to seek reimbursement from a tortfeasor who is not required to maintain PIP, should be read into the statutory provisions governing the payment of MEB to bus passengers. Consequently, we concluded that an automobile insurer that had paid PIP benefits to its insureds could not maintain an action for reimbursement against the owners of buses that had been involved in accidents with their insureds because the bus owners were liable for the payment of the MEB under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.6. <em>Id. </em>at 280-82, 806 A.2d at 841-42. In reaching this conclusion, we stated that <em>\u201cPark\u2019s </em>principle [is] that Chapter 6A of Title 39 and Chapter 28 of Title 17 must be read <em>in a reimbursement context </em>so as to create a unified legislative scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 806 A.2d at 842 (emphasis added). Consequently, <em>Coach USA </em>indicates that <em>Park </em>does not stand for the proposition that every statutory provision relating to the obligation of automobile insurers to provide PIP benefits should be imported into the statutes governing the payment of MEB benefits to bus passengers. Instead, the application of <em>Park </em>is limited to the deemer and reimbursement statutes specifically at issue in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>There is no basis for concluding that the omission from the statutes governing MEB of a provision requiring such benefits to be paid by an injured bus passenger\u2019s automobile insurer \u201cwas a legislative \u2018oversight subject to the court\u2019s remedial interpretation in order to effectuate actual legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Park, supra, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 316, 707 A.2d at 159 (quoting <em>Zupo v. CNA Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 381, 474 A.2d 259, 263 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>30, 483 A.2d 811 (1984)). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2 is designed to serve \u201cthe [legislative] policy of transactional efficiency\u201d by providing that where an injured party would be entitled to PIP benefits under both his own automobile policy and another automobile policy, the insured party\u2019s own insurer is solely responsible for payment of PIP benefits. <em>Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co. v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 263, 690 A.2d 1074, 1082 (App.Div.1997), <em>aff'd, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>205, 707 A.2d 1350 (1998). Thus, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2 only applies where an injured party is entitled to PIP benefits under two different automobile policies. Plaintiffs clearly are not entitled to PIP benefits under their own automobile policies because they were injured while occupying or alighting from buses, which are not included in the statutory definition of \u201cautomobile,\u201d thus failing to satisfy the prerequisite to PIP coverage under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4. Consequently, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4.2 does not apply in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Furthermore, a legislative decision to shift responsibility for the payment of MEB from a bus company\u2019s insurer to the injured passenger\u2019s automobile insurer would involve a different kind of policy determination than the one embodied in <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4.2. As previously noted, the assignment of primary responsibility for the payment of PIP benefits between automobile insurers who otherwise would both be liable is designed to promote transactional efficiency, which reduces the insurers\u2019 costs and consequently the overall premiums payable by policyholders. However, if automobile insurers were required to pay MEB to their insureds who suffered personal injuries while passengers on a bus, this would result in a decrease in the claims expenses of the bus insurers and consequently the premiums payable by bus companies and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>corresponding increase in the claims expenses of automobile insurers and premiums payable by their insureds. Therefore, there is no basis in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2 for finding an implied legislative intent to shift responsibility for the payment of MEB from bus company insurers to automobile insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\"><em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(6) authorizes the award of counsel fees to a successful claimant \u201c[i]n an action upon a liability or indemnity policy of insurance.\u201d \u201cAlthough ordinarily this rule is not applicable to first-party claims, an exception has been made in PIP cases.\u201d <em>Scullion v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>431, 437, 785 A.2d 469, 473 (App.Div.2001). The MEB coverage provided to bus passengers under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.6 is similar to PIP coverage. Indeed, it has been characterized as \u201cbus-PIP.\u201d <em>See Coach USA, supra, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 278, 806 A.2d at 839. Therefore, we conclude that a bus passenger who succeeds on a claim for MEB is entitled to an award of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In denying Sottilare\u2019s application for counsel fees, the trial court simply stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">[T]he subject of plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion to determine which defendant was responsible for paying for plaintiffs PIP benefits was already brought before the Court via the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">However, the fact that the coverage issue was brought before the trial court by USF&amp;G\u2019s and Liberty Mutual\u2019s cross-motions for summary judgment did not justify the denial of Sottilare\u2019s counsel fee application. Sottilare was forced to incur counsel fees to initiate this coverage action because both insurers denied her claims for reimbursement of medical expenses for injuries she suffered in an accident on a bus, and she succeeded in her claim against USF&amp;G.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">We also reject USF&amp;G\u2019s argument that Sottilare is not entitled to a counsel fee award because she has not yet established her right to a specific amount of MEB. USF&amp;G denied Sottilare\u2019s claim on the ground that her automobile insurer was solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>responsible for payment of her medical expenses, and Sottilare obtained a declaratory judgment that USF&amp;G was obligated to pay those expenses. A declaratory judgment that a disclaimer of coverage violates an insurer\u2019s obligations under its policy and the governing statutes is sufficient success to warrant a counsel fee award even though there has not yet been a determination of the amount of benefits to which the insured may be entitled. <em>See Schmidt v. Smith, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 591, 684 A.2d 66, 77 (App.Div.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>44, 53, 713 A.2d 1014, 1018-19 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The trial court also erred in denying Sottilare\u2019s application for costs. <em>Rule </em>4:42-8 provides that \u201c[ujnless otherwise provided by law, these rules or court order, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party.\u201d Under this rule, a prevailing party may be denied an award of costs only for \u201cspecial reasons.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 1 on <em>R. </em>4:42-8 (2005). There was no justification for the denial of Sottilare\u2019s application for reimbursement of the costs she had to incur because both insurers denied coverage for her medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the declaratory judgments that USF&amp;G is required to pay MEB to plaintiffs. We reverse the denial of Sottilare\u2019s application for counsel fees and costs and remand that case to the trial court to determine the amount of counsel fees and costs to which Sottilare is entitled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\"> In <em>Sottilare, </em>plaintiff named as defendants not only USF&amp;G and her automobile insurer but also USF&amp;G's claims administrator and the alleged owners of the bus in which her accident occurred.
