He was sentenced to an aggregate three-year term of probation, conditioned upon per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>forming 500 hours of community service. The court also levied a $5,000 fine and ordered him to pay the mandatory statutory penalties.

Summation at Trial</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aql\">POINT VII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-27\">THE FORGERY VERDICT WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Defendant is an attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The conviction for theft was based on defendant\u2019s delay in disbursing to his clients proceeds from a settlement of a wrongful death case. With respect to the forgery conviction, the State presented evidence that defendant endorsed and deposited the three-party settlement cheek without his clients\u2019 authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The prosecutor denied defendant\u2019s application to enter PreTrial Intervention (PTI) and, on appeal from the prosecutor\u2019s denial, the trial court affirmed. The prosecutor premised his denial on the nature of the conduct allegedly engaged in by defendant. Relying on PTI Guideline 3(i), as codified in <em>Rule </em>3:28, the prosecutor concluded that, as a licensed attorney, defendant was presumptively ineligible to participate in PTI because he was charged with committing crimes that involved a breach of the public trust. Accordingly, defendant had failed to overcome the presumption against admitting individuals charged with these type offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">After reviewing the record and in light of prevailing legal standards, we reverse the convictions. We conclude that the trial court improperly excluded substantial portions of proffered testimony by defendant\u2019s character witnesses. The court erroneously prevented these witnesses from testifying about defendant\u2019s character traits as an attorney, and improperly barred them from testifying about the specific experiences they had had with defendant that formed the basis for their opinions. We hold that defendant was entitled to present testimonial evidence attesting to his skill and care as an attorney in order to rebut the State\u2019s contention that his failure to timely disburse clients\u2019 funds constituted the criminal offense of failing to make required disposition of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The trial court also improperly submitted to the jury the full text of <em>Rule </em>1:21-6. This Rule sets forth an attorney\u2019s bookkeep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ing responsibilities related to the practice of law, with respect to both the attorney\u2019s business records and to records of client funds entrusted to the lawyer for a particular purpose. The error here involved the court\u2019s failure to provide instructions to the jury on how to consider and apply the Rule\u2019s directives to the facts of this criminal case. Without judicial guidance, a criminal jury may mistakenly regard the Rule\u2019s requirement as an element of the criminal offense of failing to make the required disposition or misapplication of entrusted property.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We further conclude that certain statements made by the prosecutor during summation were so egregious that they deprived defendant of his right to a fair trial. These involved a hypothetical scenario entirely unrelated to the crimes for which defendant was charged, and suggested that it was unnecessary for the State to prove at which point defendant\u2019s conduct became criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We affirm, however, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s PTI application. We hold that defendant failed to show that the prosecutor\u2019s rejection amounted to a gross abuse of discretion or was otherwise arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In light of these determinations, we decline to consider the balance of defendant\u2019s arguments. Our factual recitation will thus be limited to the facts necessary to address the pertinent legal issues previously identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Defendant began practicing law in 1971. His first job as a lawyer was at the office of the Bronx District Attorney. He was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1972. He and a partner opened a law firm in Cranford in 1974. Thereafter, he formed a partnership with his brother in Westfield, where he continued to work as of the time of trial. Defendant\u2019s practice primarily focused on litigation, but he also performed transactional work. He became a certified civil trial attorney when the program was inaugurated in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Barbara and Clark Ferry had been friends with defendant\u2019s secretary, Maureen Holohan, since childhood. The Ferrys first contacted defendant in the mid-1980s when they discovered that their six-year-old son, Richard, had been born with an eye problem. No lawsuit was filed in that case. In 1998, the Ferrys contacted defendant after their daughter, Desiree, died of injuries sustained in a one-car accident. After considerable discovery, that ease was withdrawn several years later because defendant was unable to find a medical expert to opine that the hospital or any of the treating physicians were civilly liable for the child\u2019s death. In 1997, defendant successfully defended the Ferrys\u2019 son, Clark (known as \u201cCJ\u201d), when he was arrested on an indictable criminal charge. Defendant never charged the Ferrys for his services on these eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In February 1998, twenty-one-year-old CJ was killed by a car as he attempted to cross Route 9 in Monmouth County at 2:00 a.m., after drinking with friends at a nearby club. The following spring, the Ferrys received several telephone messages from the driver\u2019s insurance company, Harleysville Insurance. Mrs. Ferry asked defendant to contact the insurance company \u201cand find out what they wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">According to the Ferrys, defendant contacted the insurance company and began to negotiate a settlement. The Ferrys discussed the progress of the settlement negotiations with defendant on the telephone on \u201cmore than one occasion\u201d during the fall of 1998. Thereafter, defendant informed Mrs. Ferry that the insurance company wanted to settle the claim to avoid any future lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">In December 1998, defendant sent Mrs. Ferry a contingency fee retainer agreement. Several changes were made to the agreement as a result of telephone discussions she had with defendant. Mrs. Ferry alone signed the agreement as administratrix ad prosequendum of the estate of Clark Ferry. The agreement provided for defendant to receive, by way of compensation, thirty-three percent of any monetary settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>At defendant\u2019s request, the Ferrys met him on January 4,1999, at the surrogate\u2019s office located at the Ocean County Courthouse. Both Mr. and Mrs. Ferry signed an application for administration ad prosequendum. Mrs. Ferry testified that she did not understand the purpose of the application. She also testified that she signed \u201ca lot of papers\u201d that day without knowing what she signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">According to Mrs. Ferry, the first time she saw a document that the prosecutor called \u201ca release\u201d was during defendant\u2019s trial. She testified, however, that the signatures on the document belonged to her and her husband. On cross-examination, she was shown a release dated January 1999. She surmised that she must have signed the document during her visit to the surrogate\u2019s office on January 4, 1999. She also indicated that the signatures on a document dated January 7,1999, which the prosecutor referred to as a \u201cgeneral release,\u201d were not the signatures of her or her husband. Although she never heard the term \u201crefunding bond\u201d and could not recall signing one, she identified her and her husband\u2019s signatures on a partial refunding bond sent to them by defendant on April 15, 1999. Mr. Ferry also identified his signature on the release, but was unable to recall signing the documents. He said defendant explained \u201csome things\u201d about the documents, but that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really attach any significance to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">On or about January 12,1999, the Ferrys received the following letter from claims representative Rachel Brown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">In accordance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:2-17.11, Unfair Claims Practices, we are required to notify you of settlement of your third party liability claim with your legal representative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">We are required by the above act to provide you with the following information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">1. The amount of payment: $75,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">2. The party/parties to whom the check was made payable: Clark Ferry &amp; Barbara Ferry, as Administrators Ad Prosequedum [sic] for Estate of Clark Ferry, Jr. and Mahoney &amp; Mahoney, as attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">3. The party to whom the check was mailed; Mahoney &amp; Mahoney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-13\">4. The address of the party to whom the check was mailed: P.O. Box 309, Westfield, NJ 07090</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Instead of reading the letter herself, Mrs. Ferry testified that she left it for her husband to read. She never discussed the letter with her husband until the following October. She admitted, however, that on or about January or February 1999, defendant told her that he had deposited the settlement check in his account, and that the State would not release the funds for thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Mr. Ferry testified that he read the letter in January 1999, and discussed it with his wife. He told her to call defendant because, although he \u201coriginally\u201d did not understand the letter, \u201cit became clear to [him] as [he] discussed it with [Mrs. Ferry] ... that it meant that there was a payment that was made.\u201d He also understood that the cheek had been deposited by defendant. Mrs. Ferry called defendant in March 1999, \u201cto see if he had received the release from the State so that he could issue our portion of the check.\u201d Defendant told her he was still waiting for releases pertaining to \u201cthe New Jersey income tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">In April 1999, Mr. Ferry was in the process of refinancing his mortgage. He called defendant to determine when the settlement funds would be released and whether he could use it to payoff his second mortgage. According to Mr. Ferry, defendant told him that it \u201cwould be a month to six weeks worth of time before the monies would be released.\u201d Three weeks before the expiration of his sixty-day mortgage commitment, Mr. Ferry again telephoned defendant\u2019s office inquiring about the availability of the settlement funds. He was told by the person who answered \u201cthat the monies had not been released yet.\u201d Mr. Ferry decided to cancel the refinancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">In August 1999, Mr. Ferry again contacted defendant seeking information on the status of the settlement funds. According to Mr. Ferry, defendant told him that he was planning to file a motion, sometime in September, to have the settlement funds released because \u201cno liens\u201d had been found against his son. Defendant attributed the delay to unspecified matters related to CJ\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>In October 1999, Mrs. Ferry contacted an acquaintance who was on the staff of a State Senator, to obtain information on the New Jersey tax \u201cthat was holding up the settlement money.\u201d She gave this person a copy of the January 12, 1999 letter from the insurance company. Mrs. Ferry testified that, as a result, she discovered that the settlement check had been issued listing three people as payees.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">When Mrs. Ferry obtained a copy of the front and back of the settlement check, she noticed that it contained the signatures of Clark B. Ferry, Barbara Ferry, and Mahoney and Mahoney, with the word \u201ctrust,\u201d and an account number. Both Mr. and Mrs. Ferry testified that these were not their signatures, and that they had not authorized anyone to endorse the check on their behalf. When Mrs. Ferry contacted defendant\u2019s office, she was told that the money had finally been released and that she should receive her share by the end of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">At this point, the Ferrys contacted the Westfield Police Department, which directed them to the Union County Prosecutor. On December 16, 1999, Mrs. Ferry called defendant from the West-field Police Department. A recording of the call was played for the jury. In the conversation, defendant tells Mrs. Ferry that he \u201cfinally got an Order signed by [a judge] that came in late November that gives the State 30 days\u201d and that at \u201c[t]he end of this month they should have to pay it.\u201d He told her that \u201cthey should give me something in writing that says there\u2019s no tax and ... that\u2019s the final thing.\u201d He added that \u201c[t]he Surrogate [was] waiting on the taxing authority to give them a tax clearance certificate\u201d and that he \u201cfigure[d]\u201d they should have it by \u201cthe end of the year.\u201d She should expect to hear from him \u201c[pjrobably [in] a couple weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">On December 21, 1999, the police executed a search of defendant\u2019s office and seized numerous documents including the Ferry file and bank records. Ten days later, Holohan delivered to the Ferrys a $50,000 check dated December 31,1999, payable to Clark and Barbara Ferry for the estate of Clark Ferry. The check was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>drawn on the Mahoney and Mahoney Partnership Attorney Trust Account.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">In addition to the Ferrys, the State called Susan Walters, chief clerk of the Ocean County Surrogate\u2019s Office to explain the legal function of her office to the jury. Walters explained that letters of administration ad prosequendum are required to obtain the right to file a wrongful death suit on behalf of a decedent. Here, these documents were issued on January 4, 1999, to Clark and Barbara Ferry.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">According to Walters, the Ferrys needed judicial approval to dispose of any estate asset, \u201ceven in the form of a check.\u201d This procedure is only necessary, however, when the check is issued to \u201cthe estate of\u2019 decedent. Court approval is not required when, as here, the check is made payable directly to the heirs and their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Because the surrogate\u2019s office was never notified of any assets placed in CJ\u2019s estate, no inheritance tax would have been due from his parents. As to the need for bonding by the Ferrys, Walters explained that a partial refunding bond was only necessary when the heirs receive only part of their \u201cbenefits.\u201d In this scenario, a refunding bond protects the executor or administrator \u201cif there\u2019s a just debt that comes about after [the heirs] receive their money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The State also called Rachel Brown, the claims adjuster in charge of the Ferry matter. Brown received defendant\u2019s name from an investigator the carrier hired to locate CJ\u2019s family. She contacted defendant on August 4, 1998, and they exchanged correspondence throughout the fall. She characterized the case as \u201ccomplex\u201d because it involved a fatality and questionable liability by the insured. According to Brown, CJ may have been intoxicated, was wearing dark clothing, and had crossed the middle of Route 9 in the early hours of the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>On December 10, 1998, Brown offered defendant $50,000 to settle the case. On December 14, 1998, defendant made a demand for $75,000, which Brown agreed to on December 30, 1998. On that same day, she requested confirmation that the parents in fact were responsible for the estate. Defendant faxed her copies of the relevant documents on January 7, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">That same day, Brown forward to defendant a copy of the release. The next day, January 8, 1999, the insurance company received a letter from defendant transmitting an executed release showing the Ferrys\u2019 signatures. The settlement check was issued immediately thereafter, and cashed on January 22, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Detective Gagliardi of the Union County Prosecutor\u2019s Office testified regarding the bank records seized from defendant\u2019s office. The Mahoney and Mahoney partnership attorney trust account was held at Fleet Bank (referred throughout the trial as \u201cthe 116 account\u201d or \u201cthe trust account\u201d). The partnership\u2019s business account bore a different account number. Bank records for the trust and business accounts covered a period from January to November 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">A series of banking transactions document how the critical events unfolded. It is necessary to list these transactions chronologically in order to fully appreciate the State\u2019s theory of culpability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">(1) On January 15,1999, the 116 trust account had a balance of $250.19;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">(2) On January 20,1999, a deposit was made in the amount of $75,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">(3) On January 21,1999, a further deposit was made in the amount of $6,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">(4) On January 21, 1999, three separate cheeks were written from this account: (i) a cheek for $17,045.08, payable to a bank; (ii) a cheek for $17,954.92, payable to a mortgage company; and (iii) a check for $15,000, payable to a mortgage corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">(5) On January 22, 1999, three more cheeks were written from the trust account: (i) a cheek for $6,000, payable to Mahoney and Mahoney law firm; (ii) a check for $18,827.08, payable to an individual; and (iii) a check for $4,517.92, payable to an individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-14\">(6) The account\u2019s ending balance for the month of January was $1,905.19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">Numerous checks were also written from the trust account to the firm\u2019s business account during the period from February to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>November 1999, as well as a $6,000 cheek issued to defendant. The partnership\u2019s business account had a beginning deficit balance in January 1999 of $596.79. After $17,492.74 was deposited into the account, the ending balance was $1,634.66. The bank sent five insufficient funds notices on the account in February, June and August 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Defendant testified in his own defense. He claimed that Barbara Ferry knew that he received and deposited the settlement cheek, because she verbally authorized him to endorse it. He lied to the Ferrys as to the status of the settlement funds to deflect their inquiries, thereby enabling him to concentrate on his treatment for prostate cancer. Although the cancer was not diagnosed until March 1999, based on his ill-health, he underwent an aggressive pre-diagnosis treatment regimen contemporaneous to the receipt of the settlement check.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Defendant acknowledged that bank records, including those involving the trust account, were not maintained in proper accounting order. He attributed most of the problems to his poor health, commencing with a heart attack in 1997. His health and related emotional problems only worsened after the cancer was diagnosed. He had prostate surgery and follow-up radiation therapy. This rendered him temporarily incontinent, which, in turn, caused him to feel depressed and generally unconcerned with his business affairs. Defendant also called two expert witnesses, a cardiologist and a psychologist, who had treated him at various points in his illness. These witnesses corroborated defendant\u2019s testimony with respect to his inability to fully attend to his business affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">In rebuttal, the prosecutor emphasized defendant\u2019s ethical responsibilities to maintain attorney trust account records in conformance with the requirements of <em>Rule </em>1:21-6. She aggressively cross-examined defendant on the details of his derelictions vis-\u00e1vis the Rule\u2019s requirements, and highlighted his thirty years of practicing law without ever having maintained his trust account ledger in compliance with the Rule\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">A central part of the defense focused on defendant\u2019s lack of intent to permanently deprive the Ferrys of the settlement proceeds. He emphasized that he never paid himself the one-third contingency fee he was entitled to receive under the retainer agreement. In furtherance of this defense, defendant called a group of eight individuals, consisting of both colleagues and former clients, to provide character evidence testimony concerning his manner of practice and reputation as a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Prior to these witnesses testifying before the jury, defense counsel proffered that each witness would testify about the details of his or her relationship with defendant and offer opinions on defendant\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, diligence and ability as an attorney. For each of the eight potential witnesses, defense counsel indicated when the individual had met defendant and the circumstances of the relationship. By way of example, one potential attorney-witness had known defendant since 1972, was a former co-worker, referred cases to him, and worked jointly with him on cases. Another had known defendant since law school, served with him in Vietnam, and handled cases with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">After hearing defense counsel\u2019s proffers, the trial court determined that the evidence defendant sought to introduce fell within <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(a)(1), regarding a \u201cpertinent trait of the accused\u2019s character,\u201d and not within <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(c), which involves \u201ca character or trait [that] is an element of a claim or defense.\u201d The court thus ruled that the witnesses could only testify \u201cas to their opinion of the defendant\u2019s reputation in the community as to honesty, trustworthiness, integrity and diligence.\u201d They were precluded, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">from testifying as to whether or not they were satisfied with the defendant as an attorney, their opinion of him as an attorney; that they would still be hiring him as a lawyer today; that they referred other clients to him; that he\u2019s handled millions of dollars for particular clients through trust accounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The court excluded this area of potential testimony because, in its reading of the Rule, \u201cthose are not character traits, they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>not pertinent, and they are specific instances of conduct and not opinion or reputation testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The court thereafter conducted a series of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearings in which the prospective character witnesses described, in great detail, their experiences with defendant. At the end of these hearings, the court ruled that each witness was restricted to testify only about general information concerning that witness\u2019s relationship with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Thus, the attorney who served in Vietnam with defendant was specifically precluded from mentioning that aspect of their relationship. The court directed defense counsel to use leading questions and \u201cto tell your witnesses that they are not to blurt out anything about compassion, anything about quality of services, anything about anything other than their opinion regarding the trustworthiness, truthfulness and integrity\u201d of defendant. Against this backdrop, we will now discuss the legal issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">It is well settled that a defendant in a criminal trial has the right to present character evidence to address the principal question the jury must ultimately answer: has the State met its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Siciliano, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>249, 260-62, 121 A.2d 490 (1956); <em>State in the Interest of V.M., </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 537, 833 A.2d 692 (App.Div. 2003); <em>State v. Micci, </em>46 <em>N.J.Super. </em>454, 459-60, 134 A.2d 805 (App.Div.1957); <em>State v. Steensen, </em>35 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 106, 113 A.2d 203 (App.Div.1955). Because the right to present character evidence is embedded in the presumption of innocence, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(a)(1) prohibits a court from excluding character evidence, under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403, offered by the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Here, the trial court erred when it precluded testimony about defendant\u2019s traits of care as an attorney. Under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(a)(1), defendant was entitled to present testimonial evidence attesting to his professional relationship with other clients. Such evidence directly relates to the crucial issue in this case, to wit, whether defendant\u2019s failure to turnover the settlement funds in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>timely fashion is indicative of a criminal intent to perpetrate a theft, or of mere negligence brought about by sloppy recordkeeping and poor health.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The court also erred when it excluded the testimony of witnesses\u2019 personal experiences with defendant that formed the basis for their opinions of his character. Without such a foundation, character testimony is reduced to a net opinion. In evaluating the value and legitimacy of the witnesses\u2019 opinion, the jury is entitled to consider the experiences that the witness and defendant have shared, and how they illuminate and reveal the content of a person\u2019s character.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">As previously noted, in the course of cross-examining defendant, the prosecutor made repeated references to the record-keeping requirements contained in <em>Rule </em>1:21-6. Overruling defendant\u2019s objections, the court permitted the prosecutor to revisit this issue in her summation to the jury. The prosecutor also was permitted, over defendant\u2019s objections, to make the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">I would submit to you that the defense argument that [the Ferrysl got their money therefore, he didn\u2019t have any criminal intent and he didn\u2019t commit a theft, that is ridiculous. I\u2019ll give you a whole bunch of examples.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">Somebody who is shoplifting at a store and gets caught by the security guard on the way out and then says <em>well, I </em>still have it inside my pocket. Here, you can have it back. So now I didn\u2019t commit shoplifting. Or somebody goes into a person\u2019s house and commits a burglary and takes an expensive piece of jewelry and [sic] witness sees who the person is and [sic] person gets away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">And then an arrest warrant is issued for that person and <em>11 </em>months later the person is arrested, and then the person says oh, here\u2019s that watch. You can have it back now. I didn\u2019t commit the burglary. And there\u2019s no theft because I didn\u2019t have any intent. And, you know, if the person had asked me enough times for their watch back I would have given it to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Prosecutors are afforded considerable leeway in arguing the State\u2019s case to the jury \u201cas long as their comments are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>reasonably related to the scope of the evidence presented.\u201d <em>State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 82, 727 A.2d 1 (1999). Prosecutors may suggest legitimate inferences that may be drawn from the record, but they exceed the bounds of fair comment if they go \u201cbeyond the facts before the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>122, 194, 716 A.2d 458 (1998), cert. <em>denied, </em>532 <em>U.S. </em>1057, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>2204, 149 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2001). Simply stated, prosecutors are not permitted to make inaccurate legal or factual assertions during summation. <em>Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 85, 727 A.2d 1; <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>38, 48, 837 A.2d 1137 (App.Div.2003), <em>certif. denied, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>150, 849 A.2d 183 (2004). \u201cThey are duty-bound to confine their comments to facts revealed during the trial and reasonable inferences to be drawn from that evidence.\u201d <em>Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 85, 727 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The comments at issue here were not an inaccurate statement of facts adduced at trial. Instead, the prosecutor used a series of hypothetical scenarios that she asserted were analogous to the facts of the case. The crime for which defendant was charged, however, bore no resemblance to the crime of shoplifting or burglary of a watch, where the crime is complete at a definite point in time. Because defendant did, at one point, disburse the funds to the Ferrys, there was a legitimate and critical threshold issue for the jury to decide; that is, whether an actual crime had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Moreover, at no point in the presentation of evidence or during summation did the prosecutor clarify for the jury the State\u2019s position as to when the crime was committed. Without legal guidance in this area, the jury was left on its own to determine when the theft crime was completed by defendant. Was it: (1) when defendant wrote $50,000 worth of checks from his trust account in January 1999; (2) when defendant told Mrs. Ferry that he needed to get a tax clearance certificate before he could release the funds; (3) when defendant represented to Mr. Ferry that the money would be available to payoff his second mortgage, thereby making the refinance of his existing mortgage possible; (4) when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the Prosecutor\u2019s Office decided <em>to </em>investigate; or (5) at some other point entirely?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The State bears the burden of proving each and every element of a crime. <em>State v. Ragland, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>189, 196, 519 A.2d 1361 (1986). By relying on factual scenarios completely unrelated to the crimes for which defendant was charged, the prosecutor\u2019s hypothetical scenarios improperly suggested to the jury that it was unnecessary for the State to prove at what point defendant\u2019s conduct became criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Determining that a prosecutor\u2019s summation exceeded the bounds of fair comment on the evidence is insufficient, in and of itself, to warrant reversal. We must also determine whether these comments were so prejudicial that they deprived defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Michaels, </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>579, 636, 625 A.2d 489 (App.Div.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>299, 642 A.2d 1372 (1994). In making this determination, we must consider: (1) whether defense counsel interposed a timely objection to the remarks; (2) whether the remarks were withdrawn; and (3) whether the court ordered the remarks stricken and instructed the jury to ignore them. <em>Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 83, 727 A.2d 1; <em>State v. Marshall, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>1, 153, 586 A.2d 85 (1991), <em>cert. denied,, </em>507 <em>U.S. </em>929, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>1306, 122 L.Ed.2d 694 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Here, the prejudice caused by the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was left unchecked by the trial court. That is, by overruling defense counsel\u2019s timely objection, the court missed the opportunity to mitigate the harm by issuing a properly tailored instruction directing the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s statements. Overruling defendant\u2019s objection also communicated to the jury the court\u2019s tacit endorsement of the prosecutor\u2019s incorrect expressions of the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Defendant argues that his due process rights were violated by the trial court in three distinct rulings: (1) permitting the State to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>cross-examine Mm on whether he kept Ms trust account ledgers in accordance with the requirements of <em>Rule </em>1:21-6; (2) permitting the prosecutor to refer to the Rule\u2019s requirements in the course of her summation; and (3) submitting the entire text of the Rule to the jury without the benefit of any judicial guidance as to its applicability to the facts and legal issues of this case. According to defendant, these rulings allowed the State \u201cto mix and blur the line between civil and criminal concepts and proMbitions\u201d and \u201ccreateQ a double standard for a criminal violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-9.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">We agree, in part, with defendant\u2019s arguments. The trial court correctly ruled that evidence showing defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the Rule\u2019s requirements was <em>relevant </em>to the jury\u2019s determination of guilt or innocence. The error here lies in the court\u2019s failure to limit the scope of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant. TMs error was compounded when the court permitted the jury to receive the entire text of tMs complex rule of accounting, without any instruction as to how it related to the issue of defendant\u2019s criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\"><em>Rule </em>1:21-6 is included in the New Jersey Court Rules Chapter III, pertaining to \u201cPractice of Law and Admission To Practice.\u201d The Rule is entitled \u201cRecordkeeping; Sharing of Fees; Examination of Records.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:21-6. It has twenty-six sections and subparts, and is four pages long. <em>Ibid. </em>Judge Pressler\u2019s commentary on the Rule is another four-and-a-half pages. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>1:21-6 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">The Rule provides extensive, detailed requirements for the maintenance of attorney trust and business accounts. <em>R. </em>1:21-6. The Rule: (1) establishes the accounts that must be kept by the attorney, <em>R. </em>1:21-6(a)(1); (2) provides for the location of the accounts and delineates the terms of agreements between the attorney and the financial institution, <em>R. </em>1:21-6(b); (3) describes the records that must be maintained by the attorney, <em>R. </em>1:21-6(c); and (4) specifies the location of the records, <em>R. </em>1:21-6(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The sole judicial instruction provided to the jury on the relevance and use of the Rule was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">S-125 is a New Jersey court rule regarding records, keeping of attorney trust fund [sic] and what land of records you have to keep and how you have to keep them. You also heard testimony about them. So if you wish during your deliberations to refer to that or read it, that will be in evidence also. And you\u2019ll have that in with your packet of exhibits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Thereafter, during the charge on the elements of the crime of misapplication of entrusted property, the court advised the jury that: \u201cHaving insufficient funds in one\u2019s trust account to cover an attorney\u2019s obligations to his client is not in and of itself a criminal violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The jury received no further instructions on (1) the general application of the Rule; (2) which of its twenty-six subsections were applicable to the issues in this case; (3) how to consider the prosecutor\u2019s extensive cross-examination of defendant\u2019s failure to keep sufficient funds in his trust and business accounts; and (4) the significance of the Rule in determining the issue of defendant\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">An attorney\u2019s criminal conviction is clearly relevant to a determination of whether the attorney also has violated the ethical standards encompassed in the rules of professional responsibility. <em>Matter of Pepe, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>561, 568-69, 659 A.2d 1379 (1995); <em>Matter of Schaffer, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>148, 159, 657 A.2d 871 (1995). \u201cCriminal conduct by an attorney is a particularly egregious form of unethical behavior.\u201d <em>Matter of Pepe, supra, 140 N.J. </em>at 568, 659 A.2d 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">The use of civil standards as an aid in determining criminal conduct, however, is more carefully restricted. In \u201climited and ancillary contexts,\u201d civil standards may be applicable to resolution of particular issues in criminal cases. <em>State v. Damiano, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 50, 730 A.2d 376 (App.Div.1999), <em>certif. denied, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>396, 749 A.2d 369 (2000). New Jersey courts largely have considered the issue in the context of the standards embodied in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>UCC rules have been used to establish value in civil cases and may be employed to assist a jury in determining the amount of a theft. <em>See State v. Burks, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 60, 455 A.2d 1148 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>285, 460 A.2d 684 (1983); <em>State v. Romero, </em>95 <em>N.J.Super. </em>482, 487, 231 A.2d 830 (App.Div. 1967). We have also utilized the UCC in employee embezzlement cases. <em>State v. Lamb, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 215-216, 310 A.2d 102 (App.Div.1973). In <em>Lamb, </em>citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-401(2), we deemed the crime of embezzlement to have been completed when defendant, the company\u2019s receiving clerk, signed a document acknowledging receipt of the goods. <em>Ibid. </em>We recognized that under the UCC, \u201ctitle to goods passes to the buyer upon delivery, unless otherwise specifically agreed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 310 A.2d 102. We have declined, however, to apply UCC notions of title to permit the State to seize a boat that had been used in a fraudulent insurance scheme from a bona fide, innocent purchaser for value. <em>State v. Somerset Cent. Carp., </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>716, 718-21, 524 A.2d 893 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In <em>Damiano, supra, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29-37, 730 A.2d 376, we disapproved of the manner in which a jury was instructed on UCC standards in a case involving allegations of theft by failure to make required disposition of property, misapplication of entrusted property, and theft by deception. The defendant in <em>Damiano </em>was an inexperienced and undercapitalized car dealer teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. <em>Id. </em>at 30-32, 730 A.2d 376. The evidence showed that he accepted payments and trade-ins for new cars but failed to payoff the liens on the trade-ins as he agreed to do. <em>Id. at </em>32, 730 A.2d 376. He also resold traded-in ears to new customers without having paid off the prior hens, and failed to submit to the manufacturers customers\u2019 payments for warranties on their vehicles. <em>Id. </em>at 32-33, 730 A.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The trial court instructed the jury in various aspects of the UCC and contract law. <em>Id. at </em>39-41, 49, 730 A.2d 376. We held that the trial court failed to properly focus the jury\u2019s attention on the issue of intent, because it merely instructed the jury on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>UCC standards without relating how the standards should be used in evaluating the facts relevant to the intent issue. <em>Id. </em>at 41-12, 730 A.2d 376. The violation of the stated UCC standards was not necessarily a criminal act. <em>Id. </em>at 40, 730 A.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Speaking within the context of a business facing bankruptcy, we cautioned that, where criminal allegations arise from business dealings, accurate jury charges that relate the law to the facts are essential:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">Insolvency insulting in the inability to pay creditors does not by itself necessarily imply that there was criminal conduct involved or that the unpaid creditors were the victims of criminal conduct. If that were so, every bankrupt would be liable to criminal prosecution. Obviously the harm caused to the creditors of an insolvent business is always the proper subject of civil litigation. The question is when and under what circumstances it may also fairly be the subject of criminal liability. We think it plain that in order for criminal liability to attach to the individual acts or the course of conduct engaged in by a businessman on the brink of insolvency, there must be criminal intent and criminal culpability as defined by the criminal statutes. Obviously, criminal liability cannot attach simply because civil liability attaches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">Our careful scrutiny of the jury charge here persuades us of its essential and overall failure properly to apprise the jury of these distinctions. In general terms, there was inappropriate intermingling between civil and criminal concepts. More significantly, while the instructions as to the crimes charged followed the model jury charges, the judge failed to mold those charges to include the facts of the case or to adapt them where necessary to those facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">Lid. at 36, 730 A.2d 376.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">In circumstances more similar to those here, the California Court of Appeals held that it was reversible error to instruct a jury considering charges of embezzlement against an attorney on the state\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct with respect to attorney trust accounts. <em>People v. Stein, </em>94 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>235, 156 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>299, 302-03 (1979). The defendant in <em>Stein </em>was charged with eighteen counts of grand theft by embezzlement, based on allegations that he \u201cwillfully and unlawfully took money entrusted to him by six separate clients such that [his] trust account had a deficit balance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. Stein wrote checks on the trust account to satisfy personal expenses when the balance was insufficient to meet the proven claims of clients. <em>Ibid. </em>His trust account had been overdrawn fourteen times in a two-year period; howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>er, he maintained that he was unaware of the shortage until a later date, although he continued to write checks on the accounts once he knew. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Stein denied that he ever \u201cintentionally\u201d took client trust money for his own uses. <em>Id. </em>at 302. Both sides presented expert witnesses on the accepted methods of handling client trust accounts, and the California State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct pertaining to trust accounts. <em>Ibid. </em>The jury was instructed that evidence presented <em>\u2018\u201ctending </em>to show that the defendant <em>may have violated </em>\u2019 the applicable rules ... may be considered \u2018only insofar as it <em>may tend </em>to prove that the defendant possessed the specific intent required____\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">[I]t was improper to use the professional rules of conduct to show that a violation of the rules, if any, would tend to prove that defendant possessed the specific intent required when, in fact, the violation of the rules, if any, could have occurred without any criminal intent. Even though the instructions did not presume a violation of the rules, the only reasonable inference that the jury could have drawn was that evidence of a violation was in fact evidence establishing the required intent to commit the crimes charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The <em>Stein </em>court found that the evidence failed to meet the general test for relevancy of indirect evidence because evidence of a violation of the rules \u201cdoes not tend logically, naturally and by reasonable inference to prove or disprove the state of mind (specific intent) of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The embezzlement charge required proof of \u201cthe intent unlawfully to deprive the owner of the property or \u2018devote the same to his own use.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303 (quoting 21 <em>Cal. Jur.3d (1975) Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 2258, p. 377; Perkins, <em>Criminal Law, </em>(2d ed.1969) pp. 292-93).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Turning our attention to the matter before us, the problem here was that the jury was provided with the text of a complex rule of professional accounting standards without any instructions on the relevance of the Rule to the issues before it. At no point was the jury instructed on which aspects of the Rule were relevant, to what issues, or how the Rule could assist the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>jury in reaching its decision. The court made no effort to assist the jury in distinguishing between the state of mind that established the violation of an ethical rule, and the level of criminal intent necessary to establish guilt with respect to a crime. The effect of the trial judge\u2019s one-sentence admonition was negligible in comparison to the prosecutor\u2019s extensive cross-examination and summation comments, which urged the jury to focus on the Rule\u2019s requirements and defendant\u2019s bookkeeping practices as indicative of his criminal behavior. We are thus compelled to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We would be remiss, however, if we failed to give some guidance to the trial courts as to the proper use of the Rule in the context of a criminal trial. <em>Rule </em>1:21-6 is, at its essence, a rule of accounting made particularly applicable to lawyers by virtue of the Supreme Court\u2019s plenary constitutional authority to regulate the practice of law. The Rule describes, in great detail, the record-keeping requirements of both the lawyer\u2019s business accounts and trust accounts, where clients\u2019 funds are kept by the lawyer for a particular purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">With respect to trust accounts, the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">Our prior cases dearly establish that shoddy bookkeeping alone does not suffice for a finding of knowing misappropriation. Although an attorney\u2019s records may reveal repeated and frequent instances of being out of trust, that circumstance does not necessarily constitute <em>knowing </em>misappropriation. Poor accounting procedures, however, \u201care no excuse for using client\u2019s funds. It is no defense for lawyers to design an accounting system that prevents them from knowing whether they are using clients\u2019 trust funds. Lawyers have a duty to assure that their accounting practices are sufficient to prevent misappropriation of trust funds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\"><em>[In Re Davis, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>118, 127, 603 A.2d 12 (1992) (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">In the context of a disciplinary case, however, an attorney\u2019s subjective intent is irrelevant. That is, once he makes improper use of client funds, it does not matter whether he intended to \u201cborrow\u201d or to permanently keep the funds. <em>In Re Irizarry, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>189, 192, 661 A.2d 275 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Here, by contrast, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant engaged in \u201cpurposeful\u201d conduct. In this context, shoddy recordkeeping, in violation of the Rule\u2019s requirements, may be invoked by defendant to negate the requisite mental state. Such a defense, however, can also be wielded as a sword by the State. It is entirely proper for the State to argue that this defense is purely pretextual, a clever attempt by defendant to conceal his true criminal purpose behind a fagade of incompetence and outright defiance of his ethical obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Confronted by these competing characterizations, it is the court\u2019s obligation to guide the jury in its search for the truth. Proper jury instructions in this area must begin by emphasizing that the State bears the burden of proving defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to each and every element of the crime. This burden is not diminished or transferred to defendant because he may have committed an ethical violation. The jury must be told that the accounting practices delineated in the Rule are relevant to determining defendant\u2019s state of mind, because they placed defendant on notice as to what was expected of him when he became the custodian of client funds. But, that is not the end of the jury\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">A violation of the Rule\u2019s requirements, in and of itself, is insufficient, as a matter of law, to sustain a finding of criminal culpability. However, together with any other evidence in the case, a jury may consider a violation of the Rule\u2019s requirements as evidence of defendant\u2019s purposeful conduct. The more egregious the violation, the greater its probative value is in assisting the jury in this determination. An extended pattern of conduct, displaying an utter disregard for the Rule\u2019s requirements, would have more probative value than an isolated incident of bad accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Defendant argues that denying him admission to the PTI program was a gross abuse of discretion and clear error of judgment, because the prosecutor failed to consider all the rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>vant facts and erroneously determined that defendant was presumptively ineligible under PTI Guideline 3(i)(4). Defendant contends that the prosecutor erroneously concluded that his status as an attorney meant that his crime involved a breach of public trust. He argues that the exclusion did not apply to him, because he was not a \u201cpublic official\u201d within the meaning of the PTI guidelines. We disagree. Given the facts of this case, the prosecutor\u2019s interpretation of Guideline 3(i)(4) was a proper exercise of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">On June 20, 2000, the Union County Prosecutor wrote to June Loughrey of the Union County Pre-Trial Intervention Program to object to defendant\u2019s admission to PTI: \u201cThis will confirm our telephone conversation that the above-referenced summonses charge Mr. Mahoney with two counts of third degree theft and two counts of third degree forgery. Notwithstanding same, this Office objects to Mr. Mahoney\u2019s admission into the Pre-Trial Intervention Program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">On August 8, 2000, defendant was sent a notice of rejection with an \u201cAddendum/Update\u201d from Marquita Sweet, a PTI team leader, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">REJECTION: GUIDELINE 3(i)-4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">YOUR OFFENSES, THEFT BY FAILURE TO MAKE REQUIRED DISPOSITION, MISAPPLICATION OF ENTRUSTED PROPERTY AND TWO COUNTS OF FORGERY WERE A BREACH OF PUBLIC TRUST, WHICH CONSTITUTES GROUNDS FOR REJECTION UNDER PTI GUIDELINES FOR OPERATION. IN DECEMBER 1998 YOU WERE HIRED TO REPRESENT THE VICTIMS IN A WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT REGARDING THE DEATH OF THEIR SON AS A RESULT OF A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT. AS A LAWYER AND LONGTIME FRIEND OF THE VICTIMS YOU WERE ENTRUSTED TO BE THE FIDUCIARY OF FUNDS RECEIVED FROM THIS LAWSUIT. INSTEAD WHEN YOU RECEIVED THE SETTLEMENT CHECK FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY ($75,000), YOU FORGED THEIR SIGNATURES AND DEPOSITED THE CHECK INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU THEN WROTE THREE CHECKS, TOTALING $50,000, (THE VICTIM\u2019S SHARE) AGAINST THE BALANCE TO PAY FOR UNAUTHORIZED EXPENSES. FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR YOU LIED TO THE VICTIMS, PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION AS TO THE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>STATUS OF THE CHECK AND WHEN THEY WOULD RECEIVE THEIR SHARE OF THE MONEY. BANK ACCOUNT RECORDS REVEAL THAT YOUR BALANCE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE AMOUNT OWED TO THE VICTIMS OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME. THE VICTIMS DID NOT RECEIVE THEIR MONEY UNTIL 12-31-99 ALTHOUGH YOU DEPOSITED THE CHECK ON 1-20-99. YOU INDICATED THAT ALL THE MONIES HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE VICTIMS, HOWEVER, PTI NOTES THAT THIS DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION WAS COMMENCED BY THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S OFFICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE OFFENSE FAR OUTWEIGHS THE POSITIVE REHABILITATIVE FACTORS WHICH MIGHT BE PRESENT IN YOUR CASE. ACCEPTANCE INTO THE PTI PROGRAM WOULD DEPRECATE THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE OFFENSE. YOU ARE A LAWYER WHO WAS ENTRUSTED TO REPRESENT YOUR CLIENTS\u2019 BEST INTERESTS, AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A 20 YEAR FRIENDSHIP, AS WELL AS YOUR POSITION AS THEIR LEGAL ADVISOR DURING A VERY TRAUMATIC AND STRESSFUL TIME. THE VICTIMS TOTALLY RELIED UPON YOU TO DIRECT THEM AND YOU EXPLOITED THE SITUATION AND CONTINUED THIS MOCKERY FOR OVER 10 MONTHS. YOU STOLE MONEY FROM YOUR FORMER CLIENTS AND USED \"LEGAL\u201d EXCUSES AS TO WHY YOU COULD NOT DISBURSE THE MONEY. THIS SUBSTANTIATES A BREACH OF PUBLIC TRUST OF THE OFFICE YOU WERE SWORN TO UPHOLD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">FURTHERMORE, YOU MINIMIZED YOUR INVOLVEMENT. YOU DID NOT ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF YOUR CLIENTS BY YOUR DEMONSTRATED BEHAVIOR. YOU LESSEN YOUR INVOLVEMENT BY CLAIMING THAT THE VICTIMS DID NOT CALL \u201cTO DEMAND THEIR MONIES\u201d, BUT INSTEAD WOULD \u201cOFTEN CALL TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE CASE\u201d. YOUR PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE SHOULD HAVE ALERTED YOU THAT THE VICTIMS WERE INQUIRING ABOUT THEIR MONIES TO WHICH THEY WERE CLEARLY ENTITLED. THIS KIND OF PROFESSIONAL BRASHNESS CANNOT BE TOLERATED BY SOCIETY AND DISTINCTLY WARRANTS A REJECTION OF YOUR CASE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Although not entirely clear from the record, it appears that the prosecutor adopted the August 8, 2000 letter from the PTI team leader. In rejecting defendant\u2019s challenge, the trial court accepted the prosecutor\u2019s position that defendant was presumptively excluded from PTI because he had been charged with offenses involving a breach of public trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Application for PTI is initially made to the criminal division manager who conducts an evaluation and makes a recommen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>dation to the prosecutor. <em>R. </em>3:28(h). In conducting their evaluations, the director and the prosecutor must consider the factors set forth in both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12 and <em>R. </em>3:28, Guideline 3. No crimes are per se excluded from enrollment in PTI. <em>State v. Brooks, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>215, 224, 814 A.2d 1051 (2002). Any defendant charged with a crime is eligible. <em>R. </em>3:28, Guideline 2. However, Guideline 3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">[T]he nature of the offense is a factor to be considered in reviewing the application. <em>If the crime was </em>(1) part of organized criminal activity; or (2) part of a continuing criminal business or enterprise; or (3) deliberately committed with violence or threat of violence against another person; or (4) <em>a breach of the public trust where admission to a PTI program would deprecate the seriousness of defendant\u2019s crime, the defendant\u2019s application should generally be rejected.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">[R. 3:28, Guideline 3(i) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The public policy and statutory scheme of the PreTrial Intervention program is set forth at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-12 and\u2014 13, supplemented by guidelines adopted by the Supreme Court pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-14. The purpose of PTI is to augment the options afforded a prosecutor in disposing of criminal matters. <em>Brooks, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 223, 814 A.2d 1051. A prosecutor\u2019s decision with respect to a PTI application is entitled to great deference. <em>State v. Baynes, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>434, 443, 690 A.2d 594 (1997). In particular, a prosecutor\u2019s rejection of an applicant \u201cwill rarely be overturned\u201d by a court. <em>Brooks, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 225, 814 A.2d 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">A defendant seeking to overturn a prosecutor\u2019s rejection must establish \u201cclearly and convincingly\u201d that the prosecutor\u2019s decision amounted to a \u201cpatent and gross abuse of ... discretion.\u201d <em>Baynes, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 444, 690 A.2d 594 (quoting <em>State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 582, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996)). The standard is met if defendant can \u201cshow that the prosecutor\u2019s decision failed to consider all relevant factors, was based on irrelevant or inappropriate factors, or constituted a \u2018clear error in judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Nwobu, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>236, 247, 652 A.2d 1209 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The concept of a \u201cclear error in judgment\u201d is akin to the standard where the judicial conscience is \u201cshocked\u201d by the patent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ly unreasonable application of guidelines to the particular facts of a case. <em>Id. </em>at 253-54, 652 A.2d 1209. The decision must be one that \u201ccould not have reasonably been made upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 652 A.2d 1209 (quoting <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 366, 471 A.2d 370 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Because the issue of whether a prosecutor has exercised his or her discretion based on inappropriate factors is a question of law, <em>Nwobu, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 247, 652 A.2d 1209, upon a finding of clear prosecutorial error, a court may order that defendant be directly admitted into PTI. <em>State v. DeMarco, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>562, 567, 527 A.2d 417 (1987). In addition, \u201cif a reviewing court finds that a prosecutor\u2019s decision was arbitrary, irrational, or otherwise an abuse of discretion, although not a patent and gross abuse, and if the court is satisfied that the remand will serve a useful purpose, it may send the case back to the prosecutor.\u201d <em>State v. Kern, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 439-40, 739 A.2d 969 (App.Div. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">However, a reviewing court must avoid substituting its judgment for that of the prosecutor. <em>Nwobu, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 254, 652 A.2d 1209. Moreover, a trial court proceeding on a PTI application \u201cshould not constitute a trial <em>de novo </em>on the applicant\u2019s admissibility, but should be confined to a <em>review </em>of the prosecutor\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>360, 383, 375 A.2d 607 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Here, defendant is charged with crimes that involved an abuse of his authority to establish and maintain his trust account for the exclusive purpose of safeguarding client funds. That authority flows directly from the constitutional power of the Supreme Court to grant to the lawyer a license to practice law. A lawyer assumes this custodial role as an incident of his or her status as an officer of the court. In this capacity, a lawyer\u2019s interactions with the public carry the imprimatur of the court, and the public\u2019s faith and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>confidence in the lawyer\u2019s integrity is inextricably linked to and derived from this official relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Chief Justice Wilentz eloquently explained the historical basis for the public\u2019s view of the lawyer as holding a position of special trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">Having sought his advice and relying on his expertise, the client entrusts the lawyer with the transaction \u2014 including the handling of the client\u2019s funds. Whether it be a real estate closing, the establishment of a trust, the purchase of a business, the investment of funds, the receipt of proceeds of litigation, or any one of a multitude of other situations, it is commonplace that the work of lawyers involves possession of their clients\u2019 funds. That possession is sometimes expedient, occasionally simply customary, but usually essential. Whatever the need may be for the lawyer\u2019s handling of clients\u2019 money, the client permits it because he trusts the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">It is a trust built on centuries of honesty and faithfulness. Sometimes it is reinforced by personal knowledge of a particular lawyer\u2019s integrity or a firm\u2019s reputation. The underlying faith, however, is in the legal profession, the bar as an institution. No other explanation can account for clients\u2019 customary willingness to entrust their funds to relative strangers simply because they are lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\"><em>[In re Wilson, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>451, 454-55, 409 A.2d 1153 (1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">We find further support for the prosecutor\u2019s position in <em>State v. Bender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>84, 402 A.2d 217 (1979). The facts in <em>Bender </em>involved a pharmacist who became addicted to cocaine. He diverted quantities of drugs from the stock of the pharmacy where he was employed to maintain his supply of the illicit drug. <em>Id. </em>at 90, 402 A.2d 217. The prosecutor in that case applied Guideline 3(i)(4) to reject defendant\u2019s PTI application, concluding that Bender held a position of public trust by virtue of being a licensed pharmacist.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">In reversing the prosecutor\u2019s decision, the Court made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">We also cannot accept the State\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s crime constituted \u201ca breach of the public trust.\u201d Guideline 3(i)(4). It is true that in issuing a license, the State entrusts a pharmacist with the dispensing of controlled dangerous substances in order that the health and welfare of the public not be undermined through indiscriminate and unsupervised consumption of drugs. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-1 <em>et seq. </em>Whether this \u201centrusting\u201d is sufficient to make a pharmacist not employed by the State a \u201cpublic trustee\u201d under Guideline 3(i)(4) is a difficult question which we need not here address. For even assuming that a pharmacist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>can be so characterized, the crimes here charged would not constitute a breach of that trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s cocaine diversions were not intended to nor did they cause injury to the public in general or to any particular segment thereof. The cocaine was personally consumed, not distributed to third parties. Only defendant, himself, and his immediate employer were victimized. Thus, although defendant\u2019s crimes were made possible by his status as a licensed pharmacist, those crimes did not breach the trust reposed in him to protect the citizenry at large.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 96, 402 A.2d 217 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">By contrast, defendant\u2019s crimes here directly involved use of his authority as a lawyer to cause harm to his clients. He took advantage of \u201cthe trust reposed in him\u201d to misappropriate his clients\u2019 funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">We thus conclude our discussion of this issue by emphasizing that, although defendant\u2019s status as a lawyer does not operate as a per se impediment for consideration for enrollment into PTI, we are satisfied that the trial court correctly determined that defendant failed to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the prosecutor\u2019s application of the presumption of ineligibility articulated in Guideline 3(i)(4) constituted a patent abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed based on the trial court\u2019s improper limitation of character witness testimony, inadequate jury instructions on the use of <em>Rule </em>1:21-6, and the prosecutor\u2019s inappropriate remarks during summation. The matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-9\"> Defendant was temporarily suspended from the practice of law on March 16, 2000. The record does not indicate whether the suspension remains in effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
