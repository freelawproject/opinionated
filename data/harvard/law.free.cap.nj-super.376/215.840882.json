The issue presented by this appeal is whether the holder of an insurance policy with an insolvent insurance company, with policy limits in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>excess of $300,000, is personally liable for any judgment in excess of the Association\u2019s $300,000 maximum liability. We conclude that in the absence of any statutory provision expressly exempting a policyholder from such liability, the Guaranty Act should be construed to afford an injured party the right to recover any damages in excess of the Association\u2019s maximum liability directly from the policyholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">On May 7, 1999, as he was getting out of his tow truck on a street in Jersey City, plaintiff Frederick Johnson was hit by a truck owned and operated by defendant Willie Braddy. As a result of this accident, plaintiff suffered severe injuries, including trauma to his left leg that required amputation above the knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">At the time of the accident, Braddy was an \u201cowner-operator\u201d performing trucking services for defendant Walsh Trucking, a large North Jersey trucking company. In accordance with Interstate Commerce Commission regulations, Walsh maintained an insurance policy issued by Reliance Insurance Company, with limits of $1,000,000, and an umbrella policy issued by AIG, with limits of $25,000,000,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provided coverage to both Walsh and its drivers including Braddy.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Subsequent to plaintiffs accident, Reliance was declared insolvent and placed into liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Plaintiff filed this action in 2001. After being notified of Reliance\u2019s insolvency, the trial court entered a consent order that dismissed plaintiffs complaint, subject to restoration after disposition of plaintiffs claim for uninsured motorist benefits under his own insurance policy. Plaintiffs insurer awarded him $300,000, which was the full amount of his uninsured motorist coverage, and his complaint against Braddy and Walsh was then reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Braddy and Walsh filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of plaintiffs complaint on the theory they could not be subject to personal liability for any damages in excess of the $300,000 maximum coverage provided by the Guaranty Association, which plaintiff had already recovered under his own policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The trial court concluded in an oral opinion that the $300,000 statutory limit on recovery from the Association is solely \u201ca limit on the amount of funds available to a plaintiff from the Association\u2019s coffers, not a limit on the total amount of damages a plaintiff may recover.\u201d The court reasoned that because New Jersey\u2019s public policy favors compensating victims of automobile accidents, any adverse financial consequences of insolvency of the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company should be borne by the tortfeasor rather than the injured party. Therefore, the court denied defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">We granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal because of the conflict between the trial court\u2019s decision in this case and the published opinion in <em>Flaherty v. Safran, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 843 A.2d 1198 (Law Div.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The essential objective of the Guaranty Act is \u201cto minimize financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-2(a). To achieve this objective, the Act establishes the Guaranty Association and requires all insurers who write insurance to which the Act applies, which includes all forms of motor vehicle coverage, see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-2(b), to be members, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-6, and authorizes the Association to collect assessments from members sufficient to pay covered claims of insolvent insurers, <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:30A-8(a)(3). See <em>Carpenter Tech. Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>504, 508-09, 800 A.2d 54 (2002). This legislation \u201cis patterned after a model bill prepared under the auspices of the National Association of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Insurance Commissioners ... and thereafter adopted in varying forms by almost every state.\u201d <em>R.R. Roofing &amp; Bldg. Supply Co. v. Fin. Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 85 N.J. </em>384, 391, 427 A.2d 66 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The Guaranty Association is liable for the limits of liability stated in the policy of the insolvent insurer, subject to a maximum of $300,000. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-8(a)(1). Thus, if a policyholder\u2019s coverage is less than $300,000, the Association\u2019s liability is limited to the amount of that coverage, but if the policyholder\u2019s coverage under the policy issued by the insolvent insurer is more than $300,000, the Association\u2019s liability is capped at $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The Guaranty Act does not explicitly address whether a policyholder remains personally liable for any damages in excess of the Association\u2019s $300,000 maximum liability. The question, therefore, is whether the Act reflects an implicit legislative intent to immunize a policyholder from liability for such damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The basic policy of our law is to allow an injured party to recover the full amount of his or her damages from the tortfeasor. <em>See Patusco v. Prince Macaroni, Inc., </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>365, 368, 235 A.2d 465 (1967). Thus, if a plaintiffs damages exceed the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance coverage, the tortfeasor remains personally liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the excess. <em>See Longworth v. Van Houten, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 188-86, 538 A.2d 414 (App.Div.1988). Moreover, in furtherance of this policy, statutes mandating insurance coverage are liberally construed to provide the broadest possible protection to injured parties. <em>See Motor Club of Am. Ins. Co. v. Phillips, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>277, 293, 330 A.2d 360 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In view of our State\u2019s strong public policy of affording injured parties an opportunity to recover the full amount of their damages, we believe that if the Legislature had intended to immunize tortfeasors from liability for damages in excess of the Guaranty Association\u2019s $300,000 maximum liability, it would have included a provision in the Guaranty Act expressly stating this intent. The general statement of a legislative purpose \u201cto minimize financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:30A-2(a), 'cannot reasonably be construed as an expression of legislative intent to favor policyholders over claimants by immunizing policyholders from liability for damages in excess of the Association\u2019s $300,000 maximum liability. Where either an innocent injured party or a tortfeasor must bear the adverse financial consequences of the insolvency of the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer and the $300,000 limit on the Association\u2019s liability, it is more reasonable to infer a legislative intent to favor the injured party. <em>Cf. R.R. Roofing, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 389, 427 A.2d 66 (noting that the Guaranty Act \u201cprovide[s] some protection to policyholders of insurance companies which become insolvent.\u201d) (emphasis added). This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that, without enactment of the Guaranty Act, the holder of an insurance policy with an insolvent insurer would have been personally liable for the full amount of any damages caused by the policyholder\u2019s tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In support of their argument that they should not be held personally liable for any of plaintiffs damages, defendants rely primarily upon the reported Law Division opinion in <em>Flaherty, supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 843 A.2d 1198, which held that a tortfeasor insured by an insolvent insurer under a policy with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>limits in excess of the Guaranty Association\u2019s $300,000 maximum liability is not personally responsible for any recovery above that amount. <em>Flaherty </em>heavily relied upon our opinions in <em>Hendricks v. A.J. Ross Co., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>243, 247-48, 556 A.2d 1267 (App.Div.1989) and <em>Lehmann v. O\u2019Brien, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 248-49, 573 A.2d 171 (App.Div.1989), which held that a tortfeasor may not be held personally liable for prejudgment interest that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-5(d) exempts the Association from paying. <em>Contra Wilton v. Cycle Trucking Inc., </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 328-29, 573 A.2d 462 (App.Div.1989). However, there is a significant distinction between the issue presented in <em>Hendricks </em>and <em>Lehmann </em>and the issue in this appeal. One of the rationales for the award of prejudgment interest in tort cases is to discourage delay and \u201cinduce prompt defense consideration of settlement possibilities.\u201d <em>Busik v. Levine, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>351, 359, 307 A.2d 571 (1973). Where a claim is covered by the Guaranty Act and consequently the Association controls the defense, the tortfeasor has no control over the timing of settlement negotiations or any responsibility for delay in disposition of the case. Therefore, this rationale for prejudgment interest would not support imposition of this obligation upon the tortfeasor for a claim payable by the Association. Furthermore, the obligation to pay prejudgment interest is derivative of the obligation to pay the judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 358-61, 307 A.2d 571. Consequently, it would be incongruous to impose liability for payment of the judgment on the Association but to impose liability for prejudgment interest on the tortfeasor. For these reasons, it is reasonable to infer that in exempting the Association from liability for prejudgment interest, the Legislature did not intend to transfer this liability to the tortfeasor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, as previously discussed, there is no comparable basis for inferring a legislative intent to exempt a tortfeasor from liability for damages in excess of the $300,000 limit on the Association\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>We recognize that part of the rationale in <em>Hendricks </em>and <em>Lehmann </em>for concluding that a tortfeasor should not be held liable for prejudgment interest was our view that <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:30A-5(d) \u201creflects a general legislative policy to avoid imposition of liability upon an insured for claims which may not be pursued against the Association,\u201d <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 248, 573 A.2d 171; <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 247, 556 A.2d 1267, and that <em>Flaherty </em>relied upon this interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-5(d), 367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 569-70, 843 A.2d 1198. However, upon further review, we now conclude that this interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:30A-5(d) was too broad. The part of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-5(d) that we relied upon in <em>Hendricks </em>and <em>Lehmann </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\"><em>\u201cCovered claim\u201d shall not include: (1) any amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise; provided, that a claim for any such amount, </em>asserted against a person insured under a policy issued by an insurer which has become an insolvent insurer, which, if it were not a claim by or for the benefit of a reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association, would be a \u201ccovered claim,\u201d <em>may be filed directly with the receiver of the insolvent insurer, </em>but in no event may any <em>such claim </em>be asserted in any legal action against the insured of such insolvent insurer____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We believe that, properly construed, this part of <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:30A-5(d) only addresses claims for \u201cany amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association,\u201d and that the term \u201csuch claim\u201d in the final clause, upon which we relied in <em>Hendricks </em>and <em>Lehmann, </em>refers solely to a claim for \u201cany amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association.\u201d <em>See Sussman v. Ostroff, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>306, 311-15, 556 A.2d 1301 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>143, 564 A.2d 865 (1989). Therefore, this clause does not reflect a general legislative policy to exempt tortfeasors insured by insolvent insurance companies from any claim that may not be pursued against the Guaranty Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Because our conclusion that the holder of an insurance policy with limits in excess of the Guaranty Association\u2019s $300,000 maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>mum liability is liable for the amount of any judgment in excess of that amount is inconsistent with <em>Flaherty, </em>we overrule <em>Flaherty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\"> AIG's liability for any judgment in excess of $1,000,000 coverage provided by the Reliance policy is not in issue in this appeal. The only question is whether Braddy and Walsh are personally liable for the amount of any judgment in excess of $300,000 up to $1,000,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-12(b) provides that the amount otherwise payable under the Guaranty Act shall be reduced by the amount payable under any other insurance policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\"> There are only a limited number of cases in other states dealing with this issue, which reach <em>conflicting results. An intermediate appellate court in </em>Minnesota held that a tortfeasor is not personally liable for the award of any judgment in excess of the limit of the guaranty association's liability, but its opinion is conclusionary and does not contain any analysis of the relevant statutory provisions. <em>Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. v. H &amp; W Motor Express Co., </em>507 N.W.2d 622, 624 (Minn.Ct.App.1993). The Pennsylvania courts have held that a tortfeasor insured by an insolvent insurer remains liable for any judgment in excess of the guaranty association's maximum liability, <em>see Burke v. Valley Lines, Inc., </em>421 <em>Pa.Super. </em>362, 617 A.2d 1335, 1339 n. 5 (1992); <em>Osborne v. Neville, </em>65 <em>Pa. D. &amp; C. </em>4th 225, 238-45 (Ct.Com.Pl.2004), but only the trial court opinion in <em>Osborne </em>contains any discussion of the issue. A number of decisions in other states also suggest, without dealing directly with the issue, that the tortfeasor remains liable for the amount of any judgment in excess of the guaranty association's limit of liability. <em>See, e.g., Washington Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Ramsey, </em>922 P.2d 237, 246 (Alaska 1996); <em>Gygax v. Brugoto, </em>674 So.2d 366 (La.Ct.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>679 So.2d 107 (La.1996); <em>Carrier v. Hicks, </em>316 <em>Or. </em>341, 851 P.2d 581, 586 n. 5 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\"> Neither <em>Hendricks </em>nor <em>Lehmann </em>considered a tortfeasor\u2019s liability for prejudgment interest on the part of any judgment in excess of the $300,000 limit on the Association\u2019s liability. We also express no view on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
