He had initially been charged with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3e (the fourth-degree offense of knowingly placing a call to 9-1-1 without the purpose of reporting the need for 9-1-1 services), which the prosecutor downgraded to harassment. The Law Division judge sentenced defendant to time served, which was three days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">On appeal, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">I.

THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION FORBIDS CRIMINAL SANCTIONS FOR [DEFENDANTfS EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">We agree that defendant\u2019s venting of his frustration to the 9-1-1 police dispatcher in crude terms over what he regarded as an improper roadblock, though constituting impolite and rude behavior, did not evidence \u201ca purpose to harass another\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4. Accordingly, because we are satisfied the record does not support a finding of harassment, beyond a reasonable doubt, we need not address the constitutional challenges asserted by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Early in the afternoon of August 4, 2002, the Mt. Olive Township police conducted a routine inspection detail on westbound Route 46 near the Budd Lake firehouse. Motorists were directed to merge into one lane as they approached the point of inspection; this slowed the approaching traffic to approximately five to fifteen miles per hour. If the officers witnessed a motor vehicle violation, they directed the violator into the firehouse parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Defendant was driving westbound on Route 46 in the early afternoon hours of August 4, 2002, when he became angered by the presence of the inspection detail. Defendant testified he was following shortly behind an ambulance transporting his eighty-nine-year-old aunt, who had just broken her hip, to a hospital and became upset that what he regarded as an improper roadblock would delay his arrival at the hospital. Defendant pulled over to a pay phone at the nearby Equity Plaza, where, at approximately 1:14 p.m., he called the 9-1-1 emergency number to express his displeasure. Defendant claimed he called that number, rather than the direct line for the Mt. Olive Police, because he did not have a quarter. Dispatcher Andrea Reisen answered the call, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">BEGINNING OF CALL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">REISEN: 9-1-1, where is your emergency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">DEFENDANT: Is this the Mount Olive Police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">REISEN: What is the emergency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">DEPENDANT: I\u2019m trying to get to the hospital to reach my mother <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and you mother fuckers have got a road block on 46. You got nothing better to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">REISEN: Excuse me, sir, I can\u2019t hear you.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-13\">DEFENDANT: I\u2019m trying to get to my mother. It\u2019s an emergency. I\u2019m trying to get to the hospital. I got to wait in a fucking line because you have a fucking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>road block on 46 chasing, looking at tags. You pricks don\u2019t have anything better to do? What is this, a fucking Nazi police state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">REISEN: I\u2019m sorry, sir, I can\u2019t hear you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">DEFENDANT: You can hear me just fucking fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">REISEN: Sir, do you need help?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">END OF CALL</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Reisen traced the call to the pay phone defendant used and radioed Sergeant Michael Pocquat, a member of the inspection detail, to respond to the scene. Patrol Officer Amy Clymer, another member of the inspection detail, heard Reisen\u2019s radio call, looked toward Equity Plaza, and observed defendant on the pay phone. Clymer observed defendant hang up the pay phone, get into a white car, and drive onto westbound Route 46. Clymer radioed Patrolman Luis Sanchez who pursued and stopped defendant\u2019s car. When questioned by Sanchez, defendant initially denied being at Equity Plaza and making the 9-1-1 call and claimed that he was coming from a friend\u2019s house and was headed to the mall. When Sanchez advised defendant for a second time that his description matched the description of the person who had made the call, defendant admitted making the call. Sanchez testified in municipal court that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">rambled on for one or two minutes, saying that we were fucking Nazis, what are we doing stopping cars, searching cars, conducting a roadblock in the State of New Jersey. We had no right to do that. He wanted to speak to the Attorney General. Just rambled on for several minutes____[H]e continued with[,] you know[,] cursing in regards to being Nazis ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">Sanchez had defendant follow him back to the inspection detail to speak with Pocquat. Defendant admitted to Pocquat he made the 9-1-1 call, claiming he was upset at being delayed on his trip to the hospital. Pocquat testified that when he asked defendant why he further delayed his trip to make the 9-1-1 call and berate the dispatcher, defendant swore at Pocquat and asserted that he \u201cwas living in a Nazi state.\u201d Pocquat let defendant leave the scene to avoid a confrontation but advised defendant he would review the tape of his 9-1-1 call upon returning to police headquarters and would contact defendant at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>After reviewing the tape of defendant\u2019s 9-1-1 call, Pocquat signed a complaint charging defendant with misuse of the 9-1-1 emergency service in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3e. The Morris County Prosecutor downgraded the charge to the petty-disorderly offense of harassment in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4a, and it was tried before the Mt. Olive Township Municipal Court. Defendant was convicted on March 29, 2004. He was sentenced to thirty days imprisonment in county jail, a $1,000 f\u00edne, and various financial assessments. The municipal judge denied a stay of sentence pending appeal. Defendant appealed to the Superior Court, Law Division pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:23. He served three days in jail before being released, pending his appeal, by order of the Law Division judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In a de novo trial, the Law Division judge entered a judgment of conviction. He found that defendant had made an anonymous communication in offensively coarse language in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4a. He further found that defendant made a communication</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">at, extremely inconvenient hours only because it\u2019s a 9-1-1 line. That\u2019s an emergent line, which is set aside for emergent calls. Any non-emergent call is made at an inconvenient time, and ties up not only the person that receives it, but also the dispatcher, who can no longer address other 911 calls.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The court sentenced defendant to time served, a $400 fine, and statutorily mandated monetary fees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">All of the issues raised by defendant are issues of law. \u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty v. Manalapan Tp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230, 1237 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The relevant portion of the harassment statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">[A] person commits a petty disorderly persons offense if, <em>mth purpose to harass </em>another, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>a. Makes, or causes to be made, a communication or communications anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language, or any other manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>20:33-4 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>our Supreme Court held that a violation of subsection (a) requires the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">(1) defendant made or caused to be made a communication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">(2) defendant\u2019s purpose in making or causing the communication to be made was to harass another person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">(3) the communication was in one of the specified manners or any other manner similarly likely to cause annoyance or alarm to its intended recipient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">[State <em>v. Hoffman, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>564, 576, 695 A.2d 236, 242 (1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">The harassment statute was enacted \u201cto make criminal, private annoyances that are not entitled to constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). \u201cThus, the substantive criminal offense proscribed by subsection (a) \u2018is directed at the purpose behind and motivation for\u2019 making or causing the communication to be made.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Mortimer, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>517, 528, 641 A.2d 257, 262 <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>970, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>440, 130 L.Ed.2d 351 (1994)). For defendant\u2019s conviction to stand, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, two distinct elements: defendant had the requisite intent to harass and he committed a \u201cfree-standing\u201d offense outlined in subsection (a) of the statute. <em>State v. Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 695 A.2d at 242; <em>Peterson v. Peterson, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>116, 123, 863 A.2d 1059, 1064 (App.Div.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">Defendant's call was clearly a \u201ccommunication\u201d within the meaning of the harassment statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-14q. \u201c[S]ub section (a) proscribes a single act of communicative conduct when its purpose is to harass.\u201d <em>State v. Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 580, 695 A.2d at 244. Moreover, it was \u201canonymous\u201d as defendant called from a pay phone and never identified himself. But for the fortuitous circumstance of the phone booth being within the officer\u2019s sight at the moment defendant completed his call, his identity probably would not have become known.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>We reject the Law Division judge\u2019s analysis and alternative finding that the call was made at \u201cextremely inconvenient hours\u201d under the harassment statute merely because it tied up the 9-1-1 line. As the State concedes, by its terms the 9-1-1 emergency line is a twenty-four hour service, thus there may not be an extremely inconvenient hour for a 9-1-1 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">It is clear from the record that defendant was angry because the police had delayed him. It is also undisputed that defendant expressed his opinion using profanity; in fact, he concedes his language was \u201ccrude\u201d and \u201cwould probably be deemed objectionable by those subscribing to conventional social norms.\u201d The State concedes, however, that profanity, standing alone, does not establish an intent to harass.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is equally true where the language is used in the context of an anonymous phone call. Anonymity or coarse language are necessary elements of the harassment statute but are only part of the picture. The critical element in resolving this case is whether the record supports, beyond a reasonable doubt, a purpose to harass.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">A finding that defendant acted with a purpose or intent to harass another is integral to a determination of harassment. <em>State v. Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 695 A.2d at 242; <em>Peterson v. Peterson, supra, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 123, 863 A.2d at 1063-64; <em>Bresocnik v. Gallegos, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 180, 183, 842 A.2d 276, 278 (App.Div.2004). Here, although the Law Division judge was apparently aware of the relevant law, he made no specific finding of a purpose to harass. He stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">in the sections [of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4] we note initially that the offense is directed at the purpose behind and motivation for making or causing communications to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>made. And a finding of harassment may be inferred from the evidence that\u2019s presented, and the approach is to be a common sense one just using experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">After this general reference to purpose, the judge proceeded directly to a discussion of the substantive conduct proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4a, i.e., communications that are anonymous, made at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language. In doing so, the judge inferred a purpose to harass merely because defendant committed one of the stand-alone offenses, thereby eviscerating the intent requirement as an independent statutory element. <em>See State v. Mortimer, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 536, 641 A.2d at 266-67 (\u201c With purpose to harass another\u2019 imposes a specific-intent requirement on subsection a, thereby clarifying the conduct that subsection a proscribes.\u201d); <em>State v. Finance American Corp., 182 N.J.Super. 33, 41, 440 A.2d 28, 32 </em>(App.Div.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u201cPurposeful\u201d or \u201cwith purpose\u201d is the highest form of <em>mens rea </em>contained in our penal code, and the most difficult to establish.</p>\n<p id=\"AkgU\">Our criminal statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">A person acts purposely with respect to the nature of his conduct or a result thereof if it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result. A person acts purposely with respect to attendant circumstances if he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they exist. \u201cWith purpose,\u201d \u201cdesigned,\u201d \u201cwith design\u201d or equivalent terms have the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-2b(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Although we can infer a finding of a \u201cpurpose to harass another\u201d \u201cfrom the evidence presented\u201d and from \u201ccommon sense and experience,\u201d <em>State v. Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 577, 695 A.2d at 242-43, the facts in the present case do not provide support for such a conclusion. It is clear that defendant did not intend to harass anyone. He testified he called 9-1-1 \u201cwith the very specific purpose of explaining [his] displeasure with what [he] considered] ... [the police department\u2019s] illegal activity\u201d of placing a roadblock on a major highway which slowed him down on the way to a hospital emergency. Defendant further explained, \u201cas coarse as it might be, my intention was not to call them a name ... [T]hat was used as an adjective.\u201d The record is bereft of any evidence, as urged by the State, that to retaliate for what he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>regarded as an unauthorized police delay, defendant called with a purpose to harass the police by tying up the 9-1-1 line with an anonymous phone call, refusing to state whether he was calling to report an emergency, berating the dispatcher and baiting the police to waste their time trying to find him. The State does not claim the obscenities were directed at the dispatcher or that defendant uttered the obscenities with the intent to harass her.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Nor does the dispatcher\u2019s reaction to defendant\u2019s communication in any way supply a basis to infer that defendant\u2019s purpose was to harass her. On the contrary, defendant\u2019s call was answered by a seven-year veteran police dispatcher who admitted being trained in dealing with people who are upset, anxious and distressed. The mere exposure to profanity, though irritating to many people, is not necessarily indicative of an intention to harass. The dispatcher described the phone call as \u2018Tjjust a man yelling and he was saying obscene words in reference to a traffic detail that was going on.\u201d Although she characterized the call as \u201cvery abusive,\u201d the dispatcher remained calm and collected and did not appear to be annoyed or distressed at any time throughout the call. When defendant disconnected the call, the dispatcher went about her business following the protocol of tracing the call and radioing a nearby officer to respond to the scene. <em>See State v. Frankel, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>586, 610, 847 A.2d 561, 575 <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>108, 160 L.Ed.2d 128 (2004) (\u201cPublic safety officials must respond to every open line 9-1-1 call as though a true emergency is unfolding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Based on these circumstances, we are convinced an inference cannot be drawn that defendant had the conscious intent to harass the dispatcher or, indirectly, the police officers involved in the roadblock. That is not to say that defendant\u2019s conduct was not impolite or vexatious, or that his repetitive use of what is commonly termed a \u201ccurse word\u201d was within socially recognized bounds of appropriate language. We are concerned, however, with the dangers of overextending a criminal statute to rude behavior which is not directed towards anyone specifically but only towards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>an institution in general. Defendant\u2019s mere venting of frustration or irritation at the situation is insufficient by itself to constitute harassment under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-14\"> Defendant testified he was following his aunt; the discrepancy is inconsequential.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-15\"> Dispatcher Reisen testified she could hear defendant.
