In it appellant, an Indian, was convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada on June 24, 1954, of a second degree murder of one Daisy Morgan (a 73 or 74 year old Indian woman) \u201cwithin Indian country\u201d near Reno, Nevada, in violation of Section 1111 of 18 U.S.C. Federal jurisdiction for the trial under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 is not questioned, since Daisy Morgan was killed in the Reno Indian Colony. There was no appeal from this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Appellant on April 5, 1954, pleaded guilty to an indictment hereafter described. On April 21, 1954, he withdrew this plea and pleaded not guilty. Appellant contends that he had nothing to do with the withdrawal of the guilty plea, and that the court not only set aside the plea, but dismissed the indictment, and hence there was no valid indictment in effect when he was tried. This contention is objectionably frivolous since the indictment dismissed is plainly one in a different case having a different number.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The indictment read in its pertinent part that Ornelas \u201cdid, with malice aforethought but without premeditation, murder Daisy Morgan.\u201d Ornelas contends that this indictment, with the statement that the murder was \u201cwithout premeditation\u201d and without alleging any <em>facts </em>constituting \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d as distinguished from premeditation, charged only second degree murder and that the court erred in requiring the trial to proceed as in a charge of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Nowhere does the record show that the prosecution advised Ornelas before the trial began that the \u201cmalice afore<em>thought\u201d </em>was the thought to commit \u201crape\u201d rather than the thought to commit robbery, burglary or arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">The indictment here involved is unique in form. No other court has had one before it, much less considered it under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1111(a) or its precedent statutes. In construing that act, the customary rule of strict construction in favor of the accused applies and if its words are capable of two constructions, that more favorable to him prevails. United States v. Resnick, 299 U.S. 207, 209, 57 S.Ct. 126, 81 L.Ed. 127; United States v. Halseth, 342 U.S. 277, 280, 72 S.Ct. 275, 96 L.Ed. 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">Likewise in determining the sufficiency of the indictment, the governing principles are summarized by the Supreme Court in Evans v. United States, 153 U.S. 584, 14 S.Ct. 934, 38 L.Ed. 830. There it holds with respect to criminal pleading that under United States v. Carll, 105 U.S. 611, 612, 26 L.Ed. 1135, an indictment must \u201c \u2018fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished.\u2019 \u201d [153 U.S. 584, 14 S. Ct. 936.] Continuing, the Evans case states, 153 U.S. at page 587, 14 S.Ct. at page 936: \u201cThe crime must be charged with precision and certainty, and every ingredient of which it is composed must be accurately and clearly alleged. United States v. Cook, 17 Wall. [168] 174, [21 L.Ed. 538]; United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 558 [23 L.Ed. 588], \u2018The fact that the statute in question, read in the light of the common law, and of other statutes on the like matter, enables the court to infer the intent of the legislature, does not dispense with the necessity of alleging in the indictment all the facts necessary to bring the case within that intent.\u2019 United States v. Carll, 105 U.S. 611 [26 L.Ed. 1135].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1111(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5t\">\u201cMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice afore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>thought. Every murder perpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effect the death of any human being other than him who is killed, is murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">\u201cAny other murder is murder in the second degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The first sentence of the statute, \u201cMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought\u201d is as much applicable to second degree murder as first degree murder. Fisher v. United States, 328 U.S. 463, 472-473, 66 S.Ct. 1318, 90 L.Ed. 1382. The next phrase of the statute describing \u201cpremeditated\u201d killings is specifically excluded by the words of the indictment \u201cwithout premeditation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Hence to constitute first degree murder the facts of the succeeding phrase of the statute must exist, namely, that the killing was \u201ccommitted in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, burglary, or robbery\u201d. Under the statement of the law in the Evans ease, here the indictment did not \u201c \u2018fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished.\u2019 \u201d In fact, the indictment did not \u201cset forth\u201d <em>any one </em>of the elements necessary to charge first degree murder where there is no premeditation \u2014 i. e., arson, rape, burglary, or robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">We do not agree with the contention upon which the court below based its decision, namely, that the \u201cterms premeditation and malice aforethought\u201d are synonymous. If this were so the express elimination of \u201cpremeditation\u201d would eliminate its synonymous clause \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d and we would have no crime of murder charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">We are not cited to and can find no other court, federal or state, which has considered such an indictment. In all the other cases cited by the government the indictment charges the premeditation which in the instant indictment is expressly excluded. In the District of Columbia Court of Appeals case of Burton v. United States, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 208, 151 F.2d 17, at page 18, where Burton was convicted of second degree murder, the court states: \u201cThe indictment charged murder in the first degree \u2014 a killing with deliberate and <em>premeditated </em>malice.\u201d This is an entirely different case from one where premeditation is expressly excluded. The practice in that circuit is that the indictment states the other crimes which create the malice. Goodall v. United States, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 148, 180 F.2d 397, 399, 17 A.L.R.2d 1070. So also in all the state cases cited<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the indictment charges premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\"> Since under the indictment the jury could convict Ornelas of second degree murder at most, the judge erred in compelling him to defend himself as against a crime of first degree murder having one or more of the four elements of arson, rape, burglary, or robbery. By so requiring that he be tried for a crime not charged in the indictment, Ornelas has been denied that \u201csubstance of a fair trial\u201d of Howell v. United States, 4 Cir., 172 F.2d 213, 215. By the order of the judge he was \u201cheld to answer for a capital * * * crime\u201d not on an \u201cindictment of a Grand Jury\u201d as required by the Fifth Amendment. Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 13, 7 S.Ct. 781, 30 L.Ed. 849; Edgerton v. United States, 9 Cir., 143 F.2d 697, 699; United States v. Krepper, 3 Cir., 159 F.2d 958, 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">In reading this construction of an indictment unlike any ever before considered by a federal court, we are moving in the direction the Supreme Court approved in its statement concerning the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ment of the law of the District of Columbia, \u201cCongress took a forward step in defining the degrees of murder so that only those guilty of deliberate and <em>premeditated </em>malice could be convicted of the first degree.\u201d Fisher v. United States, 328 U.S. 463, 475-476, 66 S.Ct. 1318, 1324, 90 L.Ed. 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial of Ornelas be had seeking conviction for no more than second degree murder and in which no consideration of any of the above four other crimes is relevant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\">.
