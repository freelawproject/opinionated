Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 7 Cir., 1955, 218 F.2d 295. Our attention was called to the fact that the Supreme Court had granted certiorari in that case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we were asked to defer our decision on the petition for rehearing until the Supreme Court had decided it. This we have done, and now the decision of the Supreme Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is before us. We find nothing therein which conflicts with our original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">Mackey had filed his action in four separate counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And, as the Supreme Court points out, 351 U.S. at page 430, 76 S.Ct. at page 896, each of these counts arose out of separate and independent transactions or occurrences except that Counts I and II related to different phases of the same transaction. Counts I and II were dismissed, and Counts III and IV were retained and the trial Court certified, under Rule 54(b), as amended, Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.A., that there was no just reason for delay. That question did not arise here because the complaint embraced only one <em>claim </em>(cause of action under common law pleading).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">Appellant recognized that only one claim was involved by failing to split the several elements into separate counts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It charges, \u201cThat the <em>cause of action herein complained of </em>accrued from the doing of such business and the performing of such work * * * [and] this Court has venue of <em>said cause.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.] Paragraphs numbered 2 through 11 of the complaint describe the drilling of ten oil wells on the land claimed by appellant and set up the acts of negligence or contract violation alleged to have been committed in each instance. But paragraphs 12 through 21 describe the various kinds of damage alleged to have been sustained by appellant, and all of these items of damage relate to all ten wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-17\">Paragraph 22 itemizes these damages, allocating to the various elements monetary amounts adding up to $100,200.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>and no effort is made to separate the damages as to wells. The <em>ad damnum </em>paragraph of the complaint demands judgment for that amount against appellees, and again no effort is made at separation of the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Both the form and the content of the complaint demonstrate clearly that multiple claims are not involved, and the record reveals that the rulings of the Court below from which the appeal is prosecuted related to items of damage alone and not to any claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The petition for rehearing is</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\">.
