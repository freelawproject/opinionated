Although he admits the prior conviction, defendant appeals from this judgment and sentence. He contends that he is not a second offender within the meaning of the federal narcotics laws and should not have been sentenced as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">At the time of defendant\u2019s earlier conviction, conspiracy to violate the narcotics laws was an offense punishable only under the general omnibus provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 88 (now \u00a7 371). At the time of defendant\u2019s conviction in the case at bar, such a conspiracy was an offense expressly punishable under the specific provisions of the narcotics laws. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237 (a) provide for increased sentences for second offenders and define what is meant by a second offender as follows: \u201c * * # an 0ffen(jer shall be considered a second * * * offender * * * if he previously has been convicted of any offense the penalty for which is provided in this subdivision [or subsection]\u201d or \u201cif he previously has been convicted of any offense the penalty for which\u201d is or was set forth in certain enumerated provisions of the present or earlier versions of the federal narcotics laws. There is no explicit reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 88 (now \u00a7 371), the statutory provision under which defendant was first convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"AzL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Defendant argues that the statutory language defines a \u201csecond offender\u201d as meaning only an offender who has previously been convicted <em>under </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 or 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a), or <em>under </em>the enumerated provisions of the present Or an earlier statute. If defendant\u2019s reading of the statute were correct he would not be a second offender, because he was not previously convicted <em>under </em>either 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a), or the enumerated statutes but instead was convicted <em>under </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 88 (now \u00a7 371).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">However, we believe defendant\u2019s reading of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a) does violence not only to the statutory language but also to the obvious Congressional intent in enacting these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">We hold that defendant is a second offender within the express language of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a). Each of these provisions defines a second offender as one who \u201cpreviously has been convicted of <em>any offense the penalty for which is provided in this subsection </em>[or subdivision].\u201d Each of these statutes makes conspiracy to sell narcotics an offense and provides the penalty therefor. Defendant \u201cpreviously has been convicted\u201d of conspiracy to sell narcotics, an \u201coffense the penalty for which is provided in\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a). Therefore, defendant is within the statutory definition of a \u201csecond offender.\u201d Cf. Beland v. United States, 5 Cir., 1942, 128 F.2d 795, certiorari denied, 1942, 317 U.S. 676, 63 S.Ct. 157, 87 L.Ed. 543; United States v. Johnson, 7 Cir., 1955, 218 F.2d 288, certiorari denied, 1955, 349 U.S. 923, 75 S.Ct. 663, 99 L.Ed. 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Moreover, this court\u2019s construction of the statute is clearly in accord with the Congressional intent. The purpose of Congress in enacting multiple offender penalties in the narcotics laws was to punish violators more severely, to deter the criminal who engages in illicit drug traffic, and to take habitual violators out of circulation. See House Report 635, 82nd Cong., 1st Sess., June 21, 1951; Senate Report 1051, 82nd Cong., 1st Sess., Oct. 1,1951. Where the intent of Congress is clear, penal statutes should not be so construed as to defeat that obvious intent. United States v. Alpers, 1950, 338 U.S. 680, 70 S.Ct. 352, 94 L.Ed. 457; United States v. Brown, 1948, 333 U.S. 18, 68 S.Ct. 376, 92 L.Ed. 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">For these reasons we think the trial court correctly sentenced defendant as a second offender under the federal narcotics laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">The judgment and sentence of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">HINCKS, Circuit Judge, dissents without opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-16\">.
