Putnam and James A. Over-man, as holders of a valid recorded preferred ship mortgage on the oil screw vessel Silver Spray, her engines, tackle, apparel, furniture and equipment, bring this appeal from a decree of the district court for the western district of Washington, northern division, foreclosing said mortgage and subordinating it to the wage liens of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">In May of 1954, Robert J. Tobin, owner and mortgagor of the Silver Spray, conceived the idea of conducting a tuna fishing venture in Southern California waters. Since he lacked the necessary funds to outfit such an operation, he placed advertisements<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Seattle Times, and other Northwest Coast papers, seeking persons to invest money on a working share arrangement or fishing lay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this manner, Tobin contacted appellees Lower, Kadlec, Herning, Peecher and Barquist, and represented to them that he was the owner of the Silver Spray, which was an 80' tuna clipper, and either was or would be equipped with live bait tanks and refrigeration, in order that it could leave Seattle for San Diego by May 15, 1954, to fulfill a tuna fishing contract with the Van Camp Sea Food Company. Induced by these representations, appellees Lower, Hern-ing, Peecher, each paid $2500 for a working one-tenth share on the Silver Spray.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-19\">Appellee Kadlec did not sign a share agreement, but was employed by Tobin as a crew member of the Silver Spray for a wage of $100 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>In mid-May, 1954, Tobin informed the crew that the Silver Spray would go to Alaska to haul a load of shrimp. This was to be in the nature of a shakedown run for the vessel and crew. While it appears that many of the appellees had secret objections to such a venture, none were voiced, and on May 18, 1954, the Silver Spray left Seattle for Wrangel, Alaska. In some unexplained way the shrimp, which were to be taken aboard, were gone when the vessel reached Wran-gel, and Tobin subsequently left the boat at Ketchikan and returned to Seattle with appellee Peecher, whose health was adversely affected by the cold northern weather. Thereafter, Tobin sent a wire<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the Silver Spray directing its return to Seattle to make ready for the voyage south. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">On June 2, 1954, appellee Bunker agreed to captain the Silver Spray on its fishing expedition. The following day the vessel arrived in Seattle from Alaska. It appears that during the interim, Tobin had been making efforts to secure bait and refrigeration equipment in order to outfit the Silver Spray for tuna fishing. It became necessary to dry dock the ship for repairs, and during this time Tobin left town on personal business. Provisions were growing short and the affairs of the fishing lay were in a confused state, which does not appear to have been caused by any of the appel-lees. As a result, on June 10, 1954, ap-pellee Lower libeled the boat, her engines, tackle, apparel, furniture and equipment, and Tobin personally; setting out in his libel many of the above facts. It was alleged this was a cause within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the court; that Tobin had abandoned the vessel' at Ketchikan, Alaska, and had since refused to repair it or provide it with the necessary provisions or funds to carry out the tuna fishing venture.. It was further alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>that libelant was wrongfully discharged without fault on his part, and was enti-tied to the sum of $5,000 as the value of his share of the catch, had the venture been carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"AnPL\">On June 10, 1954, pursuant to the libel, the Silver Spray was attached and held by the United States Marshal. Substantially similar intervening libels were filed on July 26, 1954, by appellees Bunker and Kadlec, and by Doss R. Payne; and on August 26, 1954, by appellees Barquist, Peecher, and Herning. On August 26, 1954, appellants Putnam and Overman filed their intervening libel in rem and in personam against the Silver Spray, and against Tobin personally, setting out the admiralty jurisdiction of the court, and alleging the sale of the Silver Spray to Tobin for a $5,000 down payment and a $30,000 promissory note secured by a duly recorded preferred ship mortgage, and praying that the mortgage be foreclosed and adjudged superior to any liens the other libelants might have for shares.</p>\n<p id=\"AlS\">Respondent Tobin answered the libels of appellees Lower, Bunker, Herning, Peecher, and Barquist, and as an affirmative defense set out the share agreement<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and alleged that each of the libel-ants became dissatisfied with the proposed venture, but violated the agreement by refusing to give respondent the requisite 30 days notice of intention to withdraw from the venture, as required by paragraph 6 thereof. Appellees replied aileging that they were induced to execute the share-agreement by respondent\u2019s mtentionally false representations that the Silver Spray was equipped to fish for tuna; that respondent was experienced m commercial fishing, and that he had a fishing contract with the Van Camp Seafood Company; and as a result the share contracts were null and void and of no effect. When the cause came on for trial, the trial judge found that on or before the date of the libel, Tobin by his actions had abandoned his contracts with libelants, abandoned the tuna fishing voyage for the 1954 tuna fishing season, and thereby wrongfully discharged libel-ants.</p>\n<p id=\"AqQj\">By the decree of October 28, 1954, appeBees Lower, Herning, Peecher, Barquist and Bunker were each awarded what the court termed \u201cseamans\u2019 wage Bens^ of $7,500, less their respective earnings the end of the 1954 tuna seaf\u00b0n- This award was based upon tBeir probable share had the fishing lay Been carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"Afi\">Kadlec, as a salaried employee rather than a working shareholder, was awarded a lien for $495 for wages earned and unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"Amm\">Appellants, as mortgagees of the vessel, were awarded a lien of $30,725, together with attorney\u2019s fees of $2,500, superior in rank and prior in time to any and all maritime liens against the vessel, excepting the above mentioned wage liens, which were held to be superior in rank and prior to the lien of appellants\u2019 preferred sBiP mortgage,</p>\n<p id=\"AZ1\">Pursuant to said decree, a writ of <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued, under which the United States Marshal sold the Silver Spray, realizing only $11,000 from the sale- Inasmuch as this amount is inade&lt;pate to satisfy even partially their subordinated mortgage lien, appellants Putnam alld Overman bring this appeal,</p>\n<p id=\"Avu\">No appeal is taken by respondent To-bin.</p>\n<p id=\"AvP\">Certain of tbe court&gt;s findings of fact are questioned. In this respect, appellants contend the eourt erred in find_ ing that the libelant and intervening libelants were ready, willing, and able to continue performance of their fishing contracts, and that they were wrongfully discharged. In admiralty, as in other fields of the law, findings of the trier of fact will not be disturbed on appeal, unless the error is manifest clearly against the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>There is no contention that To-bin formally discharged anyone; rather, the finding under attack finds its basis in Tobin\u2019s actions during the period from May 18,1954, until the original libel was filed on June 7,1954. It was the opinion of the trial court that by sailing to Alaska rather than to Southern California, by leaving the vessel at Ketchikan, by seeking to divert the enterprise to other grandiose schemes, by continuing to absent himself from the vessel, and by failing to provision it, Tobin had manifested his intention to terminate the proposed fishing lay, and thereby had wrongfully discharged appellees without fault on their part. There is, of course, no necessity that discharge be accompanied by formal words of firing. Words or conduct which would logically lead a prudent person to believe his tenure had been terminated are in themselves sufficient.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The record shows that subsequent to his alleged abandonment of the vessel in Alaska, Tobin wired appellees directing them to return in order to start the tuna venture; that he had made inquiries regarding necessary bait and refrigeration equipment after his return to Seattle; that he had paid a drydock bill and had attempted to lift the libel by posting bond; and that as late as June 3, 1954, he engaged appellee Bunker to captain the vessel on the lay. Such factors could well support a position eon-trary to that reached by the trial court, but while we might have reached such a contrary result, had we initially heard the case, we cannot say the result reached by the trial court is clearly erroneous,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and hence the finding under attack must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">For the same reasons, the finding that appellee Kadlec was hired on a wage basis must be sustained. The testimony on this point was confused and conflicting, but the court heard the witnesses and observed their demeanor,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and there is substantial evidence to support the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">We are next faced with a jurisdictional question, it being the contention of the appellants that the causes of action asserted by the appellees are essentially common-law actions for fraud and deceit, and as such not cognizable by the district court sitting as a Court of Admiralty. This argument is founded upon the replies of the respective libelants to To-bin\u2019s affirmative defense setting out the share agreements. To avoid the effect of the share agreements, the respective replies admitted their execution, but alleged that they were induced by Tobin\u2019s false representations, and were accordingly null and void.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The argument is further buttressed by statements of certain of the appellees, elicited on cross-examination, in which they admitted that their original libel had been prompted by a feeling that Tobin had bilked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>them, and by a desire to recover their monetary investment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APQ0\">The trial court was not unaware of the implications arising from the above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>and alluded to them in the course of the oral opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">If appellants are correct in their contention, .and this is purely an action initially seeking affirmative relief for fraud and deceit; it is of course true that admiralty is without jurisdiction to hear the ease. While admiralty courts are flexible in operation,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and are often said to act as courts of equity, it does not necessarily follow that they possess jurisdiction concurrent with that of equity, but rather that having once secured jurisdiction as an admiralty court, they may proceed in the trial of the cause on equitable principles.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, admiralty \"cannot entertain a bill or libel for specific performance, or to correct a mistake, * * * or declare or enforce a trust or an equitable title * * * or exercise jurisdiction in matters of accounts merely ' * * <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nor does admiralty have jurisdiction extending to-actions seeking affirmative relief from. fraud,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or seeking to set aside or reform contracts,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> merely because there is a maritime flavor to the transaction. However, this is not to say that the mere-entrance of fraud in any form into a case otherwise maritime, ousts admiralty of its jurisdiction. Whether the district, court, sitting as a court of admiralty,, has the power to hear and determine a given question, may well depend on how that question is presented in the case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although, as already mentioned, admiral<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>-ty cannot act in the manner of a court -of equity in granting affirmative relief from fraud, it is not because fraud, in and of itself, is inconsistent with admiralty jurisdiction. Admiralty in such circumstance is so limited merely because in such cases the first and fundamental exercise of power necessary, would be wholly of a non-maritime nature.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But where the first and fundamental exercise of judicial power is maritime, and the issue of fraud arises incidental to its general jurisdiction, then a court of admiralty may deal with the question of fraud, though intrinsically non-maritime, pursuant to its power to make a complete adjustment of rights over which admiralty has independent jurisdiction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As -succinctly stated by the second circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">\u201cThat jurisdiction depends in our judgment altogether upon the cause of suit which the libelant brings before the court; if that be once maritime, the court may dispose of it completely without the need of any other suit in the same, or any other court; it is omnicompetent within its sphere.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Accordingly, where the original jurisdiction is maritime, a court of admiralty may entertain an issue of fraud, mistake, or other equitable claim,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> where either is alleged as affecting the rights of parties to a maritime action.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The Stanley H. Miner, D.C.E.D.N.Y. 1909, 172 F. 486, presented an issue very similar to that in the instant case. There the libelant claimed salvage on a quantum meruit basis. Claimant answered by setting up a contract which allegedly covered the same services. Li-belant, in reply, attempted to obtain a release from the contract by means of an affirmative defense that the contract was never binding because induced by fraudulent misrepresentations. Upon the trial, the claimant moved to dismiss on the ground that the libelant should have brought an action in equity to rescind or reform his contract, and to recover upon an accounting; or that he should have brought his action in the state court for fraud and for damages, if he claimed the right to be released from the contract on that ground. The court denied the argument of claimant and allowed the affirmative defense, stating at page 493:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aov-dedup-0\">\u201c * * * and while an action to reform a contract or for an accounting based upon fraud may be equitable, nevertheless fraud itself is a valid defense, and the court can see no reason why the issue presented in the present action could not be disposed of properly.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">The fraud issue in the instant case was introduced by way of defense, and from the foregoing authorities it is apparent that if the first and fundamental exercise of power was purely maritime, the court below was not thereby ousted of its admiralty jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">That the initial exercise of power therein <em>was </em>maritime is clear, since the cause originated as a libel for wages and damages resulting from wrongful action relating to a fishing lay. Ever since the opinion of Justice Story in Harden v. Gordon, 1823, Fed.Cas.No. 6,047, 2 Mason 541,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> it has been settled in the maritime law of the United States that seamen are the wards of Admiralty, and as such the courts of admiralty vigilantly guard against any encroachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>upon their rights.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The jurisdiction of courts of admiralty over the wage claims of seamen is anciently established. From the dawn of maritime commerce, the necessity for skilled and courageous mariners has been recognized and the law has jealously protected them as to certain and prompt payment of wages or compensation by other methods.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Originally, seamen were compensated by a stake or share in the profits of the voyage. More recently, it has become customary to pay fixed wages, but the old form survives in the lay plan employed in the more speculative pursuits of sealing, whaling, and fishing. Fishermen, although possessing wages and customs peculiar to their business, are nonetheless seamen, and in general receive the same protection. Therefore, despite com-pensational differences, lay fishermen or sharesmen possess a right similar to that enjoyed by regular seamen, to lien the vessel and catch on board to secure their compensation,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and this right is maritime in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Having concluded that the district court properly took jurisdiction, we next proceed to a consideration of the question of the recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The record on this point is somewhat confusing, since it is not readily apparent on what theory recovery was predicated. The court found that the nature of the maritime liens of the appellees were for seamen\u2019s wages, and consequently commanded a lien superior to appellants\u2019 ship mortgage lien; but, at this point, an inconsistency appears in the theory of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">No wages were here specified in the original contract. Compensation was to be solely dependent upon the catch. But there was no catch, since the vessel was libeled before the voyage commenced. It is well settled that no maritime lien can be allowed to seamen for wages accruing subsequent to the time the ship is taken into <em>custodia legist</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and particularly is this true where, as here, the libel is filed by the crew of the vessel.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The theory here is that the act of seizing a ship, pursuant to legal process, effectively terminates the voyage, and thereby discharges the crew with no further claim for wages.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, seamen\u2019s wage claims are only effective for those services performed <em>prior to </em>libel. From this it is clear that any compensation recoverable to appellees, <em>as wages, </em>must have accrued at or prior to the time that appellee Lower libeled the \u201cSilver Spray.\u201d While not unquestioned,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> courts have, in similar situations, allowed recovery not for wages, but as damages for breach of the seaman\u2019s employment contract by wrongful discharge. This, on the theory that such claim becomes matured at the time ef the wrongful discharge,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> or, in our case, by the abandonment of the contract by Tobin.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Applying this reasoning to the instant case, since Tobin had wrongfully abandoned his contracts for the tuna venture <em>before </em>the date of the libel, appellees\u2019 claims for damages had accrued before the vessel entered <em>custodia legis, </em>and did not depend upon facts occurring subsequent to that time. We conclude that the appellees\u2019 claims existed at or <em>before </em>the time the ship was libeled, and were in no way cut off by said libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">We next consider the right of appel-lees to recovery in absence of a catch. Some early cases deny the right of seamen on a fishing lay to lien the vessel for claims arising from their share agreement until the earnings of the vessel are ascertained and liquidated.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This view is founded on the argument that the original fishing shares contract contemplated that the sharesmen\u2019s compensation should come solely from the catch; and to allow sharesmen to lien the vessel for claims arising from their contract would be to subvert the original contract as made by the parties, and substitute one of the court\u2019s making in its place. Such an interpretation may be justified where the failure to secure the requisite catch results from natural causes or factors which could be said to be within the scope of the contractual risk, and is not caused by abandonment by the owner. But here, Tobin, by his action in taking the Silver Spray to Alaska (an act outside the scope of the parties\u2019 share contract), abandoned the enterprise, wrongfully discharged appellees, and precluded any possibility of successful performance of the original lay. The failure of the voyage to produce any catch was not attributable to natural causes, or fishermen\u2019s luck, nor to any factor that might be said to be embraced by the share contract. The failure was solely due to the actions of the owner, and the sharesmen were without fault in the matter,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> having performed their agreement to the best of their ability and opportunity. While the trial court acted correctly under these circumstances in allowing some measure of recovery to the appellees, it erred in adapting as a standard of damages the probable profit from the voyage, if carried out in accordance with To-bin\u2019s original representation, thus allowing each appellee, with the exception of Kadlec,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the full value of his respective share in the prospective catch as estimated.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Although the gauge of damages for breach of nearly all commercial contracts, is the value of the future profits encompassed by the contract, nevertheless such profits must be determined with reference to some substantial criterion, without which any award would be merely speculative.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Accordingly, it has been quite uniformly held that prospective profits from a fishing lay are too speculative and uncertain to be a proper measure of damages.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Prospective profits are generally allowed only where there is an established going business, with a record of past profits for similar periods,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> or where the job contracted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>for was subsequently completed by another, thereby realizing the profits,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> or where the same person or persons had in the past performed the same job in the same place.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In each of these cases there is a yardstick of prior profits, a definite knowledge of the parties\u2019 past productivity which, while perhaps not exact, will enable the court to project with reasonable certainty the profits which would have resulted had the operation once more been carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The instant case involves a new venture : none of the appellees had ever before engaged in tuna fishing. Tobin himself was a railroad brakeman, not a commercial fisherman. As succinctly stated by appellee Bunker, \u201cI believe the trade name is, we were [all] green beans.\u201d Furthermore, there was no testimony as to the earning capacity of the Silver Spray. It is true that appellees\u2019 expert witness, Petrick, testified as to the probable earnings of refrigerated tuna clippers with live bait tanks; however, when shown a picture of the Silver Spray, Mr. Petrick stated: \u201cThis vessel is no bait boat'. This is a jig or trolling boat. Well, we are or have been talking about bait boats.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> No further evidence was adduced on the subject of the Silver Spray\u2019s earning capacity, leaving the court in the position of speculating on that vital subject. In so doing, the court acted in absence of a sufficient standard and was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">But this is not to say that appellees are without redress. Even though a claim for loss of profits is disproved as. too uncertain, the court may allow, as an alternative, one of the standardized measures of recovery.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Where one party to. a contract prevents the other from performing his portion thereof, the latter may abandon it and recover on the common counts.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The theory of recovery in such cases was clearly stated in United States v. Behan, 1884, 110 U.S. 338, 344, 4 S.Ct. 81, 83, 28 L.Ed. 168:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">\u201cThe <em>prima facie </em>measure of damages for the breach of a contract is the amount of the loss which 'the injured party has sustained thereby. If the breach consists in preventing the performance of the contract, without the fault of the other party, who is willing to perform it, the loss of the latter will consist of two distinct items or grounds of damage, namely, First, what he has already expended towards performance, (less the value of material on hand) ; sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>ondly, the profits that he would realize by performing the whole contract. The second item, profits, cannot always be recovered. They may be too remote and speculative in their character, and therefore incapable of that clear and direct proof which the law requires. * * * When a party injured by the stoppage of a contract elects to rescind it, then, it is true, he cannot recover any damages for a breach of the contract, either for outlay or for loss of profits; he recovers the <em>value </em>of his services actually performed as upon a <em>quantum meruit. </em>There is then no question of losses or profits. But when he elects to go for damages for the breach of the contract, the first and most obvious damage to be shown is the amount which he has been induced to expend on the faith of the contract, <em>including a fair allowance for his own </em>time and services.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Accordingly, appellees are entitled to the respective amounts expended for the working share agreements. Due to the speculative nature of the prospective profits, they cannot be recovered as damages; however, appellees are entitled to a fair allowance for their time and services in sailing the Silver Spray to Alaska and back, at Tobin\u2019s request. Just what constitutes a fair allowance for time and services in these circumstances is a question which the trial court may ascertain and award, taking into consideration the experience and duties of each appellee, and the length of time each spent aboard the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We further hold that this reasonable allowance for time and services under the circumstances of this case is in the nature of seaman\u2019s wages and thus should be given priority over the mortgage of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Those appellees who each paid $2500 to Tobin are entitled to a judgment against Tobin for such sum, but inasmuch as these sums are being awarded strictly on the basis of breach of contract, and not wages, they should not be given priority over the mortgage of appellants. The costs allowed by the trial court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">The judgment in favor of Appellee Kadlec is affirmed and is entitled to priority over the mortgage of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">The judgment in favor of appellants against Tobin, not contested here, for $30,725, together with attorney fees and costs, is affirmed. The deficiency judgment entered against Tobin, not contested, is likewise affirmed except that the amount of the deficiency is to be determined on the basis of the recoveries allowed the appellees and appellants as a result of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-13\">.

That x-espondent had entered into a contract with Van Camp Sea Food Co., Inc., to fish for tuna south of San Diego, California, for the 1954 season, using said vessel \u2018Silver Spray.\u2019 That said fishing company would operate a helicopter to assist in locating tuna fish; that respondent then planned and was prepared to take the vessel south to San Diego, leaving from Puget Sound on June 11 or 12, 1954, for the 1954 tuna fishing season; that said representations were made to intervening libelant for the purpose of inducing him to sign the aforesaid agreement, and intervening libelant agreed to work aboard said vessel for a tenth of the catch by virtue thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"A64\">\u201cIII.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai0j\">\u201cThat the aforesaid representations by respondent were false, and were made by him with intent to deceive intervening libelant, so that said writing prepared by respondent, as aforesaid, and alleged by respondent in his answer herein, is null and void and of no effect. * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">. On cross-examination, Lower testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">\u201cQ. I am inquix-ing of you. Do you now think that Tobin deceived you? A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">\u201cQ. And the purpose of your lawsuit is to try to get back your $2,500 that he deceived you of? * * *. A. The purpose of my lawsuit is to get back \u2014 I had a contract to go to Greenland which amounted to $8,000, and the salmon \u2014 I mean the tuna for the summer which I lost, all the time I have lost, and everything I have lost I am trying to get compensation for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Corey) You are trying to get damages because you claim Tobin deceived you, is that right? A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">\u201cQ. At the time you negotiated this contract with Tobin on April 17th and you put up $2,500, are you now claiming that Tobin told yoxx the truth, or cheated you? \u25a0A. Cheated me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">Herning was also examined on this point:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">\u201cQ. * * * Is it your claim, Mr. Herning, that you put up this $2,500 because Mr. Tobin misrepresented to you about this proposed trip and the availability of the boat for txxna fishing? A. That is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">\u201cQ. And what you are really complaining about is that he did misrepresent to you, got $2,500 from you, and you want to get it back, is that it? A. Well, I want to get back what I figure I have coming.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">\u201cQ. And that is the $2,500 you put up? A. That is right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-18\">Peecher\u2019s testimony follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-19\">\u201cQ. Now, in answer just a few minutes ago to a question asked you by Mr. Collins with reference to the occurrences on Juno 7, you said that on that date it was your disposition to punch Mr. Tobin in the nose? Was it because you felt that he had defrauded you? A. I had already made up my own mind that I eouldn\u2019t believe a word the man said.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-20\">\u201cQ. Well, did you think he had defrauded you in getting you into this deal? Was that it? A. I certainly did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-21\">Barquist testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-22\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Carey): In what respect, Mr. Barquist, do you claim that Mr. Tobin misrepresented anything to you in connection with this proposed venture? A. Well, when we discussed it before I bought in, why he told me that we would make anywhere from $7,500 to $12,000 a year fishing tuna. That is what sold me on the idea, and he also stated that: \u2018All the contracts we have, we will lay them up here on the table where everybody can study them and read them over and vote on them.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b613-23\">\u201cQ. Do you claim those were misrepresentations that you relied xxpon? Did you believe him in other words? A. Well, I don\u2019t know what else they could have been, because none of them was ever carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-24\">\u201cQ. I am not asking about the carrying out end of it, but was it because of those representations he made to you that you advanced your $2,500? A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-25\">\u201cQ. And that is what you are complaining about? A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-26\">Appellee Bunker was of a more independent frame of mind, as appears from the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-27\">\u201cQ. And do you think he misled you, deceived you? A. He deceived me in some respects, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-28\">\u201cQ. And that is what you are complaining about? A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-29\">\u201cQ. What are you complaining about? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>A.
