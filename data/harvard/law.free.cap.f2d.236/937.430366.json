Recognizing that the court decisions are in conflict on the interpretation of this wording in insurance contracts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we believe the reasoning of Judge Clary\u2019s opinion in this case and of Chief Judge Hutcheson\u2019s opinion in Wilkerson v. Maryland Casualty Co., D.C. E.D.Va.1953, 119 F.Supp. 383, 388, affirmed per curiam, 4 Cir., 1954, 210 F. 2d 245, is that which would be followed by a Maryland Court in this situation in view of the rule of construction which, as we have seen,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is followed in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">This construction of the contract is not \u201cunnatural\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in view of the reservation by the insurer of the ability to terminate its liability for interest through payment of the amount of its obligation under any judgment into court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>and of its right<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to control the conduct of the suit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">The judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-16\">. The opinion of the lower court summarizes the applicable factual situation as follows [136 F.Supp. 958]:</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">\u201cHarry C. Underwood, plaintiff herein, at trial, obtained a verdict of $60,000; defendant, however, was insured only to the extent of $25,000. The litigation was controlled and handled by the insur-anee carrier. After the verdict certain post-trial motions were filed by defendant and, upon dismissal of the motions, the insurance carrier paid to the Clerk of this Court the full amount of its coverage, to wit: $25,000 plus interest, on that amount only, from the date of the verdict to the date of payment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b984-10\">. During the oral argument, counsel conceded that the policy was probably delivered in Maryland and the only evidence in the record on the point was the statement on the copy attached to the Stipulation stating that it was countersigned at Baltimore (Appendix 19A). Under the applicable Conflict of Laws rule, Maryland law controls the interpretation of its language. See Harry L. Sheinman &amp; Sons v. Scranton Life Ins. Co., 3 Cir., 1942, 125 F.2d 442; Roth v. Maryland Casualty Co., 3 Cir., 1954, 209 F. 2d 371; Restatement of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 311, 312. The Maryland courts have adopted the well-recognized legal principle that if the meaning of an insurance contract is doubtful, it must be construed against the insurer. See Brownstein v. New York Life Ins. Co., 1930, 158 Md. 51, 148 A. 273, 276; New England Mutual Life Ins. Co. of Boston, Mass. v. Hurst, 1938, 174 Md. 596, 199 A. 822, 826; Hankins v. Public Service Mutual Ins. Co., 1949, 192 Md. 68, 63 A.2d 606, 610, 614.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b984-17\">. Compare Underwood v. Buzby, D.C.E.D. Pa.1955, 136 F.Supp. 957, and Wilkerson v.

Also, the argument that the insured has the use of his money during the time the insurer engages in pre- and post-trial motions and proceedings, such as those involved in this case, is not particularly forceful since interest on the judgment at the rate of 6% (as provided for in 12 P.S. \u00a7 782 and 41 P.S. \u00a7 3) far exceeds the rate available on conservative obligations in the money market at the time when this contract was issued. In diversity actions, it is noted that the interest on judgments is computed generally by Federal courts at the rate applied by the law of the state where the Federal court sits.
