Federal Power Commission, 15,321 \u2014 Ohio Oil Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 15,352 \u2014 Superior Oil Co. v. Federal Power Commission, and 15,354 \u2014 West v. Federal Power Commission, 236 F.2d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-20\">Petitioners herein were among the numerous producers who filed with the Commission applications for rehearing of Order 174-A. They, like the other applicants for rehearing, were granted oral argument before the full Commission and were afforded an opportunity to file briefs in support of their applications. Following the submission of briefs and oral arguments, as in the other cases, the Commission by order issued September 24, 1954, amended Order 174-A in a respect immaterial to these petitioners, and extended the time for compliance with the order from October 1 to December 1, 1954, but it took no further action at that time upon the applications for rehearing. Thereafter, on December 17, 1954, the Commission issued Order 174-B in which it amended and restated Order 174-A and denied all applications for rehearing respecting Order 174-A, including those which had been filed by petitioners herein. Following this action by the Commission and on February 10, 1955, petitioners filed in this Court their petition for review of Order 174-B and prayed that it be \u201cset aside, vacated, and held for naught.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-21\">Petitioners\u2019 basic contentions and the grounds asserted for vacating Order 174-B are in essence identical to those urged by petitioner in the four companion cases, supra,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and what we have said in those cases is dispositive of this case. Accordingly, and for the reasons there stated at length we conclude that the order is not reviewable and that the petition for review must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-22\">Dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>JOHN R.
