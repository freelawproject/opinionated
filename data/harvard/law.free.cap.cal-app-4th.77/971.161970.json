The issue arises because resourceful counsel has formulated an end run around the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law\u2014nunc pro tunc dismissal in an old case of charges that otherwise would be considered \u201cstrikes\u201d against the defendant in a new case. We conclude that neither the superior court\u2019s order declining Gallardo\u2019s proposal nor its refusal to reconsider the order is appealable. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>The second appeal (by David Lopez) presents a classic example of a habeas corpus petition presented to the superior court and denied by that court. Instead of filing a new petition in this court, Lopez has sought to appeal. Although he argues for special treatment to gain procedural advantages the appeal would provide and he claims his situation is different because the lower court issued an order to show cause before denying relief, we apply the long-standing rule that the defendant may not appeal denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Although we dismiss his appeal, we will refile the notice of appeal as a petition for writ of habeas corpus and will then consider it separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The third appeal (by Hector Mora) straddles the line between appealable orders and nonappealable rulings. Mr. Mora sought a writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>but the superior court denied relief, describing the motion as one for \u201cwrit of error <em>coram nobis </em>or habeas corpus.\u201d We conclude that the request was in the nature of a petition for writ of habeas corpus and that appeal does not lie. As with the Lopez appeal, we will refile the notice of appeal as a petition for writ of habeas corpus and consider it separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">We announce, however, that in the future we will not be as accommodating as we have been to Lopez and Mora when defendants insist on appealing when they should have brought petitions for writs of habeas corpus to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"Aib\">\n<em>Michael Tony Gallardo\u2019s Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">On June 3, 1983, Gallardo pled guilty (in the old case) to attempted robbery, aggravated assault and simple kidnapping, charges arising out of a single incident with a single victim. All three counts included deadly weapon enhancements based upon use of an iron bar. The court dismissed a charge of kidnapping for purposes of robbery. On July 8, 1983, the court sentenced Gallardo to the mitigated term of three years in state prison for kidnapping, plus one year for the deadly weapon. The court sentenced him to the middle terms on the other two counts, but made them concurrent with the kidnap count and ordered the other two counts stayed pursuant to Penal Code section 654.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">On July 25, 1996, Gallardo was arrested in San Mateo County (in the new case) on charges of committing lewd acts upon a child (\u00a7 288, subd. (a)), attempting by threats or violence to prevent an executive officer from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>performing a duty (\u00a7 69) and terrorist threats against a police officer (\u00a7 422). The three 1983 convictions were charged as \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of enhancement under the Three Strikes law. In a court trial, the San Mateo court found Gallardo guilty of two counts and found that all the priors were true. He was sentenced to state prison for a term of 30 years to life in the new case.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">On appeal in the new case, this court rejected Gallardo\u2019s claim that, when considering whether to strike one or more of the prior convictions, the trial court failed to take into account that the three prior convictions arose out of a single indivisible transaction and that two counts had been stayed pursuant to section 654. We concluded that \u201cat the time of sentencing, the trial court considered all relevant factors, including the interrelated nature of the prior strikes, and did not abuse its discretion.\u201d <em>(People v. Gallardo </em>(Nov. 30, 1998, A078385) [nonpub. opn.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">While we were processing the appeal from the new case, Gallardo set into motion the events leading to this purported appeal from the old case. On June 25, 1998, he sent a letter to Judge Richard Amason, the sentencing court in the 1983 Contra Costa conviction, asking the court to strike nunc pro tunc the two counts the court had previously stayed. Gallardo credited Justice Chin\u2019s dissent in <em>People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 24, 43-44 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 294, 954 P.2d 557] <em>(Benson), </em>for the idea of striking the priors, but not for the notion that the court might do so 15 years after pronouncing sentence (which appears to have been counsel\u2019s idea). In his letter to Judge Amason, Gallardo expressed his opinion that a formal motion was not required \u201csince an exercise of discretion under section 1385 is on the court\u2019s own motion in any case.\u201d Counsel for Gallardo did enlist support from Gallardo\u2019s Contra Costa trial attorney, he served opposing counsel, and he suggested a hearing be held to air all views. He offered to appear before the court on July 9 or some other convenient date.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">On July 9, 1998, the court issued a minute order decision in the old case denying Gallardo\u2019s \u201cinvitation\u201d for five stated reasons. Although the minute order recited that the matter was not reported and that defendant was not present, it did not record whether counsel for either side was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Gallardo promptly sought reconsideration, challenging each of the court\u2019s stated reasons. The court denied the informal request for reconsideration. This appeal followed, purporting to appeal both court orders in the old case.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">We issued an order to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed because the orders are not appealable. In our order, we asked Gallardo to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>consider and comment upon the following analysis: \u201cWhere the defendant seeks to vacate a judgment and reopen the proceedings after appeal has been resolved or the time for appeal has passed, the request, however formulated and characterized, is in the nature of a habeas corpus petition unless it qualifies as a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>or invokes rights established by . . . section 1016.5 or a similar statute. The court\u2019s ruling on the request, therefore, does not qualify as an appealable order within the meaning of . . . section 1237, subdivision (b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">After explaining the other two appeals also under consideration and conducting a general review of appealability in criminal cases, we will consider Gallardo\u2019s response to our order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">\n<em>David Lopez\u2019s Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">This is Lopez\u2019s third appeal arising from events in 1993. In 1995, we affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction for multiple offenses, including torture, forcible oral copulation, child endangerment, kidnapping, assault and possession of a controlled substance. The trial court had sentenced Lopez to 15 years and four months based upon eight of the 26 counts of which Lopez was convicted but, without explanation, \u201cstayed execution\u201d on the remaining counts, including the torture count, which carried a life term. We granted the People\u2019s cross-appeal and remanded for resentencing with instructions that the trial court impose sentence for all 26 counts and cite the specific authority for any terms it stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The court resentenced, imposing an indeterminate life term for torture and a determinate term aggregated from various counts and enhancements. Lopez appealed again. In an opinion filed January 24, 1997, we accepted Lopez\u2019s theory that the court intended the life term to be concurrent with the others and we ordered the abstract amended to that effect. We then rejected appellant\u2019s suggestion that we remand to permit the court to exercise its discretion, in accordance with the subsequent decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Norrell </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 429, 913 P.2d 458], whether to stay the sentence on the most serious count. We found that the court\u2019s initial sentencing to 15 years and four months showed that it realized it was not required to sentence him to the term for the most serious offense. We explained: \u201cBecause the trial court was aware of its discretion at the original sentencing to proceed in the manner described in <em>People v. Norrell, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 1 and because nothing in our opinion suggests the contrary, there is simply no basis upon which to conclude that the trial court lacked such awareness at resentencing. Accordingly, there is no support for remand as a result of <em>Norrell.\u201d (People v. Lopez </em>(Jan. 24, 1997, A073671) [nonpub. opn.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>Nearly two years later, appellant filed in superior court a petition for writ of habeas corpus. He sought to raise claims of ineffective counsel at trial and defects during resentencing. He presented a declaration from resentencing counsel showing the attorney\u2019s understanding that the resentencing judge believed his \u201chands had been tied\u201d by this court\u2019s first opinion and that he did not have authority to stay the life term.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The superior court issued an order to show cause. The People objected on timeliness grounds and challenged the merits of Lopez\u2019s claims. Lopez\u2019s current attorney responded with legal arguments and a declaration explaining the course of his research from the time he was approached by the family in February 1997, until the petition was filed in December 1998. On June 21, 1999, after a short hearing during which Lopez requested the matter be set for an evidentiary hearing, the court denied the petition, stating in its minute order that it \u201csummarily denies the motion pursuant to [section] 1484 . . . .\u201d Lopez appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We issued an order to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed because the order denying a petition for writ of habeas corpus was not appealable. We cited two decisions <em>(In re Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 750, 767, fn. 7 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 855 P.2d 729]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrett </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1421-1423 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 803]) explaining that the defendant has no right to appeal under such circumstances. In a later part of this opinion, we will consider Lopez\u2019s response to our order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">\n<em>Hector Mora\u2019s Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">On September 19, 1997, following a no contest plea, Mora was convicted of driving under the influence in an incident that caused injury. When he changed his plea to no contest, Mora received the standard advice that his plea might have immigration consequences. He was sentenced to three years in state prison. When he completed service, he was picked up by immigration authorities and placed in a det\u00e9ntion center and was slated for deportation. He filed a \u201cmotion to vacate (writ of error <em>coram nobis)\u201d </em>asserting that his trial attorney assured him he need not worry about immigration consequences and could deal with them later. He claimed that had trial counsel investigated he would have discovered that Mora would be automatically subject to deportation as a result of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">The People replied that writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>could not be granted for ineffective counsel and argued that, in any case, Mora\u2019s assertions did not make a case for issuance of the writ. The People asserted that Mora was fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>informed of the immigration consequences. After hearing, which included testimony by trial counsel, the court denied the motion. The court\u2019s written order was captioned \u201corder after hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate (writ of habeus [sic] corpus.)\u201d Mora appealed, describing the order as \u201cthe order of motion to vacate (writ of Error <em>Coram nobis </em>or Habeus [ric] Corpus).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">On September 2, 1999, we issued an order to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed because the order was not appealable. We pointed to authority stating that appeal would not lie from denial of writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>if the petition failed to state a prima facie case for relief or merely duplicated issues that could have been resolved in other proceedings. We suggested that Mora\u2019s petition below functioned as a petition for writ of habeas corpus, whose denial was not appealable. We will consider Mora\u2019s response after we have examined the law on the subject and the contentions in the other two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Appeals in Criminal Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">\u201c[A]n order is not appealable unless declared to be so by the Constitution or by statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Keener </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 714,720 [12 Cal.Rptr. 859, 361 P.2d 587].) Stated simply, a criminal appeal by the defendant may be taken only from \u201ca final judgment of conviction\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 1237, subd. (a), 1466, subd. (2)(A)) or from \u201cany order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights\u201d of the party (\u00a7\u00a7 1237, subd. (b), 1466, subd. (2)(B)). Our resolutipn of these three appeals hinges on interpreting and applying the phrase \u201corder made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights\u201d of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">If interpreted broadly, the phrase would apply to any postjudgment attack upon the conviction or sentence. Postjudgment trial level attacks seeking to nullify convictions and/or sentences come in many forms. They may be called, for example, motions to vacate, motions to correct, or motions to set aside judgments, petitions for writ of habeas corpus, or petitions for writ of error <em>coram nobis. </em>The court\u2019s denial of relief in any such situation could affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. However, decisional authority has limited the scope of the phrase, defining appealability more narrowly. We collect and consider here appellate court limitations on appealability of superior court orders rejecting postjudgment challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">A ruling denying a motion to vacate judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> would qualify semantically as an order after judgment affecting substantial rights, but such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>order ordinarily is not appealable when the appeal would merely bypass or duplicate appeal from the judgment itself. <em>{People v. Thomas </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 521, 527 [342 P.2d 889].) \u201cIn such a situation appeal from the judgment is an adequate remedy; allowance of an appeal from the order denying the motion to vacate would virtually give defendant two appeals from the same ruling and, since there is no time limited [sic] within which the motion may be made, would in effect indefinitely extend the time for appeal from the judgment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Several exceptions have modified this general prohibition, however, including a narrow exception when the record on appeal would not have shown the error, and an exception for attacks upon void judgments. (6 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 3171-3173, pp. 3927-3930.) Furthermore, the California Supreme Court has acknowledged that both the general rule and its exceptions are court created and has concluded that appellate courts may, when circumstances warrant, entertain appeals from rulings denying motions to vacate judgments. The standards for accepting such appeals are similar to those applied by the courts when deciding whether to review on the merits claims made by a petition for extraordinary writ. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Banks </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 370, 379-381, fn. 5 [1 Cal.Rptr. 669, 348 P.2d 102] <em>{Banks).) </em>In <em>Banks, </em>the court entertained the appeal because it presented a \u201cquestion as to the constitutionality or interpretation of a statute which is of concern to a number of persons other than the petitioner\u201d and because the question had not been previously answered by the Supreme Court. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 381, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Several courts have accepted without comment appealability of rulings in one narrow category of motions to vacate: motions to vacate brought under section 1016.5, subdivision (b), for failure to advise of immigration consequences. <em>{People v. Suon </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 1 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 519 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 882]; <em>People v. Shaw </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 492 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 915]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gontiz </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1309 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 786]; <em>People v. Castaneda </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1612 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 666],)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These decisions appear to defy the tenet that rulings on motions to vacate are not appealable when they offer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>defendant a second chance to appeal the judgment itself. However, if the appeal record in such a case did not show that the defendant was an immigrant, the case would meet the silent record exception to nonappealability. Where the record would have supported appeal from the judgment itself, but the judgment was not appealed, permitting appeal from the ruling on the motion to vacate may correlate to the Legislature\u2019s specifically authorizing the motion and explicitly directing courts to grant relief upon a proper <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because these decisions are not from the state\u2019s highest court and are silent about their rationale, they do not signal any alteration of the basic rule that appeal from denial of a motion to vacate does not normally provide a second chance to appeal the judgment itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">For better or worse, the terms \u201cmotion to vacate\u201d and \u201cpetition for writ of error <em>coram nobis\u201d </em>are often used interchangeably and the two procedures are similar in scope and effect. (Prickett, <em>The Writ of Error Coram Nobis in California </em>(1990) 30 Santa Clara L.Rev. 1, 19-20 &amp; fn. 80 (Prickett).) However, courts have applied more precise rules for appeals from denials of petitions for writ of error <em>coram nobis.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Denial of a defendant\u2019s request for <em>coram nobis </em>relief is appealable <em>(People v. Allenthorp </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 679, 683 [51 Cal.Rptr. 244, 414 P.2d 372]) unless the petition failed to state a prima facie case for relief <em>(People v. Kraus </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 568, 575, fn. 4 [121 Cal.Rptr. 11]) or the petition merely duplicated issues which had or could have been resolved in other proceedings <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vaitonis </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 156, 159 [19 Cal.Rptr. 54]; see generally Prickett, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 48-66).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\"><em>Coram nobis </em>will not issue to vacate a plea of guilty solely on the ground that it was induced by misstatements of counsel <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(1956) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>143 Cal.App.2d 506, 508 [299 P.2d 1057]) or where the claim is that the defendant did not receive effective assistance from counsel <em>(People v. Ibanez </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 537, 546, fn. 13 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 536]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Soriano </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1470, 1477 [240 Cal.Rptr. 328, 65 A.L.R.4th 705]). Where <em>coram nobis </em>raises only such grounds, an appeal from the superior court\u2019s ruling may be dismissed as frivolous. (See <em>People v. Shorts </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 502, 516-517 [197 P.2d 330]; <em>People v. Sumner </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 409, 413, 414 [69 Cal.Rptr. 15].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In a myriad of situations, including but not limited to those covered above, the defendant may seek to have judgment vacated by a petition for writ of habeas corpus, an all-purpose remedy.  Although the People may appeal the granting of a writ of habeas corpus, the detainee has no right to appeal its denial and must instead file a new habeas corpus petition in the reviewing court. <em>{In re Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 750, 767, fn. 7 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 855 P.2d 729]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrett, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1421-1423.) One court has authorized a defendant to appeal, however, in the limited circumstance that the habeas corpus petition led to a \u201csentencing rehearing\u201d at which the court considered whether to dismiss a prior conviction under the authority of <em>People </em>v. <em>Tenorio </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 89 [89 Cal.Rptr. 249, 473 P.2d 993], a decision that removed the prosecutor\u2019s control over dismissals of certain charges. <em>{People v. Wax </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 302 [101 Cal.Rptr. 289].) This exception was created without analysis in a case where appealability may not have been raised by the parties. Another division of the same court has declined to follow <em>Wax </em>in a parallel circumstance. <em>{People v. Garrett, supra, </em>at pp. 1422-1423.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The Gallardo Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"AQcf\">\n<em>Gallardo\u2019s Response to the Order to Show Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Gallardo tacitly accepts the principles of appealability stated in this court\u2019s order to show cause. He contends, however, that he has a right to appeal because the superior court in the old case failed to recognize its power to dismiss, nunc pro tunc, the charges it had long ago stayed. Displaying commendable candor, Gallardo acknowledges that he had no right to move to dismiss the convictions (\u00a7 1385 permits only the court or prosecutor to initiate a dismissal), that he would have no right to challenge the court\u2019s decision if it held an appropriate hearing and exercised its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>discretion not to dismiss them, that he has no right to challenge the convictions by writ of habeas corpus (because he is not confined under a conviction for the priors), and that his invitation to the court did not qualify as a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis. </em>He insists, however, that he is entitled to appeal the court\u2019s decision not to hold a hearing and is entitled to a \u201cdetermination that the reasons given by the sentencing judge for denying a hearing\u2014essentially, that he did not have the power to grant the relief which would be requested at the hearing\u2014were not proper reasons for denying a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">\n<em>Gallardo Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Gallardo\u2019s unique arguments appear to contend that (1) even though he had no right to move for dismissal, he had a right to a hearing on this nonmotion, and (2) even though he has no right to challenge the court\u2019s adverse decision, he could appeal the court\u2019s articulated reasons for deciding adversely without a hearing. Gallardo\u2019s view seems to be that the orders are appealable not because of the nature of the decisions but because of the reasons the court placed on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In its minute order rejecting Gallardo\u2019s proposal, the court stated: \u201cThe invitation [to consider striking some of the charges] is denied for each of the following reasons: (1) The plea was pursuant to . . .

(4) The very recent case of . . . <em>Benson </em>[(1998)] 18 Cal.4th 24. (5) Lastly, <em>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Restating Gallardo\u2019s argument, he asserts that the order is appealable simply because it is an order after judgment affecting his substantial rights. By this argument, he seems to be saying that despite possessing no right to move to strike or to have the court exercise its discretion in a particular way, he retains a substantial right to second guess the court\u2019s articulated reasons for not doing what he had no right to have the court do.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\"><em>People v. Pritchett </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 190 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 391], persuasively answers Gallardo\u2019s appealability claims. The defendant in <em>Pritchett </em>failed to appeal his sentence of four years and four months. However, after the time for appeal passed, he asked the court to recall his sentence pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (d), and to either reduce it to three years or reimpose the same sentence to restart the time for appeal. The court refused to reduce the sentence but, with the prosecutor\u2019s consent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>resentenced the defendant to the same sentence. The defendant appealed. Division Three of the First Appellate District dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><em>Pritchett </em>noted that section 1170, subdivision (d), permitted a court to recall a sentence on its own motion, but it conferred no standing on a defendant to move to recall the sentence. \u201cConsequently, the courts have uniformly held that an order <em>denying </em>a defendant\u2019s request to resentence pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (d) is not appealable as an order affecting the substantial rights of the party. This is because the defendant has no right to request such an order in the first instance; consequently, his \u2018substantial rights\u2019 cannot be affected by an order denying that which he had no right to request. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pritchett, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th at p. 194.) The court also rejected the idea that the defendant\u2019s rights might be greater because the sentencing court there granted the request to recall and then resentenced the defendant to the same term. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The situation in <em>Pritchett </em>was very much like the circumstance here. The only significant differences are that the trial court here did not accept Gallardo\u2019s invitation to act on its own motion and that it stated reasons for not doing so. However, appealability depends upon the nature of the decision made, not the court\u2019s justification for its ruling. No additional appellate rights accreted to Gallardo because Judge Amason expressed his belief he could not dismiss convictions long since final or because he believed Supreme Court decisions prevented him from doing so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The Lopez Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">\n<em>Lopez\u2019s Response to the Order to Show Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Lopez admits that he could file a petition for writ of habeas corpus in this court to seek the relief sought by his appeal. He asserts, however, that \u201cthere are practical reasons why such a petition may not be within appellant\u2019s reach.\u201d The only impediment he identifies is expense. He notes that he is not entitled to appointed counsel as a matter of right in a habeas corpus proceeding, whereas one would be appointed for his appeal. He also notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>that a writ petition is not as desirable because it could be summarily denied without a hearing or a written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Lopez supports his preference for appeal by describing a line of cases commencing with <em>People v. Wax, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.3d 302. He overlooks, however, the fact that the California Supreme Court decertified the only decision explicitly applying <em>Wax </em>beyond its own circumstances. In the face of decisions that state that appeal may not be taken from denial of a habeas corpus petition, he proposes an exception applicable when the trial court has issued an order to show cause before denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">\n<em>Lopez Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Even if we were disposed to do so, which we are not, we are not at liberty to change the rules on appealability of habeas corpus rulings in the manner requested by Lopez. The Legislature has provided that the People may appeal from the granting of habeas corpus relief (\u00a7 1506), but has not provided that remedy for a defendant. The California Supreme Court has, on more than one occasion, stated that the defendant may not appeal denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus. <em>(In re Clark, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 767, fn. 7; <em>In re Hochberg </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 870, 876 [87 Cal.Rptr. 681, 471 P.2d 1], disapproved on other grounds in <em>In re Fields </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1063 [275 Cal.Rptr. 384, 800 P.2d 862]; <em>Loustalot </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 905, 913 [186 P.2d 673].) In its comprehensive explanation of habeas corpus proceedings, the <em>Hochberg </em>court made no exception for cases in which the superior court issued an order to show cause or held an evidentiary hearing before denying the habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Wax, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.3d 302, stands virtually alone in suggesting that appeal may lie from a superior court\u2019s habeas corpus denial. Most recently, <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrett, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at pages 1422-1423, described by Lopez as a \u201cwild card\u201d decision, noted that the issue of appealability appeared not to have been raised by the <em>Wax </em>parties and was not discussed by the court. <em>Garrett </em>then refused to extend <em>Wax </em>to other habeas corpus rulings. So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">As did <em>Garrett, </em>however, we will treat the appeal as a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Unlike <em>Garrett, </em>which decided the petition in an unpublished portion of the appealabililty opinion, however, we will divert the habeas corpus matter into a separate proceeding and decide it there.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>The Mora Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">\n<em>Mora\u2019s Response to the Order to Show Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Mora asserts that his motion in superior court was a hybrid, containing elements of both a habeas corpus petition and a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis. </em>He claims that the latter elements predominated and that, for that reason, appeal is the appropriate remedy for the court\u2019s denial of his request. He concedes that if the fact issue involved solely counsel\u2019s ineffectively failing to advise him that his plea would automatically lead to deportation, habeas corpus would be the correct remedy. He insists, however, that <em>coram nobis </em>was an appropriate vehicle for inquiry into his ignorance of the consequences of his plea. According to Mora, the circumstance that his ignorance was accompanied by attorney incompetence merely makes habeas corpus relief an additional remedy available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Mora maintains that, at a minimum, <em>coram nobis </em>relief was appropriate for the inquiry into his ignorance of the consequences of his plea\u2014automatic deportation and denial of reentry. He suggests that his appeal would be limited to that issue and that he could raise issues of ineffective counsel by an ancillary petition for writ of habeas corpus to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The People reply by noting that Mora\u2019s petition to the superior court rested entirely on ineffectiveness of counsel. They contend he may not, after the fact, transform the lower court proceedings in order to accommodate his possible appeal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">\n<em>Mora Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">\u201cA writ of <em>coram nobis </em>permits the court which rendered judgment \u2018to reconsider it and give relief from errors of fact.\u2019 [Citation.] The writ will properly issue only when the petitioner can establish three elements: (1) that some fact existed which, without his fault or negligence, was not presented to the court at the trial and which would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; (2) that the new evidence does not go to the merits of the issues of fact determined at trial; and (3) that he did not know nor could he have, with due diligence, discovered the facts upon which he relies any sooner than the point at which he petitions for the writ. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Soriano, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. 1474 <em>(Soriano).) </em>A claim that the defendant was deprived of effective representation of counsel is not an appropriate basis for relief by writ of <em>coram nobis </em>and must be raised on appeal or by petition for writ of habeas corpus instead. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1477.)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\"><em>Soriano </em>provides the closest analogy to this case. The defendant there filed in the appellate court both an appeal from denial of a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>and an original petition for writ of habeas corpus. In taking the plea, the trial court had advised the defendant, in the language of section 1016.5, that his guilty plea could have immigration consequences. Responding to the court\u2019s query if he understood, he said \u201cyes.\u201d In the superior court <em>coram nobis </em>proceedings he claimed that, despite his assent, his English comprehension was limited and he did not understand the proceedings or the consequences. <em>(Soriano, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1473-1476.) He also presented evidence that his attorney had advised him he would not be deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">On appeal from the superior court\u2019s denial of <em>coram nobis, Soriano </em>affirmed the court\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s English skills were sufficient to understand the warning. <em>(Soriano, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. 1477.) The court addressed the ineffective counsel claims in the habeas proceeding, granting the relief sought. Uncontradicted evidence showed that counsel lacked sufficient knowledge of immigration law to provide appropriate advice about the consequences of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 1480-1482.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Unlike defendant Soriano, Mora based his superior court claim entirely upon counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective representation. He seeks here, for the first time, to recast his superior court proceedings as a hybrid inquiry, as if it had focused in part upon his own ignorance of the immigration consequences of his plea and in part on counsel\u2019s advice. However, unlike defendant Soriano, Mora did not present to the superior court a factual claim that he did not understand the standard warning dictated by section 1016.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Ignoring how he argued the case below, Mora makes a valiant claim here that inquiry into the state of his knowledge was a more significant component of the proceedings in superior court than was examination of counsel\u2019s performance. However, we fail to see any aspect of the proceedings below that addressed something other than counsel\u2019s breach of his duty to provide complete and accurate advice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude that the proceedings below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>however captioned, were in the nature of habeas corpus. Mora may not appeal the court\u2019s denial order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">\n<em>Gallardo\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Appellant having failed to successfully show cause, the appeal is dismissed.
