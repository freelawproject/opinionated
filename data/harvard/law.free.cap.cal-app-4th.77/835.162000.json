Kroupa appeals from the judgment entered against them after a bench trial. The judgment included an award of $12,089.01 plus prejudgment interest on lessor\u2019s cross-complaint for breach of the lease, and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to all defendants totaling $415,969.88.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The appellate issues relate to the sufficiency of the trial court\u2019s statement of intended decision, violations of section 2985.8 of the Vehicle Leasing Act (the Act), violation of the federal Truth in Lending Act, and the amount of the award for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">We conclude there was a violation of the Act, and reverse the judgment with remand for a determination of the amount of the respondents\u2019 liability to Kroupa under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">On July 14, 1991, Kroupa leased a 1991 Ford pickup from defendant Sunrise Ford. At the time, Kroupa had two vehicles, a 1990 Ford truck on which Kroupa owed almost $18,000, and a 1991 Ford Escort under lease from another dealer and, according to Kroupa, subject to termination fees of $2,500 (or which he could purchase for approximately $13,000). Both of these vehicles were either tumed-in or traded-in in connection with the lease of the new Ford pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">The sticker or \u201cManufacturers Suggested Retail Price\u201d (MSRP) of the new truck was $21,955, less a $1,000 rebate. The lease did not state the initial lease balance (the value of the vehicle at inception of the lease, referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>by the parties as inception value or capitalized cost), but a formula for its calculation appeared in the lease. Use of the formula shows the inception value placed on the vehicle as $27,210. The lease was for a five-year term, called for total payments over the term of the lease amounting to $33,157.20, and gave Kroupa an option to purchase the truck at the end of the lease term for the greater of its estimated wholesale value (identified elsewhere in the lease as $6,366), or its realized value.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Kroupa did not read the lease, instead relying on the salesman, defendant Dave Huber (Huber), to explain it to them. Defendant Kenneth Lecheminant (Lecheminant), Sunrise Ford\u2019s sales manager, signed the lease for Sunrise Ford on a lease form provided by defendant Lendco Acceptance Corporation (Lendco). Lendco, a lease broker, had an authorized dealer agreement with Sunrise Ford, which did not carry its own portfolio of leases. Lendco was responsible for reviewing leases from the dealer to ensure they complied with the guidelines of the ultimate lessor/assignee, defendant AT&amp;T Automotive Services, Inc. (AT&amp;T). The initial lease was signed on July 17, 1991, and was replaced by a second, corrected lease signed on August 14, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">After two years of the five-year lease term, Kroupa sought to terminate the lease, as they needed a larger vehicle to accommodate a new baby. They found that the lease payoff was then $22,433.00\u2014well in excess of the $20,955.00 list price at which the vehicle could have been purchased outright two years earlier. Mr. Kroupa thereupon filed a complaint with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), obtained access to his file at the dealership, and ultimately filed this lawsuit in May 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Kroupa sued Sunrise Ford, Lecheminant (sales manager), Huber (salesman), Lendco<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and AT&amp;T for fraud, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and tort in se (statutory violations) and, in addition sued Sunrise, Lendco and AT&amp;T for breach of contract, violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and rescission. AT&amp;T cross-complained against Kroupa, alleging breach of the written vehicle lease agreement, wrongful possession and retention of the vehicle, and conversion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">At the heart of Kroupa\u2019s lawsuit was the question how and why the capitalized cost of the vehicle was set at $27,210, instead of at the sticker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>price of $20,955, and whether this was done fraudulently or otherwise in violation of statutory requirements applicable to consumer transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">These additional facts were adduced at trial. The Lendco lease forms contained a separate, detachable worksheet, which was never shown to prospective lessees. In this case, the worksheet showed the capitalized cost of $27,210 and its components. This capitalized cost included a vehicle cost (including \u201cValue Adds\u201d such as additional equipment) of $25,865, plus service contract for $895 and Lendco fee of $450. AT&amp;T\u2019s funding policies allowed it to pay the dealer 110 percent of (a) MSRP and (b) the cost of any added equipment, plus a $250 fee for dealer preparation, a $450 lender\u2019s fee, and a $765 fee for a \u201cProtex Package\u201d (which included oil additives and the like). The initial lease signed by Kroupa and Sunrise Ford was rejected by the lender because it was \u201cover-advanced\u201d by $899.50 (that is, the dealer was asking for more money for the vehicle than could be funded under AT&amp;T\u2019s guidelines). The second, replacement leased signed by Kroupa and Sunrise Ford had slightly lower monthly payments and a slightly higher \u201cdrive away\u201d amount (initial monthly payment, registration fees, etc.). This second lease was also \u201cover-advanced,\u201d by $949.25, but this time the lease was approved by AT&amp;T, apparently because AT&amp;T believed that additional equipment\u2014an alarm, step bumper, and bedliner\u2014had been added to the vehicle, thus increasing its value. That equipment had not in fact been added to the vehicle. A \u201cDue Bill\u201d signed by Mr. Kroupa showed that nothing additional was due or promised, and it was stipulated at trial that the signature on a second Due Bill listing the added equipment was not Mr. Kroupa\u2019s <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sunrise Ford\u2019s file on the Kroupa\u2019s lease also contained two \u201ctrade-in\u201d forms, one for each of Kroupa\u2019s two vehicles. These forms contained Mr. Kroupa\u2019s signature (although, despite the testimony of Kroupa\u2019s own handwriting expert, Mr. Kroupa denied ever seeing or signing them). The trade-in forms show in each case the payoff amount for the vehicle, a lower \u201cagreed price,\u201d the resulting negative equity in each vehicle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>and the customer\u2019s agreement to apply the negative proceeds (totaling $7,819) to a new lease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Kroupa claimed they had been defrauded, and attempted to show that (a) they had assumed the cost of the vehicle was the MSRP sticker price, (b) they understood that the $2,500 they paid to Sunrise Ford ($2,000 in cash and $500 to be paid in a few weeks time) was the fee they had to pay to turn in the 1991 Ford Escort they were leasing; (c) Mr. Kroupa thought he had equity of about $1,500 in the 1990 Ford truck he was trading in, which he believed was reflected in the credit he was given for payment of the \u201cdrive-away\u201d charges on the new lease ($1,321.27 on the initial lease, changed to $1,438.47 on the corrected lease); (d) salesman Huber had told them that after making all payments under the lease ($33,157.20) they would own the vehicle; (e) Kroupa had signed a number of documents in blank (including bills of sale, trade-in payoff and adjustment forms, and powers of attorney); (f) Mr. Kroupa never signed (or that if he did, he signed in blank) the trade-in forms showing Kroupa\u2019s negative equity in their two vehicles; and (g) the removable Lendco worksheet that showed all the relevant figures and calculations was a method of deliberately concealing markups in capitalized cost from the customer. In addition to the fraud claims, Kroupa argued, inter alia, that all the agreements of the parties were required to be disclosed in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Sunrise Ford and Lecheminant, Lendco and AT&amp;T defendants, having dismissed their cross-claims against each other, maintained there was no fraud and that they had complied with all then-effective statutory requirements. They pointed to the two trade-in forms for Kroupa\u2019s two vehicles, and took the position that the trade-ins and the lease were three separate transactions and were properly documented separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">After a lengthy trial, the court on April 11, 1996, filed a statement of intended decision, finding that (a) Kroupa signed the \u201cdocuments in question\u201d with full knowledge, (b) the defendants were \u201cfair in disclosure\u201d and there was no fraud, (c) the federal truth-in-lending laws did not apply, (d) there was no violation of Vehicle Code section 11705, subdivision (a)(14)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (e) none of the defendants had any obligation to disclose the capitalized cost, which Kroupa could compute based on other figures in the lease. The trial judge told Kroupa at a posttrial hearing that \u201cit comes down to the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>that I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d The statement of intended decision also awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to defendants and to AT&amp;T as cross-complainant, in amounts to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On April 24, 1996, Kroupa filed objections to the proposed judgment prepared by AT&amp;T, and a request that a statement of decision, together with supporting facts and law, be filed as to some 73 \u201cprincipal controverted issues.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At a hearing on April' 26, 1996, on attorneys\u2019 fees, the court, in response to Kroupa\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement that she had filed a request for statement of decision, said that his statement of intended decision was his decision and that he was \u201cnot going to do it twice.\u201d In its judgment filed May 17, 1996, the court awarded defendant AT&amp;T $12,089.01 plus prejudgment interest on its cross-complaint against Kroupa for breach of the lease, and awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to all defendants \u201cpursuant to contract and pursuant to Civil Code \u00a7\u00a7 2988.9 and 2983.4\u201d in the full amount of each of their requests, totaling $415,969.88. At a hearing on June 28, 1996, the trial court denied Kroupa\u2019s motion for a new trial, and on July 18, 1996, Kroupa filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Kroupa does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusions on the fraud and misrepresentation counts, but insists that the trial court\u2019s statement of intended decision was defective, and that the court erred as a matter of law in finding there were no statutory violations. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">A. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Statement of Intended Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">After the trial court filed its statement of intended decision, Kroupa timely requested a statement of decision. Among the 73 controverted issues specified by counsel were a number of items related to the question whether the lease complied with the requirement of section 2985.8 of the Act that all lease contracts must \u201ccontain in a single document all of the agreements of the lessor and lessee with respect to the obligations of each party.\u201d Nowhere in its statement of intended decision did the trial court address this issue. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>did it otherwise respond to Kroupa\u2019s request, other than to state that it had already issued its decision and did not intend to do anything else.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Kroupa\u2019s 73-point request for a statement of decision well may have left something to be desired. Some courts have \u201ccondemn[ed] the practice, engaged in here, of generally requesting a finding on a subject without suggesting the specific factual finding requested.\u201d <em>(McAdams v. McElroy </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 985, 993 [133 Cal.Rptr. 637].) Nonetheless, the trial court\u2019s cavalier dismissal of Kroupa\u2019s request without any apparent analysis is likewise less than satisfactory. On the other hand, while the trial court did not follow mandated procedures, it is also the case that where \u201conly a pure question of law is presented, the court need not issue a statement of decision.\u201d <em>(Earp v. Earp </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1008, 1012 [283 Cal.Rptr. 43].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In this case, the relief sought on appeal is reversal and entry of judgment against respondents for statutory violations. Since the applicability of a statute presents a question of law which we may review de novo <em>(Uniroyal Chemical Co. v. American Vanguard Corp. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 285, 292 [249 Cal.Rptr. 787]), and since we conclude there was a statutory violation requiring reversal, as to which no further factfinding is required, we see no point in requiring a further statement of decision from the trial court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">B. <em>The Lease Violated the Vehicle Leasing Act, Civil Code Section 2985.8</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The Act requires (and required at the time of this transaction in 1991) that every lease contract: \u201cshall contain in a single document all of the agreements of the lessor and lessee with respect to the obligations of each party.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2985.8, now \u00a7 2985.8, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Kroupa had two vehicles on July 17, 1991, when they came to Sunrise Ford to see about purchasing or leasing a Ford pickup truck. At the conclusion of the transaction later that day, Kroupa had traded and/or turned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>those two vehicles to Sunrise Ford, and had a lease for a new 1991 Ford truck. The trade-in forms apparently signed by Mr. Kroupa show the agreed price at which Mr. Kroupa would sell the vehicles to the dealer, the payoff amount (in each case, more than the sales price), and the resulting negative equity in each vehicle. Each form also indicates Mr. Kroupa\u2019s agreement to apply the negative proceeds from the two vehicles (totaling $7,819) to the new lease. The lease itself, however, does not refer to the fact that the negative proceeds from the two vehicles have been rolled over into the new lease. Neither the lease nor the trade-in forms refer to the $2,500 ($2,000 in cash and $500 promised) that Mr. Kroupa paid to Sunrise Ford in connection with the trade-in of the vehicles. The lease also does not mention the $1,000 rebate on the new truck, although it is noted on one of the trade-in forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">There are no reported cases interpreting this, or any other provision of the Act. However, we think it is patent that there was a single transaction in this case, and that there is <em>not </em>a single document that contains \u201call of the agreements\u201d of Sunrise Ford and Kroupa with respect to their obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">It is plain from the face of the trade-in forms that Mr. Kroupa, whether he understood it or not, was agreeing to apply the negative proceeds of the two trade-ins to his new lease. The forms he signed read: \u201cCustomer Agrees to Apply proceeds &lt;$3,839&gt; to New Lease\u201d (for the 1990 truck) and \u201cCustomer Agrees to Apply proceeds &lt;$3,980&gt; to New Lease\u201d (for the 1991 Ford Escort). Moreover, we cannot believe that Sunrise Ford would have agreed to either trade-in without the lease, or that Mr. Kroupa would have agreed to the lease without the trade-ins (which were necessary to eliminate his obligations on the other two vehicles). Accordingly, we cannot agree that there were \u201cthree separate transactions.\u201d Indeed, Sunrise Ford\u2019s (and AT&amp;T\u2019s) own descriptions of the transaction in their briefs make it quite clear that the negative proceeds from the trade-ins were very much a part of the lease. Sunrise Ford says: \u201cSunrise Ford was assuming the negative equity owed by plaintiffs and those contracts would have to be paid off by Sunrise Ford. Sunrise Ford passed this negative amount onto the assignee-lessor [AT&amp;T] in the form of a higher capitalized] cost and the lessor reimbursed Sunrise Ford when it paid the higher price for purchasing the vehicle. The lessor then charged the negative [equity] back to the plaintiffs in the form of higher payments on the higher cap cost.\u201d Essentially the same explanation of the transactions appears in AT&amp;T\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The lease does not refer in any way, anywhere, to Sunrise Ford\u2019s admitted agreement to \u201cassum[e] the negative equity owed by plaintiffs\u201d or to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>lessor\u2019s admitted charge of \u201cthe negative [equity] back to the plaintiffs in the form of higher payments . . . .\u201d Sunrise Ford and AT&amp;T argue that the Act in 1991 contained no specific requirement that a lease form contain a separate item for \u201cnegative equity.\u201d That is so, but irrelevant. The statute required that all agreements between the parties appear in a single document, <em>and </em>it <em>also </em>required that every contract contain the 18 \u201cseparate items\u201d specifically listed in the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We reject the implicit suggestion that, if a point of agreement between lessor and lessee is not on the \u201cseparate items\u201d list, it may be omitted entirely from the lease. If that were so, there would be no reason for the Legislature to have stated the \u201csingle document\u201d requirement in the first place.  It is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that, \u201cwhenever possible, significance must be given to every word in pursuing the legislative purpose, and the court should avoid a construction that makes some words surplusage.\u201d <em>(Agnew v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 310, 330 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 423, 981 P.2d 52].) We adhere to that rule here.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">We are mindful that the Act was amended in 1997, and now requires a separate statement specifically labeled \u201cItemization of Gross Capitalized Cost,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny outstanding prior credit or lease balance\u201d is one of the items specifically required to be disclosed in that itemization. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2985.8, subd. (c)(2)(D).) Our decision, of course, is not based on these specific disclosure requirements, which were not in effect at the time of Kroupa\u2019s lease (and which also contain specific labeling, location, and circumscription requirements).  We decide solely on the basis of the then effective provision of the statute requiring all of the agreements of the lessor and the lessee to be contained in a single <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The facts concerning Kroupa\u2019s trade-ins or turn-ins, including Mr. Kroupa\u2019s cash payment, any rebates and Sunrise Ford\u2019s agreement to assume the remaining negative equity and charge it back to Kroupa in the form of higher payments in the lease, were required to be reflected in some way, somewhere, in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>C., D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for a determination of the amount of respondents\u2019 liability under the Vehicle Leasing Act.
