Petition denied and proceeding dismissed, on the merits, without costs or disbursements. Petitioner seeks reimbursement of moneys he paid in defense of what was, in effect, a legal malpractice action brought against him by an indigent criminal defendant to whose case he was assigned pursuant to article 18-B of the County Law. Such reimbursement would be for expenses personally incurred by counsel rather than on behalf of his client. We find no authorization in section 722-b of the County Law for the payment which petitioner seeks (see 1978 Opns St Comp 78-850). Accordingly the relief sought must be denied and the proceeding must be dismissed. Mollen, P. J., Hopkins, Damiani, Titone and Lazer, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
