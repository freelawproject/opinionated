The defendant contended, and asked the judge to rule, that, upon the evidence of Fuchs, the sale and delivery were in Boston; that if the jury believed this evidence, the defendant could not be convicted; and that this would be so, even if Hittle was not authorized by Luce to order and buy the lager beer, provided Fuchs took the order and filled it, as he had testified, in good faith, and the defendant took the .lager beer to Luce, in consequence of such order and Fuchs\u2019s directions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">There was other evidence bearing upon the question whether the sale was made at Boston, or at Dedham, and whether it was to Hittle or Luce.
