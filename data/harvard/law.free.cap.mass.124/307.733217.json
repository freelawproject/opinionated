that herring were accustomed, at a certain season of the year, to pass into and up the brook from the sea, and were annually caught with nets, or otherwise, in greater or less quantities ; and that the title to the land on both sides of the brook, including the bed of the brook, was in the demandants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">The following extracts from the records of the town of East-ham were offered in evidence by the demandants:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-6\">Under a warrant calling a town meeting, March 3, 1873, and containing this article: \u201cTo see what the town will do with the Herring Brook,\u201d \u201c Voted to choose a committee of five to confer with the owners of the land nnar the Herring Brook.\u201d \u201cVoted that Philip Smith and Joshua Cole be added to the committee of last year on Herring Brook.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-7\">Under a warrant calling a town meeting, March 24, 1873: \u201c To see if the town will sell Herring Brook for three years or more, as the town may deem proper, to the highest bidder,\u201d Herring Brook was sold\" to Cornelius Anderson for three years, for $170 per year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-8\">Article 18, in the warrant for a town meeting February 16, 1874, was: \u201c To see what action the town will take in regard to fishing privileges in town.\u201d This was \u201c referred to the Selectmen.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-9\">In the warrant for March meeting 1874 was this article: \u201c To take such action on the Herring Brook as the town shall think expedient and justifiable to the town, and to individuals, and to act very fully on the whole subject of said Herring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Brook.\u201d Under this, the town \u201c voted to warrant and defend the sale of the Herring Brook to Cornelius Anderson, against the claims and demands of all parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-4\">Anderson testified that he caught the fish in Herring Brook, under his purchase from said town, during the three years; and paid the town $170 per year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">It was proved by the demandants and not controverted, that the tenant had claimed to be the sole and exclusive owner of the right to take the herrings in Herring Brook, but it was not contended by the demandants that the tenant had ever claimed any other title to the demanded premises than the sole and exclusive right to the fishery in Herring Brook.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">The demandant Cole testified as follows: \u201c After Anderson bought the fishing privilege of the town for three years, I went in \"with him and four others, and threw our fish together, and I paid one sixth of the $170.00 for the year 1873;\u201d I caught fish there in 1874, but not with Anderson and those with him;

and the issue was submitted to the jury upon evidence offered by both the demandants and the tenant, as to the value of the fish caught within the demanded premises during the three years, considering the value of the whole fish caught by Anderson at $170 per year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-9\">The jury found that .the value of the fish taken by Anderson and those with him, during the three years, for which the town had received the^pay, was $340.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The judge, by consent of parties, before verdict, reported the case for the determination of this court. If, upon these facts, the demandants could maintain this action, judgment was to be entered for them for possession, and for $340 and costs; otherwise, judgment was to be entered for the demandants for possession only, and for the tenant for costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-4\"><em>JS, P. </em>Harriman, for the demandants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-5\"><em>Gr. </em>Mant\u00f3n, for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b328-6\">Lord, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfF\">So far as any question is intended to be raised upon the pleadings in this case, it is probable that the question is whether the tenant has been in such possession of the demanded premises as to exclude the demandants from possession, or to authorize the demandants to elect to consider themselves disseised. We presume that all the evidence deemed material is reported. Upon, this evidence, a jury would not be warranted in finding that the tenant had disseised the demandants or had claimed any title to the soil and freehold. The utmost which the evidence would warrant a jury to find is, that the tenant had claimed an easement in the demanded premises, and had enjoyed the same. This is no answer to .the tenant\u2019s disclaimer. There may be cases, in which the tenant, although disclaiming title, may have had such an actual occupation of the premises as to entitle the demandant to elect to consider himself disseised, although such occupation was by inadvertence, and without any intention to claim title to the soil and freehold. <em>Proprietors of Locks &amp; Canals </em>v. <em>Nashua &amp; Lowell Railroad, </em>104 Mass. 1. But where it is plain that the claim of the tenant is merely an easement, and that he has had no other use than that of such easement the demandant cannot elect to consider himself disseised and recover against the tenant compensation for such use. We are therefore of opinion that the tenant is entitled to its costs, while the demandants are entitled to judgment for possession. <em>Judgment accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
