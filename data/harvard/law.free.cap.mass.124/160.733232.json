Sts. <em>c. </em>63, \u00a7\u00a7 33, 34.

But it does not attempt to compel the creditors to relinquish their existing claims and accept in exchange such certificates of indebtedness, nor to deprive the creditor, who may not elect to accept certificates, \"of any lien or remedy to which he may be entitled by the general laws. <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Eastern Railroad, ante, </em>158. The purpose of the provisions of the statutes first above cited is to make the prompt payment for the land taken a condition of the right of the railroad to use it; for they give to the landowner a claim in the nature of an equitable lien upon the land. This may furnish him a valuable remedy; and we are of opinion that it is not defeated or impaired by the St. of 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\n<em>Decree for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
