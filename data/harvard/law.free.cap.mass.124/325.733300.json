The judge declined so to rule; and instructed the jury that if the defendant, at the time she received the twenty-dollar bill from Brown, took it with the intent of stealing it, and, if she induced Brown to part with the bill, not for the purpose of purchasing the brandy, but for the purpose of converting the bill to her own use, then they should convict her; but if they found that she took it innocently, for the purpose of buying the brandy, and returning the change to Brown, and afterwards conceived the intent \"to convert it to her own use, that this would not be larceny.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions to the refusal of the judge to rule as requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-8\"><em>It. </em>Morris, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-9\"><em>W.

If the possession of such property is obtained by fraud, and the owner of it intends to part with his title as well as his possession, the offence is that of obtaining property by false pretences, provided the means by which they are acquired are such as, in law, are false pretences. If the possession is fraudulently obtained, with intent on the part of the person obtaining it, at the time he receives it, to convert the same to his own use, and the person parting with it intends to part with his possession merely, and not with \u2022 his title to the property, the offence is larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Upon the facts of this case, the jury might well find that the property was obtained by the defendant as stated in the last of these propositions; and the defendant has no cause to complain of the refusal to rule as requested, or of the instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
