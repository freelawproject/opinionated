Thomas Dana, 2d, Charles E. Raymond, William F. Young and William H. Raymond, creditors: John G. Carr, debtor, arrested on execution in your favor, desires to take the oath for the relief of poor debtors, and the eighteenth day of September, 1876, at 1| o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and my office, 47 Court Street, in Boston, in said county, are appointed the time and place for the examination of said debtor. Dated at Boston, the sixteenth day of September, 1876. John E. Fitzgerald, Master in Chancery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHj5\">The plaintiffs were copartners, and the firm was composed of Thomas Dana, and the four persons mentioned in the notice, and they were so set forth in the writ and execution. The attorney upon whom the notice was served was the attorney for the plaintiffs in the original action, and as such caused Carr to be arrested on the execution. Neither the attorney, nor the plaintiffs, or either of them, had any other action or execution against Carr, and after service of said notice was made, and after the discharge of Carr, the attorney went to the office of the magistrate who issued the notice, and before whom Carr appeared for examination, and asked to see, and examined, the original notice. At the expiration of the hour fixed for the examination, the magistrate discharged the debtor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-7\"><em>O.

It contained the names of four of them in full, and stated that the debtor, arrested on execution in their favor, desired to take the poor debtor\u2019s oath, and that a time and place named were appointed for the examination of the debtor. This notice was served in due season on the attorney of the creditors, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the proper person on whom to make service. None of the creditors had any other execution or action against the debtor, nor was the attorney on whom service was made attorney for any other judgment creditor of the debtor. Under these circumstances, it is manifest that there could not have been any mistake or failure to understand what proceedings, or arrest, or execution the notice related to, so that the omission of the name of the fifth creditor from the notice became immaterial. If, under the same circumstances, the notice served on the attorney had been addressed to \u201c Thomas Dana, 2d, and others,\" merely, and had contained the recitations and statements contained in the notice given here, it would be impossible to believe that the attorney could fail to understand what it meant. All that is required, in order to make a notice of application to take the poor debtor\u2019s oath effectual, is, that it contain an intelligible statement or recital of the facts which it is necessary or material for the party, on whom service is to be made, to know. If it contains this, in substance, verbal inaccuracies, and omissions of what might with propriety be included, will not vitiate it. <em>Collins </em>v. Douglass, 1 Gray, 167. <em>Mutual Safety Ins.
