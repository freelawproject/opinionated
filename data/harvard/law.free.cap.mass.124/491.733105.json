Answer, a general denial. The case was submitted to the Superior Court on an agreed statement of facts, in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-11\">The action was defaulted when reached for trial. The defendant filed a suggestion of his bankruptcy, and the plaintiffs moved for a special judgment against the property attached on the writ as the property of the defendant, and then held under the attachment, on the ground that the attachment was not made \u201c within four months next preceding the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.\u2019 The attachment was duly made at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>one o\u2019clock p. m., on September 9, 1876, as appears by the officer\u2019s return. The defendant filed his petition in bankruptcy in the clerk\u2019s office of the District Court of the United States for this district at fifty minutes after three o\u2019clock p. M., on January 9, 1877, as appears by the records. The defendant was duly adjudicated a bankrupt upon the petition, and Dennis F. Flagg was appointed assignee, and became a party to this action for the purpose of opposing the motion of the plaintiffs for a special judgment. If the plaintiffs were entitled to a special judgment, judgment was .to be entered for them for the amount claimed; otherwise, they were to be nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-4\">The Superior Court ruled that the attachment was dissolved, refused to order a special judgment, and ordered a nonsuit.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW-\">The bankrupt act of the United States provides that the filing of the petition shall be deemed the commencement of proceedings in bankruptcy; that the assignment of the bankrupt\u2019s property by the register shall dissolve any attachment \u201c made within four months next preceding the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings; \u201d and that any conveyance by the bankrupt, in fraud of the bankrupt act, \u201cwithin four months before the filing of the petition by or against him,\u201d shall be void. U. S. Rev. Sts. \u00a7\u00a7 4991, 5044, 5128. U. S. St. March 2, 1867, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 35, 38. It has been adjudged by the Supreme Court of the United States that such a conveyance, made on December 8, 1869, was \u201c within four months before \u201d a petition filed on April 8, 1870. <em>Dutcher </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>94 U. S. 553. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>adjudication as to the construction of an act of Congress is conclusive, and renders further discussion superfluous. It necessarily follows that the attachment in the present case, having been made on September 9, 1876, was \u201c within four months next preceding \u201d the commencement of proceedings in bankruptcy by a petition filed on January 9, 1877, and that the judgment of nonsuit must be <em>Affirmed. </em>\u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
