Writ dated March 14, 1877. Answer, a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Gardner, </em>J., it appeared that the case in which the bond was given was tried in the Superior Court without a jury, on December 27, 1876; that the judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $798; that on the same day the defendant filed exceptions and presented them to the judge who tried the case; that on December 28, the judge disallowed the exceptions, and adjudged them frivolous, immaterial and intended for delay; that on the same day, being the last day of the term, judgment was entered under a general order of the court in all cases not continued absolutely or <em>nisi; </em>and that on January 8, 1877, the plaintiff took out execution, which was afterwards returned in no part satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-8\">It was admitted, that Haney, on January 16, 1877, after due notice to the plaintiff, filed in this court a petition, verified by affidavit, to establish the truth of his exceptions, which was pending, without any steps taken thereon, until November, 1877, when it was dismissed for want of prosecution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-9\">The record of the original action showed no special order of 4 judgment or execution, nor any order, except as above recited, nor any notice, minute or suggestion that the defendant contemplated filing the petition to prove his exceptions; and the judgment, entered on December 28, 1876, remains in full force so far as it ever had any force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The defendants contended, and asked the judge to rule, that there had been no final judgment in the original action, and no breach of the bond; that the plaintiff was not entitled to have judgment and execution therein; that the court had not specially awarded judgment or execution ; and that this action could not be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-4\">But the judge refused so to rule, and ruled that the action could be maintained.

Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>115, \u00a7\u00a7 9-11. At the expiration of thirty days from that judgment, the plaintiff was therefore entitled to bring this action. Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>123, \u00a7 104. And as, at the time of the trial thereof, the petition to establish the truth of the exceptions had been dismissed for want of prosecution, there was no shadow of a reason why judgment should not be rendered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled, <em>with double costs and twelve per cent, in* terest.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
