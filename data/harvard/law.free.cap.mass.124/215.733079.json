S. Rev. Sts. \u00a7 5044, by an assignment in bankruptcy under proceedings commenced by him within four months after the attachment; although the sum had been assigned by him before it was earned by an assignment not recorded as required by the St. of 1865, c. 43, \u00a7 2.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">Contract upon two promissory notes signed by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., Samuel R.

Williams.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-8\">After the service of the writ upon the trustee, a petition in bankruptcy was filed by the defendant in the District Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts within four months of that time, namely, on August 21, 1876, upon which the defendant was, on August 25, adjudged a bankrupt, and the proceedings in bankruptcy under said petition are still pending, and on September 12, 1876, William Eaton was duly chosen and qualified as assignee in bankruptcy of the estate of the defendant, and an assignment of all the estate, real and personal, of the bankrupt was duly made to him, and he appeared and was made a party claimant in this case. The trustee moved for his discharge by reason of these proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-9\">The plaintiff offered to show that the funds or credits in the hands of the trustee came to be and are held by him as follows: On or about June 5,1875, the defendant contracted to build certain houses for the trustee, and to perform all the work and furnish the materials for the same for a given sum payable in instalments. On January 13, 1876, and while the work was going on and unfinished, and before all the instalments had become due and payable, the defendant, in writing, assigned to Charles H. Williams all such sums of money as should thereafter be or become due, owing or payable to him under the contract, and also all sums thereafter due, owing or payable for extra work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>done and for extra materials furnished upon and for the houses from the trustee. This assignment has never been recorded, but the assignee has notified the trustee thereof, and claims the funds or credits in the hands of the trustee, and has appeared in this action as adverse claimant. After the assignment to Williams, sums became due and payable under the contract from the trustee, and also for extra work and materials furnished. The plaintiff contended that, upon these facts, the trustee should be charged; but the judge ruled that these facts, if proved, would be immaterial, and that the trustee should be discharged. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-4\"><em>A. QTmrehill Bl. E.
