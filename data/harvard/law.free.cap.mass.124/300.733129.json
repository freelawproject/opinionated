S. St. of June 22, 1874, \u00a7 17, is no defence to an action on a debt included therein, if the amount of the composition has not been paid or tendered to the creditor, and he has not waived such payment or tender, nor taken any part in the proceedings for a composition.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">Contract upon three promissory notes for $1000 each, dated respectively October 11, 1869, June 1, 1870, and January 27, 1871, payable to the order of the plaintiff and signed by the defendants as copartners under the name of Royal Gilkey &amp; Co. The defendant Gilkey (the other defendant having been defaulted) filed an answer setting up a composition in bankruptcy with his creditors, including the plaintiff, under the U. S.

S. St. of June 22, 1874, \u00a7 17, and notice to all creditors named in the statement filed by Gilkey, which contained the name and address of the plaintiff as a creditor of Gilkey &amp; Co., but not as of a firm composed of Gilkey and Stickney. Stickney was not mentioned in or made a party to, or notified of the proceedings in bankruptcy, or the composition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-9\">The plaintiff was not made a party to the bankruptcy proceedings, except as hereinbefore stated, and did not attend, either by himself or- attorney, any of the meetings of the creditors, or vote in regard to the compromise, or sign any consent thereto. The money alleged to have been tendered to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tiff was not paid or brought into court, and there was no evidence of the tender, excepting that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated at the trial that he would make no question as to the tender if the defendant would pay the money into court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">Upon these facts the judge found for the plaintiff; and or-\u2019 dered judgment accordingly.
