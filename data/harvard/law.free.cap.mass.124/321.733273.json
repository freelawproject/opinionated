The evidence as to this was conflicting. A witness for the government testified, upon cross-examination, that there was but one express in the town; that he was the driver of an express wagon and took orders weekly from the defendant for goods; that he made the delivery of such goods as came by railroad to the defendant. He was then asked by the defendant to describe the packages so delivered during the time covered by the complaint. The attorney for the government objecting, the defendant stated that he proposed to show by the witness, that all the goods so brought and delivered by him were in barrels, and were marked \u201c Non-intoxicating Brunswick Hop Beer,\u201d and that lager beer is universally put up in bottles, and in cases or in kegs, and never in barrels, and so sold and delivered. The judge excluded the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-8\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-9\"><em>J.
