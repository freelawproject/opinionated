Pond, and on its back by the defendants, and indorsed by Drury to the plaintiff. Writs dated May 6, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-9\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Aldrich, </em>J., the plaintiff introduced evidence that the note was signed by Pond and indorsed by the defendants, and in that condition was delivered to Drury by Pond for a debt due from Pond to Drury; and that thereafter Drury indorsed the note to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-10\">The defendants contended and offered to prove by paroi that they put their names on the note with the intention, both of themselves and the payee of the note, that they should assume the responsibility of indorsers only, and not as original promisors, and that the payee consented to accept and did accept the note, in pursuance of an agreement with the defendants that he would hold and treat them as indorsers only, and not as original promisors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-11\">The defendants further contended, and offered to prove by paroi, that they put their names on the note as sureties for the maker, without consideration, and that the payee, knowing this relation of suretyship, accepted the same; and that the payee and the plaintiff, with knowledge of the suretyship, gave to the maker, without the knowledge and consent of the defendants, a long and unreasonable extension of time in which to pay the note, and by such gross negligence and loches in other respects so lessened, embarrassed and destroyed the defendants\u2019 rights and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>remedies against the maker, as to discharge them from all liability on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-3\">The plaintiff objected to the admission of this evidence, and the judge excluded it, ruled that the defendants were liable as original promisors, and directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-4\"><em>B. W.

They must, therefore, be considered as original promisors, and paroi evidence was not admissible to show that this was not their real contract. <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>8 Met, 504. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>99 Mass. 179. <em>Way </em>v. <em>Butterworth, </em>108 Mass. 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The evidence offered of an extension of time given to the maker in which to pay the note, and of \u201c negligence and loches in other respects,\u201d was not admissible. Assuming that the defendants were sureties only, and that the plaintiff knew it, he was not under any duty to them as regards promptness in enforcing the collection of the note. If he had made a valid contract, on which a remedy could have been had against him, by which he gave time to the principal on the note, without the knowledge or consent of the sureties, that would have discharged them. The defendants did not offer to prove that such contract had been made, but only an extension of time by delay. This, if proved, would not have constituted a defence. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Bridgham, </em>2 Pick. 581. <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Bodwell, </em>5 Gray, 457. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Foot, </em>11 Met. 285. <em>Agricultural Bank </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>6 Gray, 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled </em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\"> The St. of 1874, <em>c. </em>404, which took effect on July 30, 1874, is as follows: \u201c All persons becoming parties to promissory notes payable on time by a signature in blank on the back thereof shall be entitled to notice of the non-payment thereof the lame as indorsers.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
