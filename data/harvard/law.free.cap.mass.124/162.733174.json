The judge admitted all of the foregoing evidence <em>de lene.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">The plaintiff testified that, before bringing this suit, he made search of the city clerk\u2019s records, and found no assignment recorded of John Keever or Germain Sirois; that the defendant\u2019s name was Germain Siroit, sometimes spelt Sirois, and he had been called John Keever; that the name of \u201c Siroit \u201d was sometimes translated into English as \u201c King,\u201d but that he did not know the name of Germain to be translated into English; that the pronunciation of \u201c Siroit \u201d or \u201c Sirois \u201d was Syroa, the letter \u201c t \u201d or \u201c s \u201d being silent. It was not contended by the claimants that the two names were <em>idem sonantes.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-8\">The claimants asked the judge to rule that, there being no fraud, and the bookkeeper having written the name as he understood it, the only question was one of identity; that it was competent for them to prove that the defendant was the person who gave the assignment; and that upon the evidence they were entitled to the funds in the hands of the trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>But the judge declined to rule as requested, and ruled that the statute requiring an assignment to he recorded was for the purpose of giving notice to creditors ; that this assignment, when recorded, gave no notice to creditors that the defendant, who was working for the trustee under the name of John Keever, had assigned his earnings; that the evidence offered was not competent to set up the assignment and defeat the plaintiff\u2019s attachment of the funds in the trustee\u2019s hands; and ordered that the trustee be charged.

The defendant is a Frenchman unable to speak, write or understand our language, and, as he signed the instrument with his mark only, it may be inferred that he was not able to discover the mistake as to his name, upon inspection of the document. The person whom he em ployed to write it for him signed the name as he understood it on hearing it pronounced, and the defendant, by the act of affixing his mark and giving the paper so signed to the claimants, must be understood to have adopted the mistaken signature as his own. There is therefore no uncertainty as to the identity of the person making the assignment, or of the fund which he intended to assign. So far as it concerns the defendant and the claimants only, it was a valid <em>assignment; </em>and, if acknowledged and accepted by the trustee, it would be binding upon the trustee also. <em>Gifford </em>v. Rockett, 121 Mass. 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">It is true that, owing to the confusion and uncertainty as to the pronunciation and spelling of the defendant\u2019s name, the registration of the assignment fails to give to his other creditors the notice which was intended to be provided for by the St. of 1865, <em>c. </em>43, \u00a7 2. But it is not a case of the use of the name of another person, or of the fraudulent use of a fictitious name, or a dishonest attempt to conceal the fact that such an assignment had been made. On the contrary, it was a <em>bond fide </em>attempt to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>with the statute. As between the original parties, the claimants, the defendant and the trustee, there was no confusion as to identity, and no want of certainty, and the transaction was perfectly valid. If so, all that remained to make it valid against all other persons was that it should be recorded as prescribed by the statute above referred to. It cannot be said that the plain- ' tiff has been misled by anything that has happened, or that, in the conflicting claims of creditors, there is any special equity in his favor as compared with the claimants. It is not suggested that there is any other person living having the name that is subscribed to the assignment. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
