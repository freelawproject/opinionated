At the trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before <em>Rockwell, </em>J., the defendant contended that the writing on the back of the note would not prevent the original note from being barred by the statute of limitations, but the judge ruled otherwise, and ordered judgment for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-13\">\n<em>J.

Sts. <em>e. </em>155, \u00a7 4. We are not aware of any case which can be said to be decisive of this question. But there are two cases decided by this court which illustrate it, and which will furnish us some aid in deciding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>In <em>Gray v. Bowden, </em>23 Pick. 282, it was held that a memorandum on the back of a promissory note, in these words, \u201c I acknowledge the within note to be just and due,\u201d signed by the maker and attested by a witness, was not a promissory note signed in the presence of an attesting witness, within the statute of limitations. The reason given was that \u201c there are no express promissory words. It is not therefore a note in writing promising to pay money, or a promissory note. It is merely an acknowledgment, from which a promise might be inferred, so as to take the old note out of the statute, which would extend it six years, but not an attested note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In <em>Commonwealth Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>1 Met. 21, it was held that a memorandum written on a note by the maker in these words, \u201c For value received, I hereby acknowledge this note to be due, and promise to pay the same on demand,\u201d and signed in the presence of an attesting witness, was a promissory note within the statute. The court state that the term \u201c promissory note \u201d in the statute is not to be limited strictly to negotiable notes, but was intended to apply to any note in writing by which one promises to pay money to another, and that the memorandum was a promissory note for these reasons: \u201c It is made on good consideration, viz., the payment of an existing note, then near \u2022being barred, and purports to be for value received. It is a .\u00a1promise to pay a sum of money on demand. The sum and the .name of the payee are not expressed in words; but they are \u00a1expressed with equal exactness and certainty by reference to the note on the same paper. <em>Grinnell </em>v. <em>Baxter, 17 </em>Pick. 386. It is a new promise, in writing, on a good consideration, to pay a certain sum of money to a certain company on demand, and signed in the presence of an attesting witness. It is a note, on which, if properly set out in a declaration, an action would lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABT\">It is readily seen that the case at bar falls between the two cases we have cited above, and near the dividing line. Upon which side of the line it falls is a question not free from difficulty ; but, upon the whole, we are of opinion that it is within the principle of <em>Commonwealth Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The test question is, Are the words of the memorandum merely an acknowledgment admitting that an old debt is due, or do they import a promise by the defendant to pay money to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s intestate ? If they import a promise, then here, as in <em>Commonwealth Ins. Co. </em>v. Whitney, there is a good consideration, and the sum, the name of the payee and the time are expressed with certainty by reference to the original note on the same paper. The words, \u2022\u201c I renew the within note,\u201d mean something more than the words, \u201c I admit the within note to be due.\u201d A common meaning of the word \u201c renew \u201d is to make again, as to renew a treaty or a covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Suppose the parties to a lease should, at its expiration, indorse upon the lease the words, \u201cWe hereby renew the within lease \"for one year.\u201d Would not this be a present promise to perform the terms of the lease for the time named ? If the defendant had written out in full the promise to pay the amount of the old note, on demand with interest, he might properly describe this as a \u201crenewal,\u201d as he did in his note of December, 1860. By the brief and comprehensive phrase, \u201c I hereby renew the within note,\u201d we think he intended the same thing, and that it imports that he promises anew to pay the amount of the note, and not merely an admission that the old note is unpaid. It follows that the note in suit was not barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Warren Academy </em>v. <em>Starrett, </em>15 Maine, 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
