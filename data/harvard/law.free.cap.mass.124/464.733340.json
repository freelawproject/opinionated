Prior to the passage of this order, all the owners of estates abutting on said sidewalk had paid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>sums which the highway commissioner had reported to be their respective proportions in pursuance of the first, named order. No other assessment was ever made for the construction of said sidewalk. The highway commissioner had reported to the treasurer that the proportion of expense to be paid by the plaintiff was the same as afterwards assessed by this order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-4\">The amount assessed to the plaintiff was a proportionate part of the whole of said expense, in comparison with the amounts paid by the other abutters, having reference to the length of line on- the sidewalk of the respective estates abutting thereon ; and, at the time of the construction of the sidewalk, the other estates were liable to assessment in the same manner as the plaintiff\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\">The St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>390,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> had been before that time duly accepted by the city.

Whenever the city council shall adjudge that the public convenience and necessity require that a sidewalk be laid out and established in the city of Worcester, the order for laying out and establishing the same, with a written description of the boundaries, admeasurements, grades and heights of the curbstones thereof shall be filed in the office of the city engineer, and shall remain on file seven days, at least, before the passage by either board of the order laying out and establishing said sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">41 Section 2.

And the city treasurer forthwith, after receiving the report of the commissioner of highways of the expense and outlays made by him in constructing a sidewalk laid out as aforesaid, shall demand payment in writing of the several abutters of the sums severally due from them to the city under this ordinance, and, in case such sums remain _ unpaid at the expiration of one month after such demand, the treasurer shall cause the same to be collected by resort to the proper legal process.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-6\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akqe\">The general authority, conferred by the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>390, upon the city council of Worcester, to assess the cost of constructing sidewalks upon the abutters thereon, is subject only to the limitation prescribed by the Constitution that the assessments shall be proportional and reasonable. The order of the city council in 1873 contains, in substance and effect, an assessment upon the plaintiff and all other abutters of their proportions of a certain sum, being the amount of the expense of constructing the sidewalk in question, an adjudication that a definite part of that sum is the plaintiff\u2019s proportion of such expense and shall be collected of him according to law, and a statement that the other abutters have already paid their proportions, so that no further or more particular order as to them is necessary. The amount assessed upon the plaintiff is agreed to have been a proportional part of the expense of constructing the side<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>walk, and there is nothing to show that it was unreasonable. The previous proceedings were in strict accordance with the ordinance of the city, and it need not be considered whether they might of themselves be held to constitute a valid assessment. If there was any illegality in the assessment, the law affords an adequate remedy for revising it, by writ of certiorari. The statute is not unconstitutional, by reason of omitting to provide for a trial by jury, or of committing the laying of the assessment to the city council; and there is nothing in the case stated to show that the plaintiff has suffered any wrong by the proceedings complained of. <em>Howe </em>v. Cambridge, 114 Mass. 388. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>112 Mass. 541. <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>New Orleans, </em>96 U. S. 97. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
