The judge, in his charge to the jury, said: \u201c The true construction of that interrogatory and answer is, not that the specific things done by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate were done in the mode prescribed by the defendant, but that the work which the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was doing, at the time the injury was sustained, was done under the direction and supervision of the defendant.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the judge merely stated to the jury the only legal meaning that the words of the answer in question would bear; and that the plaintiff had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-10\">Tort by the administratrix of the estate of Dennis Fay, for injuries received by him while in the employ of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Trial in this court, at September term 1877, before <em>Lord, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-4\">The defendant was erecting a large building in Boston, the walls and outer foundations of which were laid in a trench dug for that purpose.

The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was employed by the defendant to dig holes in the vicinity of these temporary posts, in which brick piers were to be laid. Two of these holes had been dug two days before the accident. On December 3, 1874, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was employed to dig near the third post, and one Dolan to do the same near the fourth. While the men were at work the girder fell, causing the injuries complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">The defendant testified that he marked on the ground where Fay was to dig, and instructed him how to dig; that the first two holes were dug according to his direction; that, on the morning of the accident, he was in' and out where Fay was at work, every few minutes, and that he saw Fay digging too near the post, and called out to him, but he did not appear to hear; and that he then went towards him, and that, as he was approaching, he saw Fay strike with his shovel against the plank on which the post rested, and, as he did so, the girder and beams came down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">In May, 1875, the following interrogatories to the defendant were filed, and answers made by him :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\"><em>Ques. </em>\u201c1.
