That in November, 1875, the plaintiff, having manufactured said goods, was ready to deliver the same to said Sargent, when said Sargent informed him by letter that he did not want said goods, and instructed him not to deliver them. That thereupon the plaintiff, being unable to account for this conduct on the part of said Sargent, and being anxious to know if said conduct proceeded from any inability on the part of said Sargent to meet his. payments, and not knowing whether to rescind his contract with said Sargent or not, inquired of the defendant for some explanation of said conduct and respecting the character and circumstances of said Sargent; and the defendant, in order to induce the plaintiff to sell and deliver said goods to said Sargent on credit, falsely rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>resented to the plaintiff in writing, that he knew very little of Baid Sargent\u2019s business, that he had no reason to doubt said Sargent\u2019s responsibility, that his rent and other payments due to him, said defendant, by said Sargent, had been made promptly by said Sargent, and that he did not fully comprehend said letter from said Sargent to the plaintiff; and thereupon the plaintiff, believing said representations to be true, was induced to sell and deliver, and did sell and deliver, said goods to said Sargent, and was induced to give and gave the said Sargent credit for the price of said goods for thirty days from delivery thereof; but when the defendant made the representations aforesaid, he was fully and thoroughly acquainted with said Sargent\u2019s business, and had reason to doubt said Sargent\u2019s responsibility; his rent and other payments due to the defendant had not been promptly paid by said Sargent, and said defendant did fully comprehend said letter from said Sargent to the plaintiff, and said Sargent was then insolvent, and not fit to be trusted with goods on credit,, all whereof the defendant then knew.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-4\">\u201c And the plaintiff further says that he has not been paid for said goods, nor for any part thereof, and is unable to obtain payment therefor, and he is likely to lose the same, wherefore the plaintiff says he is damaged to the amount of the price of said goods as set forth, and the interest thereon, and therefore he brings his suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">The third count of the declaration, as amended, was as follows: \u201cAnd the plaintiff says, that on or about the first day of July, 1875, the defendant, fraudulently intending to deceive and injure the plaintiff, and to get the plaintiff\u2019s goods into his own possession and to enjoy the same, requested the plaintiff to manufacture for, and sell and deliver to, one Osborne N. Sargent, on credit, certain goods as specified in the account hereto annexed, and the defendant then, though knowing that the said Sargent was in bad and insolvent circumstances, and unfit to be trusted with goods on credit, but fraudulently intending as aforesaid, falsely and fraudulently represented to the plaintiff that the said Sargent was a good man in good circumstances, and fit to be trusted with goods on credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">\u201c And the plaintiff says, that in consequence of the representations so made by the defendant, he, believing the said Sargent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>to be in good circumstances and fit to be trusted as aforesaid, contracted with said Sargent to manufacture for, and sell and deliver to him, on a credit of thirty days from delivery, goods in accordance with the samples then and there by the plaintiff to him exhibited and as set forth in the account hereto annexed, to be delivered in the following November.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-4\">\u201c And the plaintiff further says that thereafter, and before said goods were sold and delivered to said Sargent, and about the end of the month of October following, said Sargent wrote to him telling him that he did not want said goods, and instructed him not to deliver them, and the plaintiff, being unable to account for this conduct on the part of said Sargent, and being anxious to know if said conduct proceeded from any inability on the part of said Sargent to pay for said goods, and not knowing whether or not to rescind his contract with said Sargent, inquired of the defendant for some explanation of said conduct, and respecting the character and financial circumstances of said Sargent, and the defendant, fraudulently intending as aforesaid, falsely and fraudulently represented to the plaintiff in writing that he knew very little of said Sargent\u2019s business, that he had no reason to doubt said Sargent\u2019s responsibility, that his rent and other payments due to him, said defendant, by said Sargent, had been paid promptly by said Sargent, and that he, said defendant, did not fully comprehend said letter from said Sargent to the plaintiff; and thereupon the plaintiff, believing said representations to be true, was induced to sell and deliver, and did sell and deliver, said goods to said Sargent, and was induced to give and gave the said Sargent credit for the price of said goods for thirty days from said delivery; but when the defendant made the representations aforesaid, he was fully and thoroughly acquainted with said Sargent\u2019s business, and had reason to doubt said Sargent\u2019s responsibility, his rents and other payments due to the said defendant had not been paid promptly by said Sargent, and said defendant did fully comprehend said letter from said Sargent to the plaintiff, and said Sargent was then insolvent and not fit to be trusted with goods, all whereof the defendant then knew, but in representing as aforesaid, the defendant fraudulently intended as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201c And the plaintiff says that on or about the sixteenth day of November, 1874, said Sargent had mortgaged to the defendant all the goods and merchandise. then in his possession, and also any other goods which, from time to time during the existence of such mortgage, should be purchased by said Sargent and put in, to replace any part of the stock then in his possession so mortgaged, which might be disposed of, and had agreed that if said goods were diminished faster than the amount secured by said mortgage was paid, that he would furnish further security whenever requested, said mortgage running for a period of four years from its date;

It is alleged in substance that in July the plaintiff contracted with Sargent to manufacture certain goods and deliver them in November on a credit of thirty days. Before the time of delivery arrived, Sargent informed the plaintiff that he did not want the goods, and requested him not to deliver them. The plaintiff, being uncertain whether the-refusal of Sargent arose from his inability to pay for the goods, made inquiries of the defendant respecting the character, conduct and circumstances, of Sargent; the defendant replied in writing stating, among other things, that he had no reason to doubt Sargent\u2019s responsibility, and that the rents and other payments due him from Sargent had been paid promptly; all these representations are alleged to be false and fraudulent, but the plaintiff believing them to be true was induced to deliver the goods to Sargent, and to give him the credit of thirty days after delivery. The plaintiff was under no obligation at that time to deliver the goods under his contract made in July, but could have taken advantage of Sargent\u2019s refusal to receive them, and rescinded his contract. But, if he was induced not to do so by the false and fraudulent representation of the defendant as to the credit and responsibility of Sargent, we see no reason why he should not maintain this action. It is immaterial that the plaintiff delivered the goods under the original contract, if he was induced by the false representations not to rescind it when he could have done so properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The second ground on which the defendant relies is, that the representations made in November were not such that the defendant can be charged by reason thereof, but were such as to put the plaintiff to further inquiry before delivering the goods. It is possible that upon a full disclosure of all the evidence, there may be a question of fact for the jury whether the plaintiff should have made further inquiry, but of that we can know nothing here. It is sufficient to say that the declaration charges that certain representations of fact were made by the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>which are alleged to be false and fraudulent, and we cannot declare as matter of law that the plaintiff should have made fi \"thei inquiry. <em>Demurrer overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
