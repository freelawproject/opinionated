Sts. c. 84, \u00a7 2, and, while so travelling, fastens his horse at the side of a road, and the horse is injured by the negligent act of another in driving against it, the unlawful travelling necessarily contributes to the injury, and an action of tort for such injury cannot be maintained.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">Tobt for injuries to the plaintiff\u2019s horse caused by the alleged negligence of the defendant. Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Bacon, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff hired a horse and carriage on Sunday, August 1, 1875, for the purpose of going from Chicopee to Springfield, to attend a camp-meeting. Upon reaching the camp-ground, the plaintiff hitched his horse at the side of the road behind the defendant\u2019s buggy, and the injury was caused by the defendant\u2019s horse backing the buggy against the plaintiff\u2019s horse. The evidence was conflicting as to whether this backing was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence, or by his horse being suddenly frightened by a buffalo robe hanging from a seat of a passing wagon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">The defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury as follows: \u201c 1. If the jury believe that the accident happened through the negligence of the defendant, while the plaintiff was unlawfully travelling on' the Lord\u2019s day, and that the accident would not have happened if the plaintiff had not been so travel-ling, he cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">\u201c <em>2. </em>If the plaintiff was travelling for pleasure on the Lord\u2019s day, and such travelling contributed to the injury which befell him, he cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-11\">\u201c 8. If the jury believe that the accident happened through the negligence of the defendant, not resulting from the wilful conduct of the defendant, while the plaintiff was unlawfully travelling on the Lord\u2019s day, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-12\">The judge refused so to instruct the jury, but did instruct them as follows: \u201c It makes no difference whether the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>was then in violation of the law relating to the Lord\u2019s day or not. If I am travelling on the wrong side of the road, contrary to law, and a man carelessly and negligently runs into me, I can recover, unless my carelessness contributed to the injury. If the plaintiff went up there for pleasure and received injuries by the defendant\u2019s negligence, he can recover, unless his own carelessness or negligence contributed to the injury.\u201d The judge gave general instructions on the matter of negligence, to which no exceptions were taken. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and found specially that the plaintiff did not go to the camp-meeting with a <em>bond fide </em>intention of attending religious services there. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-4\"><em>O. L. </em>Long, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-5\"><em>\u20acf. B. Robinson, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASJ\">1. The plaintiff was not travelling at the time of the injury to his horse. The illegal act, if any, was over, and he was as much entitled to recover, as if an assault had been committed personally upon him, after he had returned to his home.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-6\">2. If the plaintiff was in violation of law at the time, his act did not contribute to the injury in any legal sense, and he is entitled to recover. It is no answer to this position to say that the injury would not have happened if he had not been travelling. This is not what the law means by \u201c contributing to the injury.\u201d Thus in <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Wesson, </em>6 Gray, 505, the fact that the plaintiff was illegally trotting his horse against the defendant\u2019s horse was held not to prevent recovery for an injury caused by the defendant\u2019s wilfully running into him. So, driving on the wrong side of the street, or standing on a street, though acts in violation of law, do not prevent the plaintiff from recovering while so driving or standing. <em>Spofford </em>v. <em>Harlow, </em>3 Allen, 176. <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Burkhardt, </em>104 Mass. 59. <em>Kearns </em>v. <em>Sowden, </em>104 Mass. 63, note. See also <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Ripley, </em>119 Mass. 135. In all these cases the injury would not have happened had not the plaintiff been illegally where he was. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>120 Mass. 490, is not an authority against this position, for there, as stated by the judge delivering the opinion, it was conceded at the trial that the travelling of the plaintiff was a cause directly contributing to his injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>3. As the plaintiff was attending a religious meeting, he is entitled to recover. <em>Feital </em>v. <em>Middlesex </em>Railroad, 109 Mass. 398,404. It is morally fit and proper to attend a religious meeting, and the motives with which one does so cannot be inquired into.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A6Z\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAD\">In an action of tort for injuries to the plaintiff\u2019s person or property, if his own illegal act or other negligence contributed to his injury, he cannot recover. But he is not precluded from recovering by the fact that he is at the time doing an illegal act, if such illegal act did not contribute to his injury. <em>McGrath </em>v. Merwin, 112 Mass. 467, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">When a man in travelling sustains an injury from a defect in the highway or from an accidental collision with the vehicle of another traveller, his act of travelling is necessarily a contributing cause of the injury. If the act of travelling is unlawful, then his own unlawful act is a contributing cause of his injury, and prevents his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The statute prohibits any person from travelling \u201c on the Lord\u2019s day, except from necessity or charity.\u201d Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>84, \u00a7 2. Whoever travels on the Lord\u2019s day, except from necessity or charity, is acting in violation of the law. Such act of travel-ling itself is unlawful, and if, in the course and as an incident of such travelling, the traveller sustains an injury, his unlawful act necessarily is a contributing cause of the injury. It has, therefore, been uniformly held in this Commonwealth that in such a case the plaintiff cannot maintain an action for his injury. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>120 Mass. 490, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In the case at bar, the defendant requested the court to instruct the jury that \u201c if the plaintiff was travelling for pleasure on the Lord\u2019s day, and such travelling contributed to the injury which befell him, he cannot recover.\u201d The court refused this request, and instructed the jury that \u201c it makes no difference whether the plaintiff was then in violation of the law relating to the Lord\u2019s day or not.\u201d The defendant was entitled to the instruction requested by him, and it was not covered by any of the instructions given. It is true that the court instructed the jury, that \u201c if the plaintiff went up there for pleasure and received injuries by the defendant\u2019s negligence, he can recover, unless his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>own carelessness or negligence contributed to the injury,\u201d implying that, if his own negligence contributed to the injury, he could not recover. But the whole instructions, taken in connection with the refusal to give the instruction requested, would naturally lead the jury to understand that if the unlawful act of the plaintiff in travelling on the Lord\u2019s day contributed to his injury, yet he could recover unless some other negligence on hie part was a contributing cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">A majority of the court is therefore of opinion that the instructions were erroneous. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
