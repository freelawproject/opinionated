The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the defendant, to this court on appeal, on an agreed statement of facts in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-4\">The plaintiff lived in Northampton, in the county of Hamp shire. On October 2, 1876, McGuire caused to be served on W. B. French, who was the plaintiff\u2019s attorney of record in the original action, and who, on August 10, 1876, made an affidavit, before the magistrate authorizing the arrest, of his belief that McGuire had property exempt from being taken on execution which he did not intend to apply to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the following notice, signed by the magistrate:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\">\u201c Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

The attorney must also have known that he was the proper person to be served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>with notice, if the debtor should desire to take the poor debtor\u2019s oath. He knew also that he was not the attorney for William Hill and others, and that he had nothing to do with any execution in favor of William Hill and others against David McGuire, and he did not know, and had no reason to suppose, that there was any such execution in existence. The notice informed him of the name of the debtor, and of the fact that he had been arrested on an execution in which William Hill had an interest as creditor, and in which W. B. French was attorney for the same William Hill. It is impossible to believe that he was misled by the notice, or that he could have failed to understand what execution it was to which the notice related. There is no reason why the strict rules which govern pleadings in criminal cases should be applied to notices of this kind. The time and place of the proposed examination were distinctly pointed out, and, although there was a verbal error in the description of the execution, there was no misnomer of William Hill, the description really created no uncertainty whatever, and ought not to vitiate the proceedings of the magistrate. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>101 Mass. 313. <em>Salmon </em>v. <em>Nation, </em>109 Mass. 216. <em>Way </em>v. O\u2019Sullivan, 106 Mass. 118. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>1 Gray, 167. <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Carr, ante, </em>397. In <em>Slasson </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>20 Pick. 436, which is cited by the plaintiff, there was an entire misnomer of the creditor. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
