The circumstances under which the liquors were found, and the fact that they were apparently concealed, and also the finding of a measure, tunnel and glasses, were proper for the consideration of the jury, as tending to indicate guilt.. It is impossible to say that there was no evidence to authorize the verdict. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
