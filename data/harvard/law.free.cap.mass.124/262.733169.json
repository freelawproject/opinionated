The plaintiff, before accepting the deed, said to the defendant \u201c You have to pay for the filling in; <em>\u201d </em>to which the defendant replied, \u201cAll right, I will pay it.\u201d The plaintiff then accepted the deed and paid the purchase money. An assessment was subsequently laid by the mayor and aldermen upon the land, and the plaintiff paid it. <em>Held, </em>in 'an action for the amount of the assessment, that the evidence disclosed a valid independent agreement by the defendant to pay any assessment for filling which the mayor and aldermen might lay upon the land, conveyed, whether the proceedings, under which the assessment was laid, were regular or not.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">Contract. The declaration contained two counts. The first count was upon the covenant against incumbrances contained in the defendant\u2019s deed to the plaintiff, delivered June 12, 1874, of a parcel of land in Cambridge; and alleged that the plaintiff had been obliged to pay an assessment for filling in the land, levied by the mayor and aldermen of Cambridge under the St. of 1872, <em>e. </em>299; and which was a lien on the land when the deed was made. The second count alleged that the defendant, in consideration of the purchase of the land by the plaintiff, orally promised to pay any assessment that might be laid upon q the land on account of any filling or grading in process at the time the plaintiff bought the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court before Allen, J., without a jury, the plaintiff offered in evidence, under the first count, an attested copy of an order of the mayor and aldermen, dated October 9,1872, requiring the owners of land in a certain district within which was the land sold, to fill in their lands to a specified grade; also a copy of the order making the assessment dated April 19,1876, and a bill of the amount assessed on the land sold, which the plaintiff paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-8\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, 8 of the St. of 1872, <em>o. </em>299, were unconstitutional, and that the assessment was invalid on account of certain alleged irregularities in the proceedings, which it is not necessary now to state in detail, The judge refused to give the rulings requested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Under the second count the evidence in behalf of the plaintiff was as follows: The plaintiff testified that he said to the defendant, \u201cYou have to pay for the filling in;\u201d that the defendant said, \u201c There is no filling, or very little; \u201d that the plaintiff said, \u201c There is some; \u201d and the defendant replied, \u201cAll right, I will pay it.\u201d \u2022 The plaintiff\u2019s wife testified that the defendant said he would pay for the filling; that he would pay the assessments or bills when they came in from the city; that she held the money, the price for the land, and would not pay it over until he said this. Both the plaintiff and his wife testified that this conversation occurred at their lawyer\u2019s office, at the interview when the deed was delivered, and just before it was delivered, and that the deed was read to them. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who took the acknowledgment of the deed, testified that he was present, recollected some such conversation, and that he told them the deed would probably bind Cheevers any way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-4\">The judge ruled that the evidence was sufficient to prove an independent separate promise, not included in the deed, and found for the plaintiff. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-5\"><em>H. Stevens, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-6\"><em>W. B. Durant, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b281-7\">Morto\u00edt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWC\">The presiding justice of the Superior Court who tried this case without a jury, found for the plaintiff upon his second count, upon the ground that the defendant at the time the deed was given made an independent agreement to pay any assessments which the mayor and aldermen of Cambridge might lay for the filling of the land conveyed. There was sufficient evidence to justify this finding, and the case cannot be distinguished from <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Dooley, </em>119 Mass. 294. The several questions raised by the defendant as to the validity and regularity of the proceedings of the city authorities in laying the assessment are immaterial. The whole object of the separate agreement would be defeated if the plaintiff was obliged to contest the regularity of these proceedings, at an expense probably greater than the whole amount of the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
