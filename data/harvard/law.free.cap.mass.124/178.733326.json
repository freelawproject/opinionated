Sts. <em>c. </em>124, \u00a7 10, by the defendant Willcutt as principal, and the other defendant as surety, and conditioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>that Willcutt, who had been arrested on an execution in favor of the plaintiff, should within thirty days from the day of his arrest deliver himself up for examination before some magistrate authorized to act, giving notice of the time and place thereof in the manner provided by law, and appear at the time fixed for his examination, and from time to time until the same was concluded, and not depart without leave of the magistrate, making no default at any time fixed for his examination, and abide the final order of the magistrate thereon. Writ dated November 24, 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-4\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., it appeared that Willcutt delivered himself up before a master in chancery, and was discharged, the plaintiff not appearing. The return of the officer, on the notice to the plaintiff, was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-5\">\u201c Suffolk, ss. Boston, Nov. 20, 1874. I this day served the within notice upon James F. Southworth, the clerk and- as agent of the within named John J. Newcomb; having made search for the said Newcomb and for his attorney, and being unable to find either of them within my precinct; by giving to said South-worth in hand an attested copy of the said notice at 55 minutes past 4 o\u2019clock, P. m\u201e, at No. 60 Commercial Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\">\u201c John B. O\u2019Brien, Dep. Sheriff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-7\">The plaintiff contended that the discharge was invalid on account of the insufficiency of the service. On the question whether Southworth was the agent of the plaintiff, the evidence was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\">1 It appeared that the plaintiff resided and carried on business in Boston, and was at his store daily; that Southworth, for fourteen years, had been the confidential clerk and bookkeeper of the plaintiff, selling his goods, drawing and indorsing his checks, on one occasion indorsing a note for the plaintiff, accepting and paying his drafts, and collecting and disbursing his moneys; that he was familiar with the plaintiff\u2019s original claim against Willcutt, the same having been for goods sold and delivered by the plaintiff to Willcutt; and that he held a power of attorney, dated July 7, 1870, from the plaintiff, which the defendants put in evidence, and the material parts of which were as follows: \u2018 to be my true, sufficient and lawful attorney for me and in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>name and stead to sign checks on the National Bank of the Republic and Merchants\u2019 National Bank of Boston, accept any draft, sell any merchandise consigned to me or held in my name, and collect any money due for the same or that may be due me for any other <em>cause; </em>\u201d with the usual clauses giving the attorney full authority in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-4\">There was also other evidence in the case; and the defendants contended that, as matter of law, the power of attorney was conclusive on the question of agency \u2022 that the service was therefore sufficient, and the defendants not liable; but the judge ruled that whether Southworth was an agent within the meaning of the Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>124, \u00a7 13, was a question for the jury, taking the power of attorney and all the evidence into consideration; and gave general instructions not excepted to. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-5\"><em>W S. </em>Maefarlane, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-6\"><em>F. F. Crane, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b198-7\">Soule, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6f\">The agent, on whom service of notice of an application for the poor debtor\u2019s oath may be made, under the Gen. Sts. c. 124, \u00a7 13, when the creditor is a natural person, is either a general agent who is invested with the general control and management of the creditor\u2019s business in his absence, inability or indisposition to attend to his own affairs, or one who, under authority from \u25a0 the creditor, has assumed the direction and supervision of the suit in which the execution issued. When the creditor is a corporation, the term agent has a somewhat different signification. It appears from the bill of exceptions that the action, in which the plaintiff\u2019s execution issued, was managed by an attorney on whom the notice of the debtor\u2019s application was not served, and that the plaintiff was giving daily attention to his business; and it does not appear that the clerk, Southworth, had anything to do with instituting, directing or superintending the action, and the power of attorney to him was limited to other matters. Under this state of facts, it was correctly ruled that the possession by Southworth of the letter of attorney from the plaintiff was not conclusive evidence that he was the plaintiff\u2019s agent within the meaning of the statute. The letter of attorney not being conclusive for the defendants, and there being other evidence in the case, the only proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>course to take at the trial was to submit the question, whether the agency of South worth was made out, to the decision of the jury; this was done, under instructions to which no exception was taken. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
