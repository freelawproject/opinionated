After the former decision, reported 122 Mass. 443, the case was tried in the Superior Court, before Bacon, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-5\">The plaintiff is the administrator with the will annexed of the estate of John Marley. On July 22, 1857, there was standing to the credit of Marley, on the books of the defendant, the sum of $1096.22, on two accounts. On that day he drew, in equal amounts from each account, the sum of $556.22, and afterwards, on the same day, opened three new accounts with the defendant in the name of \u201c John Marley, Trust.,\u201d and deposited $200 each on two of the accounts, and $100 on the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">In 1870, during the lifetime of Marley, the five books of deposit, received by Marley from the defendant, were lost or stolen from his possession, and the defendant has paid the plaintiff, as administrator, the amounts due on the two old books and on one of the new ones, on his filing a bond to indemnify the bank against the production of said books. Neither of the five books has ever been produced, and no demand has been made on either party to this suit on behalf of any person claiming to be <em>cestm 'I'uc. trust </em>of the new accounts remaining unpaid. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>was notified by Marley in 1870, after the loss of the books, that they had not been transferred, and that they were his property. The plaintiff tendered to the defendant a good and sufficient bond to indemnify it against any claim arising from the production of the missing books of the accounts still unpaid, or from any claim of any <em>cestui que trust; </em>but the defendant declined to pay said plaintiff the amounts due on said books at the date of the writ, December 22, 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-3\">Upon these facts, the defendant asked the judge to rule that on the evidence offered by the plaintiff a <em>primd facie </em>case of the existence of a trust was made out, and that the presumption was not rebutted by the further evidence offered by the plaintiff. Bui the judge declined so to rule, and left it to the jury to say whether the money deposited by Marley, on said accounts, belonged to him absolutely at the time of deposit, or whether he held it subject to a trust; and, if they found the former, to return a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-5\"><em>F. F. Parker $ W. F. </em>Perkins, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-6\"><em>C. 0. </em>Powers, <em>pro se.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b397-7\">Soule, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATU\">The ruling asked for by the defendant was properly refused. The mere fact that the money deposited by Marley was entered to the credit of \u201c John Marley, Trust.,\u201d was not conclusive evidence that-he held it subject to a trust in favor of some other person, nor that some other person had any interest in it. Even if the deposit had been made and entered \u2018 In trust for A. B.,\u201d it would have been open to proof by paroi evidence that the money was in fact absolutely owned by the depositor, and thus deposited for convenience and without intent to give \u201c A.,B.\" any right to or interest in it, whatever. <em>Brabrook </em>v. <em>Boston Five Cents Savings </em>Bank, 104 Mass. 228. <em>Clark </em>v. Clark, 108 Mass. 522. This seems to have been recognized by the defendant; and it asked the court to rule that, on the evidence offered by the plaintiff, a <em>primd facie </em>case of the existence of a trust was made out, which was not rebutted by the other evidence offered. The court could not be required to rule on the effect of a part of the plaintiff\u2019s case to the exclusion of a part. The plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>evidence offered; and, if any part of it tended to show that Marley was absolute owner of the money and held it free from trust, it was proper that the whole evidence should be submitted to the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">We are of opinion that, from the facts admitted by the defendant at the trial, as set forth in the bill of exceptions, a jury would be warranted in finding that the money was Harley\u2019s absolutely, not charged with any trust, and deposited in the name of \u201c John Marley, Trust.,\u201d for his own convenience merely. There was no error, therefore, in submitting the question to the jury under the instructions which were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
