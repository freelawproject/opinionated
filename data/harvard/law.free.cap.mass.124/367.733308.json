Gerrish and John Q. A. Hanson on two joint and several recognizances entered into under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>124, \u00a7 10, on September 5, 1874, by the first named defendant as principal, and the other defendant as surety, and each containing the usual conditions. Writ dated October 6, 1874, and returnable at January term 1875 of the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-7\">On February 18, 1876, Hanson filed an answer, setting up his discharge in bankruptcy. On April 24, 1876, Gerrish died, and his death was suggested on May. 4, 1876. On October 12, 1876, a discontinuance was entered as to Hanson, on account of his discharge in bankruptcy. On January 23, 1877, on motion of the plaintiff, an order issued to summon in the administratrix of the estate of Gerrish, returnable at April term 1877. On April 23, 1877, the following entry was made on the docket by order of the judge: \u201cHo default till further notice.\u201d On May 4, 1877, the administratrix appeared specially, and filed a motion to dismiss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-8\">On these facts, Dewey, J., ruled that the action could not be prosecuted against the administratrix, and dismissed the sam\u00e9.

S. </em>Abbott, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMo\">1. Section 11 of the Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>127, which provides that \u201c when there are several plaintiffs or defendants in a personal action, the cause of which survives, and any of them die before final judgment, the action shall proceed at the suit of the surviving plaintiff, or against the surviving defendant, as the case may be,\u201d is not applicable to this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>More than two months before the death of Gerrish, the other defendant had obtained and pleaded his discharge in bankruptcy. It was then impracticable to proceed against him. The plaintiff could not have proceeded against the other defendant at any time after the death of Gerrish; and, inasmuch as, immediately after such dismissal, he could commence and maintain a similar action against this administratrix, and against no other person, this action ought not to be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-4\">2. The 14th rule of the Superior Court provides that \u201c answers in abatement and demurrer and pleas in abatement shall be filed, and motions to dismiss made, within the time required for entering appearances, unless further time be allowed by the court.\u201d The time for entering an appearance in this case, by the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>129, \u00a7 45, and the St. of 1870, <em>c. </em>68, expired on April 13, 1877. No order of any kind was made by the court until April 23, and then further time was not allowed; and the motion filed May 4 was too late.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-5\"><em>Gr.

Hayden, 119 Mass. 361. <em>Cochrane </em>v. <em>Cushing, ante, </em>219. The order of the court, after the return of the summons to her, that no default should be entered until further notice, extended the time within which she might file a motion to dismiss. That motion was therefore seasonably made and rightly granted. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
