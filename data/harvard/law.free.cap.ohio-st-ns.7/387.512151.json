He made a will, declaring therein, that all lands standing in his and in his brother George Lockwood\u2019s individual names, respectively, belonged to them in equal proportions ; made his wife, Esther A., and Henry Lockwood, and George L.

His son, James C. Lockwood, took upon himself without any judicial authority, in December, 1843, to send his father to the lunatic asylum, at Columbus. In the meantime, Mitchell had brought seven actions of ejectment to recover possession Of the premises mortgaged to him ; and while these were pending, George Lockwood, then under treament in the lunatic asylum, employed LeGrand Marvin, a relative, and solicitor in chancery, residing in Buffalo, to file a bill in chancery against Mitchell and Crawford, in one of the vice-chancellor\u2019s courts of the State of New York, alleging that the loan secured by the not\u00a9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>and mortgage was usurious aud void. Accordingly, in March, 1844, the bill was filed by Marvin, setting up usury, and praying an injunction to restrain Mitchell and Crawford from prosecuting their ejectment suits, then pending in the courts of Huron county, \u25a0Ohio, or any suits on the note and mortgage, and to declare, by decree, the note and mortgage usurious and void. The vice-chancellor allowed the injunction. An answer was filed by Mitchell, alleging, among other things,'that the loan was not usurious, because secured on property in Ohio. A motion was made to dissolve the injunction, but was not pressed to a hearing. A few days after the motion was passed, and in July, 1844, Mitchell suggested to G-eorge L. Marvin, the law partner of LeGrand Marvin, at Buffalo, that one of them had better accompany him (Mitchell) to Milan, and endeavor to adjust the loan and its incidents. Accordingly, Mitchell and LeGrand Marvin went together to Milan. \u2022G-eorge Lockwood was still in the lunatic asylum. James C. Lockwood, his son, was attending to his father\u2019s affairs, but with\u2022out any legal authority.

Subpenas were issued, in October, 1844, against all the defendants except George Lockwood, to the sheriffs of Erie and Huron counties, and most of them served, and the cause continued. Afterward, in February, 1845, a subpena was issued against George Lockwood, the lunatic, addressed to the sheriff of Franklin county j in which county the lunatic asylum is situated. Jamos C. Lockwood took this subpena to Columbus, and placed it in the hands of Graham, deputy sheriff of Franklin county; accompanied the iatter to the lunatic asylum, when it was served on George Lock-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AckE\">wood ; and ajames C. Lockwood paid the fees of the deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>sheriff, and conveyed the writ to Erie county. At the June term, 1845, of the court, the attorney who appeared for the complainants, moved the court to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>as well for George Lockwood, a lunatic defendant, as also for Ralph Lockwood, an infant defendant. The record says, that \u201cthe court having seen the proofs and exhibits, do find that said George Lockwood is a lunatic, and order that George Reber, one of the attorneys of this court, be appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the said George Lockwood.\u201d The answer of Reber, as guardian <em>ad litem </em>of the lunatic, and of the infant Ralph, admits, in detail, the execution of the note and mortgage; that interest remains unpaid to April 1, 1842, and that the defeasance of the mortgage has become absolute, etc. Reber states in his deposition, that his answers were drawn by the attorney of the complainants, and that he was informed that the foreclosure was a family arrangement', and satisfactory to the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\">At the June term, 1845, a decree was entered, in which the court 'find due to the complainants $9,920.05, with interest from the first day of the term; and on default of payment thereof and costs, direct a sale of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\">No traces of the family contract, under which these proceedings were had, appear in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">An order of sale was issued under the decree; the mortgaged premises appraised ; the whole bid off by James C. Lockwood, in October, 1845, for $7,192; and the sale confirmed, and a deed made to him, in November, 1845.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\">George Lockwood, who had been placed in the asylum on the 29th of December, 1843, was discharged therefrom August 1, 1845, his faculties in the same unsound condition as before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-8\">Thus, in November, 1845, the title to the mortgaged premises was purchased and perfected in James O. Lockwood; who, under the stipulations of the family contract, was required, within one year from November, 1845, to sell so much of the four parcels, held by him in trust, as that the amount of such sales should equal the sum of $1,500. Mitchell, however, seems to have been unwilling that James O. Lockwood should dispose of the premises *under the trust created by the family contract; at all events, early in July, 1846, Mitchell, for himself and for Crawford, in writing, demanded of James C. Lockwood a conveyance to himself and Crawford of the fourth parcel of land described in the family contract, at the price of $1,500; and at the same time threatened that if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(James C. Lockwood) did not comply with this demand, they (Mitchell and Crawford) would institute a suit against him to compel him to do it, and to also pay the damages and costs, as well of such suit as those arising from his not complying with his duties as trustee. Mitchell also gave James C. Lockwood notice, in writing, that he should hold him personally responsible for the rents of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\">James C.. Lockwood then entered into a new contract with Mitchell, whereby he agreed to release and quitclaim to Mitchell the four parcels of land described in the family contract of August 5, 1844, in consideration of, and in full of Mitchell and Crawford\u2019s claim under the mortgage and decree, and in discharge of the trust under said agreement. Accordingly, on the 3d of July, 1846, and before the time had arrived when Mitchell was entitled to any payment under the family contract, James C. Lockwood executed to Mitchell a quitclaim deed for the four parcels of land, with special covenants against his own acts, done while he held the title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">Mitchell then proceeded to sell and convey portions of the four-parcels ; and the property having risen in value, he received, and is entitled to receive, about fourteen thousand dollars from purchasers, and still holds a portion of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">George Lockwood, soon after he returned from the lunatic asylum, complained of these transactions; and, January 1, 1849, filed a bill on the chancery side of the court of common pleas of Erie county, against Mitchell, Crawford, and others, setting forth by that bill, and by amendments afterward filed, in October, 1849, and January, 1853, in substance, the facts above stated, with allegations of fraud and collusion on the part of Mitchell, Crawford, James C. Lockwood, and LeGrand Marvin, in entering into the various contracts above set forth, and in procuring the foreclosure of the mortgage and sale under it, and the ^conveyance to Mitchell of the four parcels of land. It is alleged in the bills that the $400 which George Lockwood paid Mitchell when the original contract for the loan was negotiated, was an usurious advancement, which, by the laws of New York, rendered the note and mortgage void; and that the $400 should, in equity, \u201c be applied as so much payment of the interest thereafter accruing.\u201d That LeGrand Marvin had no power to dismiss the chancery suit in New York; that Mitchell hold the lands conveyed by James C. Lockwood to him, under said mortgage, in trust for the complainant. The complainant further al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>leges, that \u201c he has been willing, at all times, to pay said Mitchell and Crawford all just debts, and especially all moneys justly and equitably due upon the said note and mortgage; \u201d but that said decree and sale on the mortgage was procured and obtained under said family contract, unauthorizedly, fraudulently, and was informal, erroneous, and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\">Mitchell and Crawford, in their answers, admit substantially the facts above stated, but deny all collusion and fraud, and all usury. They allege that the contracts made by James C. Lockwood for George Lockwood, while the latter was insane, were honest, and with the design to subserve, and did subserve, the interests of George and his family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\">As to the $400 alleged to be usurious, Mitchell gives, in his answer, many reasons for his being paid that amount, over and above interest. It was to compensate him for permitting the Lockwoods to sell portions of the mortgaged premises, in case the part remaining was at least double the value of the amount due on the mortgage, thus subjecting him to the trouble of looking to and receiving further securities; it was to pay him for procuring the loan ; it was for the labor, trouble, and expense of converting bank paper, circulating in Westchester county, or in the possession of Mitchell, into funds par in the city of New York, where the loan was to be consummated. He further alleges that the discount <em>and labor </em>of converting bills current in Westchester county into city funds were at least one per cent.; and that George Lockwood assured him that, by the laws of Ohio, any |&gt;erson could agree to receive any sum for the loan of money *which the borrower agreed to pay, and it could be recovered by him; and, finally, Mitchell says in his answer, that the four hundred dollars \u201cwas not paid by the said George, or received by this defendant, as a bonus or usurious consideration, but exclusively to induce this defendant to furnish the loan in New York city funds, to enable the Lockwoods to realize a profit of from ten to fifteen per cent, on the difference of exchange, which he in fact did realize, as he afterward informed this defendant, and also to induce this defendant to make such loan, subject to the privileges secured to the said Lockwoods, in the said agreement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-7\">Such proceedings were had in this suit of George Lockwood, that his bill was dismissed by the district court of Erie county, at April term, 1855. A petition in error, in the nature of a bill of review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>was filed in this court, in April, 1856, and trustees were appointed, under the statute, to represent the interests of the insane complainant.

This he had a right to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-10\">The case must be tried as it is made by George Lockwood, and with reference exclusively to his rights.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-11\"><em>G. </em>P. <em>Wolcott </em>made the following points for complainant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-12\">I. The decree rendered against the complainant in the court of \u25a0common pleas of Erie county was, as between him and James C. Lockwood, a nullity, and did not, therefore, divest him as against .James C. Lockwood, of any rights or advantages which before that time pertained to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-13\">1. The complainant, at the time of the commencement of these proceedings, was confined in close custody at the lunatic asylum in Columbus. He had been sent there by his son, James C. Lockwood, without process or inquest of any kind, and was kept there solely .at the will of the latter, who was in fact the complainant in the \u2022original proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-14\">2. Now, whether George Lockwood had or had not a good defense to the proceedings instituted by his son James C., it is too clear for argument that that son can not lock up his father \u2014 institute proceedings against him while thus locked up, for the purpose of \u2022obtaining title to his property \u2014 procure a guardian to admit that the father has forfeited his rights \u2014 obtain a decree on that admission \u2014 and then set up a decree so obtained as an estoppel against the father. The law tolerates no such monstrous injustice. But,</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>3. George Lockwood had a full and complete defense to that proceeding, which his son James C., by confining him, prevented him&lt; from making. The note and mortgage were governed by the law of New York, and by that law were usurious and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-5\">(a.) The general rule is, that where a contract is made in one state, which by its terms is to be performed in another, it shall be governed as to its construction and validity by the law of the place-of performance, because the parties are naturally supposed to have had reference to that law when making the contract. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 459, 460; Story\u2019s Conflict, secs. 291-406; De Wolf <em>v. </em>Johnson, 10 Wheat. 367; Andrews <em>v. </em>Pond, 13 Pet. 65. The case of Chapman <em>v. </em>Robertson, 6 Paige, 627, cited by defendant\u2019s counsel, does not, in the decision, controvert this rule. The reasoning, however, of the court has been frequently questioned (see Kent and Story where, quoted above), and in the very recent case of Curtis <em>v. </em>Leavitt, 15 N. Y. (1 Smith), the court of appeals has directly overruled that reasoning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-6\">(b.) The fact that a note payable in one state is secured by a mortgage of real property in another state, does not (the mortgage-being a mere incident to the note) withdraw the note from the operation of the law of the place of payment. The mortgage may be looked at as an item of evidence, in connection with the other circumstances of the case, to ascertain whether the parties had reference in their contract to the law of the place of the mortgage, or the law of the place of payment, but it avails nothing more. All the circumstances in this case establish beyond doubt that the parties here contracted with reference to the laws of the State of New York. See Curtis <em>v. </em>Leavitt, supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-7\">By the laws of New York the note and mortgage are void for usury. The lender stipulated for a greater rate of interest than <em>*seven per cent, per annum. </em>The bonus of $400 was nothing , but a cover for usury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-8\">4. This defense to the bond and mortgage was not only a complete one, but up to the time of the agreement made between. Mitchell, Crawford, and James C. Lockwood, on the 5th of August, 1844, it had been entirely successful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-9\">5. This defense is still available to George Lockwood \u2014 at least as against his son <em>James </em>\u2014 for <em>he has never had his day in court.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-10\">II. Under the facts of the case, it is too clear for question, that. George Lockwood, as against his son James C. Lockwood, is enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u25a0tied to an immediate, unconditional restoration of the mortgaged premises, and to every legal and equitable right which pertained to him before the decree was rendered.

Swan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ato\">I. Was the loan of $8,000, in respect to the question of usury, to be governed by the laws of New York or .of Ohio ?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The contract for the loan was made in the State of New York; \u25a0the money was advanced there; the note and mortgage delivered there; and the loan was to be repaid there. The fact that one of the incidents of the debt consisted of a lien, by way of mortgage, upon lands in Ohio, to secure payment, does not change the law in this respect. It was a contract not only made, but to be performed in the State of New York, and must be governed by the laws of that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">II. Was the loan usurious?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">Four hundred dollars, being five per cent, on the loan, was paid *to Mitchell. What was the consideration of this? The written contract of March -17, 1836, given above, states substantially that it was in consideration that Mitchell would advance and loan to the Lockwoods eight thousand dollars at a future day. On the face of the contract, and by its terms, the four hundred dollars was an open and undisguised gratuity for the loan of money over .and above the seven per cent, interest on the loan. Mitchell in his .answer denies this, and assigns the usual reasons which lenders give for withholding a loan from an unfortunate borrower; bank bills in Westchester county were not worth as much as money in the city of New York ; the difference, together with the trouble of \u25a0converting bank bills current in Westchester into funds current in .New York, was at least one per cent.; that the Lockwoods would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>make a considerable profit on the loan when they received it, by the difference in exchange between New York and Ohio; that George Lockwood assured Mitchell that, by the laws of Ohio, he might take what he pleased for the loan and recover. Such reasons as these, especially the last, for taking the bonus of four hundred dollars, only confirm in our minds the belief that the terms of the contract truly state the consideration of the four hundred dollars, and throw so much suspicion over the only plausible reason given in the answer, to wit, a compensation for looking to and changing securities, that we have had no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the transaction is tainted with usury. It would require a clear, distinct and sufficient consideration for the payment of the four hundred dollars to be alleged and proved, to overcome the usurious consideration stated in the written contract. Instead of this, parts of the consideration alleged are no consideration at all. No means of determining the value of the others are alleged. The trouble and vexation of taking the note and mortgage, or drawing his check for the eight thousand dollars, might as well have formed a part of the consideration as some of those stated by Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"A14n\">III. As to the effect of the loan being usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The complainant has so shaped his bill and prayer for relief that, while he claims that the contract was tainted with usury, he does *not set up the statute of New York for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the loan, but simply claims that the excess of interest was paid without consideration, and prays that such excess may be applied as payment on the interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We perceive no objection to a party thus consenting to the equity and at the same time requiring a credit for the excessive interest. No objection to this is made or can be made by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">IY. The real difficulty in. this case is to determine the effect upon the rights of George Lockwood, of the family contract, decree and sale to James C. Lockwood, under the mortgage, and the conveyance by him to Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">At the time that contract was entered into, Mitchell was enjoined from further prosecuting his claim on the ground that it was usurious. <em>Sis </em>hands seemed to be tied and with a fair prospect of losing both principal and interest. In this condition of things, he procured a meeting of the friends of George Lockwood, who was then in the asylum, and they entered into the family contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Two objects seem to have been in view. Mitchell desired to avoid the question of usury and to get rid of the pending injunction. James C. Lockwood desired to obtain such a control of his father\u2019s property as that it might be sold to pay debts. Proceedings under the mortgage were therefore provided for by James C. Lockwood, not for the purpose, by sale under a decree, to pay the mortgage \u25a0debt, but to vest the legal title of the mortgaged premises in him. And these proceedings under the mortgage were consented to by Mitchell, not for the purpose of asserting his lien upon the mortgaged premises, and by decree creating a fund for the payment of the debt, for he was not to be paid by a sale under the decree, nor was he to enforce his lien by an order of sale; his object was to have his debt recognized and get rid of the chancery suit in New York. To attain these results it was agreed that the chancery and ejectment suits should be discontinued ; that the amount of the loan and interest be restated; that James C. Lockwood should prosecute to foreclosure the mortgage made by George and Ralph Lockwood to Mitchell *and Crawford; that James C. Lockwood should bid off the premises, but should pay nothing as purchaser; that Mitchell and Crawford, however, should follow a part of the land into the hands of James C. Lockwood, to secure the mortgage debt, the latter holding the premises as trustee for Mitchell and Crawford, and selling and accounting for proceeds of sales and of rents, to pay the mortgage debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">This was a very ingenious mode, on the part of Mitchell, of defeating the claim of usury set up by George Lockwood, the lunatic; and a very ingenious mode, on the part of James C. Lockwood, to divest his father of the legal title to his real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In the first place, let us ascertain what effect the family contract had upon the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">A decree of foreclosure ordinarily bars the right of the mortgagor to redeem by payment of the mortgage debt; a sale is made under the decree to satisfy the mortgage debt; the purchaser at such sale takes the title, unincumbered by the mortgage debt, and cleared off all claim of the parties to the mortgage. But in the case before us, even if we treat the family contract as obligatory upon George Lockwood, the decree of foreclosure did not operate to bar the equity of redemption; for it is clear, that the moment James O. Lockwood purchased and obtained title under the decree as trustee, to pay the mortgage debt, George Lockwood might, notwithstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ing the decree, have then tendered to James C. Lockwood, the-trustee, and Mitchell and Crawford, the amount of the mortgage-debt, and enforced a reconveyance of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Nor was the sale to James C. Lockwood, under the decree, made-for the purpose of satisfying the mortgage debt; for James C. Lockwood was not to pay anything on his bid, nor was his bid to-be credited upon the decree. Nor was the purchaser to take the-title unincumbered by the mortgage debt, or cleared of the claims-of the parties to the mortgage. The debt was to stand and follow the premises, notwithstanding the sale. This decree, therefore, as-a decree of foreclosure, was made inoperative, as such, by the terms-of the family contract. That such a contract, if entered into by the parties to a decree, or their authorized *agents, would be valid, and that a court of chancery would enforce it, and make the operation of the decree subordinate to the stipulations of the parties, we entertain no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The prosecution of the suit on the mortgage, the amount of the decree, the decree itself, the sale thereunder, and the rights- and estate acquired thereby, were inseparable parts of, and subordinate to, the stipulations of the family contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">George Lockwood was not a party to this family contract, and no one was authorized to act for him. The family contract being-unauthorized and void as to him, and the decree having been procured in consideration of the stipulations of the contract, and, indeed, forming apart of it, what shall be the operation and effect of the decree? Not, certainly, as a har to George Lockwood\u2019s-right to redeem, for that would be giving it, as we have seen, a more stringent effect than if the family contract had been authorized by him, and an effect, too, which Mitchell and Crawford did not contemplate. Nor is it necessary, in order to protect the rights-of George Lockwood, that the decree, or the sale thereunder, should be impeached for fraud or error, or that the legal title acquired under the decree, by James C. Lockwood or Mitchell, should be pronounced invalid. But we can not, under the facts, do less than-hold James C. Lockwood and Mitchell to be trustees of the estate-of George Lockwood, liable to account to him for sales-, and the premises unsold, and George Lockwood liable to account to Mitchell and Crawford for the real amount of the mortgage debt. By thus-holding, we recognize the decree as valid and operative as to third persons, protect the just rights of Mitchell and Crawford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>under their mortgage, and treat the decree as so inseparably connected with the stipulations of the family contract as not, in its operation and effect, to conclude the rights of George Lockwood as against the parties to that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Y. As to the disposition of the usurious interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">One of the objects which this family contract was intended to effect, and did effect, was the dismissal of the suit in New York, brought to impeach the mortgage debt for usury. The family contract being unauthorized and void as to George Lockwood, the'dismissal of that suit being also unauthorized and to the prejudice *of the rights of the insane mortgagor \u2014 there being in fact usury in the transaction \u2014 the trustees of the lunatic being now required to account to Mitchell and Crawford for the principal and interest, are entitled to at least credit the excess of interest beyond the lawful rate, as claimed in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">YI. As to the relation of the representatives of Ralph Lockwood to the surviving partner, and to the decree in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">George Lockwood, as surviving partner of the firm of George and Ralph Lockwood, was vested with the entire estate and control of the property of the firm. The representatives of Ralph Lockwood had no such distinct interest or authority, in settling the debts of the partnership or disposing of its estate, as would authorize us to enforce their agreement, to the prejudice of the authority \u2022or the rights of George Lockwood, as surviving partner. We can not separate the unauthorized contract of the representatives of Ralph Lockwood, in relation to the debts and estate of the firm, and enforce them against such representatives, and at the same time vindicate the rights and authority of George Lockwood, as .surviving partner. The rights of the representatives of Ralph Lockwood must therefore be controlled by, and follow the rights \u2022of Geoi\u2019ge Lockwood. Thex*e may be eases in which the rights of .a surviving partner, and of the represexitatives of a deceased partner, may be concluded by the contracts of the latter ; but this is not such a case. Here the representatives, as such, were dealing with a contract and an estate over which they had no control, and in such a manner as directly to impair the rights and affect the authority of the surviving partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">This case will be referred to a master, to state an account in accordance with the views above indicated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-10\">Bartley, C.
