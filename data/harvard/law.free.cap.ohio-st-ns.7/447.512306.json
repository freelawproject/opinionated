Bostwick, Edward Kent, and Charles Atwood <em>v. </em>William H. Raymond and Curtis L. Avery.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-10\">Under the 15th section of the chancery practice act of March 14, 1831, as amended by the act of February 25, 1848, it is not sufficient to charge that an insolvent debtor, <em>shortly previous </em>to a suit at law for the recovery of a claim against him, by the petitioner, had sold, transferred, and'disposed of his store of goods, and all of his property, so as to delay and hinder the plaintiff in collecting said claim.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-11\">The statute only applies to cases of sale, transfer, or disposal of property <em>during </em>the pendency of a suit previously commenced.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>In chancery.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Az-\">Reserved in Richland county.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-4\">The complainants \u00f1led-their bill in chancery September 18,1851,. under the third clause of the first section of the \u201c act to amend the act directing the mode of proceeding in chancery,\u201d in connection with the 15th section of the act thereby amended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\">Section 15 of the amended act (Swan\u2019s Stat. of 1841, 703,) provides as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">\u201c When a suit at law for the recovery of money or damages for any cause of action which would survive <em>to or </em>against the personal' representatives of the plaintiff or defendant, or whenever a suit in chancery for the recovery of a specific sum of money or damages, shall be pending, in either of the courts aforesaid, against a nonresident defendant, or against a resident defendant, who has, during the pendency of said suits, either secretly departed out of the jurisdiction of the court, or secreted himself or property within the-same, so that the ordinary process of law can not be served on either, and there should be any person or persons resident within such jurisdiction who is, or are, indebted to, or has in possession goods and chattels, rights, credits, moneys, or effects belonging to. such non-resident or secreting defendant, the said plaintiff at law or complainant in chancery may file a petition against the person so indebted or having in possession the goods and chattels, rights, credits, moneys, or effects of such non-resident or secreting defendant, annexing an affidavit of the truth of the allegations therein contained, and of the amount of the debt or damages by him claimed; and the court may in their discretion enjoin such other person or persons from paying over, conveying away, or secreting such debts by him owing to such non-resident or secreting defendant, or his goods and chattels, rights, credits, moneys, or effects-, until the final judgment at law or decree in chancery can be had in such former cause. And the court on final hearing shall make-such final order or decree between the parties as they shall think just and equitable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASj\">*It is provided in the first section of the amendatory act (46 General Laws, 96), that if the plaintiff or complainant in the-pending suit, his agent or attorney \u201c shall have reason to believe and shall in fact believe \u201d -.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">. . . \u201c3. That such defendant is about to convey, assign, remove, conceal, or dispose of his property with intent, or so as to defraud, hinder, or delay his creditors, . . . the pendency of such suit, together with the existence of either of the causes above-enumerated, shall entitle the plaintiff or complainant in such suit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>to file his bill or petition against the defendant, his debtors, and those having \u00edd their custody any of his property, money, or effects, in the same way as is provided in the 15th section of the act to which this is an amendment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">The bill states that the complainants, previous to filing their bill, \u2022and on the same day, had commenced an action of assumpsit against Raymond for $234.56, balance due them upon book-account and two promissory notes made by Raymond, and particularly described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">The bill further states that said Raymond has been engaged for some time past in the business of merchandising, at Mansfield, in said county, and has had on hand an extensive assortment of goods; \u201cbut that he has recently, and within the last few days, sold, assigned, transferred, and disposed of the whole of said stock of goods to one Curtiss L. Avery, of said Richland county,\u201d and whom the bill represents as indebted to Raymond for the purchase price of the goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">The bill further charges \u201c that said Raymond has sold, assigned, transferred, and disposed of said stock of goods so as to delay and \u2022hinder the complainants in the collection of their debt aforesaid;\u201d that he has no other property subject to execution; and that he has refused, upon request, to transfer to them so much of the indebtedness of said Avery for the goods, as would be sufficient to \u2022satisfy their said claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">The bill prays that, on final hearing, Avery may be required to pay to complainants, from his indebtedness to Raymond, said amount due from Raymond to complainants; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-9\">Raymond and Avery filed separate answers, and state substantially *the same facts, viz: That on the 15th day of September, 1851, Raymond sold to Avery the goods mentioned for $3,663.62, \u2022of which amount Avery was <em>jp </em>pay $2,359.97 in discharge of spe-r cific mortgage liens upon the goods; and for the remainder of th\u00f3 purchase money, h.e executed his promissory note of that date, payable to Raymond, for $1,303.65 in twelve months; and that Raymond at the same time indorsed and delivered the note to C. T. &amp; J.. Sherman, attorneys, to be collected, and after paying their charges, to be distributed <em>pro rata </em>among all his creditors.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-10\"><em>Geo. W. Geddes, </em>for .complainants, cited Nicholson <em>v. </em>Leavitt,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>vol. 1, No. 3, Am. Law Reg. 181; Douglass <em>v. </em>Huston, 6 Ohio, 156; Miers &amp; Coulson <em>v. </em>Zanesville and Maysville Turnpike Co.,. 13 Ohio, 197; Bowry &amp; Sons <em>v. </em>Odell &amp; Brother, 4 Ohio St. 627.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-5\"><em>John </em>Sherman, for defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b414-6\">Sutliff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvR7\">Depositions taken on the part of defendants corroborate the statement of facts contained in the answers ; and no proof has been taken by complainants to controvert their statements, nor are they even traversed by a replication.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The facts of the case as stated in the answer must therefore be regarded as true. And the case therefore presents the single question : Is the sale and transfer of the goods on the part of Raymond, a case within the statutes mentioned ?</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The bill does not charge, nor does the proof show, any fraud in the transaction on the part of Raymond in selling, or on the part of Avery in buying, the goods. The only clause of the statute, therefore, under which such proceeding could be sustained, is the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">\u201c That such defendant is about to convey, assign, remove, conceal, or dispose of his property, with intent, or so as to defraud, hinder, or delay his creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Under this clause of the amendatory statute, the extreme limit to which a creditor could go to charge the particular fund or property, without charging actual fraud, would be, we apprehend, *to state in his bill a case where his debtor is about to dispose of his property so as to hinder and delay his creditor in the collection of his debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">But this bill by no means shows such a case. Its language is not that Raymond is <em>about </em>to convey or dispose of his property so as to hinder or delay his creditors, but \u201c that he <em>has </em>recently, and within the last few days, sold, assigned, transferred, and disposed of the whole of said stock of goods,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">It is therefore evident that there is no case made in the bill for relief under the statute; nor is such a case at all shown by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">The bill must therefore stand dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-14\">Bartley, C. J., and Swan and Scott, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b414-15\">Brinkerhoee, J., having formerly been of counsel in the case, did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
