Defendants' Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (\"Renewed JMOL Mot.\"), ECF No. 537, and Motion for a New Trial (\"New Trial Mot.\"), ECF No. 538, are before the court. Plaintiffs oppose the motions, ECF Nos. 547-48, and defendants have replied, ECF Nos. 550-51. The court heard oral argument on the motions on October 31, 2017, and then submitted the matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 554. After careful consideration, for the reasons below, the court DENIES both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Between 2008 and 2012, California and Sacramento County regulators investigated reports that the Hardesty family was operating a sand and gravel mine illegally on the Schneider family's ranch. As a result of the investigations, regulators ordered the Hardesty and Schneider families to cease the mining operation; the Hardesty and Schneider families eventually complied. What happened during the four years from initial reports to closure of the mine forms the core of the case that went to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to plaintiffs, after a long period of regulatory disinterest, government officials were spurred to action not by their discovery of any actual legal violations, but by their desire to appease plaintiffs' competitors as well as state legislators and local politicians motivated by campaign contributions. Plaintiffs centrally allege the County recognized the Schneiders' historical right to continue mining on their property, also called a \"vested right,\" as early as 1994, but that defendants then revoked that right in 2009 without any process and in violation of the Schneiders' procedural and due process rights. The regulatory action that followed culminated in the permanent shutdown of the mining operation. The Schneiders also allege defendants retaliated against them by dramatically increasing in 2012 the financial deposit necessary to continue operating the mine, after they filed this case in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants' theory of the case was that the County never revoked plaintiffs' vested right, if they had any such right. Instead, in a series of hearings in 2010 and 2011, defendants merely determined that plaintiffs had expanded the mining operation beyond its permissible scope. The subsequent regulatory action, including requiring an amended reclamation plan and greater financial assurances, were required under state law and none of these actions were improperly motivated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following extensive summary judgment practice, plaintiffs' case proceeded to trial against the following defendants: Sacramento County; Robert Sherry, a former Planning Director for the County; Roger Dickinson, a former member of the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors; and Jeff Gamel, a former Sacramento County Senior Planner and Aggregate Resources Manager. After a sixteen-day trial held from February 16 to March 16, 2017, the jury returned a unanimous verdict on plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment procedural and substantive due process claims and the Schneiders' additional claim resting on the First Amendment's right to petition clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jury Verdict, ECF No. 469. The jury found the County, but not the individual defendants, violated plaintiffs' procedural due process rights, and awarded nominal damages of $1 to each\n   set of plaintiffs on these claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. The jury found all defendants violated plaintiffs' substantive due process rights, and awarded $75 million to the Hardestys and $30 million to the Schneiders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. The jury found the County, but not the individual defendants, violated the Schneiders' right to petition the government for redress, and awarded the Schneiders $30,000 on this claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The jury also found each individual defendant's conduct was \"malicious, oppressive, or in reckless disregard\" of plaintiffs' rights, and awarded punitive damages in the following amounts: $25,000 against Dickinson, $1 million against Gamel, and $750,000 against Sherry, with Sherry's payment broken down as $500,000 for the Hardestys and $250,000 for the Schneiders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After plaintiffs had rested their case but before the jury returned its verdict, defendants filed three motions for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a). ECF Nos. 350, 353, 443. In the first motion, defendants asserted they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because plaintiffs failed to pursue relief by way of writ in state court, the County Board of Supervisors' decision and Board of Zoning Appeals (\"BZA\") decisions had preclusive effect, the Hardesty plaintiffs were not entitled to notice related to the Hardestys' procedural due process claims, the Board of Supervisors' hearings complied with procedural due process, and plaintiffs' substantive due process claims failed. ECF No. 350 at 2-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the second motion, defendants asserted defendants Dickinson and Sherry were not liable for conduct after 2010 and Dickinson was entitled to absolute immunity for his legislative acts and qualified immunity for his executive acts. ECF No. 353 at 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the third and final Rule 50(a) motion, defendants contended plaintiffs lacked a federally protected property interest, plaintiffs received procedural due process, adequate state process precluded finding a violation of procedural due process, the only remedy for a due process violation was to order the process due, the Hardestys were not entitled to notice or alternately received actual notice of certain hearings, plaintiffs failed to exhaust remedies in state court, board determinations were entitled to preclusive effect, plaintiffs' substantive due process claims failed, all defendants were entitled to qualified immunity and Dickinson was entitled to absolute immunity for some of his conduct, no evidence permitted a reasonable jury to conclude defendants retaliated against plaintiffs, no evidence supported awarding punitive damages, and defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on a Williamson Act Claim. ECF No. 443 at 17-88. These three motions preserved defendants' right to file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)-(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 7, 2017, defendants filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and, in the alternative, for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Renewed JMOL Mot., ECF No. 537; New Trial Mot., ECF No. 538. As noted, plaintiffs jointly opposed the motions. Renewed JMOL Opp'n, ECF No. 547; New Trial Opp'n, ECF No. 548. Defendants filed replies. Renewed JMOL Reply, ECF No. 550; New Trial Reply, ECF No. 551. On October 31, 2017, the court heard both motions: Derek P. Cole, Gregory P. O'Dea and Mark O'Dea appeared for defendants; R. Paul Yetter, Christian J. Ward and George D. Robertson appeared for the Hardestys; and Glenn W. Peterson appeared for the Schneiders.

Rule 50(b) provides in pertinent part that the court may: \"(1) allow judgment on the verdict, if the jury returned a verdict; (2) order a new trial; or (3) direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(b)(1)-(3). In rendering a Rule 50 motion decision, the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Krechman v.

This argument logically extends to defendants' Rule 50(b) argument that the Schneiders not only exceeded the scope of any vested right they might have, but also that the Schneiders could not act upon such a right until a lead agency approved their reclamation plan, meaning the Schneiders lacked a property interest absent that approval.

Thus, the jury could reasonably infer the SHM mining operation was still a relatively small-scale operation despite any expansion within the SHM tract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In support of their impermissible expansion contention, defendants also observe \"[t]he historical information Jay Schneider had provided the County prior to the 1994 letter did not expressly reference any intent to mine\" the area near the Cosumnes River, \"well north of Meiss Road,\" or \"to mine the area to the extent it was being excavat[ed] by 2010.\" Renewed JMOL Mot. at 18. Defendants also point to evidence of plaintiffs' excavating new pits near the Cosumnes River, north of Meiss Road.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing JX 484 at 22, showing no pit near the river in 2004, and JX 484 at 23, showing pit as of 2007). Defendant Gamel also testified to his opinion that some of plaintiffs' mining in 2009 was not located in the area set out for mining between 2002 and 2022 in the 2002 Reclamation plan. RT 2164:18-2165:17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   JX099 at 15-16. But none of this evidence necessarily undercut the substantial evidence elsewhere in the record-notably, the 2002 reclamation plan maps and related testimony-, as discussed above, that plaintiffs' vested right included the areas plaintiffs mined in 2009 at the time they were mining. Nor are Gamel's opinion combined with a lack of historical evidence originally submitted by Schneider against the clear weight of the evidence in support of the verdict here: the County's 1994 letter spoke broadly about the SHM tract, the 2002 reclamation plan and its various maps were before the jury as evidence, and defendants themselves testified to a lack of clarity about the various maps in the 2002 reclamation plan. In sum, the evidence defendants cite does not shift the clear weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Altogether, there was substantial evidence to support a jury finding that the plaintiffs' vested right to mine encompassed the entire SHM tract. And in light of defendants' own uncertain testimony and the other evidence of record, it is not for this court to override the jury's verdict given that the jury's finding that the vested right to mine encompassed the mining plaintiffs engaged in at the time was not against the clear weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Employing New Mining Methods\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Endara v.

RT 1302:22-25, 1308:3-15, 1312:21-1313:16. Although defendants refer to this historical material as providing only \"vague indications,\" Renewed JMOL Mot. at 18, the jury heard Schneider's testimony and the historical material was admitted into evidence; it was for the jury to weigh the information in the context of the complete trial record. Defendant Gamel also testified the 1994 letter contained nothing that would limit the type of excavation or mining operation on SHM. RT 2061:6-8. Nor does the 2002 reclamation plan contain limits on the type of mining. JX099. Taking all of the evidence of record into account, the clear weight of the evidence does not contravene a finding that plaintiffs' vested right incorporates the mining methods plaintiffs used through 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Increasing Mining Production Levels\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Substantial evidence supports the jury's finding that plaintiffs' vested right included varying production levels based on demand.

That plaintiffs expanded, enlarged, relocated, and increased annual production by over ten times over fifteen years was not disputed. JX287; JX483; JX484; DXA at 80. The dispute, however, is whether this increase was such that it exceeded plaintiffs' vested right. Defendants argue plaintiffs increased production too rapidly, specifically pointing to the increase from 10,000 tons in 1995 to \"over 240,000 tons\" by 2007. Renewed JMOL Mot. at 18-19. Defendants cite Jay Schneider's trial testimony that the SHM operation historically had produced between 5,000 and 25,000 tons per year. RT 1477:20-1478:12. Additionally, defendants note when plaintiffs sought approval of their reclamation plan in 2002, the mining operation was described as a \"small scale tailing mining operation\"-a mining operation separating the valuable fraction of an ore from the uneconomic fraction-that at the time mining ceased there would be at most a \"maximum of 4.5 acres\" per year of disturbed area and from which they expected \"low annual production.\" JX080 at 5, 11. Defendants contrast those stated 4.5 acres per year with an inspection finding a total of 90 acres disturbed as of 2009 and 176 acres disturbed as of 2010, JX526 at 8, three to five times the 4.5 acre yearly projection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Yet other substantial evidence supported a jury finding that the production increase was limited to meeting population increases such that the increase remained within the scope of plaintiffs' vested right. Much of the evidence shows no volume-based limitation on the vested interest. For instance, as noted above as well, evidence permitted the jury's finding that the vested right was not limited in production levels except by the boundaries of the SHM tract. The 1994 letter from the County's Richard Maddox describing the vested right says nothing at all about production volume. JX021. Defendant Gamel conceded it was correct that nothing in the 1994 letter limited the amount of production from the SHM, nothing limited the quantity of ore or gravel that the mine could develop and nothing would limit the various kinds of aggregate. RT 2060:25-2061:11. Schneider testified that the historical\n   use of SHM showed variation in how much \"material was excavated in a short period of time.\" RT 1302:22-25. Intensity in mining also varied over time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1308:6-15, 1314:7-1315:23. Even the 2002 reclamation plan does not state a limit on the quantity of production. JX099.

Evidence also shows Teichert's taking concerted steps to inform various government officials and agencies about Hardesty, one of its competitors.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , JX507 (Teichert Strategy Matrix about Hardesty Sand and Gravel and including Teichert interactions with the County); JX375 at 2 (detailing importance of County, which, as lead agency, \"ha[d] the biggest handle,\" and stating that \"everything else will pile on top of it\";\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , RT 438:2-6 (Gamel testifying that County, as lead agency, governs mining operations within County). The jury did receive in evidence in an email from Teichert employee John Lane to defendant Gamel, copying Teichert attorney Kate Wheatley, stating Teichert's motivation was simply \"a call for fairness and level playing field.\" JX143. Wheatley testified she had the same understanding as to Teichert's intentions with respect to the SHM. RT 622:2-11. It was for the jury to weigh this evidence, and the jury was entitled to disregard it and credit the other evidence before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Evidence also permitted the jury's implicit finding that political pressure was applied through multiple meetings involving Teichert, Dickinson, Gamel, Sherry and others from 2009 through 2010.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , JX363; JX392; JX487; JX507. Counsel for Teichert even informed County counsel of its view that the\n   <em>\n    Hansen Brothers\n   </em>\n   decision \"did not sanction the substantial increase in production\" occurring at SHM in response to County counsel's concerns that\n   <em>\n    HansenBrothers\n   </em>\n   prevented the County from requiring a permit. JX356 (December 2009 email chain). Gamel also acknowledged having \"heard something like that\" in connection with Teichert's lawyers drafting findings and providing them confidentially to the BZA staff for the Board of Supervisor's ruling on the SHM. RT 534:15-23. Gamel acknowledged a conflict of interest if Teichert provided draft findings for the Board to use in rejecting the appeal of the SHM, even if the final findings did not track Teichert's proposed language.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2082:12-19. The clear weight of\n   this evidence does not run counter to a jury finding of political pressure exerted by Teichert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   A conclusion that Teichert exerted political pressure may also have been supported by evidence of the timing of campaign contributions to Dickinson and funding contributions to the County. RT 1229:9-1232:6 (Dickinson Test.). Although Dickinson testified he did not pay attention to when contributions were made and did not know immediately if a contribution was made, Dickinson did confirm an entry in his campaign finance records, which \"are a matter of public record,\" showed Teichert made a contribution to him the day before the September 28, 2010 hearing at which the Board rejected the Schneiders' appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1231:8-19. On a separate note, the day after that hearing denying the SHM appeal, Teichert signed a renewed funding contract with the County for the Aggregate Resources Manager position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1232:7-1233:13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   JX506; JX508.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The jury also could have given weight to additional evidence in finding that County decisions were based on personal or political loyalties to Teichert. For instance, after the first full-time Aggregate Resources Manager, Mike Winter, took another position within Sacramento County, defendant Gamel replaced Winter. RT 370:11-19. Before Winter took his new position, he had conferred with Teichert's attorney and asserted the SHM was a vested mine. RT 369:6-25; JX141; JX143. Gamel, Winter's replacement, had already engaged in communication with Teichert about the SHM: Before attaining the Aggregate Resources Manager position, Gamel had responded to Teichert's complaint that \"[t]he Hardesty operation continues to expand its [sic] operations and sales without any federal, state, or local permits and operate under the thinly veiled guise of vested rights,\" by informing Teichert, \"We will see what we can do.\" JX143 (September 2007 e-mail chain).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Evidence of other close communications with Teichert is not scarce in this record. For instance, in the same e-mail in which he thanked Teichert for the holiday gifts of cookies and olive oil, to which he \"look[ed] forward each year,\" Gamel informed Teichert he was working with the Office of Mining and Reclamation (OMR) to partner on the site inspection of the SHM and stated, \"We will let you know of any new developments.\" PX676. Soon after, on December 23, 2008, OMR inspected the mine, looking for potential violations. PX676; RT 457:20-459:25, 546:3-24 (Gamel Test.); RT 1769:21-1770:12 (Hardesty Test.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The jury also may have given weight to Gamel's at times conflicting testimony about his interactions with Teichert. He denied, in his deposition before trial, of any 2007 communications with Teichert. RT 463:12-16 (Gamel Test.). At trial, Gamel did not \"recall any conversations in 2007\" with Teichert about the SHM, and he stated, \"I don't know why I would be\" when asked if he should not have been talking to Teichert about SHM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   464:18-24. Yet an email chain and Gamel's testimony eventually revealed Teichert's sending Gamel aerial photographs of the SHM and complaining about Hardesty Sand &amp; Gravel while telling Gamel to be discrete-all before Gamel was appointed as Aggregate Resources Manager. JX143; RT 465:3-467:18 (Gamel Test.). As noted, Gamel had informed Teichert, \"We will see what we can do.\" JX143; RT 468:10-14 (Gamel Test.). Contrary to his earlier deposition testimony, Gamel eventually admitted at trial that he had been talking with Teichert about Hardesty Sand &amp; Gravel since 2007. RT 468:1-20. By 2008, Gamel had called the Army Corps of Engineers and told them about Teichert's interest in the Hardesty mining operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   JX152. While the jury was reminded in standard jury instructions that naturally people sometimes forget things, it also was charged with ultimately making decisions regarding credibility. ECF No. 461 at 8 (Final Jury Instruction No. 7, instructing the jury in part that \"You may believe everything a witness says, or part of it, or none of it\" and instructing the jury it may account for \"the witness's memory\"). Gamel's vacillating about his communications with Teichert permitted the jury to infer some level of improper motivation in the context of the other evidence of political ties and pressure reviewed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Teichert communicated with other County employees as well. Even if those communications in themselves were a common practice of a large company doing business in the County, the jury was entitled them to consider them in the context of all the evidence presented in resolving plaintiffs' claims. As noted, Teichert communicated its concerns about competition from Hardesty to the County.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , JX507 at 9-11 (Teichert Strategy Matrix detailing contacts with County officials); RT 580:1-20, 587:4-589:4 (Wheatley Test. about Teichert Strategy Matrix, including \"tactics or developments\" to pursue for \"the [SHM]\" and list including Dickinson, Gamel, and Sherry as contacts); RT 585:7-15 (Wheatley Test. of multiple meetings between Teichert and the County, including Gamel); JX132 (John Lane complaining that Hardesty was \"now attempting to steal our customers through the sale of very cheaply priced product\"); JX141 (August 2007 e-mail chain between Winter and Teichert lawyer Wheatley about vested status of Hardesty Sand &amp; Gravel operation at SHM); JX143; JX234 (January 2009 e-mail chain setting up meeting between Gamel, Winter, and lawyers for Teichert); JX392; JX434. Defendants Dickinson, Sherry and Gamel were among the \"primary contacts\" between Teichert and the County. JX507; RT 587:16-588:11 (Wheatley Test.). These regular contacts and the open communication lines between Teichert, County employees and defendants themselves demonstrate the clear weight of the evidence is not against a jury finding of defendants having an improper motivation in determining plaintiffs lacked a vested right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The jury's conclusion was further supported by the County's repeatedly ordering plaintiffs to stop mining altogether despite an increased demand for mining aggregate in Sacramento County.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   JX287, JX421, JX447, RT 528:10 (Gamel acknowledging the April 2010 letter \"does say shut down\" if plaintiffs do not get a use permit and rezone), RT 714:17-20 (Sherry acknowledging \"[w]e did not\" tell plaintiffs they could scale back their mining operation to their original vested right and continue mining),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   RT 1461:9-14 (Schneider testifying about an order saying \"cease mining operations immediately, initiate an application for an amended reclamation plan within seven days, initiate reclamation of pits\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   JX131, JX139, JX157, JX230, JX341, JX671 (Gamel presentation on shortage of local supply), RT 395:11-396:2 (Bly-Chester Test.),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   RT 505:1-24 (Gamel Test.). In his presentation discussing a shortage of local supply, Gamel specifically urged the County to prioritize huge quarries operated by Teichert, Granite and other participants in the funding agreement with the County to meet the critical need for local aggregate. JX671 at 30-32; RT 507:1-10 (Gamel Test.). But on cross-examination during trial, Gamel was asked: \"But the last thing you want to do is lose an actual existing source of sand and gravel in Sacramento County, true?\" He answered: \"I would say that's true, yes.\" RT 514:8-10. Yet significantly, neither Gamel nor Sherry ever suggested-or apparently considered suggesting-the option of plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   paring back their mining during a permitting process to some smaller scale tied to the County's initial recognition of their vested right, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Hansen Brothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1957540\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/12/533/#p551\">\n    12 Cal. 4th at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20778\">\n    48 Cal.Rptr.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=907%20P.2d%201324\">\n    907 P.2d 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Taken together, the evidence reviewed here provided substantial support for a conclusion that defendants operated with an improper motive. It is not the only conclusion the jury could have reached, but it is not the court's job to reweigh the evidence and superimpose its own conclusions after the fact. When considered together with the substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that plaintiffs had a vested right to mine and did not impermissibly expand that vested right, the court cannot rule as a matter of law that defendants should have prevailed on plaintiffs' substantive due process claims because defendants had a legitimate governmental objective. Nor can the court find the clear weight of the evidence above weighs against the jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs on substantive due process claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 469 at 4 (jury verdict finding County and Sherry liable for violation of Hardesty plaintiffs' substantive due process rights and County, Sherry, Dickinson and Gamel liable for violation of Schneider plaintiffs' substantive due process rights).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Complete Deprivation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Notwithstanding the evidence that could have supported the jury's conclusion of an improper motivation, defendants contend there was no \"complete\" or \"total\" substantive due process violation and the verdict therefore conflicts with\n   <em>\n    Dittman v.

Thus, action prohibiting mining at SHM is a total prohibition or complete deprivation of any associated substantive due process rights.

Instead, that letter ordered plaintiffs to cease mining operations completely until they obtained a permit, which required meeting conditions that had the effect of ending the mining operation as explained below. JX287. As defendant Gamel admitted, this letter informed plaintiffs they did not have a vested right in the\n   property. RT 526:21-527:1 (Gamel Test.). The letter stated the County had found that \"the mining that is presently occurring on your property is not protected by your vested right, and the only remedy to permit you to continue mining on the property is to file for and receive approval of a conditional use permit and rezone.\" JX287. Gamel, who authored the letter, testified that the County \"came to a conclusion that\" SHM was not \"still a vested operation\" before April 2, 2009. RT 524:16-18. Gamel further testified that this determination was entirely unilateral, with no notice or hearing to plaintiffs: \"We did not have a hearing. This was an internal matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   525:6. Gamel ultimately agreed that, with no public hearing, the County simply told Schneider and Hardesty they did not have a vested right any more.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   525:10-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The deprivation stemming from the April 2009 letter remained a complete or total deprivation because subsequent hearings about the SHM did not permit adjudication of plaintiffs' claim to an underlying vested right.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , RT 2081:9-11 (Gamel testifying that vested right \"was not the issue before the Board of Supervisors\"); RT 2257:14-19 (Derby testifying that hearings before Board of Supervisors and BZA concerned the notices of alleged zoning violations, not reaffirmation of the vested right); RT 1214:8-24 (Dickinson testifying that 2010 appeal to Board was about a violation of the zoning code and \"was not focused or directed to whatever vested right there may have been\"); RT 999:12-19 (Storelli testifying that if one needs a conditional use permit, one by definition would not be in possession of a vested right). In the County hearings, Dickinson proclaimed his view that the vested right simply did not exist.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , JX483-101:17.

Hardesty testified that defendants' conduct forced him to sell off his expensive, handcrafted equipment for scrap, let all his employees go and incur $5 million in debt, borrowed from family and friends. RT 1739:6-17, 1746:15-24, 1748:19-1752:10.

Schneider testified he attempted to have another mine operator take over after defendants shut down the Hardesty operation. RT 1140:22-25 (Light Test.); 1333:7-1336:4 (Schneider Test.). But it was not feasible for another operator to resume mining in light of the County's refusal to continue recognizing the vested right and its requirement that Schneider obtain a conditional use permit, rezone his land, and post a large bond before allow mining to continue, a process that witnesses testified could take ten years and cost millions of dollars.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , RT 1140:22-25 (Light Test.); 1333:7-1336:4, 1337:25-1338:3 (Schneider Test.); 1707:21-1708:5 (Hardesty Test.); 2255:22-25 (Derby Test.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The evidence reviewed above is substantial and supports the jury's determination that Hardesty and Schneider each experienced a complete deprivation of their vested right to operate the SHM, resulting in the destruction of their respective leasehold interest, mining operation and livelihoods connected with the mine.

Defendants did not raise this issue in their briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Renewed JMOL Mot.; Renewed JMOL Reply; New Trial Mot.; New Trial Reply. Nevertheless, the court addresses this argument because the vested rights issue is at the heart of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defendants' belated contention conflicts with their objection at trial \"to any instructions to the jury on procedural and substantive due process that are in any way premised on the theory that the defendants improperly and impermissibly revoked plaintiffs' alleged vested right to mine.\" ECF No. 427 at 1. Defendants in fact proposed striking an entire set of proposed instructions on \"California Mining Law and Vested Rights,\" including instructions on the\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   standard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-32. The court ultimately did not instruct the jury on the\n   <em>\n    Hansen Brothers\n   </em>\n   case, though the court did instruct the jury that the Schneiders claimed a \"vested right to mine.\" ECF No. 461 at 14. The court finds defendants have waived this argument under the invited error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Regardless, the jury did not need instruction on the\n   <em>\n    Hansen Brothers\n   </em>\n   case to understand the factual dispute between the parties about a vested right to mine, and the law applicable to it. Resolving that factual dispute based on the instructions the court did give permitted the jury to make the legal determination about the existence of a legitimate governmental interest asserted by defendants-that the plaintiffs' lack of vested right, or expansion beyond that vested right, permitted the assertion of a legitimate governmental interest in regulating mining activity and avoiding environmental damage and attendant costs shouldered by the public. The jury found, based on the evidence before it, that this asserted interest was not a legitimate interest. Defendants' own testimony on the confusing nature of the 2002 reclamation plan maps and the County's prior 1994 determination of plaintiffs' rights provided the jury with a factual basis to disbelieve defendants' assertion of having only a legitimate interest, offered in the face of plaintiffs' claims; the jury was free to weigh the County's position along with the totality of the evidence, including the evidence that could support the conclusion of improper motive. It was, as noted elsewhere, for the jury to make credibility determinations among conflicting narratives. On the trial record, the jury was entitled to determine whether the County staff actually concluded the SHM nonconforming use had impermissibly expanded or if County staff instead reached that conclusion pretextually in response to political pressure from plaintiffs' competitor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Excessive Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Defendants also contend a new trial must be granted because the jury's award of $105 million for substantive due process violations was based on an improper measure of damages. New Trial Mot. at 4-5. According to defendants, \"The proper measure of damage should have taken into account the difference in the fair market value of the SHM property as a result of the [p]laintiffs' loss of the right to continue their mining operation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, defendants contend plaintiffs relied on the\n   inherently unreliable testimony of expert witness Gilbert Coleman to justify asking for excessive substantive due process damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   At hearing, defendants conceded their excessive damages challenge was limited to \"[their] Rule 59 motion\" and was \"not a basis for [their] Rule 50(b) motion....\" Hr'g Tr. at 46:9-21.

New Trial Mot. at 5-6. Here as well, the court disagrees. The substantive due process damages are supportable by evidence before the jury, including Coleman's testimony. Although defendants correctly identify problems with Coleman's testimony, including Coleman's contradictions in relying on different sets of tax returns, defendants themselves highlight Coleman's other testimony that supports the jury verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Coleman's testimony bore some indicia of reliability. For instance, Coleman testified that he determines value by looking at profitability and other factors. RT 1521:4-24. Coleman considers the track record of a business to make his calculations, which here included Hardesty Sand &amp; Gravel's success for 30 years as a profitable business with a strong local demand for aggregate.

Defendants admit Coleman provided a revised valuation based on a $1-per-ton payment the Schneiders were supposed to receive. RT 1654:1-25, RT 2104:14-23. Moreover, Coleman testified that, based on the information he had seen, he had no doubt there was enough sand and gravel at the SHM to last for the next 100 years at the production levels he had observed. RT 1576:1-5. Coleman based this testimony on discussions with Hardesty and Schneider. RT 1575:19-22. Coleman's conclusion is consistent with Hardesty's testimony, based on Hardesty's excavating \"hundreds of test holes on th[e] [Schneider] ranch,\" that he \"could easily mine at the rate of pace that [he] was for another 75 or 100 years real easy.\" RT 1747:1-20, 1748:2-5 (Hardesty Test.);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JX11; JX 13 (test holes excavated by Schneider family);\n   <em>\n    Silver Sage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11097736\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/251/814/#p817\">\n    251 F.3d at 819-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding damages expert's assumption was supported by \"fully consistent\" testimony from plaintiff partner).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Schneider's testimony also supports Coleman's conclusion about the quantity of sand and gravel at the SHM. For instance, Schneider testified there were at least \"27\n   million tons of material that we know is in reserves,\" which has \"been mapped out\" and known \"for years and years and years.\" RT 1348:18-21. And Schneider also testified that one can sell aggregate to purchasers \"from stockpiles...or from reserve areas that haven't been mined yet.\" RT 1273:11-13. Those stockpiles have existed since the 1930s, with \"[a] great deal of them in the Forties and early Fifties.\" RT 1309:25-1310:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Contrary to defendants' suggestion, Coleman was not restricted to the testimony of expert Jeff Light as the basis for forming his conclusions about the aggregate reserves and their ability to sustain the Hardesty mining business over the coming decades. Light testified only as to certain areas, comprising only a part of the total acreage of the Schneider ranch, and not the entire SHM tract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RT 1117:21-1121:8. The jury was entitled to assess the testimony of Hardesty and Schneider independently, as well as Coleman's reliance on their testimony in his calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Observing all of these facts, the court does not find the substantive due process damages awarded to the Schneiders excessive or against the clear weight of the evidence. If the jury applied the $1-per-ton price for the Schneiders, considered by Coleman during his testimony, to Schneiders' testimony of at least 27 million tons in reserves, the jury would have arrived at a calculation of $27 million in damages, discounted to $21.6 million using Coleman's methodology of multiplying $27 million by 0.8.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RT 2383:15-21 (Coleman Test.). After adding the $6.43 million in past losses deemed admitted by the court (RT 2392:10-13), a total damages calculation for the Schneiders' substantive due process claim would be $28.03 million. In light of Schneider's testimony and Hardesty and Coleman's testimony on mining for another 75-100 years, a jury crediting those statements and calculating damages based on 30 million tons-establishing a total of $30.43 million in damages after discounting-is not excessive. Defendants' own suggested average tax return values for the Schneider family-$404,776 per year, New Trial Mot. at 7 n.2, and an alternative measure from the $1-per-ton measure of damages-would still permit a jury award of $30,716,560 after discounting Coleman's methodology and including the $6.43 million in past losses, if the jury credited as it could have at least 75 more years of operation of the SHM based on the collective testimony of Hardesty, Schneider, and Coleman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Defendants contend plaintiffs were provided procedural due process as a matter of law, and insufficient evidence supported the jury verdict that the County violated the due process rights of the Hardesty and Schneider plaintiffs.

As defendant Gamel testified,\n   the 2009 letter informed Schneider and Hardesty they did not have a vested right to mine on the Schneider property. RT 526:21-527:1 (Gamel Test.). The letter, penned by defendant Gamel and signed by defendant Sherry (JX287; RT 685:11-20, 687:7-19, 687:24-25), stated the County had found that \"the mining that is presently occurring on your property is not protected by your vested right, and the only remedy to permit you to continue mining on the property is to file for and receive approval of a conditional use permit and rezone.\" JX287.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Defendants direct the court to Sherry's testimony that the April 2009 letter, instead of being a unilateral deprivation of a vested right, was a request for plaintiffs \"to contact Jeff Gamel\" for a \"further dialogue...about this situation.\" RT 691:18-19. However, when asked about the 2009 letter's content with respect to an enforcement action, Sherry responded \"[t]here was no specific enforcement action intended.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   752:5-14.

That no one from the County replied to a response letter sent by Schneider's counsel reinforces Sherry's testimony that no enforcement action, with attendant procedures, was intended based on the April 2009 letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JX302; RT 752:22-755:7 (Sherry Test.). Thus, this letter and the related testimony permitted the jury to infer the County made a vested rights determination prior to sending the letter, without any form of hearing.

There, Gamel and Derby characterized \"Code Enforcement\" zoning violation notices issued in April and May 2010 as enforcing the \"April 2009\" determination by the \"Planning Director...that a Use Permit and a Re-zone was required\" and the \"continuing operation\" of the Mine following that April 2009 determination as \"in violation of the Sacramento Zoning Code.\" JX484 at 4. This evidence was before the jury; the jury reasonably could have found it lended further support to a determination that the April 2009 letter communicated a decision that plaintiffs no longer had any vested right to mine and had no way to contest the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Additional testimony supports the conclusion the County made its vested rights determination without any form of process. Gamel, who authored the letter, testified that he and others \"came to a conclusion that it was not\" \"still a vested operation\" before April 2, 2009. RT 524:16-18 (Gamel Test.). Gamel further testified that this determination was entirely unilateral, with no notice or hearing to plaintiffs: \"We did not have a hearing.

For instance, when asked whether the Board in September 2010 \"affirmed the vested rights of the Schneider Historic Mine,\" Gamel testified, \"That was not the issue before the Board of Supervisors.\" RT 2081:9-11. Similarly, Tammy Derby testified that the hearings before the Board and BZA concerned notices of alleged zoning violations, not reaffirmation of the vested right. RT 2257:14-19.

Supervisor Notolli and County counsel clarified the September 14, 2010 hearing was \"not on a vested right determination...just on whether a zoning code violation\" occurred,\" and County counsel informed the Board of Supervisors that Schneider would need to \"go across the street to the courts\" to argue the vested right determination. JX483 at 69:14-70:23. County counsel also informed the BZA during its hearings that the vested rights determination was not at issue there: \"That Reclamation Plan and that issue of what is vested pursuant to SMARA was decided at the time that the current Reclamation Plan was approved by the Board of Supervisors in 2002.\" PX568 at 145:21-24.

Substantial evidence permitted a jury inference that defendants took action against the Schneider plaintiffs for filing suit against defendants and the clear weight of the evidence is not against such a finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   A First Amendment retaliation claim has three elements: (1) plaintiff was engaged in protected activity; (2) defendant's actions injured plaintiff in a way that would chill a person of ordinary firmness from further protected activities; and (3) defendant's actions were a response to plaintiff's exercise of constitutionally protected conduct.\n   <em>\n    Corales v.

These elements were captured in the court's Final Jury Instruction 21, ECF No. 461 at 26-27, which told the jury the Schneiders were required to prove that: (1) their rights to petition for redress to the County and the courts were protected under the First Amendment; (2) the County took action against the Schneider Plaintiffs; and (3) chilling or punishing the Schneider Plaintiffs' protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor for the County's action. Defendants do not contest the sufficiency of the evidence as to the first or third element, but only as to the second.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Renewed JMOL Mot.; Renewed JMOL Reply; New Trial Mot.; New Trial Reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Substantial evidence supported the jury's finding that the County took action against the Schneider Plaintiffs in response to the plaintiffs' filing suit, and that the action came in the form of dramatically increasing a Financial Assurance Cost Estimate (FACE) that plaintiffs would need to provide to maintain their mining activity. The FACE for SHM was historically low until June 10, 2011, when it briefly was increased from $164,223 to $830,490 before being reduced again to $177,942 in February 2012.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   PX568 at 165:9,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   JX463\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   JX559 at 3,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   JX 589 at 7. Specifically, the BZA lowered the FACE back to historic levels after a BZA hearing on December 21, 2011, at which the County presented testimony from its consulting geologist, although plaintiffs were not given a chance to present their case.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   PX568 at 309:21-310:3, 303:23-306:5,\n   <em>\n    with id.\n   </em>\n   at 364:19-365:10. Nonetheless, after the December 2011 hearing, the BZA set the FACE at $177,942 as adequate to reclaim the mine based on its order to fill mine pits to no more than 30 feet deep. PX568 at 87:2-9, 382:10; JX 589 at 7. Defendants' consulting geologist even suggested plaintiffs might receive some money back at their next inspection. PX568 at 401:11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   But the FACE dramatically increased after the Schneider plaintiffs filed suit on September 27, 2012. Despite defendants' delivering a letter on October 9, 2012 to the Schneiders notifying them their required FACE deposit of $177,942 was final and approved (JX604 at 41; JX 605 at 9), defendants conducted an annual inspection of the mine the next day. JX605. Defendants then issued an inspection report increasing the FACE deposit to $8,817,074 or in the alternative $901,336 if the plaintiffs filled their mine pits with fill from the SHM property itself. JX604; JX 605 at 21. The jury heard testimony from Schneider that even the $901,336 alternative would\n   have involved using \"several million dollars of [their] stockpile material.\" RT 1338:18-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Substantial evidence provided support for the jury's inference that the increase in the FACE was not justified. Although the October 2012 inspection report states the BZA \"ruled that final reclamation of the pit area would require the pits to be [completely] backfilled,\" JX 605 at 18, the BZA actually had ordered the pits filled to 30 feet or less. JX589 at 7. Additionally, defendants' consulting geologist testified at trial that the SHM reclamation plan required only 30-foot pits, RT 2181:18-2182:3 (Bieber Test.), and plaintiffs' consulting engineer testified as well that filling the pits completely was inconsistent with both the reclamation plan and common mining practice. RT 963:1-967:20. Additionally, defendants' consulting geologist testified at trial there had been no change in conditions at the SHM despite the inspection report's stating its ruling was based on \"changes in condition\" between the 2011 and 2012 inspections of the closed mine. RT 2206:9-10; JX 605 at 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   RT 950:11-20 (Olsen testimony that \"[b]ecause there hadn't been any mining activities done...the site really hadn't changed.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Substantial evidence also supported a jury inference that defendants themselves caused the unjustified FACE increase. Defendants approached their consulting geologist and asked him to \"determine what the cost would be if we have to import material to bring the site into...substantial conformity to surrounding topography\" based on a BZA determination \"that the 30-foot does not apply to the depths of the pits.\" RT 2207:14-2208:2 (Bieber Test.). Yet defendants knew the mine had material on hand to use as fill, and the BZA had not determined the 30-foot standard did not apply. PX568 at 379:3. The consulting geologist testified that, had the County not directed him to calculate the costs of completely refilling pits, he would have continued interpreting the reclamation plan to allow 30-foot deep pits. RT 2210:25 (Bieber Test.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The clear weight of the evidence here does not run counter to the jury verdict finding a First Amendment violation by the County. Although defendant Gamel testified the BZA had ordered the pits needed to be refilled if the reclamation plan was not amended, RT 2090:17-2092:22, a compliance table adopted by that Board on December 12, 2011 mentions only filling pits to 30 feet deep. JX589 at 6-8. Gamel's statements made in his letter of November 28, 2012, which was attached to an inspection report, that the BZA ordered the pits completely filled, JX605, simply are not consistent with the record of the Board's actions in December 2011, at a hearing Gamel attended. PX 568 at 302. Additionally, this evidence, along with the timeline of events cited above, permitted while not requiring the jury to infer that the County intentionally took action against the Schneiders for filing suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Defendants' reliance on plaintiffs' refusal to file an amended reclamation plan, Renewed JMOL Mot. at 60-61, does not shift the clear weight of the evidence either. First, an amended reclamation plan is needed only where there is a substantial deviation from the previously approved reclamation plan.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2014%2C%20%C2%A7%203502\">\n    Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, \u00a7 3502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). But the substantial evidence cited throughout this order shows no substantial deviation. Second, requiring plaintiffs to file an amended reclamation plan for approval would conflict directly with plaintiffs' claims in their lawsuit, and the alternative involved was to pay a price of at least $901,336 and perhaps as high as $8,817,074. Third, this rationale even if given some weight does not rebut defendant Gamel's statements misreporting on\n   BZA orders or the relatively sudden and dramatic increase in the FACE very shortly after the Schneiders filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   VI.\n   <em>\n    MANDAMUS AND PRECLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Defendants contend plaintiffs' due process claims are barred as a matter of law for two reasons.

Defendants cite Jury Instruction 22, which addressed damages for procedural due process violations and explained \"only nominal damages are recoverable for a deprivation of a property interest determined to be otherwise justified.\" JI 22. According to defendants, because the jury awarded nominal damages for a violation of procedural due process, the jury necessarily determined the deprivation was \"otherwise justified.\" And because the procedural due process violation was otherwise\n   justified, the jury's verdict regarding procedural due process thus conflicted with the jury's verdict finding a substantive due process violation based on an \"arbitrary\" violation of plaintiffs' liberty or property interests. New Trial Mot. at 15 (\"Thus, on the procedural due process claim, the Jury found that the deprivation of Plaintiffs' property interest was justified, and in the substantive due process claim, the Jury found the deprivation of Plaintiffs' property interest was unjustified, in that it was arbitrary.

Indeed, that is what plaintiffs asserted in closing argument. RT 2493:5-24 (asking only for \"nominal damages\" after asserting that procedural due process \"is not the claim we believe all of the damages came from, but the county has to be called for that. They have to know what they did was wrong.\"). Plaintiffs asserted they believed both substantive and procedural due process rights were violated, one \"carried enormous consequences,\" and \"that the core issue in this case is substantive due process.\" RT 2466:8-9, 2496:21-22. When discussing substantive due process damages, plaintiffs asserted \"the county refused to recognize the vested right, it shut the mine down.\" RT 2498:3-4.

For instance, Dickinson's office contacted County staff about potential violations at SHM as early as October 2008. JX214; JX157 at 3. Dickinson met with Teichert and other defendants multiple times, including to discuss SHM. JX363; JX392; JX507. At a September 14, 2010 hearing, Dickinson announced he did not believe there was a vested right, JX483-014:23-15:17, and he disavowed the County's recognition of the vested rights in 1994. JX483-019:16-020:12. During a Board of\n   Supervisors hearing, Dickinson called on one of Teichert's attorneys to not only testify but also to introduce an \"extensive letter, a whole series of exhibits attached to it which cover virtually every issue which was discussed here this afternoon.\" JX483-079:15-21. Dickinson also denied Schneider's requested time to review evidence from Teichert. JX483-100:10-101:10. And Dickinson voted to close the SHM on September 28, 2010. JX483 at 104-07. At trial, Dickinson affirmed documentation showing Teichert made a campaign contribution to him the day before the critical hearing, although he also noted he would not have known of the donation at the time. As noted, Teichert agreed to help fund the County's aggregate enforcement program the day after the hearing. RT 1231:15-24, 1232:9-1233:13. From this evidence, weighing it as instructed, it was not the jury's only option but the jury could infer Dickinson engaged in affirmative acts causing the SHM to eventually permanently close without any legitimate governmental objective, but instead to satisfy Teichert as a donor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   d)\n   <em>\n    Sherry and Gamel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Defendants contend \"there is no evidence\" that Sherry or Gamel \"violated any constitutional rights of the [p]laintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62-63.

Thus, contentions about Sherry or Gamel acting in their official capacity as final policymakers-a form of municipal liability-are not relevant to a qualified immunity analysis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , RT 2279:2-5, 15-22 (Derby testimony that the planning department-of which Sherry was the director as of April 2, 2009-had final decision-making authority \"to determine whether there was a vested right or not,\" and the code enforcement department would then follow the planning department's directives to enforce zoning violations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Regardless, both Sherry and Gamel engaged in affirmative acts that the jury could find caused a deprivation of plaintiffs' substantive due process rights. For instance, Sherry transmitted to plaintiffs the April 2009 letter, which was drafted by Gamel and copied to Dickinson. JX287; JX288. Gamel communicated via email with Teichert lawyer Wheatley about SHM two weeks before the April 2, 2009 letter was issued, and Gamel met with Wheatley a week before sending the e-mail. JX275; 649:12-650:10. Gamel had also responded to a complaint by Teichert about the SHM operating without permits under vested rights by stating to Teichert, \"We will see what we can do.\" JX143. Gamel then provided updates to Teichert, including in a \"Teichert goodies\" email to Teichert's John Lane. PX676. From this substantial evidence, the jury was permitted to infer that Sherry and Gamel's actions in communicating with Dickinson and Teichert about SHM, and in issuing the letter to plaintiffs declaring plaintiffs' mining was \"not protected by [plaintiffs'] vested right,\" caused the deprivation of plaintiffs' vested right to mine. To the extent a factual dispute remained as to the parties' motives, a threshold resolution of that dispute\n   remained an appropriate task of the jury in the context of a claim of qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lolli v.

Defendant contends no comparable cases exist for the third guidepost-the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. Renewed JMOL Mot. at 71. The court therefore addresses the first two guideposts below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Here, the jury awarded punitive damages against Dickinson of $25,000, Gamel of $1,000,000 and Sherry of $250,000, all to Schneider plaintiffs. ECF No. 469 at 7-8. The jury also awarded $500,00 in punitive damages against Sherry to Hardesty plaintiffs, for a total of $750,000 in punitive damages awarded against Sherry.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030875\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/408/#p418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Substantial evidence permitted the jury to infer a significant degree of reprehensibility of defendants' misconduct. First, as previously discussed, ample evidence shows defendants communicating and coordinating with Teichert about the investigation of SHM's vested right.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , JX363; JX392; JX487; JX507. Campaign reporting records show Dickinson's campaign fund received a contribution the day before his vote to close SHM, and Teichert agreed to help fund the County's aggregate enforcement program the day after that hearing. RT 1231:15-24, 1232:9-1233:13 (Teichert Test.). Gamel authored the April 2009 letter, and Sherry signed it, declaring plaintiffs' mining was \"not protected by [plaintiffs'] vested right.\" JX287. Sherry signed this letter despite acknowledging the County never told plaintiffs they could scale back their mining operation to some \"original\" vested right. RT 714:17-20. Sherry also signed this letter apparently without understanding the maps attached to the 2002 reclamation plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RT 701:6-704:20 (testifying he \"can't tell\" and did not \"know what the colors mean\" in reference to maps with legends indicating estimates as to where mining likely will occur in the next 20, 40, and 100 years). And Gamel testified to the County's unilateral determination without a hearing. RT 524:16-18, 525:6. The sum total of this conduct resulted in the closure of SHM and plaintiffs' loss of livelihood. This evidence supports a jury finding that defendants' conduct involved targets who \"had financial vulnerability,\" involved \"repeated actions,\" was \"the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit,\" or involved a \"callous indifference to the\n   constitutional rights of others.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030875\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/408/#p418\">\n    538 U.S. at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030875\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/408/#p418\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dang v.
