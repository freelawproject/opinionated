Plaintiffs' unverified Complaint asserts a First Amendment pre-enforcement challenge against Montana's robocalling statute. Defendants challenge Plaintiffs' standing to present this claim because the claim rests on the legal rights and interests of others, and parties ordinarily do not enforce the constitutional rights of others. In order to demonstrate third-party standing, Plaintiffs must show that they have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) have a close relation to the third party, and (3) the third party is hindered from protecting his or her own interests.\n   <em>\n    Wasson v.

Plaintiffs seem to meet the first two prongs of this test in that Plaintiffs may lose business and profits in Montana if they cannot send fully-automated political campaign robocalls to Montana residences (and can be fined if they do), and there is a contractual relationship between Plaintiffs and their political campaign customers. The Court does not see any hindrance, however, to the third party's ability to litigate this question directly, and Plaintiffs' refusal to divulge the name of any potential customer (on grounds of confidentiality) causes the Court to wonder somewhat about the nature and extent of such customer interest, if any. On the other hand, an obvious hindrance to obtaining customers willing to be named in a suit\n   would be the Montana statute's prohibition itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because of concerns regarding the \"chilling effect of sweeping restrictions\" on speech, the Supreme Court has endorsed pre-enforcement actions.\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

The Court should consider \"(1) the likelihood that the law will be enforced against the plaintiff, (2) whether the plaintiff has shown, 'with some degree of concrete detail,' that she intends to violate the challenged law; and (3) whether the law even applies to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Italian Colors Restaurant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266810\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/1165/\">\n    878 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1172 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

Plaintiffs were incorporated in Michigan in 2012 and claim to have been engaged in selling robocall services outside of Montana. Plaintiff claims to have had potential Montana clients decide against hiring Victory Processing because Montana's robocalling statute stands in the way. Defendants point out that Plaintiff Dishaw's affidavit is devoid of facts relating to time, date, or specific instances of conduct as to either Plaintiff's intent to violate the law or as to Defendants' intent to enforce the law. It is troubling that Plaintiffs refused to divulge any information during discovery that would have supported their alleged intention and opportunity to violate the law. Plaintiffs' refusal to divulge the names of any potential customers (on grounds of confidentiality) provides only a thin basis for standing, but the Court believes the law applies to Plaintiff's proposed robocalls, that the law arguably affects a constitutional interest, that Plaintiffs have shown an intention to violate Montana's robocalling law, and that it is likely Montana would enforce its law against Plaintiffs if Plaintiffs were to register, for example, with the State to conduct robocalling in Montana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   n. 1.

Furthermore, in each instance, the sender of the robocall and the recipient are strangers to each other. The third common thread between the subsection 216(1)(a)-(e) conduct is the recipient's lack of prior consent for the robocall. Notably, all these prohibited robocalls are permitted under the statute when the call is introduced by a live operator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   And there are exceptions to the live operator requirement. The common thread for the exceptions granted in subsection 216(2) is that the excepted robocalls provide information that recipients clearly wish to receive because it is of benefit to them. For example, such robocalls notify the recipient that an item previously ordered is now in stock; an item previously ordered is available for delivery or pickup; or an expected package delivery is delayed by bad weather, etc. All such robocalls rely on a pre-existing business relationship between the parties and are also made for the primary benefit of the recipient. The third common thread is that these calls can be fairly deemed to be supported by implied consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Very significantly, subsection (2) of \u00a7 45-8-216 provides a global exception such that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   prohibited robocall can be made legal under Montana law simply by prefacing the robocall with a live operator who obtains the recipient's permission for the playing of the recorded message. Not only can a recipient then decline to receive that message, but also the recipient can request that no further calls be made, thereby reducing the number of interruptions in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Surveying the entire statute as a whole, the Court finds that it is organized in a logical and consistent fashion. The common thread running throughout the statute is that robocalls are prohibited without actual or implied consent. Robocalls made within the context of a preexisting relationship\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   made for the primary benefit of the recipient are not prohibited by this statute and do not require a live operator. In addition, robocalls made pursuant to actual consent are not prohibited. Only robocalls lacking in actual or implied consent are prohibited, and this prohibition has absolutely nothing to do with the content of any of those messages. In other words, the\n   <em>\n    justification\n   </em>\n   for the facially content-based discrimination holds up because there is no underlying discriminatory intent and the government's interest in protecting privacy is compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that protection of residential privacy is not a compelling government interest and claims that it has not been found to be so by any court, except perhaps for the two lower court cases in\n   <em>\n    Brickman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   . However, the Fourth Circuit did assume in\n   <em>\n    Cahaly\n   </em>\n   , a case relied upon by Plaintiffs, that the government interest in protecting residential privacy and tranquility is a compelling one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cahaly v.

CONTENT NEUTRALITY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   VPLLC and Dishaw argue that the 45-8-216(1)(e) prohibition on robocalls promoting a political campaign or any use related to a political campaign is not content neutral. They point to the statute itself: subsection 216(1)(e) explicitly states that robocalls \"promoting a political campaign or any use related to a political campaign\" are prohibited (if not introduced by a live operator as provided in subsection 216(2) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   There can be no doubt that Montana's robocall statute is content-based. The statute targets five types of speech (commercial sales, commercial advertising, surveys and polling, and campaigning) for differential treatment than other types of speech. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2230\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2230,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2230\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), a statute that identifies particular topics and subject matter for differential regulation is facially content-based.

Cal. 2016), both of which analyzed the California robocall statute pursuant to intermediate scrutiny, because in those cases, the California robocall statute did not single out political subject matter for special restrictions in the way that Montana's robocall statute does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   However, it is clear that Montana's content-based identification of subject matter is not intended to suppress discussion of the topic or of any viewpoint. A proliferation of campaign robocalls could lead easily to a veritable arms-race of political campaign robocalls and cause the exact privacy problem that the Montana statute is designed to prevent: the annoyance and harassment of Montanans in their households-an invasion of the close. Indeed, Plaintiffs analyze the political campaign speech prohibition in subsection (1)(e) by ignoring the rest of the statute. Taken altogether, the entire statute demonstrates that it is not organized by the content of speech at all, but instead is organized whether or not the robocalls are consented to by the recipient. Whether this statute is content based or content neutral is thus a closer question that might first appear, but this Court concedes that the Montana statute is content-based under the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Reed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While not disregarding the content-based nature of the Montana robocall restriction, the Court also considers whether the justification for the statute is content based or content neutral. The Supreme Court has defined content neutrality as follows: \"A regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but\n   not others. Government regulation of expressive activity is content neutral so long as it is 'justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    491 U.S. 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2754,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    105 L.Ed.2d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

It is clear that the statute categorizes political messages on an equal footing with the other named categories of messages (sales, advertisements, polling, and data gathering), and that the salient characteristics of these messages are that they are (a) unconsented, (b) between strangers, and (c) primarily of benefit to the sender, not the recipient. In addition, the section 216(a)(1)-(e) categories make up the bulk of robocall communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On the other hand, the subsection 216(2) messages that are exempt from the live-operator requirement are those messages arising in the context of (a) implied consent, (b) a preexisting relationship, and (c) primarily of benefit to the recipient, not the sender. These exceptions to the general robocalling rule make up a much smaller group of communications. Therefore, the manner in which the Montana statute draws a bright line between the two groups is not organized by the\n   <em>\n    content\n   </em>\n   of the messages, but divides along the characteristics of consenting, pre-existing relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Cahaly v.

For example, Ideological Signs could be 20 feet square and could be placed anywhere and for any amount of time. Political Signs could be 16 square feet on private property and 32 square feet on nonresidential property but limited as to time for 60 days before a primary up until 15 days after a general election. Receiving the most restrictive treatment, a \"Temporary Directional Sign\" could be allowed, but no more than four such signs, no bigger than six square feet, on a particular property; furthermore these temporary directional signs were permitted from no more than 12 hours before and 1 hour after the qualifying event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In fact, at the beginning of the\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   litigation, which was brought by Pastor Reed on behalf of his congregation at the Good News Community Church, this exemption was originally titled \"Religious Assembly Temporary Direction Signs,\" and it was directed specifically at religious congregations that had no fixed place of worship. When Pastor Reed's litigation was first filed against the Town of Gilbert, these directional signs could be placed no more than 2 hours before and one hour after the religious services, which posed a severe problem for Pastor Reed because his congregation did not know where the service would be held until the signs went up. This is content-based regulation because it \"singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment, even if it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2230\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Although not plainly discussed as a case of religious discrimination, the strict scrutiny accorded in\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   was plainly warranted on multiple grounds.

In\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , the facially content-based nature of the statute actually did disclose at least the scent of discriminatory animus underlying a superficially neutral justification. This Court distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   on that basis, because that type of underlying discrimination against an entire group or an entire subject matter or a viewpoint is not present in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   E.

The purpose of the restriction is to give control over the playing of the recorded message to the recipient, who can further request that no future calls be made. The underlying purpose of this restriction is to protect the privacy and tranquility of the person receiving the robocall. The statutory exemption that is provided to established business relationships is content neutral and consistent with the overall scheme because the preexisting relationship supports a finding of implied consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   G. NARROWLY TAILORED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Having determined that Montana's robocall statute is content based, but that the it serves a compelling governmental interest, the next question is whether the statute is narrowly tailored to address that governmental interest. First, it is clear robocalls are by and large permissible in most contexts in Montana. The statute narrowly tailors to the governmental interest in protecting the peace and tranquility of the household by requiring, in most instances, that a live operator give control over the message to the recipient for the purpose of consenting, declining, or asking to be taken off the calling list. Only calls fairly categorized as being between related parties, and for which implied consent can reasonably be inferred, are relieved of the live-operator requirement, and therefore the Montana statute is not underinclusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   There is not a less restrictive alternative that would serve Montana's purpose. For example, a time-of-day restriction (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , before 8:00 a.m. and after 9:00p p.m.) is a minimal benefit when householders (such as infirm persons who may have trouble getting to a phone, mothers with small children, and people working in their homes, to name just a few categories) are exposed to automated calls for twelve or more hours each day. Likewise, a recording disclosing a caller's identity is cold comfort for a blaring recorded message that is unwanted, and do-not-call lists are notoriously ineffective. The Montana statute is therefore not overinclusive because all of the robocalls that are reasonably likely to be unwelcome are covered by the statute; the Montana statute is not underinclusive because the few categories of calls not restricted by the live-operator requirement are reasonably understood to have implied consent and therefore need no restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   H. ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND LESS RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE REQUIREMENTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   There are two additional aspects to the overinclusive/underinclusive narrow tailoring question. First, the restriction \"must leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338073\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/288/#p293\">\n    468 U.S. 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338073\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/288/#p293\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338073\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/288/#p293\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Second, the restriction must be no more restrictive than necessary to serve the governmental interest, but it need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means possible.\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    491 U.S. at 788-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    109 S.Ct. at 2758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Montana's robocalling statute still leaves ample means of communication for individuals and organizations. Advance permission for robocalls can be obtained from donors and potential donors. Use of a live operator to introduce the recorded message may be an option. An alternative is to use live operators to communicate the entire message. There are many other channels of communication. There is leafletting and pamphleting of residences and street corners. There are billboards, posters, and yard signs. Bulk mailing is available. Internet and other media provide enormous opportunities for bulk message distribution. Obviously there are ample alternative channels for Plaintiffs' communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because a live-operator requirement is less restrictive than a complete prohibition while still serving the government's interest as no other less restrictive alternative can do, the \"less restrictive alternative\" requirement is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A telephone system generally, and certainly a residential telephone in particular, is a privately-owned means of communication. We are not examining a traditional public forum where content-based restrictions examined with strict scrutiny would generally weigh against constitutionality. The uses for a private communications facility should be determined in the first instance by the choices made by the owner of that private property. In the context of robocalls, Montana's statutory restrictions on robocalls are intended to preserve, not diminish, the private property owner's control over his or her property and personal choices regarding receipt of communications, both of which are integral elements of residential privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Political speech is precious under the First Amendment. The prohibition here of the promotion of a political campaign must meet a high bar to survive this challenge. It does so on its face by exempting robocall use if the permission of the called party is obtained by a live operator before the recorded message is delivered. It is this permission which is the saving grace of the Montana statute in this facial challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court concludes that Montana's robocall statute is a constitutionally permissible content-based regulation of speech. The governmental interest advanced by the statute is the compelling interest in protecting residential privacy and tranquility. The Montana statute is narrowly tailored to that government interest by preserving control and choice for the householder and leaving ample alternative (including all of the more traditional) channels of communication for the protected political speech.
