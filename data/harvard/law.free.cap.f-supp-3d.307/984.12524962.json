Standard for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) directs a court to grant summary judgment if the movant \"show[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that [the movant] is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" The burden of showing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact initially lies with the moving party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the moving party meets the burden, the non-moving party must present specific factual evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue of fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The non-moving party may not rely on mere allegations or denials.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Fund asserts that because PCS's claims relate to an ERISA plan, the\n   claims are preempted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"ERISA's preemption provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), provides that ERISA's provisions shall generally 'supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section 1003(a) of this title and not exempt under section 1003(b) of this title.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ninth Circuit has held that \"[a] common law claim 'relates to' an ERISA plan 'if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In determining whether a common law claim has 'reference to' an ERISA plan, the focus is whether the claim is premised on the existence of an ERISA plan, and whether the existence of the plan is essential to the claim's survival.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In evaluating whether a claim has a 'connection with' an ERISA plan, we use a 'relationship test' that focuses whether the 'claim bears on an ERISA-regulated relationship,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the relationship between plan and plan member, between plan and employer, between employer and employee.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Here, PCS's claims against the Fund are based on its assertion that the Fund \"failed to pay sums due, or delayed payment, for Covered Services provided to Eligible Persons under the Agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   PCS's briefing on the summary judgment motions focuses on the Master Services Agreement executed between the Fund and Beech Street and its affiliates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MSA states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A Payor must pay a Participating Provider the amount payable under the applicable Plan for Covered Services within 30 calendar days of receipt of a complete or clean claim (as that term is defined under applicable law) from the Participating Provider or within the timeframe required by the applicable state's prompt payment of claims law. Timely payment of the Fee Schedule will be payment in full for Covered Services. In the event of failure to timely pay, the Provider Contract discount may be rescinded and, in such event, Payor will pay the Participating Provider the amount payable under the applicable Plan without the application of the Fee Schedule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The MSA in turn defines \"Covered Services\" as \"health care services provided pursuant to an Eligible Person's Plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plan, in turn, defines Covered Charges as \"the actual costs charged for services to the extent that such charges are Usual, Customary, and Reasonable for the area and type of service.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As covered dependents of a Fund participant, the Twins' treatment at Providence resulted in a total of $4,038,464.76 in charges. PCS seeks payment of the disputed portion of those charges. The Fund defends by asserting that the disputed charges \"were not a covered benefit under the Fund's plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dispute here centers\n   on whether certain services provided to the Twins by Providence were not \"Usual, Customary, and Reasonable for the area and type of Service,\" so as to fall outside the Plan's definition of Covered Charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   PCS's Complaint asserts that the Fund's denials of payment are not warranted and constitute a breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no dispute that the Plan at issue is governed by ERISA. However, PCS maintains that \"[s]ince the Fund is not relying on Plan language due to the complete and total silence of the Plan on the issue of billing guidelines and practices, PCS's claim does not relate to Plan terms; and therefore ERISA preemption does not apply.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   And yet, PCS's Complaint acknowledges the central role that the Plan plays in the dispute between the Fund and PCS, as it alleges that \"[p]arties like the Fund ('Payors') are responsible for the payment of medical services covered by the Payor's plan ('Covered Services') that are medically necessary ('Medically Necessary') on behalf of the plan's beneficiaries ('Eligible Persons').\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In arguing against preemption, PCS describes its case as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   PCS is suing the Fund not for \"covered services\" as the Defendant claims in their Motion, but as an assignee of the independent third-party medical provider under the various contract agreements that were formed between each party and the intermediary. The issue in this case is damages for medical services that were performed but not paid under the terms of the contracts, which provided a discounted rate for services under terms of those plans and therefore not subject to ERISA preemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, PCS is unable to escape the fact that the terms of the Fund's ERISA Plan dictate the services the Fund covers, which eviscerates PCS's arguments that its claims do not relate to the Fund's Plan. PCS also rejects the Fund's objections based on the Fund's argument that the charges do not meet the UCR standard set forth by the Plan, asserting that the charges are in line with Medicare guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, even if the Fund's UCR standards are vague, as PCS seems to suggest, it does not mean that the Fund's standards are not determinative of the disputed charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court presented a broad view of ERISA preemption under ERISA \u00a7 514(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff employees claimed that their ERISA plans \"did not provide benefits to employees disabled by pregnancy as required by the New York Human Rights Law and the State's Disability Benefits Law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argued that the claims were preempted; Plaintiffs argued that because\n   their claims fell within the preemption exception of \u00a7 514(d), which states that \u00a7 514(a) \"shall not be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs asserted that in their case, \"pre-emption of state fair employment laws would impair and modify Title VII because it would change the means by which it is enforced.\" In holding the plaintiffs' claim were preempted, the Court held, \"We have no difficulty in concluding that the Human Rights Law and Disability Benefits Law 'relate to' employee benefit plans.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court recognized that \"Congress used the words 'relate to' in \u00a7 514(a) in their broad sense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While PCS acknowledges the importance of\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   as a central preemption case, it asserts that the Fund \"fail[s] to cite other important cases that help further clarify the limits of preemption and distinguish types of cases that fall outside of preemption.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   PCS cites\n   <em>\n    The Meadows v. Employers Health Insurance\n   </em>\n   for its statement that \"courts have held that ERISA does not preempt a third-party provider's independent state law claims against a plan precisely because those claims do not 'relate to' the administration of an ERISA plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that case, which PCS acknowledges is \"not directly on point,\" an ERISA plan misrepresented to a provider that an individual was a covered participant, resulting in a suit by the provider for breach of contract, estoppel, and misrepresentation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling that the claims were not preempted because the \"state law claims for misrepresentation and estoppel 'make no reference to' and 'function irrespective of' the existence of an ERISA plan.\" Here, the same cannot be said of PCS's claims, which depend on obligations of the Fund that are outlined in the Plan documents. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    The Meadows\n   </em>\n   that, \"In the instant case, that the [individuals] were not beneficiaries of any plan at the time Employers Health misrepresented the existing coverage is further reason to conclude that The Meadows' claim does not 'relate to' the provisions of the ERISA plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the court noted that \"the district court's decision is also in line with several policy considerations that militate against preemption\" but which do not apply in the instant case, such as the Fifth Circuit's \"observ[ation] that insulating plan fiduciaries from the consequences of their own misrepresentations to third-party providers does not further any of ERISA's objectives.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   PCS also cites\n   <em>\n    Blues Cross of California v. Anesthesia Care Associates\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Catholic Healthcare West-Bay Area v. Seafarers Health &amp; Benefits Plan\n   </em>\n   , two cases in which claims involving ERISA plans were held not preempted under \u00a7 1144.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Anesthesia Care\n   </em>\n   , four medical care providers were in a dispute with an insurance company whose Prudent Buyer Plan covered private employer subscribers and their employees, similar to the Fund in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, unlike the instant case,\n   the dispute did not involve medical costs relating to individual beneficiaries. Instead, the case involved \"changes in the fee schedules that Blue Cross allegedly made in 1993, 1994, and 1995.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although \"[e]ach of the Providers ha[d] some patients who [were] enrolled in the Prudent Buyer Plan as part of a health benefit plan covered by ERISA,\" the connection between the cause of action and the ERISA plan was more tenuous than here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court held that provider's claims were not preempted because they \"arise from Blue Cross' alleged breach of the provider agreements' provisions regarding fee schedules, and the procedure for setting them, not what charges are 'covered' under the Prudent Buyer Plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, by contrast, what charges are covered under the Plan is at the heart of the dispute. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Anesthesia\n   </em>\n   , the instant dispute \"encroaches on relationships regulated by ERISA, such as between plan and plan member, plan and employer, and plan and trustee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Catholic Healthcare West-Bay Area v. Seafarers Health &amp; Benefits Plan\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case. There, St. Mary's Medical Center brought state law claims against Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan for breach of implied contract, negligent misrepresentation, estoppel, quantum meruit, and indebitatus assumpsit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ninth Circuit held that the claims were not preempted, because \"where a third party medical provider sues an ERISA plan based on contractual obligations arising directly between the provider and the ERISA plan (or for misrepresentations of coverage made by the ERISA plan to the provider), no ERISA-governed relationship is implicated[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, in that case, the plaintiff represented to the court that \"any claims it might have had under Seafarers' plan either have been resolved or waived[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, however, PCS's claims directly invoke the Plan, whose terms are essential in determining the amounts allegedly owed by the Fund for the Twins' healthcare costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, declining to recognize preemption in this case would permit an \"end-run around ERISA by wholesale incorporation of an ERISA plan into the terms of an implied contract\" that the Ninth Circuit warned against in its\n   <em>\n    Seafarers\n   </em>\n   decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The situation in this case is more akin to that in\n   <em>\n    Lodi Mem'l Hosp. Ass'n v. Tiger Lines, LLC.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lodi\n   </em>\n   , a hospital filed an action for quantum meruit and violations of California's Unfair Competition Law, asserting that it was owed reimbursement for medical services provided to beneficiaries of an ERISA plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the hospital attempted to frame its claim as being sufficiently independent from the ERISA plan to avoid preemption under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the district court disagreed. The court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Absent any basis independent from the provisions of the Plan for Plaintiff's\n   claim that it is owed more for services provided than it has already received, a contention Plaintiff has not made as stated above, the viability of both of Plaintiff's claims must necessarily rest on a claim that Plaintiff is owed more under the provisions of the Plan itself. Such a claim, however, premised on Defendants' obligations to provide benefits to patients pursuant to the terms of the Plan, clearly relates to ERISA. As such, both of Plaintiff's current causes of action conflict with ERISA and those claims must be dismissed on that basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Plan that governs the Twins' coverage is critical to the determination of what amounts are payable to Providence by the Fund for the healthcare provided to the twins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the same logic as\n   <em>\n    Lodi\n   </em>\n   applies. The amounts PCS claims are owed by the Fund depend on the Plan's definitions of the scope of covered charges and therefore dictates the amount of the Twins' medical charges that the Fund would cover.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the \"claim bears on an ERISA-regulated relationship,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the relationship between plan and plan member[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite PCS's assertions of an independent basis for its claims, the dispute is not \"merely between a health plan and a hospital.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without the Plan, PCS would not have a claim against the Fund, whose selective coverage of the Twins' medical expenses is the sole source of the instant dispute.
