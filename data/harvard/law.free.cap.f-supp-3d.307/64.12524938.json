Defendants also move to dismiss the claims as time-barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (AHR Mem. 16; BRE Mem. 8) For the reasons explained below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts alleged in the Complaint are assumed to be true for the purpose of deciding Defendants' motions. Wilchfort, a resident of Sarasota County, Florida, was a shareholder of three separate real estate investment trusts (entities that own and operate income-producing real estate or \"REITs\"): Apple REITs Six, Seven, and Eight (\"A-6,\" \"A-7,\" and \"A-8\"). (Compl. \u00b6 13; Civil Cover Sheet, annexed to Compl., Docket Entry No. 1-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Beginning in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, A-6, A-7, and A-8 each instituted a Dividend Reinvestment Program (\"DRIP\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-17, 49.) Under DRIP, shareholders were \"offered ...the choice of receiving additional units in lieu of [cash] dividends.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) The initial Forms S-3\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   provide the manner in which the shares are to be priced:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The price of units purchased under the plan directly from us by dividend reinvestments will be based on the fair market value of our units as of the reinvestment date as determined in good faith\n   by our board of directors from time to time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   Our units are not publicly traded; consequently, there is no established public trading market for our units on which we could readily rely in determining fair market value. Nevertheless, the board has determined that, for purposes of this plan, at any given time the most recent price at which an unrelated person has purchased our units represents the fair market value of our units. Consequently, unless and until the board decides to use a different method for determining the fair market value of our units, the per unit price for the plan will be determined at all times based on the most recent price at which an unrelated person has purchased our units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors may determine a different fair market value and price for our units for purposes of this plan if (1) in the good faith judgment of the board an amount of time has elapsed since our units have been purchased by unrelated persons such that the price paid by such persons would not be indicative of the fair market value of our units or (2) our board determines that there are other factors relevant to such fair market value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   The most recent price paid by an unrelated person for a unit was $11.00 on July 25, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, our board of directors has determined that the offering price for units purchased under the plan will initially be $11.00 per unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 50; 2006 A-6 Form S-3,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1277151/000119312506026519/ds3d.htm; 2007 A-7 Form S-3,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1329011/000119312507156224/ds3d.htm; 2008 A-8 Form S-3,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1387361/000119312508087581/ds3d.htm.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, in exchange for foregoing dividends, shareholders received shares at \"fair market value,\" a rate determined by one of two methods: (a) \"the most recent price at which an unrelated person had purchased [the] units\" (b) or another measure determined in the good faith judgment of the boards of directors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 50; AHR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mem. 4.) Thus, unless the boards chose otherwise, shares were to be priced at the rate purchased by the last non-shareholder. (Compl. \u00b6 50.) Throughout the entire alleged \"Class Period,\" ranging from July 17, 2007 through February 12, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13), all three Apple REITs assessed fair market value at eleven dollars per share, \"[t]he most recent price at which an unrelated person ha[d] purchased [the Apple REIT] units\" according to Defendants' various public filings, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Relying in part on a SEC Administrative Order imposing penalties on the Apple REITS for various violations of federal securities law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wilchfort alleges that Defendants were aware that the actual fair market value of their shares was well below eleven dollars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 57, 59, 61, 71, 72.) Wilchfort further alleges that shares of A-7 and A-8 had been purchased by \"unrelated persons ... for much less than [eleven dollars] per share\" in various tender offers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66, 68.) In light of these circumstances, Wilchfort asserts that \"Defendants failed to live up to their agreement to, in good faith, revalue units from time to time and to price units at 'the most recent price at which an unrelated person has purchased [the] units.' \" (Pl. Opp'n to AHR Mot. and BRE Mot. (\"Pl. Opp'n\") 5, Docket Entry No. 32; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 81-83, 105-07.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In light of this language in the Forms S-3, the\n    <em>\n     Moses\n    </em>\n    court determined that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged a breach of contract based on the allegation that the defendant continued to value the units at eleven dollars per share despite sales to unrelated parties at lower prices.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *6. Here, Plaintiff likewise alleges that Defendants failed to reprice A-7 and A-8 shares despite successful cash tender offers to unrelated parties at prices below eleven dollars per share. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 66-69.) However, Plaintiff fails to allege in the Complaint any similar sales to unrelated parties of A-6 shares. Accordingly, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a breach of contract under this theory as to A-7 and A-8 but not A-6.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    AHR Defendants attempt to distinguish Plaintiff's claims from those in\n    <em>\n     Moses\n    </em>\n    by arguing that the Complaint's references to tender offers of A-7 and A-8 shares are only \"offered as support\" for the allegation that eleven dollars per share was not reflective\n    of fair market value. (AHR Mem. 10.) In other words, AHR Defendants assert that Plaintiff does not allege claims for breach of contract for failure to reprice the shares following tender offers of units at prices lower than eleven dollars per unit. Defendants contend that this \"construction\" of the Complaint is \"consistent\" with the asserted class period commencing July 17, 2007, \"rather than on the dates of the tender offers, [which occurred] years later.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The Court disagrees with AHR Defendants' construction of Plaintiff's claims as to this theory of breach. Although the Complaint is not entirely clear, the section on breach of contract does incorporate earlier allegations that encompass the theories of breach as clarified in the opposition submission. For example, the Complaint states that \"[a]s part of the contract, A-6, A-7, and A-8 agreed to value the units at 'fair market value' deemed to be the last arms-length transaction in the units and\n    <em>\n     further\n    </em>\n    agreed to re-evaluate the worth of the units in good faith and adjust same to be equal to fair market value.\" (Compl. \u00b6 2 (emphasis added).) The Complaint also separately notes the failure of A-7 and A-8 to reprice the shares after the tender offers. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 66-69.) Moreover, even the allegation in paragraph eighty-three of the Complaint, on which AHR Defendants rely, can be read to support either theory of liability. The allegation explains that Defendants breached their contracts \"by failing to change the price of units ... when the arbitrary [eleven dollars] per unit price was no longer indicative of the actual fair market value of the units,\n    <em>\n     as required by the contracts\n    </em>\n    .\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 83 (emphasis added).) Even under this theory of breach, eleven dollars per unit could be considered \"arbitrary\" and \"no longer indicative of actual fair market value\" because of a failure to reprice \"as required by the contracts\" following the tender offers. Read as a whole, the Complaint sufficiently states a claim for breach of contract based on a failure to reprice the shares after the tender offers to unrelated persons.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <strong>\n     2.

Under this theory, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants were\n    <em>\n     expressly required\n    </em>\n    to revalue the shares in good faith from \"time to time.\" (Pl. Opp'n 10.)

In addition to a contractual relationship, a viable claim requires a breach of the implied covenant that can be demonstrated in two ways: \"(1) where a party has a clear contract right, even if its exercise would arguably be arbitrary, that party is only forbidden from acting dishonestly, (2) but where a party has discretion in performance, that party cannot act arbitrarily or unfairly.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229386\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/944/460/#p465\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The Court finds unviable two of Plaintiff's theories of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing: (1) that Defendants dishonestly failed to price the units at fair market value and (2) that Defendants failed to establish any re-evaluation procedures. The first theory effectively duplicates the arguments made in support of Plaintiff's breach of contract claim. As discussed\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the Complaint sets forth sufficient allegations of breach of contract claims arising out of a failure to reprice the units upon sales to unrelated\n    persons. Thus, the Court finds it unnecessary and duplicative to determine whether the failure to reprice can be characterized as \"dishonest.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rogers v.

Similarly, the Court has already effectively considered in the breach of contract discussion whether Defendants have an obligation to periodically reevaluate the unit pricing process. To be viable, this theory requires an affirmative obligation to reassess the price or methods of valuation from \"time to time\"-an argument unsupported by the Forms S-3. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    pp. 71-73.)

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 105, 107.) Under the Forms S-3, Defendant had the initial contractual right to price the shares at eleven dollars per unit, based on the last sale to an unrelated person, while retaining sole contractual discretion to reassess the price and methods of valuation. Consistent with this understanding, Defendants are not liable for breach of contract for merely declining to exercise such discretion. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    pp. 71-73.) However, Defendants may be liable for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if their refusal to do so was arbitrary or unfair.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Virginia Vermiculite, Ltd. v.

AHR Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' claims accrued either when (1) the value of the DRIP units were set in 2007 or 2008 or (2) when the DRIP unit value prices were no longer indicative of fair market value-a time period ranging between late 2008 to 2011.
