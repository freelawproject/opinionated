Plaintiffs contend that the State of Ohio unnecessarily institutionalizes people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in violation of federal law. Plaintiffs filed this action on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated individuals with intellectual and developmental\n   disabilities (1) who currently reside in Intermediate Care Facilities (\"ICFs\") with eight or more beds (\"Large ICFs\") throughout Ohio, but who are willing and able to live in the community, and those (2) who are in community-based care, but who are at serious risk of placement in a Large ICF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012132\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396n(c)(2)(B) and (C), and are asking for \"a single injunctive order requiring Defendants to remedy systemic deficiencies that deny class members their rights under federal law.\" (Pls.'

The Ohio Defendants moved for expedited reconsideration of that decision (ECF No. 92), which this Court granted (ECF No. 98).

The\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Court framed the issue as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In the [ADA], Congress described the isolation and segregation of individuals with disabilities as a serious and pervasive form of discrimination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (5).

Congress instructed the Attorney General to issue regulations implementing Title II's discrimination proscription.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12134(a).

Plaintiffs provide a large amount of evidence, which, they contend, shows that \"Ohio's service system for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities leaves thousands of Ohioans who prefer to live in the community unnecessarily institutionalized in Large ICFs, or at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization in these facilities, in violation of federal law.\" (Pls.'

It has employed a funding and rate structure that incentivizes unnecessary institutionalization. It has adopted counseling processes that do not provide a red choice between institutionalzation and home and community-based services. Defendants continue to license, maintain, and fund a system of large, segregated ICFs providing restrictive facility-based residential, employment, and day services. The size of Ohio's ICF system makes it a national outlier. These discrete actions and inactions by the State harm a large group of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and subject them to unnecessary segregation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs conclude that \"hundreds, if not thousands, of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Ohio remain segregated in Large ICFs, even though they qualify for community-based services and have chosen or expressed interest in learning more about such alternatives to institutional care.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.

Doc. 273 at 14, 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 42 at 11. Although Ohio has gradually reduced the size of its state-operated ICFs (\"developmental centers\"), Defendants continue to license, fund, and sustain a substantial network of private ICF beds. For at least twenty years, the number of individuals in private ICFs has remained relatively stagnant: The total number in SFY [State Fiscal Year] 1995 was 5,788; by SFY 2015, the number had actually increased to 5,877.

The research supporting community-based services and supports for people with disabilities as well as evidence from other states that have made this transition successfully clearly demonstrates that people with significant disabilities who require regular, intensive supports greatly benefit from living in community settings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Experience shows that states can effectively shift their focus and funding priorities from institutional to community-based services without causing undue disruption to the residents who transition from institutions. Indeed, the lesson from those experiences is that residents and families are more satisfied with integrated community alternatives-even families that had initially opposed the changes. As a recent report from the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) and the Association of University Centers on Disability (AUCD) noted:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Over the past half-century we have learned that large institutions do not promote positive outcomes for people with [intellectual and developmental disabilities] and limit community interaction and involvement for some of our most vulnerable citizens. These settings have negative outcomes for their health, well-being, quality of life, independence, and overall happiness. As a society we have moved from providing residential supports for people with intellectual and other developmental disabilities in the large, segregated, isolated institutions of the first half of the 20th century ... to smaller group homes, shared apartments, and individually-owned or rented houses or apartments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Community Living and Participation for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities: What the Research Tells Us\n   </em>\n   (July 24, 2015) (hereafter\n   <em>\n    AAIDD/AUCD Report\n   </em>\n   ), at 2, available at http://www.aucd.org/docs/publications/2015_0723_aucd_aaidd_community_living3.pdf.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(Ohio Defs.' Supp. Mem. in Opp. at 6, ECF No. 291.) The Ohio Defendants, however, contend that the statistical evidence does not support Plaintiffs' position that Ohio has failed to provide an ever increasing number of community-based services to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Rather, the Ohio Defendants provide statistics they contend show the increase in community care and decrease in ICF services as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs overstate the current role ICFs play in Ohio's system. Describing ICF numbers as \"relatively stagnant,\" Pls.' Supp. 5, is a half-truth at best. By looking solely at Ohio's raw ICF numbers, Plaintiffs ignore the expansion of Ohio's system since\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   . In 1999, when\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   was decided, Ohio had less than 14,000 people with developmental disabilities receiving Medicaid funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weidner Aff. Exs. A-B, Doc. 273-4. And 59% of those people were living in ICFs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By 2016, the service population had more than tripled, with over 42,000 Ohioans receiving Medicaid funding.\n   <em>\n    See id. But\n   </em>\n   waiver participants made up the strong majority: 85%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And this trend projects forward. Over the past three years, Ohio has averaged 205 new waiver participants to only 32 new ICF participants each month. McGonigle Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, Doc. 273-9. Thus, given the overall growth of Ohio's service population, any \"stagnation\" in\n   <em>\n    raw\n   </em>\n   ICF numbers, is, in reality, a dramatic\n   <em>\n    proportional\n   </em>\n   decrease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (noting that \"even looking only at raw figures, the number of people in Ohio ICFs has gone down since\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   \" because of the interplay between private and public ICFs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Further, the Ohio Defendants explain that \"Ohio has encouraged ICF downsizing,\" asserting that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Ohio has provided rate incentives to ICFs that have committed to either (1) converting ICF beds to waivers or (2) transitioning people from ICFs with 16 or more beds to smaller ICFs. Ohio Resp. 13-14; Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 5124.67(A)(1). These efforts have led to many ICF beds being voluntarily converted or downsized. So far, over 450 ICF beds have been converted to waivers and over 260 beds have shifted to smaller ICFs.

They continue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Many ICFs make extensive efforts to integrate their residents into the community, while also caring for their needs.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Lee Aff., Doc. 273-25; Slight Aff., Doc. 273-26; Gall Aff., Doc. 273-27. For these and other reasons, thousands prefer ICFs for their, or their loved ones', care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Resp. 22, 27-29.

All members of the class had purchased this supplemental cancer-only policy, and presumably desired greater benefits. The\n   <em>\n    Gooch\n   </em>\n   class contained individuals who were aggrieved by the defendant's interpretation of the contractual phrase \"actual damages\" when they submitted a claim and received reduced benefits. The class also contained individuals who had not submitted a claim, so they were not aggrieved by the defendant's interpretation of the phrase \"actual damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Thus, when the\n   <em>\n    Gooch\n   </em>\n   court stated that \"[a]ll of the class members need not be aggrieved by ... [the] defendant's conduct in order for some of them to seek relief under Rule 23(b)(2),\" it did not mean that a group of plaintiffs could target a policy that would not potentially cause uniform harm. The\n   <em>\n    Gooch\n   </em>\n   class members were not then aggrieved by the defendant's interpretation of the contract simply because they had not made a claim under that provision of the policy, not because of some fundamental inability to prove uniform injury (such as not having purchased the cancer-only insurance policy). Yet, if in the future, these non-aggrieved class members made a claim under the policy, they would have received reduced benefits and therefore would have been injured in the same way as the other class members by the defendant's interpretation of the contractual language in the cancer-only policy. Their coverage, in other words, was affected even if no claim had yet been made. Thus, the relief was indivisible in nature as to the entire class, whether each individual class member had made a claim or not, and the court's ruling on the defendant's\n   interpretation of the contract would \"generate common answers\" apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the harm would be effectively redressed by final injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the entire class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The policies or practices targeted by a proposed plaintiff class must at a minimum have the potential to uniformly harm the class so that the entire class has an interest in modifying those policies. In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , individuals who are currently residing in Large ICFs and who have requested community-based services are potentially harmed by the policies targeted by Plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , providing fewer community services slots than are necessary to meet this need.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   However, some of the class members who after counseling indicate that they \"may be\" interested in community-based services will not be harmed by this targeted conduct. Some of the class members who indicated that they \"may be\" interested in community-based services will decide that they prefer to stay in a Large ICF.

Indeed, the opposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The class members who decide that they prefer to stay in a Large ICF may actually be harmed by Plaintiffs' proposed modification of Ohio's funding policies, which would divert funding away from these class members' preferred service option (Large ICFs) to community-based service. Indeed, this concern is not merely hypothetical. The Guardians in this case make this precise contention. Thus, some of the class members will not \"complain of a pattern or practice [failure to sufficiently fund community-based services] that is generally applicable to the class as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gooch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736802\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/672/402/#p428\">\n    672 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   428 ).

The DD Boards provide the example of Rebecca Huelskamp, the mother and guardian of her daughter Patricia who lives at home and is actively engaged in work and community activities. (Aff. of Rebecca Huelskamp \u00b6\u00b6 5-10, ECF No. 293-3.) Patricia has been engaged in competitive employment since 2005, using the sheltered workshop at times when not on her regular job. She has had steady employment at a local private company since 2011 at a rate above minimum wage. When not working, Patricia has a wide range of interests and activities. Patricia has been on the waiver waiting list for at least 15 years and was placed in the Aging Caregiver priority category. Patricia's mother attests in her affidavit that she did not place Patricia on the waiting list because of an immediate need for a waiver from ICF placement; rather she wanted to be on the list if a need arose in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The DD Boards show that the experience of the Huelskamp family is not unique. A significant percentage of persons who are offered waivers from ICF placement decline the offer while remaining on the wait list. With respect to Level One waivers in Cuyahoga County, Amber Gibbs stated in her affidavit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   Since August [2017], the DD Board contacted 77 people on the waiting list who met priority criteria under Ohio Admin.

(\n   <em>\n    Pls.' Final Reply\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, ECF No. 300.) This Court disagrees. The Court does not review the evidence to determine whether the individuals who have placed themselves on a wait list are unnecessarily institutionalized,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether Ohio provides sufficient community-based services to comply with the ADA. Instead, the Court reviews the evidence as part of its \"rigorous analysis\" required under Rule 23 to determine whether the proposed class members have homogenous interests so that the relief sought would benefit them.\n   <em>\n    Senter v.

That is, the class members who may want community-based services do not have homogenous interests with those class members\n   who do want community-based services. Likewise, some class members who are on the wait list want community-based services and some want services provided in Large ICFs. In a situation where there is limited funding, this not only reflects lack of homogenous interests, it indicates\n   <em>\n    competing\n   </em>\n   interests, which could actually harm certain members of a broad Rule 23(b) class because of the lack of notice and opportunity for class members to opt out. Therefore, because the proposed class does not suffer a uniform harm that can be remedied with the same relief, certifying a broad class is inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reeb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936280\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/639/#p645\">\n    435 F.3d at 645-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the plaintiffs must show \"that the party opposing the class has affected the class in a way generally applicable to the class as a whole so that final injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the entire class is appropriate.\") (citing Fed.

Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the following revision of the class definition will ensure that a Rule 23(b)(2) class is properly constituted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   All Medicaid-eligible adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities residing in the state of Ohio who, on or after March 31, 2016, are qualified for home and community-based services, and, after receiving options counseling, express that they are interested in community-based services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   This definition includes all individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities who want to utilize the community-based services, whether they are currently in an ICF or in the community and wish to move to another setting in the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   This modified class definition is similar in scope to the one certified in\n   <em>\n    Lane v.

The Lane court highlighted the homogeneity of interests among the class members:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   [A]ll plaintiffs are qualified for, but not receiving the full benefit of, supported employment services; all lack regular contact with non-disabled peers (other than paid staff); and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all want to work, but are not working, in an integrated setting\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .

Consequently, final injunctive or declaratory relief requiring the state to plan, administer, operate and fund a system that provide employment services that allow the class members to work in the most integrated\n   setting would remedy the uniform potential harm of the entire class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Proof on the Rule 23(a) Prerequisites\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The class definition as modified by the Court also meets all of the criteria in Rule 23(a). The Ohio Defendants contend that Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden under Rule 23(a) to show commonality, typicality, and adequacy. The Court notes, however, that the Ohio Defendants' arguments, obviously, are not directed at the modified class definition the Court has set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \"Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members have suffered the same injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 349-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted). As discussed at length above, the modified class definition contains individuals who have suffered the same injury. The class members wish to receive care in the community and contend that Ohio \"provid[es] fewer slots than are necessary to meet the demonstrated need.\" (Pls.' Reply at 37, ECF No. 283.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In turn, typicality exists where \"by pursuing their own interests, the class representatives also advocate the interests of the class members.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Whirlpool Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063713\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/838/#p850\">\n    722 F.3d at 852-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2013). \"A necessary consequence of the typicality requirement is that the representative's interests will be aligned with those of the represented group, and in pursuing his own claims, the named plaintiff will also advance the interests of the class members.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

Here, Plaintiffs' interest in utilizing community-based services is aligned with the class who also seek an expansion of waiver services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Last, the standard for adequacy of representation overlaps significantly with the commonality and typicality requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prater v.

Class representatives are adequate when it appears that they will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class, which usually will be the case if the representatives are part of the class, possess the same interest, and suffer the same injury as the class members. Here, Plaintiffs have vigorously prosecuted the interests of the class and possess the same interest and same injury of the class members,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , insufficient community-based services resulting in unnecessary institutionalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification.\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    Medicaid-eligible adults are individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities who have been determined eligible for ICF services.

However, the Ohio Defendants admit that they are \"uncertain whether, and to what extent, these people are in or out of this proposed class\" because, while Plaintiffs \"repeatedly suggests they seek to represent such people\" the definition of the class requires an ICF resident to have \" 'receiv[ed] options counseling' and then expressed at least some interest in waivers.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 32.) The Court does not interpret Plaintiffs' request to encompass all residents of Large ICFs.
