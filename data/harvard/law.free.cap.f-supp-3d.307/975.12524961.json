Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Spring Glen is a North Dakota limited liability partnership that owns an apartment building (the \"Building\") in North Dakota. Stip. Facts 1. The Building was covered under a policy (the \"Policy\") issued by Arch, an insurance company incorporated in Missouri with a principal place of business in New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Spring Glen's Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 14, 2016, while the Policy was in effect, seven to ten inches of water flooded the \"lower floor of the Building.\" Stip. Facts 1-2. The flooding occurred when an underground water main (the \"Pipe\") cracked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Pipe, which serviced the Building, was located roughly seven feet below the Building and was over forty years old.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The crack in the Pipe was caused entirely by wear and tear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The water not only caused damage to the \"lower floor\" but also caused cracking in the walls and ceilings of upper floors that housed apartments (together, the \"Property Damage\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Property Damage rendered the Building untenantable until repaired, causing Spring Glen to sustain a loss of business income (the \"Business Losses\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Spring Glen filed an insurance claim with Arch for the Property Damage and Business Losses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Arch denied Spring Glen's claim in letters dated May 17, 2016, June 3, 2016, and June 8, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Policy contains three forms relevant to this action: Policy Declarations (the \"Declarations\"), a Building and Personal Property Coverage Form (the \"Property Coverage Form\"), and a Causes of Loss-Special Form (the \"Causes of Loss Form\"). Ins. Policy (\"Ins. Policy\") 16, 18, 34, 43, ECF No. 8-1. The Declarations indicate that the Policy covers both the Building itself and business income from the Building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17. In the \"Covered Causes of Loss\" section of the Declarations, the Policy states \"Special.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Property Coverage Form states that the Policy covers \"direct physical loss of or damage to Covered Property at the premises described in the Declarations caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. The Policy defines \"Covered Property\" as including \"the building or structure described in the Declarations,\" which, as described above, is the Building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Policy defines \"Covered Cause of Loss\" as \"direct physical loss unless the loss is excluded or limited in [the] policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Causes of Loss Form, which pertains to \"Special\" causes of loss, contains various lists of causes that are excluded from coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Section B(1) of the Causes of Loss Form sets forth one such list, stating: \"We will not pay for loss or\n   damage caused directly or indirectly by any of the following. Such loss or damage is\n   <em>\n    excluded regardless of any other cause\n   </em>\n   or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). One of the excluded causes listed is water (the \"Water Exclusion\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44. The Water Exclusion excludes coverage, in pertinent part, for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (3) Water that backs up or overflows or is otherwise discharged from a sewer, drain, sump, sump pump or related equipment; (4) Water under the ground surface pressing on, or flowing or seeping through: (a) Foundations, walls, floors or paved surfaces; (b) Basements, whether paved or not; or (c) Doors, windows or other openings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Water Exclusion \"applies regardless of whether any\" of the listed causes \"is caused by an act of nature or otherwise caused.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Water Exclusion also includes an \"ensuing loss provision,\" which states that \"if any of the above [causes] results in fire, explosion or sprinkler leakage, we will pay for the loss or damage caused by that fire, explosion or sprinkler leakage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section B(2) of the Causes of Loss Form lists additional exclusions, including \"loss or damage caused by or resulting from... [w]ear and tear\" (the \"Wear and Tear Exclusion\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45. Later, it states, \"[b]ut if an excluded cause of loss [listed in this subsection] results in a '\n   <em>\n    specified cause of loss\n   </em>\n   ' ... we will pay for the loss or damage caused by that 'specified cause of loss.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the Definitions section of the Causes of Loss Form, \"specified causes of loss\" is defined, in part, as \"water damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52. \"Water damage\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) Accidental discharge or leakage of water ... as the direct result of the breaking apart or\n   <em>\n    cracking\n   </em>\n   of a plumbing, heating, air conditioning or other system or appliance (other than a sump system including its related equipment and parts), that is located on the described premises ... and (2) Accidental discharge or leakage of water ... as the direct result of the breaking apart or\n   <em>\n    cracking of a water or sewer pipe\n   </em>\n   that is located\n   <em>\n    off the described premises\n   </em>\n   and is part of a municipal potable water supply system ...\n   <em>\n    if the breakage or cracking is caused by wear and tear.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11780625\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/587/191/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Definitions section then explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   But water damage does not include loss or damage otherwise excluded under the terms of the Water Exclusion.... To the extent that accidental discharge or leakage of water falls within the criteria set forth [above].. such water is\n   <em>\n    not subject to the provisions of the Water Exclusion which preclude coverage for surface water or water under the surface of the ground\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11780625\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/587/191/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties ask this Court to decide whether the damages were caused by or resulted from a Covered Cause of Loss. Pl.'s Mem. 1; Def.'s Mem. 2. The parties disagree as to: (1) whether the cracked Pipe, which caused water to enter the Building, is a Covered Cause of Loss under the Policy, and (2) whether the question of Arch's acting in bad faith is proper for summary judgment. Pl.'s Mem. 1; Def.'s Mem. 2, 18. The Court concludes that the cracked Pipe is a Covered Cause of Loss under the Policy and that whether Arch acted in bad faith is a question of fact. Therefore, the Court denies Arch's motion for summary judgment on Counts One and Two, and grants Spring Glen's motion for summary judgment on Count One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Spring Glen argues that this fact compels the conclusion that the Wear and Tear Exclusion is applicable and, as a result, that the Wear and Tear\n   Exclusion's exception for specified causes of loss applies to impose liability on Arch.

Water damage is then defined, in part, as \"[a]ccidental discharge or leakage of water... as the direct result of the... cracking of a water or sewer pipe that is located off the described premises... if the breakage or cracking is caused by wear and tear.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The leaking water leading to the damage in this case was due to the circumstances explicitly provided for in the water damage definition. Therefore, the water is \"not subject to the provisions of the Water Exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court thus concludes that the Policy unambiguously provides coverage for damage caused in a situation such as this one and imposes liability on Arch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Arch provides three main counterarguments to this position. First, Arch argues that the Water Exclusion only provides coverage when there is an \"ensuing loss\" (specifically, a fire, explosion, or sprinkler leakage). Def.'s Mem. 7-9. Since the Water Exclusion does not provide a similar exception for \"specified causes of loss,\" Arch asserts, the definition of \"specified causes of loss,\" which in turn contains the definition of \"water damage,\" cannot impose liability. Def.'s Mem. 8-9; Ins. Policy 44. This assertion is, in part, true. Whereas other exclusions, such as the \" 'Fungus', Wet Rot, Dry Rot And Bacteria\" Exclusion, state that such damage is excluded unless it results in a \"specified cause of loss,\" Ins. Policy 44-45, the Water Exclusion does not provide an exception for \"specified causes of loss.\" Ins. Policy 44. Arch's continued focus on the Water Exclusion, however, ignores that the Wear and Tear Exclusion's ensuing loss provision\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   provide coverage for specified causes of loss. Ins. Policy 45, 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, Arch argues that the Wear and Tear Exclusion does not apply because it did not deny coverage under that exclusion; it denied coverage under the Water Exclusion, and according to Arch, the anti-concurrent cause language prevents Spring Glen from recovering under any other exclusion. Def.'s Mem. 10. Arch argues that \"the Pipe is not Covered Property\" and thus \"the Policy's coverage grants and exclusions do not apply to the Pipe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Spring Glen may not be able to claim coverage for the repair of the actual Pipe, but it does not appear that the Policy requires that the Pipe be Covered Property in order for the Wear and Tear Exclusion to apply. Even if it did, however, Arch fails to explain why the Policy would specifically provide coverage for water damage caused by \"the breaking apart or cracking of a water or sewer pipe that is located off the described premises ... if the breakage or cracking is caused by wear and tear.\" Ins. Policy 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Spring Glen uses an analogy to explain its position: \"[T]he fact that semi-trucks are generally not Covered Property ... does not mean that the Policy does not pay for the direct physical loss to the Building when a semi-truck crashes into it.\" Pl.'s Mem. 11. Arch responds that, in that case, the Building is the Covered Property and the semi-truck is a Covered Cause of Loss, whereas here, the Building is Covered Property but underground water is not a Covered Cause of Loss. Def.'s Mem. 11. This argument, while seemingly accurate, misses the point of Spring Glen's hypothetical. Spring Glen uses this hypothetical to argue that if tangible property (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a\n   semi-truck or a municipal pipe, as opposed to fire or wind)\n   <em>\n    leads to\n   </em>\n   a Covered Cause of Loss (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a building's collapse due to the semi-truck's crash or water damage due to a cracked municipal pipe), that tangible property need not be Covered Property under the Policy in order for the Policy to provide coverage for the damage it may cause. Pl.'s Mem. 11. Spring Glen is right; the Policy does not impose such a requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Arch relies on two out-of-circuit cases,\n   <em>\n    General Acc. Ins.

The parties in\n   <em>\n    General Accident Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , however, did not cite any policy provisions which provided specific coverage for damage caused by corroded, off-premises, municipal water pipes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9438584\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/288/651/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the Policy specifically provides for damages from the \"[a]ccidental discharge ... of water ... as the direct result of the breaking apart or cracking of a\" plumbing, water, or sewer pipe that is located on\n   <em>\n    or off\n   </em>\n   the premises \"\n   <em>\n    if the breakage or cracking is caused by wear and tear.\n   </em>\n   \" Ins.

The insured then filed a claim in court for additional damages, which was denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20687564\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Praetorian\n   </em>\n   denied the claim for two reasons: (1) the water exclusion applied and thus excluded further coverage of damages, and (2) the anti-concurrent causation clause applied, thus making any other cause (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a specified cause of loss exemption for the corrosion of an underground pipe) irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. Though similar to this case, the parties in\n   <em>\n    Praetorian\n   </em>\n   did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   stipulate to the fact that the damage was due to a cause specifically accounted for in the policy, as the parties did here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In this case, the Policy does not clearly preclude coverage when the Cause of Loss is not itself Covered Property. Rather, it explicitly carves out an exception for damage caused by an underground pipe which cracks due to wear and tear and is not located on the premises. Ins. Policy 52. Even if this creates an ambiguity, a reasonable person in Spring Glen's position could easily believe the Wear and Tear Exclusion's exception for underground\n   pipes that crack due to wear and tear provides coverage in this case. Because that reasonable interpretation of the ambiguity would impose liability on Arch, the Court would resolve this ambiguity in favor of Spring Glen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dundee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11780625\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/587/191/#p194\">\n    587 N.W.2d at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Third, Arch argues that even if the Wear and Tear Exclusion's specified causes of loss exception applies, the definition of \"Water Damage\" states that it \"does not include loss or damage otherwise excluded under the terms of the Water Exclusion,\" and therefore coverage is still precluded. Ins. Policy 52 (emphasis added); Def.'s Mem. 9-10. The examples that follow, however, indicate that this exception refers to pipes that break or crack due to causes\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    in addition to\n   </em>\n   , wear and tear (citing \"weather-induced flooding\" as an example). Ins. Policy 52. Arch also does not address the later sentence in that definition, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   To the extent that accidental discharge or leakage of water falls within the criteria ... of this definition of 'specified causes of loss,'\n   <em>\n    such water is not subject to the provisions of the Water Exclusion\n   </em>\n   which preclude coverage for surface water or water under the surface of the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11780625\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/587/191/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). If this specific type of water damage is\n   <em>\n    not subject\n   </em>\n   to the Water Exclusion, then it cannot also be\n   <em>\n    excluded\n   </em>\n   by the Water Exclusion. Were the Court to follow Arch's interpretation of the Policy, and let the first sentence override the second, it would render the second sentence meaningless. The Wear and Tear Exclusion's specified causes of loss exception, which includes water damage, explicitly accounts for situations like this one.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11780625\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/587/191/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The anti-concurrent cause language in the Water Exclusion cannot in turn preclude coverage when the applicable specified causes of loss exception states that the \"water is not subject to the provisions of the Water Exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11780625\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/587/191/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Here, the plain language of the insurance contract provides coverage for this specific scenario.
