Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs in this proposed putative class action allege that Defendant FCA's 2007-2012 Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 diesel trucks (the \"Trucks\" or \"Affected Vehicles\"), equipped with 6.7-liter Turbo Diesel engines manufactured by Defendant Cummins Inc., emit nitrogen oxides (\"NOx\") at levels in excess of federal and state emissions standards. The Complaint alleges violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO Act\"), the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act (\"MMWA\"), as well as claims asserted under the respective laws of 49 states and the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants marketed the Trucks as containing \"clean diesel engines,\" while they discharged emissions at levels greater than what a reasonable customer would expect based on the alleged representations. Defendants have moved for dismissal of Plaintiffs' Complaint, which Plaintiffs oppose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to bring claims on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of all persons or entities in the United States who, as of November 1, 2016, owned or leased the following Trucks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. 2007-2010 Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 with Cummins diesel (2WD, 4WD)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. 2011-2012 Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 with Cummins diesel (non-SCR systems, 2WD, 4WD).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs also seek to establish sub-classes representing owners and/or lessees of the Trucks in every state and the District of Columbia, alleging deceptive advertising, breach of contract, and fraudulent concealment claims under the laws of those respective states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pending before the Court are Defendants' motions to dismiss plaintiffs' Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint (\"Amended Complaint\" or \"Complaint\") pursuant, in part, to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). For the reasons outlined below, Defendants' motions are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") promulgates emissions standards and regulations for manufacturers of diesel engines. Plaintiffs' Complaint maintains that diesel engines, unlike their gasoline counterparts, generate power by compressing a mist of liquid fuel and air to very high temperatures and pressures, causing the mixture to spontaneously combust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22, Pg. ID 1540. One by-product of this diesel combustion process is the creation of oxides of nitrogen (\"NOx\"), which include a variety of nitrogen and oxygen chemical compounds that only form at high temperatures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   NOx emissions have been the target of EPA regulation, for the pollutant and harmful nature of nitrogen oxides is well documented.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January 2001, the EPA issued the \"2010 NOx standard,\" requiring NOx emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines be reduced by 95 percent-to .20 grams of NOx per horsepower-hour-by no later than 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   66 Fed.Reg. 5,002 (Jan. 18, 2001). The EPA exercised authority pursuant to Section 202 of the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\") in enacting this new standard. As one court explained, \"[b]y delaying the effective date until 2010, [the] EPA gave [the] industry nine years to innovate the necessary new technologies.\"\n   <em>\n    Mack Trucks, Inc. v. E.P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771777,3890789\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/87/\">\n    682 F.3d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 (D.C. Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The named Plaintiffs in this case are 15 alleged purchasers or lessees of model year 2007-2012 Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 heavy-duty trucks equipped with Defendant Cummins' 6.7-liter turbo diesel engines. Defendant Fiat Chrysler Automobiles LLC (\"FCA\") is a motor vehicle manufacturer and a licensed distributor of new, previously untitled Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram brand motor vehicles. Dkt. 22, Pg. ID 1537. Plaintiffs allege that FCA sells and leases the vehicles it manufactures, including the Trucks at issue in this case, through FCA franchise dealerships. Dkt. 22, Pg. ID 1538. Defendant Cummins Inc. is a Fortune 500 company that designs, manufactures, and distributes engines, filtration, and power generation products. Dkt. 22, Pg. IDs 1538-39. Cummins Inc. manufactured the diesel engines for the Trucks at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Complaint alleges that each Plaintiff is similarly situated. Each purchased or leased a 2007-2012 model year Dodge Ram 2500 or 3500. These trucks were allegedly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [E]quipped with an emissions system that turned off or limited its emissions reduction system during normal driving conditions and emitted pollutants such as NOx at many multiples of emissions emitted from gasoline-powered vehicles, at many times the level a reasonable consumer would expect from a \"clean\n   Diesel,\" and at many multiples of that allowed by federal law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 22, Pg. ID 1510 at \u00b6 27. Throughout their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants installed \"defeat devices\" in the Trucks, which resulted in significantly increased emissions when tested during normal driving as compared to when tested in laboratory settings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to the Complaint, Plaintiffs tested one 2012 Dodge Ram 2500, the results of which allegedly show that the vehicle emitted emissions at amounts greater than those permitted by federal and state regulations, higher than its \"gasoline engine counterpart,\" higher than what a reasonable consumer would expect, and higher than levels set for vehicles to obtain certificates of compliance. Dkt. 22, Pg. ID 1505. In addition to the emissions test, Plaintiffs support their allegations by pointing to the existence of a purported \"worldwide emissions scandal,\" unrelated regulatory enforcement actions directed at other vehicles manufactured by FCA, and prior regulatory enforcement taken against Cummins for problems with other engines. Plaintiffs contend that these facts give rise to a plausible inference that FCA and Cummins engaged in the alleged \"Emissions Fraud Enterprise,\" where they created, marketed, and sold to consumers Trucks with defective emissions systems or with defeat devices installed in them. According to Plaintiffs, this defeat device allow the vehicles to perform in such a way to \"pass\" emissions testing when tested, but allow the Trucks to operate differently (emitting emissions as a much higher level) during actual on-road performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The consolidated amended Complaint includes two claims brought on behalf of a proposed nationwide class of claimants. The first alleges that the Defendants violated the RICO Act. Dkt 22, Pg. IDs 1586-1601. The second alleges that the Defendants violated the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act. Dkt. 22, Pg. IDs 1601-04. The Complaint contains additional state law claims arising under the fraudulent concealment and consumer protection laws of 49 states and the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants have separately moved for dismissal pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a), 9(b), 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).

Over significant distances, emissions were found to be as high as 1,100 to 2,800 mg/mile for periods lasting as long as 21% of the total drive time. That is 5.5 to 14 times the relevant standard. During on-road PEMS testing designed to simulate the driving profile of the Highway certification cycle, average emissions were found to be 756 mg/mile, or 1.9 times the California (and Section 177 state) standard. Over significant distances, emissions were found to be as high as 1,200 to 2,250 mg/mile for periods lasting as long as 16% of the total drive time.

While the allegations in Plaintiffs' Complaint may be accepted for the factual proposition that the\n   <em>\n    tested\n   </em>\n   vehicle-during the testing in question-produced emissions at levels shown by the test results, plaintiffs offer no well-pleaded factual content for the court to accept as true that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   1. the truck in question had a defective emissions control system or contains a defeat device, which allows the truck to produce low emissions and perform a certain way when tested in a laboratory setting, but differently under normal driving conditions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   2. the \"Affected Vehicles\" are subject to the same performance characteristics as those observed in the tested vehicle; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   3. the \"Affected Vehicles\" contain a defeat device or defective emissions control system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Thus, Plaintiffs' allegations of the presence of a defect or a defeat device in the identified vehicles, based on results of their PEMS testing on a single Truck, are conclusory; they are not founded on specific allegations of fact.

But in\n   <em>\n    Counts,\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs explained that the GM vehicles about which corroborative European test results were alleged, \"share[d] common designs, including engines,\" which made it plausible that those test results also applied to the plaintiffs' vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Counts,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268110\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/572/\">\n    237 F.Supp.3d at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, those vehicles had engines manufactured, imported and sold by VM Italy and VM North America.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   From the standpoint of plausibility, Plaintiffs' reliance on allegations of past enforcement actions directed at Defendant Cummins is equally unavailing. While Plaintiffs allege Cummins has previously been fined for regulatory noncompliance issues, Plaintiffs do not allege that those past regulatory issues concerned engines, exhaust control systems, or other relevant shared technology with the Cummins engine at issue in this action. If anything, Plaintiffs' Complaint contains facts showing the uniqueness of the 6.2L Cummins diesel engine used in the Affected Vehicles. Moreover, the fine against Cummins in 2010 was for shipping \"more than 570,000 heavy duty diesel engines to vehicle equipment manufacturers nationwide\n   <em>\n    without pollution control equipment\n   </em>\n   \" from between 1998 and 2006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22, Exhibit 12. The allegations in the Complaint are quite different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Consequently, for the reasons described above, the Court finds that the well-pleaded facts in Plaintiffs' Amended Consolidated Complaint fail to raise a plausible inference of wrongdoing-namely, that the alleged \"Affected Vehicles\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   1. perform in a manner consistent with the Plaintiffs' PEMS results; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   2. were manufactured by Defendants with a defective emissions system or with a defeat device installed in them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court makes the above findings with a full appreciation of Rule 8(a)(2), which provides that a pleading that states a claim for relief must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. The Court must follow the Supreme Court's guidance in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   to levy its \"judicial experience and common sense\" in construing Rule 8's requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p556\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p556\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
