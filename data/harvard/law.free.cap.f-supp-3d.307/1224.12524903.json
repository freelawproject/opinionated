This Court, having considered the pleadings, motions, briefs, evidence, and relevant law, concludes that (i) Defendants' motion for summary judgment should be granted in part and denied in part as described herein, but the Court will reserve ruling for a hearing on the issue of the liability of Defendants Dental Dreams, LLC a.k.a. Dental Experts, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company, and KOS Services, LLC; (ii) Defendants' motion to exclude certain opinions of Plaintiff's expert Dr. Ryan Craig Moffat will be granted; and (iii) Defendants' motion to partially dismiss the amended complaint and to strike will be granted in part and denied in part as described herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Ms. Pinto acknowledged she was aware of the billing fraud and said there were forms to fill out if he found more of these situations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.

Consistent with Ms. Pinto's direction, Plaintiff reported to Mr. Sandoval that same day the fraudulent charges he discovered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. In response, Mr. Sandoval replied \"the company\" wanted Plaintiff to do the missing work, fill out a form, and allow his production to be credited with the work, although it would not at that time be billed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Plaintiff stated that the company's response was inadequate by law and that it needed to report it and do an audit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Mr. Sandoval said that he knew that was what the company was required to do, but it was not what the company would do because they would lose too much money.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The forms Mr. Sandoval provided Plaintiff to complete on the falsely certified work were pre-addressed to Sameera Hussain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.

In rejecting this argument, the Supreme Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Although we did indeed find the punitive character of the treble damages provision a reason not to read \"person\" to include a State, it does not follow that the punitive feature has the force to show congressional intent to repeal implicitly the existing definition of that word, which included municipalities. To begin with it is important to realize that treble damages have a compensatory side, serving remedial purposes in addition to punitive objectives. While the tipping point between payback and punishment defies general formulation, being dependent on the workings of a particular statute and the course of particular litigation, the facts about the FCA show that the damages multiplier has compensatory traits along with the punitive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   ...The most obvious indication that the treble damages ceiling has a remedial place under this statute is its\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   feature with its possibility of diverting as much as 30 percent of the Government's recovery to a private relator who began the action. In\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   cases the rough difference between double and triple damages may well serve not to punish, but to quicken the self-interest of some private plaintiff who can spot violations and start litigating to compensate the Government, while benefiting himself as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030459\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030459\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/119/\">\n    at 130-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030459\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/119/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In light of the Supreme Court's discussion of the compensatory traits of the FCA's damages provision, this Court is not convinced that the\n   <em>\n    Southern Maryland\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning remains sound. Moreover, the district court in\n   <em>\n    Southern Maryland\n   </em>\n   acknowledged the considerable authority that then-existed in the FCA context imposing vicarious liability on employers, even if the employee's actions did not benefit the employer, when the employee is acting within the scope of employment or with apparent authority.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11518940\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/95/465/#p466\">\n    95 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   467-68 (citing cases).

Mr. Sandoval and Ms. Patrone were part of the conversation in which Mr. Hussain fired Plaintiff. Plaintiff reported the fraudulent activity within days of being fired-a very close connection in time. Again, this is a close evidentiary issue, but viewing all the evidence and the inferences to be derived therefrom in favor of Plaintiff, a jury may infer that Mr. Hussain was aware of Plaintiff's reports of Medicaid fraud or that Mr. Sandoval or Ms. Patrone affected the firing because of Plaintiff's repeated reports of Medicaid fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants argue that the evidence conclusively establishes that Plaintiff was fired for insisting on bringing his dog to work and for unprofessional behavior, not for attempting to further an FCA action. Although Defendants have met their burden of production in showing a reason for firing Plaintiff apart from retaliation, as discussed in more detail below, questions of fact exist for a jury's determination as to whether Defendants' reason for firing Plaintiff over Boscoe was legitimate or if it was pretextual.

Although Boscoe did not have documentation to show completed training, that alone does not preclude a jury from finding Boscoe to be a service animal so long as, at the time of the events at issue, he was trained to perform tasks and work for the benefit of Plaintiff in alleviating his General Anxiety Disorder or PTSD. Plaintiff has provided evidence in the form of his own testimony of how Boscoe, at the time of his employment, was capable of detecting Plaintiff's panic attack, cuing Plaintiff if he could see Boscoe, and minimizing or alleviating the panic attacks for Plaintiff, if Plaintiff was in his presence. Plaintiff averred in his Verified Complaint that Boscoe had \"trained responses\" to Plaintiff's anxiety and his presence alleviated his symptoms. Verified Am. Compl. \u00b6 349, ECF No. 52.

According to Plaintiff, Mr. Hussain refused to consider any documentation Plaintiff had concerning his need for Boscoe and Boscoe's training.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Mr. Hussain instructed Plaintiff that he must leave the dog at home, and if he brought him to work the next day, he would be fired. Viewing the evidence in Plaintiff's favor, a jury could find that Mr. Hussain already closed off the possibility of allowing any service dog, however well-trained, in the office, refused to discuss how a service dog could assist Plaintiff, refused to consider any paperwork Plaintiff claimed to have regarding Boscoe's training, and did not consider or propose alternative accommodations. Consequently, the Court will leave to the jury to determine whether Plaintiff's employer engaged in the interactive process in good faith and whether the breakdown in the interactive process was caused by Mr. Hussain's obstruction and refusal to communicate and propose further accommodations, or was caused by Plaintiff's refusal to communicate and discuss other reasonable accommodations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11670027\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/1154/#p1172\">\n    180 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a party that fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may be acting in bad faith); 29 C.F.R.

Defendants contest the third prong, arguing that Plaintiff has not shown that his employer fired him because of his PTSD and General Anxiety Disorder. Plaintiff argues, however, that the inference of unlawful disability discrimination may be made because Mr. Hussain forbade him from bringing his service dog to work, and Plaintiff insisted upon it. For the reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the timing of his firing very shortly on the heels of the disclosure of his disability is evidence from which a jury could infer the reason for his firing was really because of his disability.

The Court does not believe that Plaintiff's Title VII sex discrimination claim is necessarily at odds with the Charge of Discrimination. Defendants refer to Plaintiff's statement that \"Respondent's reason for Adverse Action\" was Plaintiff's \"refusal to stop bringing a Service Dog to work.\" That statement could be construed as Plaintiff relating what Mr. Hussain gave verbally as the reason for firing Plaintiff. Plaintiff gave other specific facts in the Charge of Discrimination indicating the reasons he believed the actual basis for his termination was multi-fold-because of his disability, sexual orientation, and in retaliation for asserting rights under the ADA, Title VII, and NMHRA. The Court will therefore turn to the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   A plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of wrongful termination by a preponderance of the evidence by showing\n   that (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the job; (3) despite his qualifications, he was fired; and (4) the job was not eliminated after his termination.\n   <em>\n    DePaula\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276545\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/957/#p968\">\n    859 F.3d at 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his response, Plaintiff argues that he has presented sufficient evidence to show he was a member of a protected class based on his sexual orientation (homosexual male), he was qualified for the job, and was terminated. Plaintiff argues that the issue in dispute in Counts 17 and 18 is whether he was fired under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. Defendants assert that, even if Plaintiff could demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination based on sexual orientation, they had legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating him because of his refusal to discuss alternate arrangements for his dog and his rude and unprofessional behavior to staff and patients. Defendants have met their exceedingly light burden of production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiff, however, has provided evidence indicating that these reasons were false. Family Smiles had a policy permitting service dogs in the office, and Plaintiff has submitted evidence, construed in his favor, which indicates that Mr. Hussain refused to consider Plaintiff's documentation indicating that Boscoe was a service dog and did not attempt to engage in a discussion of reasonable accommodation for his dog; instead, he fired him for his desire to bring Boscoe into work the next day, despite a policy permitting it. A plaintiff may \"show pretext by demonstrating 'the defendant acted contrary to a written company policy,' an unwritten company policy, or a company practice 'when making the adverse employment decision affecting the plaintiff.' \"\n   <em>\n    DePaula\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276545\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/957/#p968\">\n    859 F.3d at 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kendrick v.

As for the patient and staff complaints, Plaintiff argues that the record evidence of patient and staff complaints was made after he was fired, supporting an inference that Defendants retroactively created a purportedly legitimate reason to fire him after in fact firing him for discriminatory reasons. Viewing the record as a whole, the Court finds that Plaintiff has submitted evidence from which a jury could determine that his employer did not honestly believe the reasons given for Plaintiff's termination and did not act in good faith upon those beliefs, precluding summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The Court notes that Plaintiff's evidence for discrimination based on sex is thin, but the Court may not weigh the evidence. At this stage, because Plaintiff has produced evidenced that he was fired very closely in time after disclosing his sexual identity and complaining about Mr. Sandoval's unwanted advances, and he has produced evidence of pretext, the Court will send the factual questions to a jury and deny summary judgment to Family Smiles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Plaintiff limited Counts 17-18 to Family Smiles, Khurram Hussain, and KOS Services.

Again, to satisfy the third element, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the person who took the adverse action against her knew of the employee's protected activity, or that the person allegedly harboring the discriminatory animus knew and used the person who effected the adverse action as the \"cat's paw\" to affect his own discriminatory designs.\n   <em>\n    Montes\n   </em>\n   , 497 F.3d at 1176.

Mot. for Summ. J. 39-40, ECF No. 112.

These arguments mirror those made and developed more fully in Defendants' motion to partially dismiss the amended complaint (ECF No. 57), which Defendants reference in their motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Plaintiff states in his summary judgment response that he continues to assert liability against Family Smiles, Khurram Hussain, Dental Dreams a.k.a.

Plaintiff, however, failed to address in his response to the summary judgment motion the arguments Defendants made that the record is devoid of evidence to support veil-piercing. Plaintiff did not cite to specific evidence in the summary judgment record to support his theories of liability for entities other than Family Smiles. Nor did Plaintiff expressly incorporate arguments he made in his response to Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Plaintiff nevertheless sets forth in his response to Defendants' motion to dismiss the theories of liability upon which he relies. As discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that the claims against Dental Dreams, LLC a.k.a. Dental Experts, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company, and KOS Services, LLC, will survive Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, but the claims against Defendant Khurram Hussain will be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6). The Court thus needs to determine whether claims against Dental Dreams, LLC a.k.a. Dental Experts, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company, and KOS Services, LLC, survive summary judgment or whether Plaintiff waived them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In the response to the motion to dismiss, Plaintiff relies on numerous paragraphs of his Verified Amended Complaint that were sworn to by Dr. Hernandez-Gil,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Verification, ECF No. 52 at 124 of 125. Consequently, the record contains arguments on the issue of veil-piercing using potentially admissible evidence on summary judgment (that to which Plaintiff has personal knowledge). Nevertheless, since the filing of the briefing on the motion to dismiss, discovery has proceeded, and Defendants re-briefed the issues on summary judgment. Issues of fairness to Defendants are at play as to whether the Court should consider arguments and evidence in separate briefing that were not incorporated into the summary judgment briefing. Generally, when Defendants raise an argument of lack of evidence on summary judgment, it is Plaintiff's burden on summary judgment to set forth the admissible evidence it wishes the Court to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Court would like to hear arguments from the parties regarding whether Plaintiff has waived his claims of liability so that summary judgment should be granted to Dental Dreams a.k.a. Dental Experts, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company, and KOS Services, LLC, on the remaining claims against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (providing options for court when\n   party fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact, including opportunity to support or address fact). The Court will consider arguments on this limited issue of waiver at the Call of the Calendar hearing already currently scheduled for Thursday, April 5, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. Given that this Memorandum Opinion and Order resolves most of the issues of the pending motions, the Court will grant the Joint Motion for Hearing and for Oral Argument on pending Motions (ECF No. 136) only in part to permit argument at the Call of the Calendar on the outstanding issues remaining for trial and not resolved by the entry of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Motion to Partially Dismiss Amended Complaint and to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In Defendants' Motion to Partially Dismiss Amended Complaint and to Strike (ECF No. 57), they seek to strike certain allegations in the Amended Complaint inconsistent with the Court's prior Memorandum Opinion and Order and to dismiss defendants other than Family Smiles, LLC (\"Family Smiles\"), the entity that employed Plaintiff directly. Many of the issues highlighted in the motion to dismiss, however, are now moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   First, Defendants moved to dismiss FCA, MFCA, and FATA claims to the extent they state claims involving patients treated by dentists other than Drs. Shafer and Agarwal. Plaintiff's claims have been limited to patients of Dr. Shafer, so this argument is now moot. Defendants also seek to dismiss the qui tam claims under the FCA, MFCA, and FATA against non-Family Smiles Defendants. Plaintiff agreed to the dismissal of those claims \"against any of the Defendants other than Family Smiles\" in footnote 7 of his response, so that argument is now moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. 23 n.7, ECF No. 123. Defendants moved to dismiss claims against non-Family Smiles entities in Counts 22-23 and Count 25. Plaintiff dismissed Counts 22-23 and agreed to limit Count 25 to Family Smiles, so these arguments are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Defendants additionally moved to strike allegations of the amended complaint concerning extra-contractual promises. Plaintiff is no longer proceeding on claims related to those provisions, so the Court will strike the provisions upon which Plaintiff is no longer relying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Finally, Defendants seek to dismiss the retaliation and discrimination claims against all Defendants other than Family Smiles. Plaintiff in his response \"acknowledges that only the employer itself may be directly liable for the retaliation and discrimination claims under the FCA, MFCA, FATA, ADA and Title VII.\" Pl.'s Resp. 10, ECF No. 64.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, direct liability does not extend to non-employer individuals under those statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howell v.

Feb. 21, 2017). Plaintiff, however, argues his retaliation and discrimination claims against the individual and other corporate Defendants should proceed under alter ego and/or integrated enterprise theories. Since the filing of the motion to dismiss, Plaintiff has limited the retaliation and discrimination claims to Family Smiles, Khurram Hussain, Dental Dreams a.k.a. Dental Experts, LLC, and KOS Services, LLC, so the Court need only address\n   these veil-piercing theories as to Khurram Hussain, Dental Dreams a.k.a.

Dental Experts, LLC, or KOS Services, LLC, abused the corporate form to perpetrate a fraud, promote injustice, to evade legal obligations, or for another improper purpose that would justify disregarding the \"corporate\" form. There are not sufficient non-conclusory facts to suggest inadequate capitalization of Family Smiles. Moreover, the allegations that Mr. Hussain had an ownership interest in Family Smiles and KOS Services, which was a separate entity that provided administrative services for Family Smiles, or that Dental Experts exercised considerable control over Family Smiles' operations are not sufficient to indicate that the corporate structure was set up for fraudulent purposes. The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiff has not met his burden of alleging sufficient non-conclusory facts to plausibly show that Khurram Hussain, Dental Dreams a.k.a.

Dr. Moffat's review of Dr. Shafer's patient records revealed to him a consistent pattern of incorrect billings, which he believed to be inconsistent with what is traditionally accepted in dentistry, and therefore, he concluded the pattern shows an intent taking place to bill incorrectly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Dr. Moffat 41:16-25, ECF No. 111-2. Dr. Moffat testified, \"I think that if you look at the evidence you'll see many more instances than could be considered simple mistakes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   46:15-17. Although he acknowledged that there is no standard in dentistry quantifying how many mistakes may be made before considering a pattern of mistakes in billing to be fraudulent, Dr. Moffat opined that the number of errors represents a pattern that is false or fraudulent based on his judgment that the number of errors was too high.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   46:25-49:15; 167:25-169:2. Dr. Moffat never spoke with Dr. Shafer, any person who worked with Dr. Shafer, or any patient treated by him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   40:16-18, 42:10-12, 43:3-5, ECF No. 111-2. He also acknowledged that simply because standards of care were violated does not mean that the care is false.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   45:13-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Defendants contend that expert testimony on a person's state of mind is not admissible because it invades the role of the jury, renders conclusions on issues of law, and has no basis in any body of expertise. The Court agrees to a limited extent. Dr. Moffat may not testify that Dr. Shafer had fraudulent intent, because that issue is more properly a question for the jury and outside an expert's expertise. See\n   <em>\n    DePaepe v. General Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191691\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/715/#p720\">\n    141 F.3d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 720 (7th Cir. 1998) (concluding that district court erred in allowing expert to testify that company reduced amount of padding in sun visors to save money because he lacked a scientific basis for that opinion). Indeed, Plaintiff agrees that Dr. Moffat should be subject to the limited restriction of not claiming to know what Dr. Shafer's mind was, but he contends that because Dr. Moffat has reviewed in-depth billing records of Dr. Shafer, he should be permitted \"to express the conclusions he has drawn concerning Dr. Shafer's intent to defraud.\" Pl.'s Resp. 4, ECF No. 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   An expert may testify that certain evidence is consistent with fraud and not innocent conduct or mistakes, so long as the expert provides adequate explanations for his conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5769753\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/1173/#p1195\">\n    796 F.3d at 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Witnesses are permitted to testify about how the law applies to a certain set of facts, so long as they provide adequate explanations for their conclusions.\");\n   <em>\n    Schneider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653657\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1287/#p1293\">\n    704 F.3d at 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"the rules do not prevent an expert from drawing conclusions about intent, so long as the expert does not profess to know a defendant's intent,\" and finding no error in expert testimony that evidence\n   indicated an intention to deceive and defraud the system where expert expressly disclaimed knowledge of the criminal defendant's intent);\n   <em>\n    DePaepe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191691\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/715/#p720\">\n    141 F.3d at 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that expert \"could give an opinion as an engineer that reducing the padding saved a particular amount of money; he might testify as an engineer that GM's explanation for the decision was not sound (from which the jury might infer that money was the real reason); but he could not testify\n   <em>\n    as an expert\n   </em>\n   that GM had a particular motive\"). The Court will therefore turn to the questions of whether Dr. Moffat is qualified to render the opinion and whether he has a reliable methodology or standard supporting his specific opinion concerning the evidence indicating fraud based on the number of billing errors submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Defendant asserts that Dr. Moffat is not qualified to render opinions on Dr. Shafer's fraudulent intent and motives. Defendants assign significance to the fact that Dr. Moffat has not received any training in identifying fraud in dentistry or other areas. The Court is not convinced that specific training in fraud is required. Dr. Moffat has years of training and experience practicing dentistry. He has been a Board Certified Pediatric Dentist since 2006 and has practiced dentistry in private practice since 2001.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report of Dr. Moffat, ECF No. 111-1. He also has experience providing dental services paid by Medicaid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden of production of showing that Dr. Moffat used a reliable methodology in concluding that Dr. Shafer's billing practices indicated he intended to defraud Medicaid. Dr. Moffat admitted there is no specific standard in dentistry to assign a percentage or number to arrive at a definitive determination of fraud, and so he instead used his \"professional opinion\" as a dentist that the number of mistakes over the course of a year was too high to indicate innocent mistakes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Dr. Moffat 46:2-49:15, 167:12-169:2, ECF No. 111-2. Although the application of experience to the facts can serve as the methodology of an expert, the problem here is that Plaintiff has not cited to anything in the record before the Court showing that Dr. Moffat has reviewed other dentists' records in his training and experience to have a baseline for an opinion that the number of errors here far exceeds those made in other dental practices. Plaintiff has not even argued what specific methodology Dr. Moffat employed when reaching his fraud conclusion. At this point, Plaintiff has not met his burden under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kumho Tire\n   </em>\n   to show a reliable methodology, so the Court will exclude Dr. Moffat's testimony that the number of errors is so high as to indicate fraud. The jury will have to consider the significance of the numbers without the specific aid of expert testimony on the issue of intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   1.

The Court addresses that motion\n    <em>\n     infra.\n    </em>\n    Defendants, however, have not sought to exclude Dr. Moffat's testimony concerning the errors he purportedly discovered regarding Category A and B restorations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    The circuits applying vicarious liability are split on whether the doctrine applies only where the corporation received a benefit, at least in part.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     O'Connell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12029516\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/890/563/#p568\">\n     890 F.2d at 568\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (discussing split in authority). The parties have not argued whether a corporate benefit is required for liability, but the Court need not resolve that issue now, because at this stage, Plaintiff's evidence indicates that Family Smiles benefited from the submission of the purported false claims of Dr. Shafer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    Moreover, even if some culpability on the part of the employer is required to establish vicarious liability, a question of fact exists in this case as to whether Family Smiles' management knew of and ratified Dr. Shafer's conduct.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    discussion\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    Title I of the ADA prohibits discrimination in employment and the EEOC has authority to issue regulations pertaining to Title I; Title III prohibits discrimination by public accommodations and the Attorney General has authority to issue regulations pertaining to Title III.\n    <em>\n     McDonald v.

That fact may be relevant at trial as to whether Boscoe was sufficiently trained to act as a service dog to help Plaintiff cope with his disability, but for purposes of determining whether Family Smiles engaged in good faith in the interactive process, the alleged refusal to consider purported paperwork is relevant as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    Defendants have submitted evidence from their expert William Goren, Esq., in which he opines that Plaintiff was responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process and that housing Boscoe in the dental office imposed an undue hardship on Family Smiles.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Report of William Goren, ECF No. 113-1. Plaintiff has moved to exclude Mr. Goren's opinions. The Court will consider the motion to exclude in a separate opinion. Even assuming that the Court would permit Mr. Goren's testimony, the Court finds that contrary expert testimony is not required to create a question of fact. The facts construed with all inferences in Plaintiff's favor create questions of fact that a jury may resolve in deciding the ultimate questions of law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    Although Plaintiff mentions in his complaint a \"hostile work environment,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Verified Am. Compl. \u00b6 384, he does not appear to be pursuing a hostile work environment theory of discrimination based on his response and the Pretrial Order (ECF No. 135). The Court will therefore limit its own inquiry as to Counts 17 and 18 to the theory on which the parties have based their arguments-whether Plaintiff was terminated because of his sexual orientation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    Plaintiff does not address whether New Mexico allows for direct liability for non-employer individuals under the NMHRA (relevant to Counts 18 and 21). Plaintiff, however, only urges liability under alter ego and integrated enterprise theories. The Court therefore deems any argument about direct liability under the NMHRA waived.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    Even if the allegations of the complaint were sufficient under Rule 12(b)(6), and if Plaintiff did not waive the argument on summary judgment, the Court notes that the factual assertions for which Plaintiff has personal knowledge, and about which he is competent to testify, are far fewer than the totality of the allegations. From the summary judgment record, a reasonable jury would not be able to find that Khurram Hussain, Dental Dreams a.k.a. Dental Experts, LLC, or KOS Services, LLC, abused the corporate form to perpetrate a fraud, promote injustice, to evade legal obligations, or for another improper purpose that would justify disregarding the \"corporate\" form under an alter ego theory.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    <em>\n     Daubert v.
