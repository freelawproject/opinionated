In a later, published opinion in a case filed by the same plaintiff, the Court reaffirmed that \"a plaintiff who alleges a danger of serious harm due to a failure to treat a chronic illness or condition satisfies the imminent-danger exception under \u00a7 1915(g).\"\n   <em>\n    Vandiver v.

The court rejected the defendant's assertion that the plaintiff's claims were \"not serious enough,\" stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Section] 1915(g) is not a vehicle for determining the merits of a claim. To follow the [defendant's] logic, a district court would not just need to determine whether a prisoner is alleging some type of ongoing or imminent harm. It would also need to fine-tune what is \"serious enough\" to qualify for the exception. Is being denied heart medication? What about a cholesterol-lowering drug? How frequently do beatings need to occur before they are serious? This would result in a complicated set of rules about what conditions are serious enough, all for a simple statutory provision governing when a prisoner must pay the filing fee for his claim. This is not required, and so we find that the district court erred in concluding that [the plaintiff's] complaint didn't meet the imminent danger exception.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296178\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/352/328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296178\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/352/328/\">\n    at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavis v.
