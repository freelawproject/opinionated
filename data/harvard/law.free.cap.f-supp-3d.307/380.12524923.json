INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Adams Outdoor Advertising Limited Partnership (\"Adams\") challenges the constitutionality of the Interchange Prohibition in Pennsylvania's Outdoor Advertising Control Act of 1971, 36 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2718.101 - 2718.115 (the \"Act\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Pa. Code \u00a7\u00a7 445.1-445.9. Defendant Leslie S. Richards (\"Richards\"), the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (\"PennDOT\"), has moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint or, in the alternative, to transfer venue to the Middle District of Pennsylvania. For the reasons set forth below, the motion is denied as to Adams's claim that the Act fails First Amendment scrutiny, the facial challenge to the Act under the First Amendment based on the absence of any time restrictions, and Adams's as-applied challenge under the First Amendment based on the delay before its application was decided. The motion to dismiss is granted with respect to Adams's request for monetary damages, Adams's vagueness challenge regarding the 500-feet spacing requirement in the Interchange Prohibition, and Adams's facial substantive due process claim. The motion to dismiss is granted in part as to Adams's as-applied substantive due process claim and equal protection claim, as these claims are dismissed without prejudice as premature. The request to transfer venue is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Adams is in the business of outdoor advertising (leasing space from private property owners and erecting billboards that disseminate messages). It filed a Complaint and an Amended Complaint alleging that the Act is unconstitutionally vague with respect to the regulation that \"no structure may be erected adjacent to or within five hundred feet of an interchange or safety rest area, measured along the interstate or limited access primary from the beginning or ending of pavement widening at the exit from or entrance to the main-traveled way.\" 36 P.S. \u00a7 2718.105(c)(2)(i) (\"Interchange Prohibition\"). The Interchange Prohibition includes an exemption, stating that \"[o]fficial and 'on premise' signs, as defined in section 131(c) of Title 23, United States Code, shall not be counted nor shall measurements be made from them for purposes of determining spacing requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   36 P.S. 2718.105(c)(2)(iv). \"Official signs\" are defined as \"[d]irectional or other official signs or notices erected and maintained by public officers or agencies pursuant to and in accordance with direction or authorization\n   contained in State of Federal law, for the purpose of carrying out an official duty or responsibility.\" 23 C.F.R. 750.105(a). \"On-premise signs\" are \"[s]igns not prohibited by State law which are consistent with the applicable provisions of this section and \u00a7 750.108 and which advertise the sale or lease of, or activities being conducted upon, the real property where the signs are located.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To support its claim that the provision is vague, Adams alleges that PennDOT has changed its interpretation of the Interchange Prohibition several times in the past thirty-seven years as to whether the 500-feet spacing requirement applies to structures on the opposite side of the highway from an interchange or safety rest area, or only on the same side. The last time PennDOT changed its interpretation was in 1997, when it determined that the 500-feet spacing requirement in the Interchange Prohibition applies to structures located on both sides of the highway. This interpretation, which Adams complains PennDOT made even though there were no amendments to the Act requiring a new interpretation, was announced in a strike-off letter issued on March 27, 1997.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Adams asserts that this interpretation conflicts with 67 Pa. Code. \u00a7 445.4, which states that the \"distance between sign structures shall be measured along the nearest edge of the pavement between points directly opposite the signs\n   <em>\n    along the same side of the traveled way.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20445.4\">\n    67 Pa. Code \u00a7 445.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(v) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the time the complaints were filed, Adams had filed an application to erect a billboard along the east-bound (south) side of U.S. Route 22 in Hanover Township, Northampton County, but had not yet received a response from PennDOT.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The proposed billboard would not be within 500 feet from an \"exit ... or entrance [ramp] to the main-traveled way\" as measured along the south side of U.S. Route 22, but it would be within 500 feet from a ramp located on the north side of U.S. Route 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Adams raises numerous claims, alleging violations of its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of free speech and freedom of expression, as well as violations of due process and equal protection. Adams challenges the constitutionality of the Act on its face and as applied, and alleges that the Interchange Prohibition is unconstitutionally vague and not narrowly tailored to advance any governmental interest. Adams complains about the lack of time restrictions in the Act, asserts that the Act is so vague as to be impossible of reasonably accurate interpretation, and alleges that PennDOT has unlimited discretion to give varying interpretations of the Interchange Prohibition. Adams also asserts violations of his substantive due process and equal protection rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In alleging combined\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\n   Adams asserts that the Act results in a total prohibition of its right to speak at the proposed location and that because the vagueness of the Interchange Prohibition fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice and also allows for differing interpretations, it is inherently inconsistent with a valid time, place, and manner regulation because it has the potential for becoming a means of suppressing speech for its content. Adams claims that the varying interpretations also violate equal protection. Finally, Adams asserts that the absence of any time constraints on PennDOT in the Act, and PennDOT's one-year delay in rejecting Adams' application violates free speech. These claims also include substantive due process challenges. The merits of each of these claims, as well as the applicable standards, are reviewed point by point hereinafter. Initially, however, the Court addresses whether Adams may obtain monetary relief from Richards on any of these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Richards cannot be liable for monetary damages.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Richards argues that qualified immunity shields her from liability for civil damages because there is no Pennsylvania Supreme Court or Third Circuit authority clearly establishing that any part of the Act is unconstitutional. Adams responds that its claim is now limited to injunctive relief, which is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and that it is \"prepared to accept dismissal of its claim against Secretary Richards for monetary relief.\" Opp. 10. Consequently, all claims for monetary relief are dismissed and Adams may proceed only on its request for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. In light of the exclusions identified in the Interchange Prohibition, Adams's claim that the Interchange Prohibition violates its First Amendment right to speak at the proposed location is sufficient to survive through this early stage of the proceedings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In determining whether a law violates the First Amendment, the first step is to determine whether the statute is content-based or content-neutral.\n   <em>\n    Rappa v.

The fourth and fifth factors also balance relatively equally because while Adams is located in this District, Richards is located in the Middle District, and it is likely\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   that witnesses will be located in both districts.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In light of the exclusions mentioned in the Interchange Prohibition, Adams's claim that the Act fails First Amendment scrutiny sufficiently states a claim. Adams has stated a facial challenge to the Act under the First Amendment based on the absence of any time restrictions for PennDOT to act on sign applications. At this stage of the proceedings, Adams's as-applied challenge under the First Amendment based on the one-year delay before PennDOT decided his application is also sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. However, Adams's vagueness challenge regarding the 500-feet spacing requirement in the Interchange Prohibition is dismissed. Adams's substantive due process claims are also dismissed, but the as-applied challenge is dismissed without prejudice as premature. Similarly, Adams's equal protection claim is dismissed without prejudice as premature. Because a substantial portion of the events giving rise to Adams's claims occurred in this District, namely the alleged suppression of free speech, Richards's request to transfer venue is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A separate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The 1997 strike-off letter states that PennDOT's prior interpretation was superseded by two Commonwealth Court opinions, which held that the 500-feet spacing requirement applies to any structure regardless of which side of the highway it is erected, and that this interpretation conforms with the purposes of the Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Am.
