Also, Defendant filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. Doc. No. 7-1 (\"Sanct. Mtn.\"). Plaintiff opposes both motions [Doc. No. 8 (\"MTD Oppo.\"), Doc. No. 9 (\"Sanct. Oppo.\") ], and Defendant replied [Doc. No. 10 (\"MTD Reply\"), Doc. No. 11 (\"Sanct. Reply\") ]. The Court found the matters suitable for determination on the papers and without oral argument pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1.d.1. Doc. No. 12. For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss [Doc.

Plaintiff purchased a subscription plan from Defendant and seeks to represent a class of \"[a]ll persons within California who, within the applicable statute of limitations period, up to and including the date of final judgment in this action, purchased any product or service in response to an offer constituting an \"Automatic Renewal\" as defined by [California Business and Professions Code] \u00a7 17601(a) from Stages of Beauty, LLC, its predecessors, or its affiliates.\" Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 7, 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's automatic renewal or continuous service offers failed to present the offer terms in a clear\n   and conspicuous manner and in visual proximity to the request for consent to the offer prior to purchasing the subscription and that Defendant charged Plaintiff's and class members' credit or debit cards, or third-party accounts, without first obtaining the subscriber's consent to the agreement containing the offer terms.

Compl., \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant failed to provide an acknowledgement including the full cancellation policy. Compl., \u00b6 2.

Plaintiff alleges that these emails provide language regarding cancellation without specifying that a subscriber must call the cancellation number \"at least one day prior to the date the subscriber's next monthly delivery ships.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiff, Defendant's webpage also references \"cancellation and gives a phone number for cancellation,\" but \"does not specify, as do terms set forth later in the website, that that number must be called at least one day prior to the date the subscriber's next monthly delivery ships, and thus does not contain a full description of the cancellation policy in visual proximity to the request for consent to the offer....\" Compl., \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a result, Plaintiff alleges \"all goods, wares, merchandise, or products, sent to Plaintiff and Class Members under the automatic renewal or continuous service agreement are deemed to be an unconditional gift....\" Compl., \u00b6 20. Based on these allegations, Plaintiff raises the following causes of action: (1) failure to present the automatic renewal or continuous service offer terms clearly and conspicuously and in visual proximity to the request for consent offer in violation of the ARL; (2) failure to obtain the consumer's affirmative consent before the subscription is fulfilled in violation of the ARL; (3) failure to provide an acknowledgement with the automatic renewal terms and information regarding the cancellation policy in violation of the ARL; and (4) violations of California's UCL for unlawful and/or unfair business practices.
