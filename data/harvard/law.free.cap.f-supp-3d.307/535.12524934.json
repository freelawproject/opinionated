Plaintiffs sued Harang Sugars, LLC (\"Harang Sugars\"); Lee Harang (\"Harang\"), the majority owner of Harang Sugars; Calvin Smith (\"Smith\"), an employee of Harang Sugars; and Harang Sugars' liability insurers Louisiana Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Company and Louisiana Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (collectively \"Farm Bureau\"). This Court has jurisdiction because Plaintiffs are Mexican nationals, all defendants are citizens of Louisiana, and the amount in controversy\n   exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The underlying facts giving rise to Plaintiffs' injuries are not in dispute. On August 14, 2015, during a sugarcane planting operation, Harang Sugars' employee Smith negligently drove a tractor into the rear of a cane cart on which Plaintiffs were riding. Plaintiffs, payroll employees of Lowry Farms, Inc. (\"Lowry Farms\"), were injured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The primary issue before the Court is Plaintiffs' status. If Plaintiffs are employees or independent contractors involved in manual labor for Harang Sugars, as Farm Bureau contends, Plaintiffs' exclusive remedy against Harang Sugars is workers' compensation, and they have no tort remedy against any of the Defendants. Furthermore, there would be no coverage under the two Farm Bureau policies. If, on the other hand, Plaintiffs are employees of Lowry Farms, and not employees of Harang Sugars or independent contractors doing manual labor for Harang Sugars, as Plaintiffs and Harang Sugars maintain, then Plaintiffs have a viable tort remedy against Defendants, and Farm Bureaus' policies would provide coverage for the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons which follow, the Court finds that Plaintiffs were, at the time of the accident, employees of Lowry Farms only and not employees (outright, borrowed, dual or joint) of Harang Sugars and were not, within the meaning of Louisiana law, independent contractors doing manual labor for Harang Sugars. The Court finds the two Farm Bureau policies provide coverage for the accident. Given the stipulation regarding Smith's fault and the amount of damages suffered,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   judgment is rendered in favor of Plaintiffs in the amount stipulated among the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Players\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs Jorge-Chavelas and Moreno-Abarca are Mexican nationals who were at all relevant times temporarily and legally residing in Louisiana as \"H-2A workers\" under the authority of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, 20 C.F.R. 655.100,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Harang Sugars is a Louisiana limited liability company whose members are natural persons and citizens of Louisiana.

There, Plaintiffs alleged that, in the event it was found that Plaintiffs were employees of Harang Sugars, then Defendants were liable to Plaintiffs for breach of contract, violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and violation of the Louisiana Wage Payment Law ( La.

Plaintiffs would look only to Louisiana Farm Bureau for the payment of judgment, if any. Plaintiffs stipulated that in the event the Court determined judgment should be entered in their favor, the judgment should award $1,937,500 to Alejandro Jorge-Chavelas and $562,500 to Alfredo Moreno-Abarca. All other claims for damages, including the FLSA claims, would be dismissed. They agreed the case would be tried solely on the issue of Harang Sugars' immunity and/or the applicability of Farm Bureau's employment-related coverage exclusions and unless Farm Bureau prevailed on the foregoing immunity/coverage defenses, Farm Bureau would pay the full amount of the stipulated damages plus interest and costs as allowed by law.

It farms nearly 5000 acres of sugar cane, regularly harvesting approximately 4000 acres of sugar cane which is delivered to a sugar mill each year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harang is the majority owner and the person in charge of the day-to-day operations of Harang Sugars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Farming sugar cane is a year-round enterprise which involves multiple different phases that are important to a successful crop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The planting phase is an important part of Harang Sugars' business because once it is completed, it must live with the results of the planting for the four or five year cycle involved in growing sugar cane.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sugar cane planting season lasts for one to two months depending on the weather.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In Louisiana, sugarcane is still routinely planted by the \"hand-planting\" method, which sugarcane farmers find to be superior to that done by machine because less seed cane is used. This results in more cane going to the sugar mill and higher profits. The hand-planting process involves the use of a large tractor which pulls a \"cane cart,\" loaded with sugarcane, up and down rows of a field. Three \"cane planters\" follow on foot behind the cart, pulling stalks of sugarcane from the cart and laying them in the furrows. It is hoped that a new cane crop will sprout from the joints of the planted stalks. Cane planting is considered unskilled manual labor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Hand planting is a labor intensive process, and, therefore, Harang Sugars' need for additional labor increases dramatically during the planting season. Twenty-one (21) additional laborers were necessary to hand plant sugar cane on Harang Sugars's farm in 2015. Sugarcane farm owners rarely have their own employees plant the cane.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, sugarcane farmers usually contract with a planting service to plant the sugarcane over the few weeks of the planting season. One such sugarcane planting service is non-party Lowry Farms, an Arkansas company who employed Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lowry Farms\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lowry Farms is located in Hermitage, Arkansas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clay Lowry is the president, operator, and manager of Lowry. Renee Ferrell is Lowry Farm's office manager and farmer liaison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike the clients it serves, Lowry Farms is not in the business of growing and selling sugarcane for profit\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   but, rather, is in the business of planting sugarcane.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In 2015, Lowry Farms had 70 sugarcane farmer clients in Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lowry charged its clients on a per-acre (as opposed to per cane-planter or per hours worked) basis, without regard to how long it took to plant the cane.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lowry Farms\n   would confer with its clients before the cane planting season to determine when the client wanted to begin planting and the number of tractors and tractor drivers the client had-and therefore determine the ideal number of cane planters for each farm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A crew leader and/or straw boss, Lowry Farms employees, would accompany the Lowry Farms cane planters to the job site, and remain there to guide and direct their work. When the work was completed at the end of each day, Lowry Farms employees would provide transportation for its workers to a temporary housing site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lowry Farms' H-2A employees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Lowry Farms, through the United States Department of Labor's H-2A procedure, hired Mexican nationals to perform the cane planting work. Lowry Farms recruited, vetted, and hired the cane planters, and then brought them to the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lowry's H-2A workers were seasonal employees who remained employed with Lowry Farms only as long as the planting season required. Lowry Farms paid the cane planters an hourly wage and provided them with workers' compensation insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A written contract-denominated \"General Disclosure and Terms of Employment\"-governed the relationship between Lowry Farms and its H-2A seasonal employee cane planters. The Terms of Employment document provided, in relevant part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Workers are hired by [Lowry Farms] on a contract basis for hand planting sugar cane as well as any other general farm labor needed[;] The employees will be employed from the time their contract begins until all cane under contract is planted[;] Employees are provided with Workers Compensation Insurance[;] Employees will be required to work all hours as directed by Lowry Farms management personnel[;] Wage rate is applicable prevailing hourly wage rate or greater for the location in which they are working[;] Paychecks will be issued to employees weekly at the job site and no later that [sic] the second Tuesday following the end of the work week.

Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1044 and Plaintiffs have failed to rebut that presumption; second, that Plaintiffs were independent contractors engaged in manual labor within the meaning of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1021(7); third, that Plaintiffs were Harang Sugars' borrowed servants; fourth, that Harang Sugars was a special or joint employer of Plaintiffs under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1031(c) and/or by virtue of regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor and codified in relevant provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, (\"FLSA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   A related issue, but one not advanced by Farm Bureau, is whether Plaintiffs were the statutory employees of Harang Sugars under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1061. Finally, related to all of the above issues are the coverage defenses asserted by Farm Bureau.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Only Farm Bureau maintains that, under one of these theories, Plaintiffs were employees of Harang Sugars and therefore Harang Sugars is immune from this tort claim and Farm Bureau does not provide coverage for this loss. Harang Sugars, Intervenor and Plaintiffs, on the other hand, have maintained throughout this litigation that Harang Sugars was not the special\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   or borrowing employer of Plaintiffs and that Harang Sugars had no control over the cane planters, including Plaintiffs; had no right to select, hire or fire them; and had no obligation to pay them. Further, they contend the contract with Lowry Farms provided nothing to the contrary. Instead, they maintain that Lowry Farms was at all times the sole employer of Plaintiffs, that only Lowry Farms had the right to control, select, hire or fire and the obligation to pay and provide workers compensation coverage for Plaintiffs.

In making an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess, the Court relies on the following: (1) decisions of the [Louisiana] Supreme\n   Court in analogous cases, (2) the rationales and analyses underlying [Louisiana] Supreme Court decisions on related issues, (3) dicta by the [Louisiana] Supreme Court, (4) lower state court decisions, (5) the general rule on the question, (6) the rulings of courts of other states to which [Louisiana] courts look when formulating substantive law and (7) other available sources, such as treatises and legal commentaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the context of Louisiana law, the Court must follow the civilian method in carrying out this task.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   This approach is followed because in Louisiana, jurisprudence is considered a secondary source of law, and the federal court is not bound by Louisiana appellate court opinions, particularly if there is \"persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Western District has observed the civilian methodology requires examination of primary sources, if available on the given issue, prior to relying on lower court jurisprudence in order to make an \"Erie guess.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Were Plaintiffs the Presumed Employees of Harang Sugars?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Under Louisiana law, workers' compensation is generally the exclusive remedy for an employee injured at the workplace.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   A prerequisite to workers' compensation coverage \"is the existence of an employer-employee relationship,\" which is ordinarily evidenced by the following four factors: \"1) selection and engagement, 2) payment of wages, 3) power of dismissal, and 4) power of control.

Rather, the only two operative contracts in this case were between Plaintiffs and Lowry Farms, and between Lowry Farms and Harang Sugars. Furthermore, the contract between Harang Sugars and Lowry Farms indicates that both parties to the contract envisioned that Plaintiffs would at all times remain the employees of Lowry Farms. Because there was no contract between Plaintiffs and Harang Sugars, Plaintiffs contend they have successfully rebutted any presumption they were employees of Harang Sugars under La. Rev. Stat.

Plaintiffs were at all times payroll employees of Lowry Farms and, as discussed elsewhere in this ruling, never left the direction, supervision and control of Lowry Farms. The only operative contracts in this case were between Plaintiffs and Lowry Farms and Lowry Farms and Harang Sugars. Plaintiffs are correct that the contract between Harang Sugars and Lowry Farms envisioned that Plaintiffs would remain the employees of Lowry,\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating in relevant part: \"I [Harang Sugars] agree to pay Lowry Farms, Inc. weekly\n   <em>\n    for the work performed by Lowry Farms, Inc. workers.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any work by Plaintiffs which benefitted Harang Sugars was done by operation of Plaintiffs' contract with Lowry Farms and through Lowry Farm's contract with Harang. The fact Plaintiffs' work benefitted Harang Sugars' business enterprise does not establish a contract, express or implied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The contract between Lowry Farms and Plaintiffs provides further support for Plaintiffs' position.

In\n   <em>\n    Lushute v. Diesi\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court examined the legislative history of the term \"independent contractor\" as the term is used in La. Rev. Stat.

Rather, the only contract to which Plaintiffs were a party was their contract with Lowry Farms. Moreover, as discussed above, Lowry Farms' contract with Harang Sugars expressly indicates that the parties intended for Plaintiffs to remain the employees of Lowry. Thus, Plaintiffs are not independent contractors as defined in La. Rev. Stat.

He called Ferrell because \"that's the-that's the route of me communicating to get things done.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs' contracts with Lowry Farms declare that Plaintiffs are Lowry Farms' employees, and Plaintiffs \"will be required to work all hours as directed LF personnel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing in their contracts suggests that the client farmer would have any control over Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs themselves understood that they were employees of Lowry Farms. They understood that they worked for \"Clay Lowry\" and that Hernandez and Torres-both Lowry Farms employees-were Plaintiffs' bosses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jorge Gonzales, a Harang Sugars employee-tractor driver\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n   pulling the cart from which Plaintiffs were working, directly observed who was exercising control over Plaintiffs' work. Gonzales observed Hernandez talking to the planters about how they should do their job, every morning. Gonzales understood from what he saw that Hernandez was the\n   supervisor for the cane planters. Gonzales personally observed Hernandez instruct the cane planters and train them how to do their job, every morning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As to Farm Bureau's argument that orders came from Lowry Farms crew bosses only because Plaintiffs did not speak English and Lee Harang did not speak Spanish, Plaintiffs respond in their supplemental memorandum\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Harang Sugars had 5 to 7 employees who spoke Spanish and could, and sometimes did, translate for Harang if and when he wished to communicate directly with a Lowry Farms employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   This included Jorge Gonzales, the tractor driver working with Plaintiffs at the time of the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court has carefully reviewed the extensive evidence and argument on this issue of control and concludes that the legal presumption that Lowry Farms retained control has not been rebutted, and, indeed, the great weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that the right of control and its actual exercise remained with Lowry Farms. This \"first and foremost factor\" weighs heavily against a borrowing relationship. Lowry Farms had sole discretion as to where Plaintiffs would work; it could unilaterally transfer Plaintiffs from Harang Sugars' farm to that of another client without consulting Harang Sugars. As to Farm Bureau's argument that Harang only dealt with Lowry Farms supervisors because of language issues, the Court has reviewed the conflicting evidence on this point and rejects Farm Bureau's position. Lowry Farms, its Crew Leaders and Straw Bosses exercised actual and real control over Plaintiffs and their co-workers and were not merely acting as interpreters to communicate Harang Sugars' directives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As far as Harang Sugars' decisions regarding what time to begin work; which fields to work on a particular day; and whether to cancel work for inclement weather, this is precisely the type of \"mere suggestion of details or cooperation\" that does not support a finding of borrowed employee status. Harang never spoke to or had any interaction with Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Harang himself acknowledged that Harang Sugars did not have the power to control Lowry Farms' planters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harang Sugars could make requests of Lowry Farms' planters, but Harang Sugars could not force the planters to do anything.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n   One who has hired a contractor for a particular service may request of his contractor corrections to work the contractor's employee did incorrectly. In doing so, the client does not assume control of his contractor's worker so that the worker becomes the client's borrowed employee; rather, \"[the worker] remains subject to no orders but those of the man who pays him.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Harang Sugars could\n   require Lowry Farms to replant cane if Harang Sugars was unsatisfied with the work, Plaintiffs remained subject to no orders but those of the one who paid them, Lowry Farms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   It is true that the nature of the cane planting operation requires coordination between the farmer and the planting service. For instance, the farmer decides when he wants to begin the planting; what he wants the final product to be (e.g., three overlapping stalks of cane in the furrow); how many tractors/drivers he has available, thus suggesting the most efficient number of cane planters (three per tractor/driver); and since tractors/drivers are useless without a planting crew behind them-and planting crews are useless without a tractor/driver in front of them-daily start times, lunch breaks, and quitting times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Harang Sugars was a client paying for a specific service, and just as in any service contract, Harang Sugars could request corrections to work done incorrectly. While Harang Sugars could require Lowry Farms to replant cane if Harang Sugars was unsatisfied with the work, Plaintiffs remained subject to no orders other than those of Lowry Farms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As mentioned elsewhere in this analysis, it is uncontested that Harang Sugars lacked the authority to terminate Plaintiffs' employment. It could not require them to perform other duties that were part of Harang Sugars' operations (such as harvesting mature sugarcane), though it could offer to pay them for such services, if they chose to accept the additional assignment. Its control of the plaintiffs was limited to mere suggestion and details of cooperation, which is an insufficient indicia of control to establish a borrowed employee relationship. No part of this agreement between Harang Sugars and Lowry Farms gave Harang Sugars any control of the Lowry Farms cane planters\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, indeed, Harang Sugars did not want any control of the Lowry Farms employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, and without regard to the presumption, the Court concludes that Harang Sugars did not exercise control over Plaintiffs and this factor weighs against borrowed servant status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Second Factor: Who Selected Plaintiffs?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The second factor considers who-as between the general employer and the putative borrowing employer-selected the employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case there were two selection events: (1) the original selection of Plaintiffs to work for the general employer, Lowry Farms and (2), the subsequent selection of Plaintiffs to work in some connection with a particular farmer-client of Lowry Farms. Lowry Farms maintained exclusive control over the entirety of both selection events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Harang Sugars' only involvement in the selection process was an initial request for a certain number of cane planters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Lowry Farms was not obligated to provide that specific number.\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   For instance, in 2015 Harang Sugars requested 21 cane planters, but Lowry Farms initially brought only 18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harang Sugars paid the same per acre price regardless of the number of cane planters Harang Sugars requested\n   or Lowry Farms actually brought.\n   <footnotemark>\n    168\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Lowry Farms' Crew Leader/Recruiters went to Mexico and recruited and vetted their cane planters. Lowry Farms, with no assistance from Harang Sugars, handled the entire H-2A visa process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lowry Farms recruited and vetted the cane planters in Mexico and arranged for their visas. Lowry Farms, without input from Harang Sugars, then transported the cane planters to Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once the planters were in Louisiana, Lowry Farms' Crew Leader/Recruiters, without input from Harang Sugars or the other farmers, selected which planters would work and where.\n   <footnotemark>\n    171\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even after Lowry Farms sent the planters to the various farms, Lowry Farms had discretion to move planters from one farm to another for any reason and without input from the client as to which planters would be moved or how many.\n   <footnotemark>\n    172\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record evidence demonstrates that the \"who-selects\" factor weighs against a borrowing relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Third Factor: Who Paid Plaintiffs' Wages?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The third factor considers who, as between the general employer and the putative borrowing employer, paid the employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    173\n   </footnotemark>\n   Analysis of this factor goes beyond an inquiry of which employer's bank account was used to write the employee's paychecks. Instead, \"[t]his factor focuses on which entity provided the funds with which the injured employee was paid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \"When the borrowing employer pays the lending employer and then the lending employer in turn pays his workers, a finding of borrowed servant is supported.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the borrowing employer pays the general employer an hourly rate for the employee's labor, and the general employer in turn pays the employee an hourly rate, the method supports a finding of a borrowing relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this is not what the evidence showed in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Where the general employer bills the putative employer based on the work performed, and the putative employer does not \"simply reimburse\" the employee's hourly rate, the general employer retains the obligation to pay the employee's wages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is the situation which existed in this case. Lowry Farms paid its cane planters an hourly rate\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   and issued the pay checks on a weekly basis, drawn on a Lowry Farms account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n   Significantly,\n   Lowry Farms invoiced Harang Sugars on a\n   <em>\n    per-acre\n   </em>\n   basis while Lowry Farms paid Plaintiffs an hourly rate. Furthermore, Lowry Farms tendered payment of Plaintiffs' wages before collecting payment under its contract with Harang Sugars,\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   thereby bearing the financial risk of payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harang Sugars had no input as to when or how Plaintiffs were paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The per-acre amount Lowry Farms charged Harang Sugars did not fluctuate based on the number of planters, even if the number changed during the planting season.\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lowry Farms determined its payroll schedule and frequency for its cane planters. Harang Sugars had no control over how or when the cane planters were paid. In fact, Harang Sugars' own employees were on a different payroll schedule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n   This factor weighs against a finding of borrowed employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth Factor: Who had the right to fire Plaintiffs?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The fourth factor considers whether the borrowing employer had the authority to terminate the worker's services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    184\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence establishes that Lowry Farms had the exclusive authority to fire Plaintiffs and that Harang Sugars had no right to terminate them. Thus, argue Plaintiffs, this factor weighs decidedly against borrowed employee status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    185\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Farm Bureau counters that the question presented is not which employer had the authority to terminate the employee's employment outright but rather, whether the borrowing employer had the authority to terminate the employee's services with the borrowing employer\n   <em>\n    at its jobsite.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    186\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harang Sugars maintains it would let Lowry Farms or its employees know if it was unhappy with the work being performed and expected Lowry to make changes in light of any unsatisfactory reports from Harang Sugars or if Harang Sugars requested changes to be made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    187\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, argues Farm Bureau, Harang Sugars retained control over the work of the laborers in its cane fields and could instruct or even have unsatisfactory laborers removed from them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    188\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court has reviewed the evidence on this point and concludes Farm Bureau overstates its case. Harang testified multiple times that he could not fire a Lowry Farm's employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    189\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, he conceded that, rather than having the ability to remove a Lowry Farms' hand with whom he was unhappy, his only recourse was to terminate the entire contract with Lowry Farms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    190\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court concludes that this factor weighs against Plaintiffs' borrowed employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <em>\n    Fifth Factor: Who provided the tools and place to perform work?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The fifth factor considers who provided the tools and place to perform the work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    191\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both sides concede that Harang Sugars provided the tractors, trailers, seed cane, water, and gloves used in the sugarcane planting operation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    192\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs argue, however, that Lowry Farms supplied the cane planters with their H-2A visas, transportation to the United States, workers compensation insurance, and transportation from their housing to the particular field they worked each day. Lowry Farms also provided transportation to the grocery store and to the place where the cane planters cashed their payroll checks. Lowry Farms brought them to their particular farm assignment, and, when done, to another farm assignment or back to Mexico.\n   <footnotemark>\n    193\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   If one reads the requirements under this factor narrowly, this factor favors the borrowed servant status of Plaintiffs. However, if read broadly to include items and services necessary for Harang Sugars' work to be performed by the H-2a workers, then it is a closer call. However, interpreting the words \"tools and place to perform work\" literally, this factor favors borrowed servant status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    Sixth Factor: Was the \"new employment\" over a considerable length of time?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The sixth factor considers whether the \"new employment\" was over a considerable length of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    194\n   </footnotemark>\n   Typically, when the new employment is over a considerable length of time, the factor weighs in favor of a borrowing relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    195\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Harang Sugars' planting in 2015 lasted for a period of only four or five weeks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    196\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was never intended that Plaintiffs' work on Harang Sugars' farm for longer than this, and, in fact, they had worked there for just three weeks at the time they were injured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    197\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had Plaintiffs not been injured, Lowry Farms could have, at the completion of the job, sent Plaintiffs to another job site to plant cane on another client's farm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    198\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Especially in light of the fact that an entire crop cycle (from seed planting through harvesting) can last years, it cannot reasonably be said that Plaintiffs' employment, which could not have lasted longer than five weeks, was a \"considerable\" period of time.

One could logically argue that Plaintiffs were performing Lowry Farms' work because Lowry Farms is in the business of planting sugarcane. Lowry Farms was rendering a service for Harang Sugars through Plaintiffs pursuant to a contract between Lowry Farms and Harang Sugars. On the other hand, one can logically conclude that Plaintiffs were performing the work of Harang Sugars' business: it was Harang Sugars' sugarcane that was being planted on Harang Sugars' property for the ultimate purpose of allowing Harang Sugars to cultivate and harvest it. While close, the Court finds Harang Farms has the better side of the argument. Thus, the Court finds that this factor favors borrowed employment status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    Eighth Factor: Did an agreement exist between Lowry Farms and Harang Sugars?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The eighth factor considers whether there was some agreement between putative borrowing and putative lending employers evidencing a discussion and understanding of the employees' status, and specifically whether there was any indicia of control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    200\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Dupre v.

Plaintiffs similarly turned to Lowry Farms' employees if they had an issue off the worksite, such as with their housing or cashing their checks. The Court finds there was no acquiescence of these workers to employment for Harang Sugars.

The Court found the two companies were joint employers of the plaintiff, and both were obligated under Louisiana workers' compensation laws rather than in tort. The court held that the scenario presented was precisely the type of situation contemplated by the La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1031(C) -\"that of a worker employed by, and under the control and direction of, the special employer at the time of his injury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    218\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the commercial insurance policy issued by Waste Management's insurer excluded any obligation for which Waste Management might be liable under workers' compensation law, the immunity enjoyed by the special and general, or joint, employers excluded coverage for the insurer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    219\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Louisiana's Revised Statutes do not provide a definition of \"special employer\" or \"general employer.\" However, state courts have held that these terms, and the test used to determine whether one falls under one or the other, is analogous to the test for \"borrowed employer\" status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    220\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed,\n   Farm Bureau concedes that the test for dual employment is essentially the same as the borrowed employee test previously detailed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    221\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, they urge that the result of the analysis should be that \"the plaintiffs...were 'borrowed employees' under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1031(c) because the laborers at Harang Sugars' farm were under the control and direction of Harang Sugars at all times.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    222\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court disagrees. For the reasons previously given by the Court in connection with its analysis of the borrowed servant issue, the Court finds that Harang Sugars was not a special, joint or dual employer of Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Ordinarily, in order for a party to claim dual or joint employer status, that party must establish that the right of the general employer to control the employee has ended and that the right to control him has been assumed by the borrowing employer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    223\n   </footnotemark>\n   A mere showing of a division of control is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that a general employer retains control over his regular employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    224\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, the Court finds that Harang Sugars never exercised control of Plaintiffs so as to give it borrowed or joint employer status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Farm Bureau makes, as Plaintiffs correctly note, a \"straw man\" argument charging that \"Plaintiffs' urge that there can be only one employer in the instant case\" and then cite law supporting the notion of joint or dual employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    225\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs respond that first, they never made this argument and second, \"the point Farm Bureau ignores is that the dual liability under 1031(C) arises\n   <em>\n    only when\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     there is first\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    a borrowing situation.\n   </em>\n   In other words, had Plaintiffs become Harang Sugars' borrowed employees, both Harang Sugars and Lowry Farms would be jointly liable for workers compensation benefits under 1031(C). But if, as Plaintiffs contend, Plaintiffs never became borrowed or \"special\" employees of Harang Sugars, there can be no dual employment under 1031(C).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    226\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiffs. For the reasons detailed above, Harang Sugars never became the borrowing employer of Plaintiffs and therefore cannot be their dual, joint or special employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    Applicability of H2-A Regulations and Definitions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   In support of its contention that Harang Sugars was Plaintiffs' sole, special, joint or dual employer, Farm Bureau points the Court to the regulatory definitions promulgated by the Department of Labor governing the H-2A visa program. It also urges that the federal statute and regulations are relevant to the issue of insurance coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Specifically, Farm Bureau urges that Plaintiffs should be considered Harang Sugars' employees under the H-2A federal regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    227\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further argues that under the regulatory definitions promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor (\"DOL\") governing the H-2A visa program, Harang Sugars and Lowry Farms must, at a minimum, be considered Plaintiffs' joint employers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    228\n   </footnotemark>\n   It urges the Court to apply an \"economic realities\" test to determine whether the two companies were Plaintiffs' joint employers under H-2A regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    229\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, it alleges Harang Sugars and Lowry Farms were \"special employers\" under the LWCA, and avers that the test for special employers under Louisiana law is analogous to the test for joint employer under H-2A regulations and/or supported by it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    230\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In short, Plaintiffs respond that Farm Bureau's H-2A argument is misguided and is an improper comparison of \"apples to oranges.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    231\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argue that the \"economic realities\" test urged by Farm Bureau is derived from the definition of \"employ\" under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which DOL uses to support the remedial purpose of giving H-2A visa workers the broadest protections possible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    232\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In any event, argue Plaintiffs, even if the Court were to consider Harang an \"employer\" under H-2A regulations, this is wholly irrelevant to the dispositive inquiry here, which is whether Plaintiffs were Harang Sugars' employees as defined by the liability policy issued by Farm Bureau.\n   <footnotemark>\n    233\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the term \"employee\" is not specifically defined in that policy, the term must be given its ordinary and usual meaning, which in this case, render Plaintiffs beyond the purview of employee status under the policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    234\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   As stated above, the Court has diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and is therefore bound to apply Louisiana state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    235\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no Louisiana Supreme Court decision addressing the argument Farm Bureau raises here, and therefore, the Court must again make an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess to determine the soundness of its argument. As discussed below, the Court is confident that the Louisiana Supreme Court would not extract a statutory definition from the FLSA and apply it to issues arising exclusively under state law, i.e. employer/employee status for purposes of worker's compensation, tort liability and insurance coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Court notes the dearth of jurisprudence Farm Bureau offers in support of its novel argument that Harang Sugars is the joint employer for liability purposes based upon the H-2A regulations. Furthermore, the Court finds that although the Plaintiffs\n   in this case were in the United States on H-2A visas issued by DOL, the dispute at issue here does not implicate their status as H-2A laborers, nor does it involve application of the administrative regulations promulgated by the DOL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The central inquiry of this dispute is, as Plaintiffs correctly note, whether or not Plaintiffs were \"employees\" for purposes of Louisiana law and Harang Sugars' liability policies issued by Farm Bureau. This inquiry and the pertinent analysis would remain unchanged if Plaintiffs were Lowry Farms' employees recruited locally rather than from Mexico. Every other argument urged by Farm Bureau involves the application of Louisiana state law; it offers no logical or principled reason why the Court should apply language from federal regulations subject to administrative review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Fifth Circuit noted that \"[t]he remedial purposes of the FLSA require the courts to define 'employer' more broadly than the term would be interpreted in traditional common law applications.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    236\n   </footnotemark>\n   This jurisprudence makes clear that FLSA terms are unique to the FLSA and transplanting their distinctive definitions to issues arising under state law is not a practice in which Courts should engage. Accordingly, the Court declines Farm Bureau's invitation to do so here and holds that whatever definition of \"employer\" or \"joint employer\" is provided by the FLSA, it is wholly inapposite to the dispute at the heart of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Was Harang Sugars the Statutory Employer of Plaintiffs under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1061 ?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Although Farm Bureau alleges that Plaintiffs were independent contractors engaged in manual labor as defined in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1021(7), Plaintiffs counter that Section 1021(7) is inapplicable here because that provision of the Louisiana Workers' Compensation Act applies only to instances where the principal is obligated to provide coverage to an individual in direct contractual privity with the principal as an independent contractor, which is not the case here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    237\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Plaintiffs assert that the relevant provision is actually La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1061, which \"applies to the contractor's employees vis-\u00e0-vis the contractor's principal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    238\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Plaintiffs are correct that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1061\"provides guidance as to when a\n   <em>\n    contractor's employee\n   </em>\n   , rather than a contractor himself, may recover under the principal's worker's compensation liability.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    239\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such is the case here. Plaintiffs worked for Harang Sugars by operation of Plaintiffs' contract with Lowry Farms, and Lowry Farm's contract with Harang Sugars. There was no contractual privity between Plaintiffs and Harang Sugars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Nonetheless, nowhere in its briefing has Farm Bureau alleged tort immunity through the application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1061 and Plaintiffs argue that, while the appropriate article governing this kind of situation, Farm Bureau has conceded 1061 does not apply here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    240\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   its briefing, Farm Bureau did not contend otherwise. At the oral argument on pretrial motions held on February 9, 2017, the Court pointedly asked counsel for Farm Bureau its position on the applicability of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1061, to which counsel replied that Farm Bureau had not taken a position on the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    241\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked what Farm Bureau's position on the issue was at that juncture, counsel represented that he would not be arguing the applicability of 1061, as it was his belief that there were more effective vehicles to bar Plaintiffs' recovery in tort.\n   <footnotemark>\n    242\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nowhere in pre-trial or post-trial briefing has Farm Bureau argued for tort immunity based on 1061 and the Court finds none on its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Do Farm Bureau's Policies Cover the Loss?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Farm Bureau's farm liability and umbrella policies exclude coverage for tort liability for injuries to employees; coverage for such claims is provided by worker's compensation and employer's liability policies, and not general or farm liability policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    243\n   </footnotemark>\n   Farm Bureau argues that Plaintiffs are either employees of Harang Sugars or independent contractors engaged strictly in manual labor and, as such, Plaintiffs' exclusive remedy against Harang is in workers' compensation and therefore, given the policies' exclusions, there is no coverage available for the Plaintiffs' or Intervenor's claims under either policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    244\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Plaintiffs argue, to the contrary, they are neither employees nor independent contractors engaged in manual labor, and therefore no policy exclusion applies to exclude coverage. As to Farm Bureau's attempted reliance on FLSA regulations and its definitions, Plaintiffs argue that the word \"employee\" in an insurance contract must be given its ordinary and usual meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    245\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is particularly so because the Farm Bureau policies do not define \"employee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    246\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   \"[A]bsent an indication of a different meaning in an insurance contract, the word 'employee' understood in its common and usual sense, signifies one who is a party to an employment contract, express or implied.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    247\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, argue Plaintiffs, Farm Bureau's attempt to use the FLSA and H-2A regulations and graft upon the insurance policies as well as Louisiana law \"the broadest definition [of 'employee'] that has ever been included in any one act\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    248\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one that \"cover[s] some parties who might not qualify as such under a strict application of traditional agency law principles\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    249\n   </footnotemark>\n   -runs against the word \"in its common and usual sense\" and should be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Court agrees. As previously discussed above in a different context, the FLSA and H-2A definitions are inapplicable for the use for which Farm Bureau attempts to put them. Accordingly, the Court finds the policy exclusions relied upon do not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Plaintiffs are neither employees of Harang Sugars nor independent contractors performing manual labor within the meaning of Louisiana's workers compensation laws. In addition, there are no exclusions to coverage for these claims under the Farm Bureau policies. There is therefore no legal impediment to Plaintiffs' tort claims against Harang Sugars, Smith and its farm liability and umbrella insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Therefore, in accordance with the stipulations reached among the parties, the Court renders judgment in favor of Alejandro Jorge-Chavelas and against Farm Bureau in the amount of $1,937,500. The Court renders judgment in favor of Alfredo Moreno-Abarca and against Farm Bureau in the amount of $562,500. Legal interest is awarded on both awards from date of judicial demand until paid. Within seven days the parties shall submit a judgment which incorporates this ruling and details the amounts owed under each Farm Bureau policy as well as any relief owed to Intervenor American Interstate Insurance Company.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; Plaintiffs' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (\"PPFFCOL\"), \u00b6 98, Doc. 80 at 17; Defendants' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (\"DPFFCOL\"), \u00b6 66, Doc. 79 at 12.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Stipulation of Parties (\"Stipulation\"), Doc. 78 at 3-5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1230028\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/360/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    PPFFCOL, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, Doc. 80 at 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    DPFFCOL, \u00b6 11, Doc. 79 at 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    PPFFCOL, \u00b6 6, Doc. 80 at 1; DPFFCOL, \u00b6 10, Doc. 79 at 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    Louisiana Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Co.
