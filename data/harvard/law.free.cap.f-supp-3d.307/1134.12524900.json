[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37] The Administrator directed Avant of CO to issue refunds to consumers for the excess charges and fees, and to apply Colorado law to any loan agreements.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39] The Administrator rejected this position and again requested that Avant of CO take corrective action.

The Court Adopts the Recommendation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Judge Varholak's Recommendation began by observing that Section 27 \"allows a state bank to charge interest rates permitted in its home state on loans made in another state, even if that interest rate would be unlawful in the state where the loan is made.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8-9.) The Recommendation noted this is similar to Sections 85 &amp; 86 of the National Bank Act (\"NBA\"), which \"allo[w] national banks to charge interest rates to the extent allowed by their home states, notwithstanding the laws of the states in which the loans are made,\" and \"se[t] forth the elements of a usury claim against a national bank.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Judge Varholak also summarized the holding in\n    <em>\n     Beneficial National Bank v.

Daniel of this Court in\n    <em>\n     Ace Cash\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    note 3, the Recommendation resolved the present issue in the same way. Emphasizing that \"the Administrator only asserts .... claims against [Avant],\" \"does not assert any claims against WebBank,\" and that \"the relief sought is related to the charges that [Avant has] imposed on the loans [it] purchased from WebBank\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 15), and after distinguishing cases and arguments advanced by Avant which are further addressed below, the Recommendation concluded that the \"Administrator's state law claims are directed against [Avant],\" which is not a state-chartered bank, and \"[t]he claims thus are not completely preempted by the FDIA, even if the Court were to find that complete preemption applies to usury claims against state-chartered banks\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 22).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Court is broadly persuaded by the analysis set out in the Recommendation, and, applying\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    review under rule 72(b), agrees with Judge Varholak's view of the applicable law, and adopts and affirms the Recommendation in its entirety.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Avant's Objections are Unavailing\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    In its Objection, Avant argues that Judge Varholak erred in four ways. Having reviewed the Motion, the Recommendation, Avant's Objection, and all of the related briefs, the Court organizes its further discussion by addressing each of Avant's four arguments in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Complete Preemption Under Section 27\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    a.\n    <em>\n     \"Any loan\n    </em>\n    ...\n    <em>\n     made\" by a Federally-Insured Bank\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Avant argues that the recommendation mis-applied the complete preemption doctrine inasmuch as Avant argues that Section 27 applies to \" 'any loan ... made' by a state-chartered bank\" and \"makes no distinction between a cause of action against\n    <em>\n     banks\n    </em>\n    versus one against 'non-bank defendants.' \" (ECF No. 69 at 4 (quoting 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831d ); emphasis in original.) Relatedly, Avant argues that under common law principles the assignee of a loan \"steps into the shoes of the assignor\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 5 (internal quotation marks\n    omitted) ), and thus \"the complete preemption of state usury law [by Section 27] survives the assignment of the loans ... to Avant,\" meaning that complete preemption should apply regardless of whether the loan \"is held by WebBank or assigned to Avant ... or its affiliates or any other third party\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 6). Thus, in Avant's view, it is immaterial whether a loan is presently \"held\" by a State-chartered bank, so long as it was originally \"made\" by such a bank.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    In support, Avant argues that the text of Section 27 \"makes no distinction between a cause of action against banks versus one against 'non-bank defendants,' \" and that an \"exclusive federal cause of action for bringing a usury claim\" is set out by Section 27 which \"is tied to the scope of preemption,\" and applicable to \" 'any loan ... made' by a state-chartered bank,\" regardless of whether another entity later acquires rights in the debt or loan. (ECF No. 69 at 5.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    However, while Avant's \"any loan ... made\" argument relies on isolating three words from the statute, the language of \u00a7 1831d as a whole defeats Avant's argument. Initially, the statute states its purpose is to prevent discrimination \"against State-chartered insured depository institutions,\" and does not, on its face, state any purpose with regard to institutions other than federally-insured banks, much less a Congressional intent to broadly foreclose state law actions or to permit removal to federal court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Further, and significantly, the relevant text of \u00a7 1831d(a) states that \"[a]\n    <em>\n     State bank\n    </em>\n    .... may, notwithstanding any State constitution or statute which is hereby preempted for the purposes of this section, ... charge on any loan ... or ... note ... or other evidence of debt, interest at a rate of not more than ... the rate allowed by the laws of the State ... where the bank is located.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831d(a).\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    This language\n    governs what charges a \"State bank\" may impose, but again, does not on its face regulate interest or charges that may be imposed by a non-bank, including one which later acquires or is assigned a loan made or originated by a state bank.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Moreover, the cause of action provided by \u00a7 1831d(b), does not on its face apply to actions against non-banks, instead providing a cause of action to \"the person who paid\" an excess rate of interest, who then \"may recover in a civil action ...\n    <em>\n     from such State bank\n    </em>\n    ....\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831d(b). Contrary to Avant's argument that the statute \"makes no distinction\" between banks and non-banks, and that its cause of action does not distinguish between bank and non-bank defendants, the statutory text in fact provides for recovery \"from [a] State bank,\" but is silent as to any remedy or recovery against a non-bank such as Avant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Under the first, and here dispositive, inquiry of the two-part complete preemption analysis, the cause of action provided by \u00a7 1831d(b) does not manifest a Congressional intent to allow removal of actions such as this one, which pleads only state law claims, brought against a non-bank entity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Devon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518537\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1195/#p1204\">\n     693 F.3d 1195\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Avant, however, has not made a showing that WebBank (or any other federally-insured bank) is the real party in interest, instead relying on the far broader argument that complete preemption applies in perpetuity to\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    assignee of loans originated\n    by WebBank. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 69 at 4-7.)\n    <em>\n     Vaden II\n    </em>\n    never stood for such a sweeping proposition, and the Court has already rejected Avant's argument that Section 27 creates complete preemption as to any non-bank assignee.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Thus, both Avant's emphasis on the \"contractual shifting of rights through an assignment\" and its reliance on\n    <em>\n     Vaden\n    </em>\n    are unavailing. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 69 at 9-10.) As with\n    <em>\n     Krispin\n    </em>\n    , to the extent complete preemption might depend on a real party in interest analysis, as conducted in\n    <em>\n     Vaden II\n    </em>\n    , the facts here must lead to the opposite result. Here, Avant is for all practical purposes in control of the Avant loans, and it has indemnified WebBank, whose role was short-lived and is now entirely in the past. In\n    <em>\n     Vaden II\n    </em>\n    , by contrast, the\n    <em>\n     bank\n    </em>\n    remained \"the party in charge of setting the terms and conditions,\" and the set the guidelines implemented by the affiliate servicing provider, which the bank also indemnified.

Thus, the Fourth Circuit itself does not apply\n    <em>\n     Vaden II\n    </em>\n    as standing for the broad proposition advanced by Avant, namely, that Section 27 completely preempts all usury claims \"as to loans originated by a state-chartered federally insured ban[k].\" (ECF No. 69 at 9.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    3.\n    <em>\n     True Lender\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Avant next objects that the Recommendation \"wrongly conclude[d] that allegations that a bank was not the 'true lender' are sufficient to defeat federal jurisdiction.\" (ECF No. 69 at 12.) Avant claims that the issue of whether it is the \"true lender\" \"is a purely legal question whether ... factual allegations in the complaint .... are legally sufficient to treat Avant as the 'true lender' notwithstanding that it did not make the loans,\" and argues that this question \"must be decided under federal law.\" (ECF No. 69 at 11-12.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The Court finds no error in the Recommendation's treatment of the Complaint's \"true lender\" allegations (ECF No. 6 \u00b6\u00b6 32-34), and finds, moreover, that this issue is not controlling of the Court's removal jurisdiction. The Court disagrees with Avant's characterization that the Recommendation treated the \"true lender\" issue as controlling or sufficient by itself to warrant remand. (\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 62 at 11-14.) Moreover, even if resolution of the Administrator's \"true lender\" allegations might support a\n    <em>\n     defense\n    </em>\n    of federal preemption (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , if Avant can disprove the allegations and prove that WebBank is in fact the true lender), and even if Avant is correct that this issue may ultimately be undisputed or could be determined a matter of law, the Court finds this at most gives rise to a preemption defense, but does not reflect complete preemption, nor\n    create a federal question permitting removal under the well-pleaded complaint rule.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Caterpillar\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p398\">\n     482 U.S. at 398-99\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p398\">\n     107 S.Ct. 2425\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Vaden III\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/\">\n     129 S.Ct. at 1272\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an actual or anticipated defense.\").

Defendants' Objection to the Recommendation (ECF No. 69) is OVERRULED;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    3.

Defendants' request for Oral Argument (ECF No. 66) and request for the Court to request briefing from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and/or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (ECF No. 69 at 10) are both DENIED. Given the extensive briefing and argument already submitted and available to the Court, and given the nearly uniform authority supporting the Recommendation's conclusions regarding complete preemption, the Court agrees with the Administrator that further argument or briefing would lead only to additional delay in resolving the Administrator's already long-pending Motion (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 74); and,\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    5.
