(\"Hopeman\" or \"Plaintiff\"), ECF No. 81. For the reasons stated below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   in part Defendants' motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 83, and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   in part Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, ECF No. 81. The Court reserves for later disposition the issue of whether certain asbestos-related claims fall into products/completed operations by default and the issue of whether the underlying policies have been exhausted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of a coverage dispute between Hopeman and its insurers\n   regarding numerous asbestos-related claims. From the 1930s until 2003, Hopeman specialized in the engineering, manufacture, and installation of marine interiors on ocean-going vessels. During this period, maritime standards required the use of fire-containing materials. To meet these requirements, Hopeman procured and installed several kinds of asbestos-containing panels. Since 1979, Hopeman has been named in over 123,000 claims alleging personal or bodily injury from exposure to asbestos fibers contained in marine interior materials provided by Hopeman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beginning in 1937, Hopeman purchased primary and, starting in 1965, excess general liability insurance coverage. During the relevant period of 1971 to 1977, Hopeman maintained multilayer insurance coverage. Hopeman's primary-layer policies were all issued by the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty\") for $500,000 in annual coverage (totaling $3 million in primary coverage from 1971 through 1977). Hopeman also obtained additional layers of excess insurance through annual policies issued by various excess insurers, including a number of policies issued by Defendants. From 1971 to 1974, Hopeman obtained two excess policies for $5 million in annual coverage from the Home Indemnity Company (\"Home\") and the Insurance Company of North America (\"INA\") for a combined total of $30 million in coverage. From 1974 to 1977, Hopeman acquired two further excess policies of $5 million in annual coverage from Liberty and the Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company (\"Aetna\") for an additional $30 million in excess coverage. For additional excess coverage, Hopeman maintained a \"quota share\" layer including Continental, Lexington, and North Star Reinsurance Corporation (\"North Star\"). This agreement provided for $10 million in combined annual limits above the $10 million underlying excess coverage and $500,000 primary insurance (totaling $60 million in excess coverage from 1971 to 1977). Lexington agreed to be responsible for half of each quota share limit ($30 million in total), Continental for 20% ($12 million) and North Star the remaining 30% ($18 million).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a result of numerous asbestos exposure claims, Hopeman has faced significant liability. These claims have in turn triggered the policies of Plaintiff's primary and excess-layer insurers, and Hopeman has received payments from or otherwise resolved coverage with all of the relevant insurers covering the 1971-77 period except Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2003, 2005, and 2009, Hopeman settled with Liberty, Aetna, and INA respectively. In 2013, Hopeman settled with the Insurance Commissioner of the State of New Hampshire as Liquidator of the Home. This settlement resolved Hopeman's claims against seven Home policies, and Hopeman ultimately assigned its rights under the Home policies to a third party. In all of the above-mentioned settlements, Hopeman agreed to modified pro rata allocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Van Epps Dep., Ex. 11 at 125:2-127:11, ECF No. 84-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In late 2012, Plaintiff notified the \"quota share\" excess insurers that the underlying 1974-77 policies were nearing exhaustion. In February 2013, Hopeman informed Defendants and the General Reinsurance Corporation (\"Gen Re\"), the successor to North Star, that the underlying policies had been exhausted, and requested that the \"quota share\" layer insurers immediately enter settlement negotiations. Soon thereafter, Hopeman began negotiations with Gen Re, resulting in a settlement on a modified pro rata basis in October 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between 2013 and December 2016, the Claro Group (\"Claro\"), Hopeman's agent, negotiated with Defendants' third-party administrator, Resolute Management Inc., regarding Defendants' policies. Hopeman asserts that Continental initially agreed to pay on its policies, making $355,823 in payments between December 2012 to April 2014, but that it terminated its participation in July 2014. Lexington, however, has never agreed to participate in any payments. In December 2016, the parties terminated further settlement negotiations after Resolute refused Plaintiff's latest settlement demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Hopeman filed a two-count complaint, alleging breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment regarding Defendants' alleged obligation to pay various asbestos-related claims.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. Specifically, Hopeman alleges that Defendants are in breach of contract for failing to reimburse Hopeman for claims related to Defendants' 1974-77 policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Hopeman also demands a declaratory judgment regarding Defendants' obligations to pay an \"all sums\" share of amounts incurred for asbestos-related claims arising during the 1971-77 policy periods, as well as \"all sums\" incurred in defense of such claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 9. In May 2017, Defendants filed their answers to the complaint. ECF Nos. 32, 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2017, Plaintiff filed its motion for partial summary judgment. ECF No. 81. Hopeman first requests summary judgment on two scope of coverage issues: (1) that the \"all sums\" allocation method applies to the policies,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   at 1; and (2) that the Lexington Policies provide defense coverage,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff next seeks a ruling that the underlying insurance of the 1974-77 policies has been exhausted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. For the 1971-74 policies, Hopeman requests summary judgment that Hopeman's payment of the Home policy's products/completed operations aggregate limit and the granting of an allowed claim in the Home insolvency satisfy the Home policy's limits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff then argues that summary judgment is appropriate on the following coverage issues: (1) that products/completed operations coverage applies by default for asbestos-related claims,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; (2) that \"bodily injury\" occurs for products/completed operations claims from the date of first exposure and continues thereafter,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3; and (3) that each individual alleging bodily injury from exposure to asbestos constitutes a separate \"occurrence\" under the policies,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Hopeman also requests summary judgment that the non-cumulation clauses only reduce Insurers' policy limits with respect to the same \"occurrence\" or \"loss\" as the one for which Hopeman seeks coverage, and only to the extent Hopeman has recovered for that same \"occurrence\" or \"loss\" under relevant prior insurance at the same \"layer\" or horizontal \"tier\" of coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Plaintiff further requests summary judgment that the term \"loss\" in several relevant non-cumulation clauses should be read narrowly, and that, in any case, the first $7 million of recovery from Defendants will be unaffected by the non-cumulation clauses because Hopeman has not previously recovered from prior insurance in the same tier or layer as the policies at issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Hopeman seeks a ruling that it has satisfied any duty to mitigate or avoid losses for asbestos-related claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants responded to Hopeman's motion in late November 2017, ECF No. 98, and Plaintiff filed a reply in December 2017, ECF No. 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In November 2017, Defendants also filed their motion seeking summary judgment on five issues. ECF No. 83. Defendants first argue that Plaintiff had previously evinced a belief that Defendants' policies required a \"pro rata\" allocation method, and therefore should not be permitted to\n   now seek \"all sums\" allocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Summ. J. Br. 2, 12-15, ECF No. 84. Second, Defendants claim that, even if an \"all sums\" allocation method applies, the prior insurance/non-cumulation provisions must be enforced to limit coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 15-20. Third, Defendants assert that they are under no obligation to pay the excess liability claims because the underlying policies are not exhausted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 20-23. The claims are allegedly not exhausted because Hopeman compromised its claims with certain insurers for less than the full limits of those policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Fourth, Defendants argue that Hopeman failed to comply with its obligation to allocate claims according to whether they were \"product\" or \"non-product\" claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-26. Accordingly, Defendants claim they are entitled to a ruling that this method of calculating the exhaustion of the underlying limits is incorrect as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Finally, Defendants claim that Hopeman is improperly seeking reimbursement of some defense costs. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-30. In November 2017, Hopeman filed a response to Defendants' motion, ECF No. 97, and in December 2017, Defendants filed a reply brief, ECF No. 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Having been fully briefed and considered by this Court, Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment and Defendants' motion for summary judgment are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CHOICE OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because the parties ask this Court to interpret the relevant insurance contracts, the Court must first determine which state's laws govern their interpretation. As a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction, the Court must apply the choice of law rules of the state in which it sits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec.

J. Br. at 7, 8; Defs.' Summ. J. Br. 10-12, ECF No. 84. At the time the policies were issued, Hopeman's headquarters was located in New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Summ. J. Br. 12. Hopeman's New York business address is listed on the policies, and it paid insurance premiums from that state.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=431%20S.E.2d%20289\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, Hopeman used brokers located in New York to procure the policies, and it corresponded with these brokers from New York.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=431%20S.E.2d%20289\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under Virginia's choice of law rules, these facts establish that the policies were written and delivered in New York, and therefore New York law governs their interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DECLARATORY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Federal Declaratory Judgment Act provides that, \"[i]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction,\" the district court \"may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In determining whether to issue a declaratory judgment, a district court should consider (1) whether such judgment \"will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue,\" and (2) whether it \"will terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Centennial Life Ins.

These issues are nearly identical to those of the breach-of-contract claim of the 1974-77 policies, and a declaration of rights under the non-triggered policies will obviate the need for further litigation construing such policies. While Defendants deny that Plaintiff's demanded relief is justified, they agree that a genuine dispute exists regarding these policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lexington's Answer \u00b6 35, ECF No. 32; Continental's Answer \u00b6 35, ECF No. 33.

The mere existence of some\n   <em>\n    alleged\n   </em>\n   factual dispute between the parties \"will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no\n   <em>\n    genuine\n   </em>\n   issue of\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

For this Court to reach a different conclusion regarding these NCCs, Defendants would have to point to some additional policy language or provisions that would indicate that the NCCs have a different meaning than those in\n   <em>\n    Viking Pump (NY)\n   </em>\n   . Defendants have failed to make such a showing, and therefore this Court is precluded from interpreting the NCCs differently from the New York Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With respect to Defendants' argument that, even if the policies might otherwise require all sums allocation, a ruling that such method applies would be premature before Hopeman identifies a loss or occurrence covered under each policy that is also covered under any other excess policy, the Court finds that this goes beyond what is necessary under\n   <em>\n    Viking Pump (NY)\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Viking Pump (NY)\n   </em>\n   court determined on the basis of the NCC language alone that \"all sums allocation is appropriate in policies containing such provisions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    27 N.Y.3d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    33 N.Y.S.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    52 N.E.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants have pointed to nothing in\n   <em>\n    Viking Pump (NY)\n   </em>\n   or any other subsequent case that demonstrates that a policyholder must show the existence of at least one long-tail claim before receiving a ruling on allocation method. Because the plain language of the NCCs reveals the parties' intent to use an all sums allocation, Plaintiff need not also demonstrate that there is a specific claim for each policy to receive a ruling that all sums allocation applies to the relevant long-tail claims arising under each policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Therefore, this Court finds, as a matter of New York contract law, that the NCCs' contractual language unambiguously requires an all sums allocation method for long-tail claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Whether Hopeman Should Be Bound to a Pro Rata Method\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants also claim that, regardless of whether the policies otherwise require all sums allocation, Hopeman should be held to a pro rata method based on its prior course of conduct. The precise theory upon which Defendants rely for this proposition is unclear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants cite several cases in which courts found that a party's prior course of conduct was relevant for establishing a \"practical construction\" of an ambiguous contract,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Summ. J. Br. 13-14, ECF No. 84, but Defendants explicitly deny offering a practical construction argument,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Summ. J. Reply Br. 8, ECF No. 110. They also fail to respond to the following arguments offered by Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (1) practical construction does not apply because the prior course of conduct was with parties other than Defendants; (2) practical construction only applies where a provision is ambiguous, and Defendants have not argued that the NCC is ambiguous; (3) Defendants cannot establish the requisite knowledge or acquiescence, because the prior conduct cannot be shown to be an interpretation of the policy language and New York law, rather than a reasonable resolution of disputed issues; and (4) in any case, Hopeman would only be bound to a\n   <em>\n    modified\n   </em>\n   pro rata method, because that is all it has agreed to with its insurers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Partial Summ. J. Br. 9-11, ECF No. 82. Based on Defendants' denial that they are offering a practical construction argument and their failure to rebut Plaintiff's arguments, the Court views any practical construction argument to have been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff also points out, and Defendants do not deny, that the insurers are not arguing that Hopeman is collaterally estopped.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Summ. J. Br. 10, ECF No. 97. In the absence of a practical construction or collateral estoppel theory, the Court construes Defendants' argument to be that, for reasons of fair dealing, Plaintiff should not be able to offer a position that is inconsistent with the one it has taken in settlement negotiations. This argument would be similar to that of judicial estoppel, where a party may be precluded as a matter of law from offering a position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same or related litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v. Herbert J. Thomas Mem'l Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615641\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/192/#p196\">\n    159 F.3d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196 (4th Cir. 1998). While the precise contours of judicial estoppel have not been clearly defined, one inquiry courts make in determining whether to preclude an inconsistent position is whether there is a reasonable explanation for a party's inconsistent positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18B Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 4477.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Construing Defendants' argument in this way, the Court finds Plaintiff's explanation, for why it has previously used a modified pro rata basis, to be reasonable. Hopeman notes that pro rata allocation was part of the terms of the Wellington Agreement that it entered in 1985 as part of an effort to resolve uncertainties as to how signatories' insurance would apply to asbestos claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Summ. J. Br. at 10, ECF No. 97. Several of Hopeman's paying insurers are Wellington signatories, and Hopeman's other insurers who are not Wellington signatories have been willing to accept the benefits of the modified pro rata approach rather than seeking to litigate their obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615641\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/192/#p196\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hopeman also points out that it has offered Defendants a settlement based on the modified pro rata approach, but that Defendants have refused this offer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. Based on these facts, it appears that Plaintiff has a reasonable explanation for why it has previously used a modified pro rata allocation method, and it thus does not appear that Plaintiff should be precluded from seeking an all sums allocation method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Whether Hopeman Has \"Opted Out\" of an All Sums Allocation by Settling with Other Insurers on a Pro Rata Basis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants also claim that Hopeman should be bound to a pro rata allocation method because \"by settling with other insurers on a pro rata basis and exhausting the underlying limits horizontally, Hopeman has opted out of an all sums allocation,\" Defs.'

Hopeman suggests that the Court should adopt the \"indisputably reasonable definition\" of \"loss\" from the Continental policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.

In addition, Plaintiff claims that the term \"loss,\" which is incorporated from the Home policy, should not be read as referring to similar losses from multiple claims. Pls.' Partial Summ. J.

Hopeman notes that when the Insurers intended to refer to \"losses\" resulting from multiple claims, they did so expressly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As evidence Plaintiff cites the Home policy's \"Loss Payable\" provision, which uses language about the submission of a request for payment of \"loss\" for a definite claim and submissions of future \"losses\" for the same occurrence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Johnson Ex. 8 at 1922, ECF No. 82-9). According to Hopeman, this demonstrates that the same \"occurrence\" can result in multiple \"losses,\" showing that the \"loss\" limitation in the Home policy is even narrower than the \"occurrence\" limitation of the other NCCs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants do not offer a preferred definition of the term \"loss,\" but they deny that it should be construed narrowly.

App. Div. 2015). One applicable dictionary definition of \"loss\" is \"the amount of an insured's financial detriment due to the occurrence of a stipulated contingent event (as death, injury, destruction, or damage) in such a manner as to charge the insurer with a liability under the terms of the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1338 (1993). This definition, which refers to the \"amount of an insured's financial detriment\" arising from covered events, is inherently broad and would include an insured's total liability arising from a particular category of harm. Additionally, the determiner \"any\" broadens the term \"loss\" such that it refers to all loss arising under a policy. Applying this plain and ordinary meaning to \"loss\" and \"any,\" the Court finds that the term \"any loss covered hereunder\" has a plain meaning that is broad enough to mean the gross amount that a policyholder is seeking in its claim under a policy. This conclusion is strengthened in particular for the 1971-74 Continental policy because it incorporates an \"ultimate net loss\" that, as in\n   <em>\n    Stimson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    New England Reinsurance\n   </em>\n   , demonstrates that \"loss\" is a broad term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   This Court's reading of this term is consistent with that of the\n   <em>\n    Stimson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    New England Reinsurance\n   </em>\n   courts mentioned above, and also that of the three other courts which have construed this same term in similar NCCs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Air &amp; Liquid Sys.

As to Hopeman's argument that because \"loss\" is written in the singular in the NCCs that it should therefore not be read to mean similar losses from multiple claims, the Court notes that the singular term \"loss\" can reasonably be referring to a single gross sum sought under a policy. Thus, there is no inconsistency, as Plaintiff asserts, in noting that the contract uses the term \"losses\" in reference to multiple \"payments\" in the Loss Payable provision, but that it uses the term \"loss\" in the NCC to refer to a single gross sum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Therefore, because this issue presents a question of contract interpretation for the Court, and because the Court finds that the term \"loss\" in the NCCs unambiguously refers to the gross amount Hopeman is seeking under each policy, summary judgment on this issue is warranted.\n   <em>\n    Seiden Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520802\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/425/#p428\">\n    959 F.2d at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Lexington Policy Follow Form Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Having described the general standards for construing follow form provisions, the Court now turns to interpret those provisions of the instant Lexington policies. This analysis begins with the language of each policy. Item 2 of the Declarations in the 1971-74 Lexington policy identifies the policy's \"Underlying Umbrella Insurers\" as the \"Home Insurance Company-Policy No. to be advised\" and \"Varuous [sic] Companies and Policies.\" Ex. 5 at 2611, ECF No. 84-5. Endorsement # 1 in the 1974-77 policy identifies the Underlying Umbrella Insurers as \"(a) Liberty Mutual-Various\" and \"(b) Aetna C &amp; S.\" Ex. 7 at 2636, ECF No. 84-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Each Lexington policy contains the same definition of coverage, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   The Company hereby agrees, subject to the limitations, terms and conditions hereinafter mentioned, to indemnify the Assured for all sums which the Assured shall be obliged to pay by reason of the liability ... [c]aused by or arising out of each occurrence happening anywhere in the world, and arising out of the hazards covered by and\n   <strong>\n    as defined in the Underlying Umbrella Policies stated in Item 2 of the Declarations and issued by the \"Underlying Umbrella Insurers.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Ex. 5 at 2614, ECF No. 84-5; Ex. 7 at 2641, ECF No. 84-7 (emphasis added). Both policies also feature a Maintenance of Underlying Umbrella Insurance provision, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    This Policy is subject to the same terms, definitions, exclusions and conditions (except as regards the premium, the amount and limits of liability and except as otherwise provided herein) as are contained in or as may be added to the Underlying Umbrella Policies stated in Item 2 of the Declarations\n   </strong>\n   prior to the happening of an occurrence for which claim is made hereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Ex. 5 at 2615 (emphasis added); Ex. 7 at 2642. Outside of the above-cited provisions, the Lexington policies do not otherwise clarify the follow form provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Based on this language, the Court reaches several conclusions. First, the Lexington policies fail to designate an \"immediate underlying insurer\" or to establish that the immediately underlying insurer is the followed policy. Second, the policies do not indicate any other criteria for determining which underlying policy is to be followed. The language in the Maintenance of Underlying Umbrella Insurance and the Coverage provisions simply states that the policies incorporate the terms, conditions, and exclusions of the policies of the \"Underlying\n   Umbrella Insurers.\" Third, the policy language establishes that the policies follow form to the underlying policies only to the extent that they are consistent with the Lexington policies. See Ex. 5 at 2615 (stating the policy incorporates the terms of the underlying policies \"except as otherwise provided herein\"); Ex. 7 at 2642 (same). The Second Circuit has held that such language establishes a clear intent to have the excess policy's terms control in case of a conflict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538618\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/902/1111/#p1113\">\n    902 F.2d at 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding under New York law that a follow form provision that stated that the following policy was \"subject to the same warranties, terms and conditions (except as otherwise provided herein) as are contained in ... the Underlying Coverage\" meant that the terms of the excess policy governed in case of a conflict).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   While the Lexington policies do not contain any language clarifying which of the underlying policies should prevail if their terms conflict, Lexington argues that one can infer the priority from the underlying policies themselves. Lexington points to language in the 1971-74 INA and 1974-77 Aetna policies in which they respectively list the Home and Liberty Umbrella policies as sitting under the INA and Aetna policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   INA policy, Ex. F at 76, 79, ECF No. 1-6 (stating that the INA policy is excess of the Home Insurance Company policy); Aetna Policy, Johnson Ex. 11 at 1972, ECF No. 82-12 (listing Aetna as excess of the Liberty Mutual policy). Lexington argues that this establishes that the INA and Aetna policies are the \"immediate underlying policies.\" Defs.' Opp'n to Partial Summ. J. Br. 22; Defs.' Summ. J. Br. 27. Even if this were true, the Lexington policies do not specify that the immediate underlying policies govern in the case of a conflict. As mentioned above, there are numerous possible ways that a following form policy can designate which policy should be followed, and the immediate underlying policy is not by default the followed policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3 Thomas,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615641\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/192/#p196\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615641\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/192/#p196\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 29A.02. In the absence of a provision designating that the immediately underlying policy is to be followed, the Court declines to read such a provision into the policies. Thus, the Court finds that the 1971-74 policy follows form equally to both the Home and INA policies and that the 1974-77 policy follows form equally to the Aetna and Liberty Umbrella policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether the 1971-74 Lexington Policy Includes Defense Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Court next turns to the question of whether the underlying policies of the 1971-74 Lexington policy include defense coverage. The INA policy provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   C. The insurance afforded by this certificate shall follow that of the primary insurance\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   (1) anything in this certificate or the primary insurance to the contrary notwithstanding,\n   <em>\n    INA shall not be obligated to assume charge of the settlement or defense of any claim or suit brought or proceeding instituted against the Insured.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Ex. F at 2, ECF No. 1-6 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   This language establishes that the INA policy does not include a duty to defend. However, the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify,\n   <em>\n    Cont'l Cas. Co. v. Employers Ins.

The 1971-74 Lexington policy provides that \"it is expressly agreed that liability shall attach to the Company only after the Underlying Umbrella Insurers have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of their respective\n   <em>\n    ultimate net loss\n   </em>\n   liability\" and that the \"Company shall then be liable to pay only the excess thereof up to a further\n   <em>\n    ultimate net loss\n   </em>\n   in all in [sic] respect of each occurrence\". Ex. C at 40-41, ECF No. 1-3 (emphasis added). The term \"ultimate net loss\" is not defined in the Lexington policy, but it incorporates a definition from the Home Policy, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   The term \"Ultimate Net Loss\" shall mean the total sum which the Insured, or any company as his insurer, or both, become obligated to pay by reason of personal injury, property damage or advertising liability claims,\n   <em>\n    either through adjudication or compromise\n   </em>\n   , and shall also include hospital, medical, and funeral charges and all sums paid as salaries, compensation fees, charges and law costs, premiums on attachment or appeal bonds, interest, expenses for doctors, lawyers, nurses and investigators and other persons, and\n   <em>\n    for litigation, settlement, adjustment and investigation of claims and suits which are paid as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder\n   </em>\n   , excluding only the salaries of the Insured's or of any underlying insurer's permanent employees. The Company shall not be liable for expenses as aforesaid when such expenses are included in other valid and collectible insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Ex. E at 64-65, ECF No. 1-5 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   This language unambiguously provides that defense costs are only covered if (1) they are \"paid as a consequence\" of a covered occurrence and (2) the fact that an occurrence is covered has been established \"through adjudication or compromise.\" The ultimate net loss provision of the Home policy, which the 1971-74 Lexington policy incorporates, therefore excludes those defense costs associated with unsuccessful suits that either fail at trial or that do not result in settlement. New York courts have described policies with similar language as providing that the obligation to reimburse defense costs follows the indemnity obligations as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Stonewall Ins.

The insurers do not argue, however, that the\n   <em>\n    Keasbey\n   </em>\n   approach would apply. Instead, their analysis of the amount owed is premised on the idea that coverage is triggered by exposure. Troy Belting does not appear to dispute that the trigger event is exposure.

In light of the long-standing approach under New York law of treating the trigger of coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury as a question of fact to be determined on a case-by-case\n   basis, and in light of Defendants' failure to show that\n   <em>\n    Keasbey\n   </em>\n   altered this approach, the Court rejects Defendants' position that this Court is bound by the injury-in-fact findings featured in\n   <em>\n    Keasbey\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   While the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Keasbey\n   </em>\n   does not establish a definition for asbestos-related \"bodily injury\" applicable to all courts applying New York law to insurance contracts, the Court cannot agree with Plaintiff that\n   <em>\n    Keasbey\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because its \"bodily injury\" determination was restricted to \"operations\" claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Partial Summ.

Prior to describing its findings regarding trigger of coverage, the\n   <em>\n    Keasbey\n   </em>\n   court stated it was answering the following question: \"what constitutes sufficient bodily injury to trigger coverage.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5728671\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/60/128/#p142\">\n    871 N.Y.S.2d at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Defendants rightly point out, the only distinction the\n   <em>\n    Keasbey\n   </em>\n   court made regarding bodily injury for operations claims was in regards to the timing of the injury, not the nature of the injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-64. One other consideration that leads this Court to reject Plaintiff's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Keasbey\n   </em>\n   is that the Court has been unable to find any authority showing that any other injury-in-fact jurisdiction applies a different \"bodily injury\" standard for operations claims as opposed to products/completed operations claims. This makes sense in light of the fact that the insurance contracts that the Court is aware of do not use different language when describing bodily injuries that arise in one category as opposed to another. Because Plaintiff has pointed to no contractual language that shows that bodily injury changes based on whether a claim arises from operations or products/completed operations, and because the Court believes Plaintiff misconstrues\n   <em>\n    Keasbey\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that the contractual language in these policies does not unambiguously establish that injury-in-fact differs by whether a claim falls into either \"products/completed operations\" or \"operations\" coverage. Hopeman is therefore not entitled to summary judgment on that issue,\n   <em>\n    Seiden Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520802\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/425/#p428\">\n    959 F.2d at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's request for summary judgment on that issue. ECF No. 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Hopeman also requests summary judgment that its preferred injury-in-fact trigger applies to the contracts. Pl.'s Mot. Partial Summ. J. 2-3, ECF No. 81. However, because the injury-in-fact trigger involves a factual question that must be decided on the basis of the medical evidence presented in a case, summary judgment on this issue is premature. Though Hopeman entreats this Court to presume that the medical evidence to be presented in this case will be as convincing as that seen by the\n   <em>\n    ITT Cannon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Viking Pump (Del.)\n   </em>\n   courts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Partial Summ.

Therefore the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's request for summary judgment that, as to one \"who ultimately develops lung cancer, mesothelioma, or nonmalignant asbestos-related disease, bodily injury first occurs, for policy purposes, upon cellular and molecular damage caused by asbestos inhalation, and such cellular and molecular damage occurs during each and every period of an asbestos claimant's significant exposure to asbestos and continues thereafter.\" ECF No. 81.

Defendants argue that, because the Home Insurance Company-which became insolvent in 2003-has not made actual payment of the insurance limits, the contractual language from the 1971-74 Continental and Lexington policies requiring \"payment\" of the underlying limits cannot be satisfied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520802\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/425/#p428\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff replies that the underlying limits of the Continental and Lexington 1971-74 policies may be exhausted either by payment by Hopeman of an amount equivalent to the underlying limits or by Home's having been \"found liable to pay\" its underlying limits.

Whether the Home Policy Can Be Exhausted for Purposes of the 1971-74 Lexington Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   As to the 1971-74 Lexington policy, the above-cited cases are persuasive for the proposition that the Lexington policy can only be exhausted either by actual payment of the Home policy limits by the Home or by the Home being held liable to pay its underlying limits. The Lexington policy states that coverage attaches only after \"\n   <em>\n    the Underlying Umbrella Insurers have paid\n   </em>\n   or have been held liable to pay the full amount of their respective ultimate net loss liability[.]\" Ex. C at 40, ECF No. 1-3 (emphasis added).

The Court therefore finds that this language unambiguously designates the underlying insurer as the party to make any requisite payments. The only remaining question for the Lexington policy is whether Home was \"held liable to pay the full amount\" of its limits during its liquidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Home was held liable to pay its limits when Home's liquidator recommended a $15 million claim be\n   allowed to Hopeman, which was ordered allowed in January 2014.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347607\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/766/#p769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As other courts have observed, the policy language \"has paid or been held liable to pay\" contemplates a scenario in which an underlying insurer is \"liable but the insurer for some reason has not paid.

Thus, an order adjudicating the liability of an insolvent insurer is one of the ways by which an underlying insurer may be \"held liable to pay\" its policy limits. The Home policy would therefore be exhausted for purposes of the Lexington policy if Hopeman can show that Home was held liable to pay the full limits of the 1971-74 policy (totaling $15 million) during its liquidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   At oral argument on the instant motions, Plaintiff's counsel submitted documents previously produced in discovery that purportedly show that the $15 million claim was allowed only in reference to the instant Home policy. The first document submitted was titled \"Proof of Claim,\" and it clearly shows that Hopeman only requested a total of $15 million from Home in the liquidation proceedings. Plaintiff's counsel also submitted an internal PowerPoint from the Claro Group titled \"Hopeman Brothers, Inc.: Home Insurance Company Claim Presentation\" that was apparently presented in February 2013. Plaintiff's counsel claimed that this document demonstrates that Hopeman had not made any claims on any other Home policy by the time it submitted its proof of claim. Plaintiff's counsel also submitted a chart showing all of Hopeman's commercial general liability insurance policies. The chart demonstrates that Hopeman had seven policies (including the instant policy) from the Home which have combined limits of approximately $98 million. The chart also shows that Hopeman's six other policies all have attachment points above $40 million. Plaintiff's counsel claimed that the $15 million allowed claim reflected the Home liquidator's assumption that the other six policies were in such high coverage tiers that they would never be reached. In light of these documents, Plaintiff asserts that the $15 million allowed claim should be seen as a determination that Home was held liable to pay the $15 million limits of the instant policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Even with these supporting documents before it, the Court finds that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the allowed claim was made solely with regard to the instant Home policy. As Defendants point out, the claim allowed was made to resolve Hopeman's claims against\n   <em>\n    all seven\n   </em>\n   Home policies. Defs.' Summ. J. Reply Br. at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, Ex. 16 at 3038, ECF No. 87-6 (noting the seven different policies whose liability was resolved by the agreement). While Hopeman may claim that the other policies were in such high tiers that they likely would never have been reached, Hopeman's documents suggest otherwise. As Defendants' counsel noted at oral argument, the Claro Group claims presentation PowerPoint from February 2013 indicates that Hopeman anticipated hundreds of millions in additional asbestos-related costs by 2047. It thus appears that Hopeman may reasonably have believed that these tiers could eventually have been reached, and therefore the $15 million claim may have been allowed in light of the combined limits of approximately $98 million that Hopeman would have been entitled to under the Home policies. Thus, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n   Home has been \"held liable to pay\" the full limits of its 1971-74 policy, and consequently the Court cannot grant summary judgment that the Home policy is exhausted with respect to the Lexington policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's request for summary judgment that Home has been \"held liable to pay\" its limits, ECF No. 81, and also\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment to Defendants that the Home policy cannot be exhausted with respect to the Lexington policy.

Whether Hopeman May Fill the Gap for the 1971-74 Continental Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The Court turns next to address whether Hopeman may fill the gap with respect to the 1971-74 Continental policy. As previously noted, the Continental policy includes no language requiring the \"underlying insurer\" to make the requisite payments. The policy simply states that Continental will \"indemnify the insured for the amount of\n   <strong>\n    loss\n   </strong>\n   which is in excess of the applicable limits of liability of the underlying insurance[,]\" where loss is defined as \"\n   <strong>\n    the sums paid\n   </strong>\n   as damages ... for which the insured is legally liable[.]\" Ex. A at 12, ECF No. 1-1 (emphasis in original). This policy language is less specific than in any of the above-cited cases. If the Court were only looking to this language, the\n   <em>\n    Maximus\n   </em>\n   court's analysis would be the most applicable and would lead to the conclusion that such language is ambiguous as to whether Hopeman can fill the gap. However, the 1971-74 Continental policy incorporates a provision from the Home policy that clarifies the Continental policy's initial ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Defendants have explicitly admitted that the Continental policy incorporates the Home policy's Loss Payable provision. Ex. 2 at 7, ECF No. 83-2. The Loss Payable provision states that liability will not attach until \"\n   <em>\n    the Insured, or the Insured's underlying insurer\n   </em>\n   , shall have paid the amount of the underlying limits.\" Home Policy, Ex. E at 66, ECF No. 1-5. The disjunctive use of \"or\" in this provision plainly contemplates payment by either the insured or the underlying insurer to exhaust the policy's limits. The Continental policy, which has no language regarding which party is required to make payment, also does not conflict with the Loss Payable provision. The presence of this incorporated Loss Payable provision thus unambiguously demonstrates that the 1971-74 Continental policy may be exhausted through payment by Hopeman up to the underlying limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Although neither party specifically addressed the import of the Home policy's Loss Payable provision in their briefs, the Court addressed this issue with the parties at oral argument on the instant motions. At oral argument, the Court asked the parties about whether this provision would alter the Continental policy's ambiguity as to whether Hopeman could fill the gap. Plaintiff's counsel replied enthusiastically, claiming it bolstered Hopeman's argument that it could fill the gap. Counsel for Defendants did not explicitly concede that this provision alters the Continental policy, but argued that, even if it did, there is no evidence that Hopeman has made payments that exhaust the Home policy. Defense counsel did not, however, present any reasons for why the Loss Payable provision would not permit Hopeman to fill the gap. In the absence of any compelling reason to find that the Loss Payable provision otherwise conflicts with the 1971-74 Continental policy, the Court finds that it is incorporated and governs the issue of whether Hopeman may fill the gap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Numerous other courts interpreting identical or similar provisions to the above Loss Payable provision have held that they establish that exhaustion may be satisfied either by the insured or the underlying\n   insurer.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Defendants, however, have provided no evidence that plausibly establishes that Hopeman could have been seeking to avoid the application of the NCCs when it settled with the other insurers. In order to have \"manipulated the claims,\" Hopeman would have had to predict years ahead of time all of the following: (1) that New York law would later recognize that the all sums allocation method and vertical exhaustion apply to policies with NCCs; (2) that New York law would later clarify that only payments made by prior policies in the same tier of coverage as the policy with the NCC are counted for purposes of applying the NCC; (3) that Defendants would refuse a settlement on a modified pro rata basis; and (4) that settling on a modified pro rata basis with other insurers would result in preventing the triggering of prior policies in the same tier as Defendants' policies. The Court finds utterly implausible the allegation that Hopeman was clairvoyant in acting as it did and \"manipulated the claims.\" Thus, the Court is not persuaded that it should alter the application of the NCCs in order to mitigate the effect of any alleged claim manipulation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    \"Under New York law, courts will give effect to general liability policy language specifying that coverage is triggered by bodily injury 'during the policy period,' by requiring the policyholder to show that an 'injury-in-fact,' i.e., an actual rather than a presumed injury, occurred during the policy period.\" 2 Dunham,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 18.03 [3] [a]. \"In the toxic tort context, complex medical evidence often must be presented to prove the timing of an injury-in-fact before an insurer will be required to indemnify against a particular loss.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    The 1971-74 Continental and Lexington policies incorporate several definitions from the Home policy.
