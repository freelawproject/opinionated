BIANCO, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff John Doe (\"plaintiff\") brings the instant action against defendants United States Merchant Marine Academy (the \"Academy\"), James A. Helis, individually and in his capacity as Superintendent of the Academy, the United States Department of Transportation, and the United States of America (collectively, \"defendants\" or the \"government\"). Plaintiff claims that defendants improperly and unlawfully suspended him as a result of an unfavorable determination at a hearing at the Academy (the \"Hearing\"), thereby barring him from completing his final term and graduating with his class. Plaintiff claims that his Hearing and suspension violated the Academy's own rules under the Administrative Procedure Act (the \"APA\"), and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiff argues that he is, therefore, entitled to equitable and injunctive relief,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff now seeks a preliminary injunction that would compel the Academy to immediately reinstate plaintiff, permitting him to complete his third-term courses, sit for his licensing examination, and attend the Class of 2018 graduation ceremony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on his APA claim, or on his claim that defendants violated his procedural and substantive due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With respect to the APA claim, the Court concludes that the Academy's disciplinary proceeding was conducted in a manner that is consistent with the rules and procedures promulgated by the Superintendent pursuant to the authority delegated to him by statute. Although plaintiff argues that various procedures were inconsistent with the Academy's existing rules and policies (including, among other things, proceeding by a Superintendent's Hearing instead of an Executive Board Hearing, and requiring plaintiff to cross-examine the alleged victim through written questions asked by the Superintendent), the Court disagrees. In addition, the Court finds unpersuasive plaintiff's argument that the Superintendent applied the wrong\n   standard in determining whether the alleged victim consented because there is no indication in the record of any such misunderstanding. Moreover, there is substantial evidence in the record, if credited by the Superintendent (including the testimony of the alleged victim of the sexual assault, as well as plaintiff's friend who was present at various times on the night of the alleged assault), to support the Superintendent's decision. In particular, based upon the alleged victim's testimony, there is more than sufficient evidence in the record for the Superintendent to have concluded that she was unable to lawfully consent to sexual activity because of her intoxication. Although plaintiff's testimony contradicted the alleged victim's testimony, and plaintiff also called other witnesses at the Superintendent's Hearing who supported his version of events (and plaintiff emphasized that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office did not initiate charges after conducting an investigation), the Superintendent was entitled to weigh that evidence and make the necessary credibility findings in connection with the charges. Having carefully reviewed the record, the Court does not believe that plaintiff can possibly show that the decision was arbitrary or capricious (or contrary to law) based upon the manner in which the disciplinary proceeding was conducted or the evidence adduced at that proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court also concludes that plaintiff is not likely to succeed on his procedural due process claims. Plaintiff was provided with the following: (1) notice of the charges against him; (2) the right to review the investigatory file; (3) a Superintendent's Hearing during which, although plaintiff had to conduct the Hearing himself, he had the assistance of counsel and a faculty advisor; (4) at the Hearing (which lasted approximately twelve hours and involved eleven witnesses in connection with whether the charges were proven in Phase I), plaintiff was given the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses directly (with the exception of the alleged victim of the sexual assault, for whom he submitted written questions, and follow-up questions, to be asked by the Superintendent), and to testify and to call his own witnesses; and (5) an opportunity to give an opening and closing statement at the Hearing. Based upon well-settled Second Circuit precedent regarding due process requirements in the context of a disciplinary proceeding of this nature, and the Court's careful review of the record before it (including a review of the proceeding itself), the Court concludes that the due process protections afforded to plaintiff at the Hearing were more than sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standard under the Fifth Amendment in this type of disciplinary proceeding. Although plaintiff argues that due process required additional protections, the Court disagrees and emphasizes that due process does not mandate the use of all of the protections of a criminal trial in this type of disciplinary proceeding. To the extent that plaintiff challenges the implementation of the procedures at the Hearing (including the manner in which the Hearing was conducted, such as the number and length of breaks), the Court is not persuaded that any of those purported issues, either individually or collectively, rises to a constitutional magnitude or impacts the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. For example, the Court concludes that plaintiff's allegations of unconstitutional bias by the Superintendent in his dual role as prosecutor and neutral decision-maker are not supported by the case law or the record. Accordingly, plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits in connection with his procedural due process claims. For the same reasons, the Court concludes that plaintiff is unlikely to prevail under the exacting standard for demonstrating\n   a substantive due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In light of the Court's determination that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to any of his claims, he is not entitled to a preliminary injunction. Accordingly, the Court denies the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following facts are taken from the complaint, as well as the parties' submissions to the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A. The Statutory and Regulatory Framework\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the allegations in this case arise from a Hearing held by the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. The Academy is a federal institution operated by the Maritime Administration (\"MARAD\"), which is an operating administration of the Department of Transportation. (Def. Mem. at 3.) Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051301\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 51301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to maintain the Academy as an institution of higher education to prepare its students for service in the U.S. Merchant Marine, among other objectives.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051301\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 51301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Secretary of Transportation delegated authority to carry out its functions under this provision to the MARAD Administrator,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.93\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , who, in turn, delegated direction and supervision of the Academy to the Academy's Superintendent. (Def. Mem. at 3 (citing Maritime Administrative Order, 150-1).) The Academy's operation and maintenance is governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051301\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 51301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and regulations promulgated thereunder. Section 51318 establishes that the Superintendent is required to \"prescribe a policy on sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking applicable to the cadets and other personnel of the Academy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051318\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 51318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This provision sets forth the \"[m]atters to be specified in the policy,\" including \"a procedure for disciplinary action in cases of alleged criminal sexual assault involving a cadet or other Academy personnel,\" and \"any other sanction to be imposed in a substantiated case of sexual harassment, dating violence ... or any other criminal sexual offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051318\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Superintendent has also been delegated the authority to issue \"all regulations necessary for the accomplishment of the Academy's mission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.67\">\n    46 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pursuant to this statutory grant of authority, the Superintendent has promulgated policies and procedures governing sexual misconduct, including policies aimed at prevention, raising awareness, and conducting disciplinary actions. These regulations include Superintendent Instruction 2016-02 (\"SI 2016-02\"), which is the Academy's \"Sexual Assault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking, Prevention Education, and Response Policy\" (ECF No. 14-1 (\"SI 2016-02\") ), and Midshipman Regulations paragraphs 243(a) and (b) (ECF No. 3 at 48).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paragraph 243 prohibits\n   sexual misconduct, which paragraph 243(a) defines as \"acts at the Academy ... or under circumstances that are discrediting to the Academy or the midshipman, or are prejudicial to good order and discipline in the Regiment of Midshipmen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Paragraph 243(b) states that sexual misconduct includes \"any actions of a sexual nature that would reasonably excite or satisfy the sexual desires of the actor ... includ[ing] kissing, touching, sexual intercourse of any sort, ... and indecent exposure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   SI 2016-02 provides that the Academy \"may pursue an administrative investigation and disciplinary proceedings\" against an accused midshipman pursuant to the Midshipman Regulations or the Academy's \"Procedures for Superintendent's Disciplinary Hearing in the Case of Sexual Assault/Harassment\" (the \"SA/SH Procedures\"). (SI 2016-02 at 5.) Under these policies, the Academy can conduct either a Superintendent's Disciplinary Hearing or an Executive Board Hearing, as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . In Superintendent's Hearings (the type of hearing at issue in this case), midshipmen have a right to appeal the Superintendent's decision to the Maritime Administrator\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the penalty imposed is disenrollment. (ECF No. 14-2 (\"SA/SH Procedures\") at 2, 5.) Otherwise, midshipmen can request the Superintendent's reconsideration of his decision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the SA/SH Procedures do not provide a right to appeal to the Maritime Administrator where any other penalty was imposed (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under the APA, a midshipman can seek judicial review of an Academy Hearing decision once it is \"final\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and there is\n   \"no other adequate remedy in a court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B. The Complaint\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The following allegations are taken from the complaint filed by plaintiff in the instant action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   1. The Alleged Misconduct\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Academy held the Hearing at issue in this case to decide whether plaintiff had violated the Academy's sexual assault policy, in response to allegations following the Academy's annual Ring Dance the previous summer. (Compl. \u00b6 19.) Every August, the midshipmen in the rising senior class receive their class rings during a formal ceremony, and the Academy holds the Ring Dance to celebrate this milestone event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff, a member of the Academy's Class of 2018, attended the Ring Dance for his class on August 12, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Midshipmen typically attend this dance with dates and, as plaintiff did not have one, a friend (the \"Friend\") suggested that he could set plaintiff up with his date's sister. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 23.) The Friend told plaintiff that the sister (the \"Complainant\") was \"hotter\" than his own date, and conveyed his interest in a sexual relationship with her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff accepted the Friend's offer to arrange the date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Academy is located on Long Island and, as the dance was held in Manhattan, plaintiff arranged to stay in a hotel near the venue-as many midshipmen do-the night of the dance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25.) The Friend had also arranged to stay in Manhattan that night, as well as the night before, and was sharing a room with Complainant and her sister (his date). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) The night before the dance, plaintiff met the Friend and their dates for drinks at a bar in midtown, where he met Complainant for the first time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff and Complainant spent time together that night and had alcoholic drinks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to the complaint, the next night-the night of the dance, plaintiff and the Friend checked into separate rooms at a different hotel from the one where the Friend had stayed the night before, with Complainant and her sister again staying in the Friend's room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Prior to the dance, plaintiff and the Friend purchased and drank wine together, but Complainant did not have any. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) At the venue, plaintiff and Complainant presented photo identification demonstrating that they were over twenty-one to get a wristband for free drinks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Complainant, who was eighteen years old, allegedly presented false identification that the Friend helped her obtain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff and Complainant spent several hours at the dance together. As is tradition, plaintiff kissed Complainant on the cheek at the end of the Ring Dipping Ceremony during the dance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 34.) Later in the night, plaintiff and Complainant were seen dancing \"provocatively\" and kissing, and no one tried to stop them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Complainant allegedly initiated the kissing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the dance, plaintiff and Complainant spent time together on the Friend's hotel room balcony with a group of midshipmen and their dates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-38.) According to the complaint, plaintiff and Complainant were not drinking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) At the end of the night, Complainant told her sister and the Friend that she intended to sleep in plaintiff's room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff\n   was not part of this conversation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The sister and the Friend expressed their disapproval, but neither they nor anyone else did anything more to stop her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) The Friend told plaintiff not to engage in sexual intercourse with Complainant because she was too intoxicated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) According to the complaint, plaintiff had not planned to and agreed that he would not have sexual intercourse with Complainant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Complainant took her suitcase, and she and plaintiff left for her room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It is further alleged that, as soon as plaintiff and Complainant entered plaintiff's hotel room, Complainant began kissing plaintiff, and then initiated sexual contact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) She allegedly \"made it clear through her words and actions she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with Plaintiff, was consenting ..., and had the mental capacity to consent, including without limitation by telling Plaintiff to put on a condom.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Plaintiff asserts that he had not anticipated having sexual intercourse with Complainant, so he did not have a condom with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) According to the complaint, \"at the Complainant's behest\" plaintiff purchased a condom from a kit in the hotel room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff and Complainant had sexual intercourse then and a second time that night, after Complainant allegedly initiated by positioning herself on top of plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Plaintiff asserts that the second time they had intercourse, \"[a]gain, through her words and actions Complainant made it clear to [him] that she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with him, was consenting ... and had the mental capacity to consent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Complainant then changed into clothing to sleep and slept in the bed with plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   According to the complaint, in the morning, Complainant and plaintiff stayed in bed talking and cuddling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Complainant added herself as a \"friend\" to plaintiff's Snapchat account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Friend texted plaintiff to say he needed assistance tidying the balcony in his room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Complainant jokingly said to plaintiff that she would be sick if they had to go clean, which plaintiff texted to the Friend, but the two decided to return to the Friend's room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Complainant had also texted her sister to inform her of what had happened the night before and, within a few minutes, the Friend texted plaintiff to say he knew he had had sexual intercourse with Complainant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.) According to the complaint, Complainant had not given plaintiff any reason to think she was upset. In addition to adding herself to his Snapchat account, before leaving, Complainant allegedly told plaintiff she had had a good time and hugged him goodbye. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Later that night, the Friend accused plaintiff of sexually assaulting Complainant, claiming that she had been too intoxicated to consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Over the course of the next several weeks, the Friend and Complainant started dating. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In October 2017, Complainant's mother contacted law enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) According to the complaint, Complainant was \"adamant\" that she did not want to file charges, but her mother and others pressured her to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Complainant called plaintiff twice several months after the Ring Dance to ask what had happened that night, claiming not to remember. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Law enforcement arranged and recorded those phone calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2. The Investigation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to the complaint, the Academy was notified of the alleged sexual assault in October 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Allegedly, the Friend, Complainant's new boyfriend, pressured her to file a complaint with the\n   Academy, and first reported the allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 54.) According to the Superintendent, Complainant's mother first reported the alleged sexual assault to the Academy. (Decl. of James A. Helis (\"Helis Decl.\") \u00b6 9.) The initial report was then referred to the Director of the Academy's Department of Public Safety, Jeffrey Thomas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 55.) Thomas then contacted Complainant's mother, who described the allegations and informed him that the matter had been reported to law enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On November 1, 2017, Thomas met with the detective in the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") assigned to investigate the complaint (the \"Detective\") and a Special Agent from the Department of Transportation Inspector General's Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) That day, Thomas also contacted Complainant's mother to arrange an interview with Complainant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Rather than agree to the interview, on November 3, 2017, Complainant's mother responded with an emailed, unsigned, unsworn statement that was allegedly from her daughter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 9, 2017, Thomas conducted a phone interview with Complainant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) He asked follow-up questions, but did not go through each of her allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This phone interview was the only time Thomas spoke with Complainant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Also on November 9, 2017, the Detective informed Thomas that Complainant and her mother contacted him about bringing criminal charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) The Detective requested that Thomas not interview plaintiff until the Detective had spoken with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 13, 2017, the Detective interviewed plaintiff at the Academy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Thomas was present throughout the interview. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was not informed that the Academy was also conducting an investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Detective read plaintiff his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, and plaintiff waived his right to remain silent and voluntarily submitted to the Detective's questioning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) Plaintiff did not have counsel, an advisor, or his parents present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff asserts that he answered all questions and was honest and forthright. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the complaint, he \"never wavered\" regarding what happened the night of the Ring Dance, insisting that Complainant was \"a willing, active and consenting participant in all sexual activity, and at times was the aggressor,\" and noting that she had asked him to get a condom and positioned herself on top of him to initiate sex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Plaintiff was also firm about the fact that Complainant was not too intoxicated, had the mental capacity to, and did, in fact, consent to all sexual activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   3. The Notice of Disciplinary Charges\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On January 10, 2018, the Academy provided plaintiff with a \"Notice of Superintendent's Disciplinary Hearing\" (the \"Notice\") that directed plaintiff to appear for a hearing on January 19, 2018, and outlined the charges against him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-70; ECF No. 3-1\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 3.) The Notice stated\n   that plaintiff was charged with violating Superintendent Instruction 2016-02 and Midshipman Regulations paragraphs 243(a) and (b) by sexually assaulting his date to the Ring Dance at a hotel in New York City after the dance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Notice also stated that plaintiff was charged with violating Midshipman Regulations paragraph 204(f) by failing to prevent Complainant, who was underage, from drinking unlawfully or irresponsibly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In addition to listing the charges against plaintiff, the Notice included a list of eleven witnesses that the Academy \"may\" call at the Hearing, a list of plaintiff's rights prior to and at the Hearing, the SA/SH Procedures, the Academy's \"Investigation Report,\" and plaintiff's file, including his academic files, midshipman profile, company file, personnel jacket, and Sea Year file. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 71-72; ECF No. 3-1 at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The list of plaintiff's rights prior to and at the Hearing includes, among others,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the right \"[t]o question all witnesses, whether called by the Academy or by you, except for the Complainant .... You may, however, submit written questions for [the Complainant] to the Superintendent, who shall review the questions and ask those questions relevant to the proceedings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The SA/SH Procedures are not included or referenced in the Midshipman Regulations and are not available online (unlike the Midshipman Regulations and SI 2016-02). (Compl. \u00b6 74.) These procedures include a list of the \"Rights of Respondent,\" including his rights:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 To present evidence including but not limited to documentary evidence and the testimony of reasonably available witnesses during each phase of the hearing (determination whether violation occurred and penalty phase, if necessary)....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 To question all witnesses, whether called by the Academy or by Respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75; ECF No. 3-1 at 7.) As plaintiff states in his complaint, the SA/SH Procedures did not authorize the Academy to prohibit him from questioning Complainant, or to prohibit him from calling witnesses whose identities were provided in a timely manner. (Compl. \u00b6 76.) Neither the SA/SH Procedures nor SI 2016-02 specifies\n   the standard of proof the Superintendent will apply when deciding the case, and the Superintendent never stated what standard he would apply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff was \"expressly prohibited\" from providing a copy of the Notice and accompanying documents to his counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) Plaintiff's counsel formally requested a copy of the Notice on January 10, 2018 and, having received no response, again on January 11, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On January 11, 2018, plaintiff's counsel notified the Academy that law enforcement had cleared plaintiff of any wrongdoing, and that its investigation had been closed without any charges filed against plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Helis Decl. \u00b6 14 (discussing the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and NYPD criminal investigation).) Plaintiff's counsel argued that the Hearing should not proceed because \"law enforcement had concluded that the Complainant was\n   <em>\n    lawfully\n   </em>\n   able to and had consented to engage in sexual activity with Plaintiff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, plaintiff's counsel requested a 60-day adjournment to review the materials the Academy had provided to plaintiff and prepare for the Hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) The Academy required plaintiff's counsel to sign a confidentiality agreement, and then, on January 12, 2018, provided counsel with plaintiff's materials in redacted form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81, 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Academy stated that the law enforcement decision had \"no impact\" on and did not \"inform\" its disciplinary proceedings because plaintiff was charged with violations of the Academy's \"policies, not ... a criminal act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) The Academy also denied the request for a 60-day adjournment, so plaintiff's counsel requested a 30-day adjournment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) On January 16, 2018, plaintiff was granted a one-week adjournment from January 19 to January 26, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.) The Academy stated that this was \"sufficient time\" to prepare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 17, 2018, the Academy issued a revised Notice advising plaintiff's counsel of the new Hearing date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On January 23, 2018, plaintiff secured a faculty advisor to assist him at the Hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) The advisor had never served in this role before, and the Academy provided him with no training or guidance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) On January 24, 2018, the Academy notified plaintiff's counsel that the two Notices incorrectly stated the date of the alleged misconduct as occurring in October, rather than August, and that the Hearing was therefore adjourned to February 9, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) The Academy issued a revised Notice advising plaintiff's counsel of the new Hearing date on January 25, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On January 26, 2018, plaintiff's advisor emailed counsel for the Academy regarding due process concerns, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (a) [that the Notice] prohibit[ed] Plaintiff from cross-examining the Complainant in direct contravention of the SA/SH Procedures; (b) unexplained redactions in the Investigation File; (c) [that the Academy was] affording the Complainant the right to be present throughout the proceedings and to have an advisor contrary to all other witnesses who were not provided with such rights and those rights were not provided for in the SA/SH Procedures; (d) [that the Academy was] affording the Complainant an opportunity to make a victim impact statement which is not provided for by the SA/SH Procedures; and (e) inconsistencies between the rights and protocols set forth in the Hearing Notice and those in the SA/SH Procedures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91; ECF No. 3-1 at 21-22.) The Academy's counsel addressed a number of plaintiff's advisor's concerns in an email dated January 29, 2018. (ECF No. 3-1 at 25-26.) With respect to plaintiff's right to\n   question Complainant directly, the Academy's counsel explained that \"the right to question witnesses does not confer the right to do so directly,\" and referred the advisor to the statement in the Notice that plaintiff \"may submit written questions for the Complainant to the Superintendent, who shall review ... and ask those questions relevant to the proceeding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On January 29, 2018, plaintiff's advisor formally lodged objections to \"the Superintendent's decision to utilize procedures cobbled together from differing policies and protocols, at his discretion.\" (Compl. \u00b6 92.) The objections included that the Academy was holding a Superintendent's Hearing rather than an Executive Board Hearing, which was available under the Midshipman Regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also demanded that the Academy fully comply with its policies and procedures, in particular those requiring:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022 The Complainant to be treated like all other witnesses and permitted only to attend the hearing while being questioned, and appear without an advisor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiff to be free to question the Complainant directly, like any other witness; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \u2022 The Complainant not to be allowed to deliver a victim impact statement in the event the Hearing entails a Phase II (penalty phase).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.) On January 30, 2018, the Academy denied these requests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On January 31, 2018, the Academy notified plaintiff's advisor and counsel that the Superintendent intended to call only four of the eleven witnesses identified in the three Notices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) The Superintendent reserved the right, however, to call any of the other witnesses at the Hearing if he found their testimony to be necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That day, plaintiff's advisor responded: \"My sense ... is that the [Superintendent] will only be calling witnesses that he believes help make the case that [plaintiff] is guilty of the charges.\" (ECF No. 3-1 at 28.) The advisor also raised concerns about the Superintendent's role as both prosecutor for the Academy and \"impartial\" judge. (Compl. \u00b6 97.) He cited SI 2016-02, which provides that \"the accused has the 'right to an investigation and disciplinary process conducted in a manner that ... is not conducted by individuals with a conflict of interest,' \" and continued, \"[i]t seems obvious to me that being both prosecutor and judge is an inherent conflict of interest.\" (ECF No. 3-1 at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On February 8, 2018, plaintiff's counsel submitted an 11-page letter objecting to the Academy's policies, procedures, and protocols on the basis that they were fundamentally unfair and provided insufficient due process. (Compl. \u00b6 98.) Plaintiff's objections included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 Proceeding with the Hearing in the face of a law enforcement determination that there was no probable cause to believe Plaintiff engaged in nonconsensual sexual activity or contact with the Complainant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 Proceeding by way of a Superintendent's Disciplinary Hearing under the SA/SH Procedures instead of an Executive Board;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 The Superintendent's conflicting roles as \"advocate\" for the Academy, \"neutral judge\" presiding over the proceedings, and \"jury\" determining the facts;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022 Prohibiting counsel's right to participate in the Hearing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 Prohibiting counsel's presence in the Hearing room;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 The Complainant's presence in the Hearing room throughout the proceedings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 Prohibiting Plaintiff from directly questioning the Complainant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 The Superintendent's decision not to call exculpatory witnesses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 Consideration by the Superintendent of unsworn statements contained in the investigation report;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 Consideration of photographs of purported bruises to the Complainant's legs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 The Superintendent's access of the entire investigation report;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 The Academy's failure to obtain critical evidence during the investigation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 The failure of statements in the investigation report to be in the first person as required by Academy rules and regulations;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 The failure to provide Plaintiff with the training records of those who investigated and adjudicated the charges against him;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 Restrictions imposed on Plaintiff as to the use and disclosure of the contents of the investigation file.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 3-1 at 39-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   4. The Hearing, Phase I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Hearing began on Friday, February 9, 2018, at approximately 10:15 a.m., and concluded at approximately 9:45 p.m. that night. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 99, 115; Helis Decl. \u00b6 21.) There were brief pauses and a short lunch break during the Hearing. (Compl. \u00b6 99.) The parties contest whether the Superintendent provided a dinner break. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Helis Decl. \u00b6 21.) The entire proceeding was recorded. (Compl. \u00b6 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiff was present with his faculty advisor and counsel throughout the proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100.) Two attorneys represented plaintiff, but the Academy permitted only one attorney to be present in the hearing room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent questioned witnesses on behalf of the Academy, presided over the Hearing, acted as fact-finder, made the determination as to whether plaintiff violated the Academy's rules, and decided his penalty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SA/SH Procedures at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Hearing began with a \"summary rejection\" of plaintiff's 11-page objection letter, with no further explanation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.) Plaintiff, his advisor, and Complainant gave opening statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.) The Superintendent then called Complainant to testify and questioned her regarding the allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the complaint, the Superintendent posed questions in a \"neutral, non-confrontational manner, even after [Complainant] provided obviously false and inconsistent testimony.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent prohibited plaintiff from questioning Complainant directly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) Instead, plaintiff submitted a list of cross-examination questions to the Superintendent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The complaint states that the Superintendent \"refused to ask the Complainant questions that would have revealed her lack of credibility, including those concerning her relationship with ... the 'Friend.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent elicited hearsay testimony from Complainant regarding her conversations with law enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) The complaint alleges that Complainant suggested that the criminal investigation had not been closed, and was not active \"because she had not definitively stated she wanted to pursue charges.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the complaint, Complainant's testimony was \"contradictory, inconsistent with statements she made previously, inconsistent with the testimony of others, changed repeatedly, and was replete with falsehoods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Ten hours into the Hearing, after plaintiff had examined ten witnesses, the Superintendent called plaintiff to testify. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.) According to the complaint, he \"vigorously and aggressively\" cross-examined plaintiff, \"questioning his version of events and his judgment on the night in question.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.) Plaintiff alleges that the\n   Superintendent \"had not acted in the same manner towards the Complainant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   According to the complaint, Complainant's sister \"declined to appear\" to testify. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) The Superintendent asked plaintiff to speculate as to why Complainant's sister wanted Complainant to sleep in the same room as her even though, based on plaintiff's testimony, it was clear that he had not discussed this with the sister and \"was unaware of her view.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The complaint also alleges that the Superintendent aggressively cross-examined plaintiff on a misstatement of the record regarding a fellow midshipman's warning that Complainant was intoxicated, even though that midshipman testified at the Hearing that he had no opinion as to her level of intoxication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.) That midshipman testified that he did not know how much, if anything, Complainant drank that night, and that he had not said anything about it to plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Superintendent cross-examined plaintiff regarding his own level of intoxication, focusing on the number of drinks plaintiff had consumed without regard to the amount of time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   According to the complaint, the Superintendent elicited hearsay statements that law enforcement officers had made to Complainant, but precluded similar testimony as \"impermissible hearsay\" when plaintiff's counsel sought to testify regarding (1) plaintiff's candor and truthfulness during his voluntary interview with the Detective, and (2) the fact that the law enforcement investigation had been closed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Counsel for the Academy had indicated that breaks would be permitted during plaintiff's testimony as long as there was no pending question. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113.) Regardless, according to the complaint, the Superintendent refused multiple requests for breaks, including a dinner break over six hours after the end of the lunch break. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   According to the complaint, plaintiff was \"honest and forthright\" in his testimony, which was \"consistent with his prior statements and was corroborated by other witnesses and documentary evidence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Superintendent called three witnesses-namely, Complainant and two midshipmen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.) According to the complaint, the Superintendent believed these midshipmen \"would support the charges.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He did not call Complainant's sister or \"any of the many midshipmen who had interacted with and observed the Complainant on the night in question.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the complaint, plaintiff \"was forced\" to call seven witnesses, six of whom were midshipmen who testified about their interactions with or observations of Complainant the night of the Ring Dance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.) These witnesses provided exculpatory evidence \"proving the Complainant was not intoxicated to the point of being unable to consent to sexual activity, she willingly engaged in sexual activity with Plaintiff, and she lied during her testimony\" at the Hearing and in her statement to Thomas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was also forced to call Thomas, who had conducted the Academy's investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   According to the complaint, plaintiff found the Hearing procedures to be \"physically and emotionally overwhelming and grueling.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119.) The Hearing lasted for nearly twelve hours, during which plaintiff, with \"absolutely no legal training,\" \"serve[d] as his own attorney throughout, giving opening and closing statements, making legal and factual arguments and objections, and examining witnesses, all in addition to having to testify and being subjected to vicious cross-examination by the Superintendent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   At the end of the day, the Hearing was adjourned until Monday, February 12, 2018, for the Superintendent's decision and, if necessary, the punishment phase of the proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.) The Hearing reconvened on February 12, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., and the Superintendent rendered his decision, finding that plaintiff had violated SI 2016-02 and Midshipman Regulations paragraph 243(a). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.) He dismissed the paragraph 243(b) charge as redundant, and dismissed the paragraph 204(f) charge (that plaintiff failed to prevent the underage Complainant from drinking unlawfully or irresponsibly). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the complaint, the Superintendent issued no findings of fact and never explained the basis for his decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   5. The Hearing, Phase II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Immediately after rendering his decision, the Superintendent began the punishment phase of the proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123.) Plaintiff was permitted to call only five character witnesses, even though neither the Midshipman Regulations nor the SA/SH Procedures requires this limitation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent also questioned plaintiff again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Complainant was permitted to make a victim impact statement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.) The Superintendent did not question her, and plaintiff was not permitted to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Superintendent adjourned this phase of the Hearing to deliberate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125.) After approximately two hours, plaintiff was notified that the Superintendent had additional questions for plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent did not, however, appear to ask these questions and, after another hour, reconvened the Hearing and pronounced plaintiff's punishment without asking further questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125-26.) The Superintendent suspended plaintiff for the rest of the academic year (referred to as a \"setback\"), or one nine-week term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127.) In reality, however, the remaining classes plaintiff needs to complete to graduate are offered only during the third term each year and, therefore, his punishment amounted to a year-long suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   According to the complaint, plaintiff was informed that he was not entitled to appeal the Phase I decision or Phase II punishment; his only recourse was to seek reconsideration by the Superintendent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   6. The Reconsideration Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiff submitted a notice of intention to seek reconsideration of the Superintendent's decisions in both phases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130.) Plaintiff's notice stayed the setback, so he was permitted to remain on campus, complete his second term courses and finals, and begin the third term, which started on March 9, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On March 2, 2018, plaintiff's counsel submitted plaintiff's application for reconsideration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132.) His application included the following: additional character letters, a letter from plaintiff \"addressing what he learned from this process, raising concerns about the punishment imposed, and suggesting alternative punishments,\" a letter from plaintiff's parents regarding the financial hardship they experienced due to the Hearing, a letter from plaintiff's faculty advisor regarding the impact of the punishment on plaintiff's ability to complete his requirements for graduation, and a copy of counsel's February 8, 2018 objection letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's application raised objections to the finding of guilt, the lack of due process as a result of the Hearing procedures, the findings that he argued were against the weight of the evidence and inconsistent with law enforcement findings, and the Superintendent's failure to apply the relevant definition of consent from SI 2016-02. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133.) Plaintiff\n   expressed his concerns that the punishment would impact his ability to \"successfully complete his studies\" and obtain his degree, mariner's license, and military commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134.) He proposed alternative punishments that he believed would have a more positive impact on the Academy and his classmates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   On March 20, 2018, the Superintendent issued a decision denying plaintiff's request for reconsideration, without explanation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135.) Plaintiff had completed 20% of his final term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He was required to complete check-out procedures and depart immediately on a \"leave of absence,\" and returned home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 136-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   C. The Superintendent's Declaration\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Superintendent submitted a declaration along with defendants' memorandum of law in opposition to plaintiff's motion for injunctive relief. In his declaration, the Superintendent describes his position at the Academy, including his role in disciplinary proceedings. He explains that the Superintendent is responsible for \"all programs, activities and facilities at the Academy, including the academic and regimental programs.\" (Helis Decl. \u00b6 1.) As Superintendent, he is authorized to issue regulations necessary for the accomplishment of the Academy's mission, which include the Superintendent Instructions and other policies and directives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) The Superintendent describes the Academy's Midshipman Regulations as the \"student code of conduct,\" and explains that when midshipmen violate these regulations or other Academy policies, they can be charged with violations ranging from Class III (least egregious) to Class I (most egregious). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   According to the declaration, the Superintendent is responsible for holding a Superintendent's Hearing when midshipmen are charged with Class I violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Violations of SI 2016-02 (the sexual assault/harassment policy) constitute Class I violations, \"[g]iven the nature of such misconduct allegations,\" and, therefore, it is Academy policy for the Superintendent to hear these cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent explains that the procedures in Superintendent's Hearings and Executive Board Hearings are \"substantially similar,\" and that \"each affords the same due process protections.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During his time at the Academy, the Superintendent has held six other sexual assault hearings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) He exonerated one student of the alleged sexual assault, and found the other five had violated the Academy's policy against sexual assault and disenrolled them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Superintendent also describes the procedures applied in these cases generally, and in plaintiff's case in particular. He first sets forth a brief overview of the underlying facts in plaintiff's case, the criminal investigation, and the Academy's investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-12.) The Superintendent explains that, in plaintiff's case, he reviewed the Deputy Superintendent's decision on January 10, 2018 to set the Hearing for January 19, 2018, and found that the 60-day extension plaintiff requested was \"unacceptable,\" but agreed to an extension to January 26, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) He disagreed with plaintiff that \"there was no urgency to the hearing as Complainant was not a student at the Academy,\" in light of the severity of the allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the declaration, plaintiff's attorneys were not available on the new Hearing date, so the Hearing was rescheduled to February 9, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Superintendent explains that, like Executive Board Hearings, Superintendent's Hearings have two phases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) During Phase I, the Superintendent\n   applies a preponderance of the evidence standard in determining whether the midshipman committed the charged misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent determines the \"appropriate discipline\" at Phase II. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   With regard to the witnesses in plaintiff's case, the Superintendent asserts that he determined that he \"did not need to hear from\" seven of the witnesses identified in the Investigation Report because, \"based on summaries of their interviews, they did not have first-hand knowledge of the alleged misconduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) He asked Academy counsel to inform plaintiff of this decision, and that plaintiff could include any of those individuals that he wanted to call to testify on his witness list. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff included four of the seven witnesses on his list for Phase I, and one on his list for Phase II, all of whom testified in their respective phases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Superintendent states that he learned prior to the Hearing that Complainant's sister was unavailable to attend because she was away at college. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) The Superintendent further asserts that, upon information and belief, Academy counsel relayed to plaintiff's attorneys his message that the sister could testify at the Hearing by telephone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's attorneys did not consent and, thus, the sister did not testify. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The declaration explains that, during a Superintendent's Hearing, a midshipman's attorney may consult with and advise his client, but cannot otherwise participate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) The Superintendent states that plaintiff's attorney and his faculty advisor consulted with and advised him \"throughout\" both phases of his Hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In Executive Board Hearings, on the other hand, an accused may have an attorney present only if he or she is also criminally charged for the conduct at issue in the Academy proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff, therefore, would not have been permitted to have an attorney present had his case instead been heard by an Executive Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent notes that Complainant was accompanied by counsel during Phase I, but not Phase II of the Hearing (counsel was not available during Phase II). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Superintendent states that he began plaintiff's Hearing by explaining that he was not persuaded by the arguments in plaintiff's attorneys' February 8, 2018 letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) He asserts that he provided breaks, including a dinner break, although the on-campus cafeteria was closed at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Academy counsel had informed plaintiff's attorneys that the Hearing could continue past the end of the business day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   According to the declaration, plaintiff spent almost an hour questioning the Friend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) The Friend answered questions about his disciplinary records-including that he was currently on restriction for misconduct-about the state of his past and current friendship with plaintiff, and about his relationship with Complainant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent prohibited questions regarding the Friend's \"sex life,\" which he states \"was consistent with [his] not allowing [such] questions\" regarding Complainant or others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent reviewed a recording of the Hearing and asserts that plaintiff's attorney audibly directed plaintiff to ask certain questions of the Friend that plaintiff can be heard refusing to ask. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiff began calling witnesses at approximately 5:00 p.m., and the Superintendent permitted the testimony of all of his witnesses except his attorney, Gerald Lefcourt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff informed the Superintendent that Lefcourt would testify that the Detective found plaintiff to be credible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent states that he precluded this testimony because\n   \"as the presiding official, I assess credibility, and the opinions of others as to credibility are not relevant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   According to the declaration, plaintiff was \"ably assisted\" by his attorney and faculty advisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) They all had identical, approximately 3-inch binders with questions prepared for plaintiff to ask witnesses, and counsel \"appeared to frequently direct Plaintiff's attention to specific questions\" for him to ask. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Counsel and the faculty advisor frequently whispered to plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiff provided the Superintendent with a ten-page typed list of questions for him to ask Complainant, along with some handwritten questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) The Superintendent states that he asked \"most of the questions,\" but \"declined to ask\" those relating to Complainant's sexual activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also accepted additional follow-up questions from plaintiff after Complainant answered the first set of questions, and again asked those he deemed relevant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In arriving at his adverse decision at the conclusion of Phase I, the Superintendent states that he \"considered all the documentation and witness testimony, as well as [plaintiff and his advisor's] lengthy opening and closing statements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) In his deliberations as to plaintiff's punishment, the Superintendent considered the Phase II testimony by plaintiff, his advisor, and plaintiff's five character witnesses, Complainant's impact statement, plaintiff's overall academic, Regimental, and disciplinary record, and twenty-three written statements of support for plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) The Superintendent determined that plaintiff \"should be set back to the Class of 2019, subject to terms and conditions of probation for his rehabilitation, which would be supervised by an Academy mentor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Superintendent explains that the Academy's academic calendar \"is not as flexible as those at most universities,\" and that many courses are offered in sequence, and at limited times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) As a result, when a midshipman goes on a leave of absence \"for any reason,\" that student \"normally\" returns the next year at the start of the same term during which he or she departed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Superintendent explains that this is the reason that Academy policy is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to suspend a student during disciplinary proceedings, but rather to \"move[ ] forward as expeditiously as possible while insuring that any accused Midshipman is afforded his/her due process protections.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Midshipmen are then expected to comply immediately with the decision once it is made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In the declaration, the Superintendent also notes that plaintiff ignored his multiple admonitions at the Hearing not to share information about the proceedings with \"anyone outside the room,\" including through social media. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Plaintiff sent three messages to his classmates via Facebook, stating: (1) during the break between phases, that plaintiff was \"found guilty of sexual assault and now [a]wait[s] punishment from [the Superintendent]\" (ECF No. 14-5); (2) after Phase II, that he planned to \"appeal and fight [his setback] with every ounce of strength that I have\" (ECF No. 14-6); and (3) also after Phase II, that, \"for those who haven't heard the superintendent has ruled that I committed a serious class 1 violation\" (ECF No. 15). In a separate disciplinary proceeding, plaintiff was found to have committed a\n   Class I violation for failing \"to comply with the specific orders of a commissioned officer or superior\" by posting these messages, despite the Superintendent's orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Superintendent states that the Academy \"has a significant interest in ensuring that it bestows a diploma on an individual who has not only complied with all of its graduation requirements ... but also is of exemplary character. The Academy owes it to the taxpayers who fund the education of the Midshipmen at the Academy to only graduate those who have so complied, and who will serve their obligation with distinction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   D. Procedural History in the Instant Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   On March 28, 2018, plaintiff filed the complaint in this action, as well as a motion for a preliminary injunction. At a hearing that afternoon, plaintiff also requested a temporary restraining order permitting plaintiff to attend classes in advance of the preliminary injunction hearing. The parties submitted letters regarding the request for a temporary restraining order on March 29, 2018. The Court held a telephone conference on March 30, 2018, and declined to grant plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order at that time, but moved the preliminary injunction hearing from April 6 to April 4, 2018, in light of plaintiff's concerns about missed classes. Defendants filed their opposition on April 3, 2018, which included a memorandum of law as well as the declaration by the Superintendent discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court held the preliminary injunction hearing on April 4, 2018. Prior to the preliminary injunction hearing, the government provided the Court with an audio recording of the Academy Hearing, but had not yet prepared a transcript. On April 5, 2018, the Court granted plaintiff a temporary restraining order in light of its finding that, in its absence, plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm while awaiting the Court's decision (which would follow the Court's review of the transcript of the disciplinary proceeding). The temporary restraining order stayed any disciplinary action by the Academy and permitted plaintiff to attend classes until the Court issued its preliminary injunction decision. At the Court's direction, on April 10, 2018, the government filed a copy of the transcript of the Academy Hearing under seal. The government also provided an unredacted copy of the administrative record. The Court has now reviewed the administrative record, including the transcript of the Hearing, and has fully considered all of the arguments and submissions of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   II.

Mem. at 24.) Defendants argue that (1) they did, in fact, follow their policies and procedures, and (2) their decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. For the following reasons, based on its review of the record, the Court agrees with defendants and concludes that plaintiff has no likelihood of success on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Court first notes that defendants are entitled to deference with regard to their policies, which were enacted in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051318\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 51318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and other regulatory authority governing the Academy's operations.

If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute ....

The statute specifies the matters to be covered by this policy, including a procedure for disciplinary action, as well as sanctions to be imposed in these types of cases.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051318\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 51318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Following this statutory mandate, the Superintendent established the Academy's sexual assault policy, which includes the procedures that the Superintendent enforced during the Hearing and which plaintiff challenges under the APA. The policies and procedures that the Superintendent promulgated and followed at the Hearing were, therefore, entitled to deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In their opposition, defendants identify the following as plaintiff's only claims that defendants did not follow their own policies: (1) plaintiff's Hearing was not before an Executive Board, as provided for under the Midshipman Regulations, and (2) plaintiff was prohibited from cross-examining Complainant, even though the rules \"explicitly\" allow him to do so. (Def. Mem. at 18 (citing Compl. \u00b6 92; Pl. Mem. at 20).) The parties also dispute whether the Superintendent followed the Academy's policies by applying the SI 2016-02 definition of consent in determining that plaintiff had committed the charged sexual assault. Defendants argue that any other allegations that they failed to follow their own policies are not rooted in the actual policies, or are simply based on plaintiff's interpretation of those policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   First, plaintiff's assertion that, under existing rules and policies, he was entitled to an Executive Board Hearing, rather than a Superintendent's Hearing, is incorrect. As noted above, pursuant to statute, the Superintendent promulgated policies and procedures, including SI 2016-02 and the SA/SH Procedures, for disciplinary proceedings involving charges of, among other things, sexual assault. SI 2016-02 specifically states that \"the Academy may pursue an administrative investigation and disciplinary proceedings against an accused Midshipman pursuant to the Midshipman Regulations\n   <em>\n    and/or\n   </em>\n   [the SA/SH Procedures].\" (SI 2016-02 at 5.) Thus, it is clear that the Superintendent was authorized to use these procedures (including the Superintendent's Hearing) for this disciplinary proceeding involving charges of sexual assault, rather than the Executive Board procedure that was utilized for other types of disciplinary proceedings. In short, the use of the Superintendent's Hearing in this case is completely consistent with the Academy's policies and procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As to plaintiff's second claim, regarding his inability to cross-examine Complainant, the Superintendent provided him the required opportunity for such questioning under the Academy's policies and procedures. In particular, although he did not allow plaintiff to personally cross-examine Complainant, the Superintendent accepted plaintiff's lengthy list of prepared written questions, and written follow-up questions, and asked those questions that the Superintendent deemed relevant to the\n   proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. I\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 64-66 (plaintiff submits ten pages of written questions for the Superintendent to ask Complainant on cross-examination, and the Superintendent asks questions based on this list);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051318\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051318\">\n    at 85-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the Superintendent asks plaintiff's follow-up written questions during cross-examination of Complainant).) This use of written questions for cross-examination of Complainant was completely consistent with the SA/SH Procedures, which state: \"It is preferred that witnesses appear in person. However, given the nature of the allegations of misconduct, the Superintendent may direct that the testimony be provided by one or more witnesses by alternative means, such as remotely via VTC, behind a screen or through written questions.\" (SA/SH Procedures at 3.) Here, even though Complainant appeared in person, it was not a violation of the rules to require cross-examination of Complainant through the Superintendent, and this process did not impact the fairness of the proceeding in any way. The SA/SH Procedures provide accused midshipmen the right \"to question all witnesses\" (SA/SH Procedures at 2), but do not state that this right is without limitations. Instead, the Superintendent is expressly authorized to omit certain questions: for instance, SI 2016-02 makes clear that the victim has the right to exclude prior sexual history. (SI 2016-02 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Finally, plaintiff argues that the Superintendent did not apply the definition of consent established in SI 2016-02 and, therefore, wrongly found that he committed sexual assault. Under SI 2016-02, \"[a]ssent shall not constitute consent if it is given by a person who is\n   <em>\n    unable to lawfully\n   </em>\n   give his or her consent because of ... intoxication.\" (SI 2016-02 at 3.) Plaintiff argues that the Superintendent based his determination that Complainant had not consented on the fact that she had been drinking, not on a finding that she had been intoxicated to the point that she was unable to lawfully consent. Plaintiff asserts that a lesser degree of impairment would not suffice to support a finding that he had violated the Academy's sexual assault policy. Plaintiff argues that the Superintendent did not state the basis for his Phase I decision, and further asserts that it appears the Superintendent applied a different definition of consent, and, in doing so, failed to follow Academy policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Based on its review of the transcript of the Hearing, the Court disagrees. Although the Superintendent asked questions about the extent of Complainant's drinking, at no point in the Hearing did he suggest that he was applying some lesser degree of impairment with respect to the definition of consent. In fact, the faculty advisor made this standard extremely clear during his opening statement, and the Superintendent did not, in any way, contest the standard. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. I at 27-29 (plaintiff's faculty advisor emphasizing the definition of \"consent\" in SI 2016-02, Section 5, Subsection E).) Plaintiff reiterated the standard in detail in his closing statement (Tr. II at 188-89), without the Superintendent noting (at any point) any disagreement with plaintiff's summary. Moreover, as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , there was more than sufficient evidence (if Complainant's testimony was credited) for that standard\n   to be met-namely, that Complainant was so intoxicated that she could not lawfully consent. Accordingly, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate, based on the evidence adduced at the Hearing or statements by the Superintendent, that the Superintendent misunderstood or misapplied the relevant legal standard under the Academy's policies and procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   As agency actions, and even more as actions by the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the policies that the Superintendent promulgated and applied at the Hearing were entitled to deference: \"Few decisions properly rest so exclusively within the discretion of the appropriate government officials [as] the selection training, discipline and dismissal of the future officers of the military and Merchant Marine.\"\n   <em>\n    Wasson v. Trowbridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2076093\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/382/807/#p812\">\n    382 F.2d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812 (2d Cir. 1967) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews v.

In this case, defendants followed policies that were enacted pursuant to a clear congressional directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   With respect to the decision itself, the Court concludes that there is no likelihood that plaintiff can demonstrate that it was arbitrary and capricious. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , courts are highly deferential in determining whether agency action was arbitrary and capricious: they are to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for the action, but still conduct a narrow review, rather than substitute their judgment for that of the agency.\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Here, the Superintendent found in Phase I that plaintiff had committed the charged misconduct after \"considering all the documentation and witness testimony, as well as [plaintiff and his advisor's] lengthy opening and closing statements.\" (Helis Decl. \u00b6 28.) As defendants correctly argue, this administrative hearing is not a criminal proceeding, and the Court finds it to be sufficient that the Superintendent applied a preponderance of the evidence standard during Phase I. (Helis Decl. \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SA/SH Procedures at 4 (\"The Superintendent will evaluate the facts and determine whether the charge(s) as set forth in the Notice are sustained ...

In fact, the Friend testified that he told plaintiff, in front of others, that Complainant was too drunk to have sexual intercourse and that, if they had intercourse, \"it w[ould] be date rape,\" and plaintiff re-assured him, \"I know, dude. I'm just gonna take care of her.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr.

Based on Complainant's testimony and the record overall, there is simply no likelihood that plaintiff could demonstrate that the Superintendent's decision finding that he violated the Academy's sexual assault policy was arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Similarly, with respect to the punishment phase, the Superintendent based his decision on a review of documentary evidence including testimony by plaintiff, his advisor, and character witnesses, plaintiff's overall academic, Regimental, and disciplinary record, and twenty-three written statements of support for plaintiff. (Helis Decl. \u00b6 29.) The Superintendent then imposed what he determined to be the \"appropriate discipline\" based on his review of all of this evidence: a \"setback,\" under which plaintiff would be permitted to resume classes, graduate, and take his licensing exam in 2019. Plaintiff has failed to point to any aspect of the punishment that was arbitrary or capricious under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In sum, the Superintendent based his decision on a review of testimonial and documentary evidence from multiple witnesses with regard to the allegations of sexual misconduct. The Superintendent conducted a nearly twelve-hour Phase I hearing, at which eleven witnesses testified. Based on this evidence, the Superintendent found that plaintiff had violated the Academy's sexual assault policy, SI 2016-02-a Class I violation. During Phase II, the Superintendent heard testimony on behalf of plaintiff from seven people, including plaintiff. He deliberated over the weekend for Phase I and for approximately three hours for Phase II, weighing the evidence of plaintiff's good character against his misconduct, before pronouncing the punishment. Based on its independent review of the record, the Court concludes that the Superintendent followed the Academy's procedures and considered all of the evidence during both phases of the proceedings in arriving at his decisions, and there is simply no basis to conclude that his actions or decisions were arbitrary or capricious. Plaintiff has, therefore, failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of the APA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   B. Constitutional Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that the Hearing and his suspension violated the Fifth Amendment by depriving him of his substantive and procedural due process rights.

Plaintiff highlights \"several of the most egregious violations\" of his right to due process: the lack of a fair and impartial decision-maker; the failure to apply the Academy's own definition of consent; the failure to abide by the Academy's own rules and regulations, including the right to cross-examine the accuser; and the \"oppressive and unreasonable conditions\" of the twelve-hour Hearing with limited breaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants address each of these in turn, grouping the last two as the \"conduct of the hearing.\" (Def. Mem. at 15-20.)

He argues that the Superintendent could not serve as an impartial \"judge, ... jury, ... [and] appeals court\" after prosecuting the case on behalf of the Academy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) He argues that to believe, under those circumstances, that the Superintendent could have objectively decided the case \"belies common sense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff points to the following examples of the Superintendent's bias in favor of the Academy: his failure to call the potential exculpatory witnesses, his \"disparate treatment\" of Complainant and plaintiff, and his misstatement of testimony as incorrectly suggesting that a witness had warned plaintiff that Complainant was intoxicated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court is not persuaded by plaintiff's argument that the Hearing was unconstitutional\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   because the Superintendent\n   <em>\n    could not\n   </em>\n   have\n   been impartial in light of his multiple roles. The Court disagrees, and concludes that the Superintendent's role as prosecutor, fact-finder, and appeals court was prescribed by Academy rules, and is permissible in light of precedent permitting such a combination of functions. The Academy's policies establish through the list of participants in the SA/SH Procedures, as well as Hearing procedures delineated therein and in the Midshipman Regulations, that the Superintendent shall serve in each of these roles. The SA/SH Procedures list of participants includes the Superintendent, parties, and witnesses (but no additional individual to serve as prosecutor or judge);\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and its procedures indicate that the Superintendent (1) gives the introductory statement of the case and \"may question any and all witnesses at the hearing,\" and (2) evaluates the facts, determines whether the respondent committed the charged violation, and issues a decision and penalty. (SA/SH Procedures at 1, 3-5.) The Midshipman Regulations provide for appeal to the Maritime Administrator\n   <em>\n    only where the penalty was disenrollment\n   </em>\n   , and for reconsideration by the Superintendent in all other cases. (Midshipman Regulations at 12.) At the same time, SI 2016-02 includes among the rights of the accused and victim in sexual assault disciplinary proceedings: \"[t]he right to an investigation and disciplinary process ... [that] is\n   <em>\n    not conducted by individuals with a conflict of interest\n   </em>\n   .\" (SI 2016-02 at 6.) The fact that these policies coexist shows that the Academy has determined that there is no such\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   conflict of interest as a result of the Superintendent's multiple roles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Moreover, the Supreme Court and Second Circuit have rejected the argument that administrative hearings are unconstitutional\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   because decision-makers who perform multiple roles cannot, as a matter of law, be impartial. In\n   <em>\n    Withrow v.

It is too clear to require argument or citation that a fair hearing presupposes an impartial trier of fact and that prior official involvement in a case renders impartiality most difficult to maintain. In fact, the Regulations of the Academy prescribe this separation of functions. Of course the closeness of Academy life and the manpower limitations of a Regiment may at times make it unduly burdensome or impossible to secure a panel wholly lacking previous contact with the events in issue, yet the hearing must proceed. We think, however, that Wasson was entitled to show that members of the panel had had such prior contact with his case that they could be presumed to have been biased.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2076093\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/382/807/#p812\">\n    382 F.2d at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, the Court concludes that the Superintendent's combination of functions was not unconstitutional\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , and there is no evidence that he had any prior involvement in the investigation that would have eviscerated his impartiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Plaintiff urges this Court to look to the Sixth Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

In\n   <em>\n    Miami University\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged that one of three school officials on his administrative hearing panel had served as investigator, prosecutor, and judge, dominated the hearing, and made remarks \"designed to reduce [the plaintiff's] credibility while bolstering [his accuser's] credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515976\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/579/#p601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Sixth Circuit found that this official's dominance \"raise[d] legitimate concerns, as she was the only one of the three [panel members] with conflicting roles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515976\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/579/#p601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also noted the allegation that this official \"announced during the hearing that 'I'll bet you do this [i.e., sexually assault women] all the time.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515976\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/579/#p601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court found that this statement suggested the official \"had determined prior to the hearing that [the plaintiff] was responsible for the misconduct ... and had a propensity for engaging in sexual misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515976\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/579/#p601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court, therefore, concluded that \"although an [official's] dual roles do not per se disqualify him or her from being an impartial arbiter,\" the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the official's \"ability to be impartial 'had been manifestly compromised' \" to support a procedural due process claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515976\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/579/#p601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In this case, plaintiff argues that the Superintendent showed similar bias to the official in the\n   <em>\n    Miami University\n   </em>\n   case. The Court disagrees. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success in showing that the Superintendent had a bias toward plaintiff that rendered him unable to perform his function as a fair and impartial decision-maker. First, plaintiff has not pointed to any of the Superintendent's remarks that would suggest a pre-conceived notion about plaintiff's responsibility for (or propensity to engage in) sexual misconduct, as in\n   <em>\n    Miami University\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff claims that the Superintendent's conduct amounted to \"disparate treatment\" because he questioned plaintiff more vigorously than he questioned the victim. In the context of this particular proceeding, the Court does not believe that any differences in the tone or substance of the questions posed to plaintiff as compared to Complainant demonstrate an unconstitutional bias by the Superintendent. The Superintendent asked many questions of Complainant, including most of the written questions submitted by plaintiff. Moreover, plaintiff's other contentions regarding the Superintendent's questioning at the Hearing show only that the Superintendent considered the competing narratives before him, based on different witnesses' testimony over the course of the Hearing. Having carefully reviewed the Hearing, the Court does not believe plaintiff has put forth evidence that demonstrates that the Superintendent was biased.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeFabio v.

Given that plaintiff has not overcome the \"strong presumption that [the Superintendent] [is] impartial,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 492, the Court does not believe that plaintiff is likely to prevail on this ground with respect to the due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   ii. Notice of the Issue of Consent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that the Academy failed to notify him of the charges against him in its Notice-in particular, of how plaintiff was alleged to have \"sexually assaulted\" Complainant. (Pl. Mem. at 19.) He also asserts that neither the applicable Superintendent Instruction nor the Midshipman Regulations prohibits engaging in sexual conduct with a person who has consumed alcohol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff acknowledges that SI 2016-02 prohibits sexual contact with a person one \"reasonably should have known was impaired and, thus unable to consent, due to the use of alcohol,\" but argues that this rule (1) does not define impairment, and (2) later states that sexual contact is prohibited if the person would have been unable to consent due to intoxication\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (citing SI 2016-02 (5)(e) ).) Additionally, plaintiff argues that the following definition of sexual misconduct under Midshipman Regulations paragraph 243(a) is unconstitutionally vague: sexual acts \"under circumstances that are discrediting to the Academy or the midshipman or are prejudicial to good order and discipline in the Regiment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Court agrees with defendants that these Notices were constitutionally sufficient. Plaintiff recognizes that the Academy's policies included a definition of consent and, further, that they referenced intoxication in this context. The Court\n   finds this more than adequate to alert plaintiff to the charges against him and the type of misconduct that would qualify as a violation of Academy rules. In short, plaintiff received adequate notice to constitute due process, as it has been articulated in the particular context of Academy hearings, discussed\n   <em>\n    supra. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wasson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2076093\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/382/807/#p812\">\n    382 F.2d at 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (In the context of the Academy, \"due process only requires ... that [the midshipman] be given a fair hearing at which he is apprised of the charges against him and permitted a defense.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   iii. Conduct of the Hearing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Plaintiff identifies the following ways (among others) in which the Academy failed to abide by its own rules, by: refusing to provide plaintiff with an Executive Board Hearing rather than a Superintendent's Hearing; refusing to allow him to cross-examine Complainant; permitting Complainant and an advisor to sit in the Hearing room throughout the entirety of the proceedings; and waiting months to complete its investigation and file charges. (Pl. Mem. at 20.) Plaintiff also lists multiple objections to different aspects of the proceedings that, together, he alleges amounted to \"oppressive and unreasonable conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17, 20-21.) These include that the Superintendent: refused to provide breaks during the lengthy Hearing day; forced plaintiff to serve as his own attorney and testify on his own behalf; prevented plaintiff's counsel from participating and one of his attorneys from sitting in the Hearing room; precluded plaintiff from introducing favorable evidence based on law enforcement conversations, although such evidence was elicited from Complainant; refused to present exculpatory evidence and \"instead requir[ed] plaintiff to do so, thereby shifting the burden to plaintiff to prove his innocence\"; refused to allow plaintiff to inquire about Complainant's romantic relationship with the Friend; and refused to allow plaintiff to cross-examine the Friend about disputes between them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Defendants rebut these issues in turn, and the Court agrees with defendants' responses. Students are not entitled to representation at non-criminal proceedings. In\n   <em>\n    Crowley v. U.S. Merchant Marine Academy\n   </em>\n   , the court correctly noted that \"courts generally have declined to recognize a right to representation by counsel, as a function of due process, in military academy disciplinary proceedings concerning non-criminal acts.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"58404\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/292/#p297\">\n    985 F.Supp. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297 (E.D.N.Y. 1997). Here, the criminal investigation was closed before the Hearing began and, as the Academy correctly stated, plaintiff was charged with violations of the Academy's \"policies, not ... a criminal act.\" (Compl. \u00b6 82.) Additionally, plaintiff\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have an attorney present, who actively advised him both prior to and throughout the proceeding, directing him to specific prepared questions to ask witnesses and whispering advice to him. The fact that plaintiff was not allowed to have a second attorney in the Hearing certainly does rise to the level of a due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Court also agrees with defendants that plaintiff was not prejudiced by the length of the proceeding or the number or length of breaks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Hearing\n   lasted from approximately 10:15 a.m. until 9:45 p.m. and included a lunch break, a dinner break, and other breaks throughout the day. Plaintiff was advised in advance that the Hearing could continue past business hours. The Court hardly finds these conditions to be \"oppressive\" or to rise to the level of a due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Moreover, the Court agrees with defendants' responses to plaintiff's evidentiary objections. First, the Superintendent did not undermine plaintiff's ability to present his case by limiting his time to give an opening or question Academy witnesses, or his right to call his own witnesses. Plaintiff argues that the Superintendent should have called exculpatory witnesses, but plaintiff had the opportunity to call any witnesses that he believed would support his defense (and did call such witnesses). Further, even in the context of a criminal prosecution, the Superintendent would have satisfied his duty in identifying these witnesses that possessed this (potentially) exculpatory information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bagley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/#p678\">\n    473 U.S. 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/#p678\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/#p678\">\n    87 L.Ed.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). Second, the Superintendent was within his right in declining to hear plaintiff's attorney's testimony as to interactions with law enforcement, where a law enforcement officer purportedly suggested that plaintiff was a credible witness. The Superintendent correctly stated that he was responsible for credibility determinations and, as such, that this evidence was not relevant. Third, the limitations during the cross-examination of the Friend do not raise any constitutional issues; rather, plaintiff engaged in extensive cross-examination of the Friend and was given the opportunity to undermine his credibility in a number of different ways. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. II at 11 (Friend drinks with underage women);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-21 (Friend had a friendship with Complainant after the Ring Dance, including going to softball game);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24 (Friend had been drinking at the dance);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35 (Friend had many infractions at the Academy);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39 (Friend had received immunity from Academy for testimony).) Finally, the Court agrees that the Superintendent correctly precluded plaintiff from inquiring into Complainant's sexual activities. Not only does SI 2016-02 establish the victim's right to exclude prior sexual history in these hearings, but this Academy policy follows New York state's rape shield law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grant v. Demskie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"643426\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/75/201/#p209\">\n    75 F.Supp.2d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209-10 (S.D.N.Y. 1999),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=234%20F.3d%201262\">\n    234 F.3d 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2000) (\"The purpose of New York's rape shield law is to prohibit cross-examination about a victim's sex life....

As required, plaintiff was given a fair hearing, notice of the charges against him, and the opportunity to defend himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wasson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2076093\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/382/807/#p812\">\n    382 F.2d at 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, he was given greater protections-to name a few, he had both a faculty advisor and an attorney that he consulted with throughout the proceeding, he had the opportunity to prepare questions for Complainant (as well as a set of follow-up questions), and, in determining plaintiff's penalty, the Superintendent heard testimony from five character witnesses and reviewed twenty-three statements in support of plaintiff. In sum, the Court concludes that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on his claim that he was deprived of his right to procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   2. Substantive Due Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Plaintiff also brings a claim for a violation of substantive due process under the Fifth Amendment. The standard for such a claim under the Fifth Amendment is the same as for such a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Piechowicz v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535085\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/885/1207/\">\n    885 F.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1214 n.9 (4th Cir. 1989). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects persons against deprivations of \"life, liberty, or property.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. The Fourteenth Amendment \"does not provide a comprehensive scheme for determining the propriety of official conduct or render all official misconduct actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Pena v.

Plaintiff makes the conclusory allegation that defendants' conduct \"violat[ed] ... the Academy's own rules, was\n   arbitrary and capricious and did not involve the exercise of proper judgment,\" and \"was motivated by bad faith or ill will.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 148-59.) Plaintiff claims that defendants \"deliberately and prejudicially assumed Plaintiff's guilt, ... rushed to judgment, ... were intentionally dismissive of Plaintiff's statements and rights, and then overzealously punished Plaintiff to serve political purposes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150.) As defendants argue, all of plaintiff's substantive claims are rooted in alleged procedural infirmities. The claims pertaining to defendants' motives-that they were motivated by ill will and political objectives-are unsupported by any concrete factual allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The Court finds that, for the same reasons discussed with respect to plaintiff's procedural due process claim, plaintiff fails to show a likelihood of success on his claim that he was deprived of his right to substantive due process.

I at 63-64 (Superintendent permits a 20-minute break before cross-examination of Complainant);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 85 (Superintendent takes break to allow follow-up written questions by plaintiff to Complainant);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 93 (Superintendent takes lunch break);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 139-41 (Superintendent takes break before cross-examination of Friend); Tr.

Plaintiff claims that he was not permitted a dinner break, but the Superintendent states that he provided one, although the on-campus cafeteria was closed. Defendants argue that this is no fault of the Superintendent's, and plaintiff had been advised of the potential length of the proceeding and could have ascertained the cafeteria hours and other dinner options. In short, neither the length of the proceeding nor the number of breaks created a due process issue. It is abundantly clear from the record that plaintiff was actively engaged in his defense throughout the proceeding. Although the Superintendent denied plaintiff breaks toward the end of his testimony at the end of the day, and plaintiff, on the recording, appears to be taking deep breaths at one point, there was nothing about that denial that impacted the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. Plaintiff had already testified to his version of the events in great detail, including in his opening, which was considered part of his testimony. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 177.) There was nothing about plaintiff's testimony or performance after the point where the break was denied that demonstrates that a lack of a break impacted his ability to participate in the proceeding in a meaningful way. His answers continued to be detailed and responsive. He was then given a break before his thorough closing statement.
