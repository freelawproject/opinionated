LLOYD, United States Magistrate Judge\n   Plaintiff Technology Credit Corporation (TCC) sues for alleged breach of written contract over funding it provided for a failed solar project. Jurisdiction is based on diversity,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Briefly stated, TCC says that it advanced certain funds for a solar equipment installation at defendants' facilities, but claims that defendants have not re-paid those sums as required by the parties' contracts. Arguing that venue is not proper here, defendants N.J. Christian Academy, Inc. (NJCA or Church) and New Jersey United Christian Academy (NJUCA or School) now ask that the court either dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3), or transfer this action to the District of New Jersey pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Even if venue is proper here, defendants alternatively request that this action be transferred to the District of New Jersey pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice. TCC opposes the motion, contending that the court should enforce a forum selection clause designating venue in California. Following the motion hearing, and with leave of court, each side submitted supplemental briefing on the issue whether the subject forum selection clause is permissive or mandatory. The matter now being submitted, upon consideration of the moving and responding papers, as well as the arguments of counsel, this court denies the motion to dismiss and the request for a \u00a7 1406(a) transfer, as well as the alternate motion to transfer pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   TCC is headquartered in San Jose, California and says that it is in the business of funding solar equipment installations for non-profit schools, churches, and other non-profit organizations throughout the United States. (Dkt. 22-2, Declaration of James E. Hartigan (Hartigan Decl.) \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant NJCA is a church that offers religious worship and seminars. (Dkt. 11-1, Declaration of Jeong Ha Shinn (Shinn Decl.), \u00b6 4). Defendant NJUCA is a boarding school for grades 6-12 that combines academic and religious teachings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Both defendants say that they are incorporated in New Jersey and operate only in that state on the same 43-acre retreat facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to defendants, in August 2015, a company identifying itself as Green Life Solar, Inc. (Green Life Solar) sent them an email offering to build a solar system on defendants' property. The email described Green Life Solar as \"a Solar Integrator and Financing Company\" that could build a solar system for defendants \"without any upfront cost to the Church....\" (Shinn Decl. \u00b6 7, Ex. A). Among other things, the email stated that \"Green Life Solar will coordinate the financing process with its funding partner, as well as[ ] design, build and install the solar system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Church says\n   that, excited by the prospect of saving money without any upfront cost, it decided to have Green Life Solar construct a solar power system at their facilities and to proceed with Green Life Solar's financing offer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 22, 2015, TCC received an email from Chris Tzokas of Green Life Solar, with a Request for Financing on behalf of NJCA. (Hartigan Decl. \u00b6 3). TCC says that, on September 24, 2015, it emailed Green Life Solar a proposal in connection with the NJCA project, conditioned on TCC's credit approval of the Church and the School (as the Church's guarantor), as well as on TCC's approval of the equipment to be used on the solar project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). A revised proposal was sent to Green Life Solar on October 28, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to TCC, after conducting a thorough credit check on the defendants, it approved the terms of the proposed transaction. And, TCC's credit committee authorized Daniel Ambrogio (the company's Director of Operations) to prepare a Power Purchase Agreement, supporting documentation, and Guaranty. (Hartigan Decl. \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   There were several agreements executed in connection with the project:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Installation Contract between Green Life Solar and the Church\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 27, 2015, Green Life Solar executed a Solar Construction Agreement (or, what is referred to in the papers as the \"Installation Contract\") with the Church for the construction of the solar energy system at defendants' New Jersey facilities. (Shinn Decl. \u00b6 8, Ex. B). The next day, the Church executed the agreement through David Kim, its Facility Administrator at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Installation Contract contains a forum selection clause designating New Jersey:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"history\" id=\"p-18\">\n   Disputes; Jurisdiction; Venue: This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey. All disputes hereunder shall be adjudicated in the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey, Camden County Vicinage, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing to pursue alternative dispute resolution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Installation Contract \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The first page of the Installation Contract states that the contract \"includes: this page; the Terms, Conditions and Specifications; the State Addendum; Customer Pre-Installation Activities (if applicable) and any other documents expressly made a part of this Agreement.\" (Shin Decl. \u00b6 8, Ex. B, Installation Contract at 1). It further provides that the \"Agreement represents the entire agreement between [Church] and [Green Life Solar] and supersedes all prior negotiations, representation[s] or agreements, either written or oral.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, appended to the Installation Contract are several exhibits, most of which, on their face, indicate that they are part and parcel of, or supplements to, the Power Purchase Agreement between TCC and the Church. The Installation Contract also says that the Church's obligations under the contract are conditioned on \"[Church]'s successful negotiation of a financing agreement and power purchase agreement (the \"Financing and Power Purchase Agreement\") with [TCC]....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, if the Church didn't manage to obtain such financing on terms reasonably acceptable to the Church, then the Church could terminate the Installation Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Power Purchase Agreement between TCC and the Church\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Church subsequently entered into the Power Purchase Agreement with TCC. (Shinn Decl., \u00b6 10, Ex. C). According to TCC, through the Power Purchase Agreement, the Church contracted with TCC to have TCC buy the solar energy system from Green Life Solar and to then sell the power from that system to the Church. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Power Purchase Agreement contains a forum selection clause that provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Governing Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws, but not the choice of laws provisions, of the State of California, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     [TCC] and [Church] hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any State or Federal court located in San Jose, California for all legal proceedings arising directly or indirectly from this Agreement, and each irrevocably waives any objection to any such proceeding based on venue or inconvenient forum\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The Parties agree to waive their right to a jury trial and to submit all disputes of fact or law relating to or arising out of this Agreement to a trial pursuant to an Order of Reference under California Code of Civil Procedure section 638 et seq. The Parties intend this general reference agreement to be specifically enforceable in accordance with CCP section 638 et seq.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Power Purchase Agreement \u00b6 22) (emphasis added). The Power Purchase Agreement also states that \"[t]his Agreement (including all exhibits attached hereto represents the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written agreements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Power Purchase Agreement \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Jeong Ha Shinn, NJCA's founder, Chairman and Director of the Board, executed the Power Purchase Agreement on December 15, 2015. (Shinn Decl. \u00b6 10, Ex. C). James E. Hartigan, TCC's co-founder, executed the agreement on behalf of TCC. However, TCC says that it did not receive defendants' signed agreement until December 21, 2015; and, although his signature is dated December 15, 2015, Hartigan says that the agreement, as executed by defendants, was not actually presented to him for signature until sometime after December 21, 2015. (Dkt. 22-3, Declaration of Daniel Ambrogio (Ambrogio Decl.) \u00b6 5; Hartigan Decl. \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Progress Payment Agreement between TCC and the Church\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As discussed, the Installation Contract between the Church and Green Life Solar appends several exhibits that indicate that they are part of, or supplements to, the Power Purchase Agreement between TCC and the Church. Relevant to the discussion here, appended as Exhibit G to the Installation Contract is a document entitled \"Progress Payment Agreement.\" In relevant part, the Progress Payment Agreement provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ... on or before\n   <em>\n    June 10, 2016\n   </em>\n   (the \"Commitment Termination Date\"), at the request of [Church], [TCC] shall fund the purchase of System by making payments toward the purchase price of such System as designated by [Church] as specified in one or more draw requests provided by [Church] to [TCC] from time to time (the \"Progress Payments\"). The aggregate amount of Progress Payments paid by [TCC] hereunder shall not exceed a total of Six Hundred Thousand Three Hundred Twenty-seven Dollars and Zero Cents ($600,327.00) (the \"Commitment\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2(a) ). The agreement further provides that the Church \"shall request that\n   [TCC] make a Progress Payment by delivering a notice, in the form of attached Schedule B, (a \"\n   <em>\n    Funding Request\n   </em>\n   \") to [TCC]\" that (1) identifies the amount of the Progress Payment, which together with all other Progress Payments previously made by TCC, does not exceed the Commitment; (2) identifies the date by which the Progress Payment is to be made; and (3) appends an invoice from Green Life Solar for the amount of the Progress Payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2(b) ). \"Delivery of such Funding Request shall constitute an acknowledgement by [Church] that such invoice is approved and accepted by [Church].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   TCC's obligation to make Progress Payments was to terminate on the \"Termination Date,\" i.e., the earlier of (1) the \"Operational Commencement Date\" under the Installation Contract (essentially, the date the Church certified to TCC that the solar energy system was successfully installed and operational) or (2) the Commitment Termination Date. (Shinn Decl., \u00b6 8, Ex. B Progress Payment Agreement \u00b6 3(b) ). And, on the Termination Date, the Progress Payment Agreement provides that \"[Church] shall pay to [TCC] an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all Progress Payments made by [TCC] hereunder together with the Interest Amount due and payable....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4(b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dr. Shinn signed the Progress Payment Agreement for NJCA on December 15, 2015, and Hartigan executed the document for TCC. (Shinn Decl., Ex. B). Again, Hartigan avers that although his signature is dated December 15, 2015, the document as executed by defendants, was not presented to him for signature until sometime after December 21, 2015. (Ambrogio Decl. \u00b6 5; Hartigan Decl. \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Guaranty between TCC and the School\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, through a Guaranty, TCC says that the School guaranteed the Church's debt/loan obligations. Dr. Shinn executed the Guaranty for the School on December 15, 2015. (Shinn Decl., \u00b6 12, Ex. D; Hartigan Decl. \u00b6 9). The Guaranty contains a \"Miscellaneous\" section that provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   This Guaranty shall be governed by and construed according to the laws of the State of California, shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns of the Guarantor [School] and shall inure to the benefit of the Power Supplier [TCC], its successors and assigns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Shinn Decl., Ex. D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Subsequent Events\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As discussed above, under the Progress Payment Agreement, TCC and the Church agreed to a Commitment Termination Date of June 10, 2016. Through a subsequent amendment dated June 27, 2016, the Commitment Termination Date was extended to September 30, 2016. (Shinn Decl., Ex. B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is undisputed that, for whatever reason, Green Life Solar never did construct the solar power system at defendants' facilities. Defendants say that from February through June 2016, they received several emails from Green Life Solar, citing various reasons for delays, including (1) pending approval from New Jersey's Clean Energy Program; (2) delays from \"the electric company\"; and (3) a \"township permit delay.\" (Shinn Decl. \u00b6 15, Exs. E-G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Meanwhile, the Church says it received two invoices from Green Life Solar-the first on December 15, 2015 for $100,054.00, and the second on June 26, 2016 for $308,277.00. (Shinn Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, Exs. K-L).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   TCC says in response to two funding\n   requests it received from the Church, TCC directed Bank of the West to make the requested wire transfers to Green Life Solar. Specifically, plaintiff says that its records show that (1) on January 19, 2016, a wire transfer was made from TCC's Bank of the West account to Green Life Solar in the amount of $100,054.00; and (2) a second wire transfer in the amount of $308,277.00 was made to Green Life Solar on June 29, 2016-for a total of $408,331.00. (Hartigan Decl., \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In July 2016, the Church terminated David Kim, the Facility Administrator who executed the Installation Contract and who, defendants say, had been the only person communicating with Green Life Solar up to that time. Thereafter, NJCA/NJUCA employee, Adam Kim, began to oversee the Installation Contract. He says he made multiple attempts to reach Green Life Solar by email and phone, but was unable to reach anyone, including David Wei and Chris Tzokas, who reportedly communicated with David Kim about the solar project. (Dkt. 11-3, Declaration of Adam Kim (Kim Decl.) \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   TCC says that, by late November 2016, it appeared that Green Life Solar was never going to construct the solar system at the NJCA site. (Hartigan Decl. \u00b6 14). And, in December 2016, defendants say that they began receiving communications from TCC to \"work on a solution\" to the issues. (Shinn Decl. \u00b6 18, Exs. I &amp; J). By February and April 2017, defendants say that those communications became formal demands for \"repayment of amounts loaned to NJCA by TCC.\" (Shinn Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, Ex. M-O).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    All parties have expressly consented that all proceedings in this matter may be heard and finally adjudicated by the undersigned.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c) ; Fed.

(Shinn Decl., Ex. A). Plaintiff denies being \"in a partnership or joint venture with [Green Life Solar].\" (Hartigan Decl. \u00b6 10). TCC's objections are overruled. Based on the record presented, one may reasonably infer some sort of relationship between TCC and Green Life Solar. The court considers Green Life Solar's assertion, not for the truth of the statement that plaintiff is, in fact, Green Life Solar's \"funding partner,\" but simply as the way in which Green Life's Solar chose to characterize its relationship with TCC. Nevertheless, the court agrees that Dr. Shinn's assertion (Shinn Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10) that defendants were told that TCC was Green Life Solar's funding partner is hearsay and lacks foundation. Fed. R. Evid. 602, 803.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Although the copy of the second invoice submitted by defendants does not show any dollar figure, there is no dispute as to the amount that was invoiced.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    In May 2017, Dr. Shinn and Adam Kim say they met with an attorney to discuss opening a fraud investigation into Green Life Solar's conduct. (Shinn Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, Ex. P; Kim Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). That attorney asked the Monmouth County, New Jersey prosecutor to investigate the matter, and defendants say that the prosecutor's investigation is still pending. (Shinn Decl. \u00b6 25, Ex. P; Kim Decl. \u00b6 8).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Shortly after, TCC wrote defendants to advise that it had retained counsel to pursue collection of the amounts TCC claims they owe. (Shinn Decl. \u00b6 26, Ex. Q). This lawsuit followed. In its complaint, TCC says that as a result of defendants' (alleged) breach of contract, TCC has been damaged in a sum exceeding $470,939.46.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Defendants contend that this matter doesn't belong here and should proceed in New Jersey in any event.

Plaintiff argues that venue is proper under \u00a7 1391(b)(2) because its agreements with defendants were made in California and were to be performed here and because, according to the complaint, TCC suffered harm here as a result of defendants' alleged breach of contract.

Like TCC, in\n    <em>\n     Farm Credit West\n    </em>\n    , the California plaintiff sued for breach of a guaranty, and the Washington state defendant moved for a more definite statement, arguing that the complaint's allegations were too vague or ambiguous to establish that venue was proper in California. Concluding that the complaint's allegations were sufficient to establish proper venue, the\n    <em>\n     Farm Credit West\n    </em>\n    court noted that \"[a] contract is to be performed at the place where it is made, when no other place is indicated\"; \"[a] contract is 'made' in the place of acceptance\"; and \"[a]n obligation evidenced by an instrument is created at the place where the instrument is delivered.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *2. The guaranty at issue in\n    <em>\n     Farm Credit West\n    </em>\n    was deemed to be made in California (not Washington) because the defendants executed the guaranty and delivered it to plaintiff; plaintiff signed and accepted the guaranty in California; plaintiff's acceptance was the last act necessary to give the guaranty binding effect; and no place of performance was expressly mentioned in the document.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    TCC argues, persuasively, that the same operative facts are present here. Additionally, TCC says that the Church's funding requests were processed in San Jose; the bank that made the wire transfers to Green Life Solar is located in San Jose; TCC is headquartered in San Jose; and defendants' alleged breach caused TCC to suffer harm here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    For their part, defendants argue that all or most substantial events giving rise to TCC's claims occurred in New Jersey, noting that at least one court has observed that the \"[m]ere execution of a contract does not weigh heavily in determining\n    which forum state is more convenient or proper.\"\n    <em>\n     Vitria Tech., Inc. v.

They point out that the Power Purchase Agreement and Guaranty concerned TCC's agreement to fund the solar construction project at defendants' New Jersey facilities; TCC's communications with defendants took place with NJCA employees, all of whom are located in New Jersey; and no meetings between the parties ever took place in California. Additionally, defendants note that they signed the subject agreements in New Jersey. Further, defendants contend that their contracts with TCC essentially are intertwined with their deal with Green Life Solar. And, to that end, defendants argue that it is material that the actual construction of the solar power system was governed by the Installation Contract with Green Life Solar (a New Jersey corporation), and that the Installation Contract contains a forum selection clause requiring disputes under that contract to be brought in New Jersey.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Defendants fail to convince.

And, pointing out that English is not his first language, defendants claim that Dr. Shinn did not understand the legal import of the forum selection clause, which they say TCC never discussed. Having foraged the internet for information, TCC submits evidence it contends shows that Dr. Shinn was not hapless or unwitting, as he would seem to let on. Defendants object to that evidence on numerous grounds, but the court has, in any event, found it unnecessary to consider that evidence. It is defendants' burden to demonstrate overreaching, and they have not met that heavy burden here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    According to his own declaration, Dr. Shinn is the founder of NJCA and the current Chairman and Director of the Board (Shinn Decl. \u00b6 3), and the prefix before his name indicates that Dr. Shinn is highly educated. There is no indication that he had insufficient time to review the contracts, or that he sought a translation of the documents or legal consultation. Nor is there any evidence that defendants were prevented from seeking the same due to time pressures or anything else. Defendants seem to suggest that TCC was in a superior bargaining position, arguing that TCC is in the business of financing and is well familiar with the terms of its own agreements. But, defendants have not convincingly demonstrated that there was any unequal bargaining power. In any event, \"a forum clause is not unreasonable merely because of the parties' unequal bargaining power: it is enforceable if there is reasonable communication of the clause.\"\n    <em>\n     Marcotte v.

Cal., Sept. 11, 2014). In the Power Purchase Agreement, the forum selection clause appears under the bold underlined heading \"Governing Law.\" While defendants seem to suggest that the forum selection clause was buried on the last page of that contract, the clause appears in the middle of\n    the page, just above the signature boxes where the parties executed the agreement. (Shinn Decl. Ex. C). The court finds no overreaching here.\n    <em>\n     See generally, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Mechanix Wear, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20417193\">\n     2017 WL 417193\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *5 (finding no overreaching where there was no evidence the defendant was prevented from seeking legal counsel or that there was insufficient time for him to do so, and where the forum selection clause appeared under the bold underlined heading \"Governing Law/Forum\" in the middle of a 4-page typewritten agreement).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Defendants nonetheless argue that enforcement of the forum selection clause is contrary to public policy. But, they fail to identify any policy that would be violated if the clause were to be enforced. Instead, they merely note the\n    <em>\n     absence\n    </em>\n    of any public policy concerns about providing a neutral forum for dispute resolution (a concern that, they say, is present largely in international cases). In any event, to the extent that defendants suggest that the presumptive validity of forum selection clauses applies only in international disputes, they fail to persuade that is consistent with the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    For the first time in their supplemental brief, defendants argue, in highly conclusory fashion, that the School should not be subject to the forum selection clause because it is not a party to the Power Purchase Agreement between TCC and the Church. Defendants cite no supporting legal authority, and their eleventh-hour argument is beyond the issue for which supplemental briefing was permitted. In any event, defendants fail to persuade. The School entered into the Guaranty, which purports to guarantee the Church's obligations under the Power Purchase Agreement. Moreover, there is an apparent affiliation between the Church and the School and both contracts were signed on their behalf by Dr. Shinn. (Shinn Decl., Exs. B &amp; C). The School fairly is subject to the Power Purchase Agreement's forum selection clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Defendants have not met their heavy burden to prove that the forum selection clause was the product of overreaching or that its enforcement is contrary to public policy. The parties nevertheless dispute whether the court is to consider both private and public factors under the traditional \u00a7 1404(a) analysis or whether the modified\n    <em>\n     Atlantic Marine\n    </em>\n    analysis applies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <strong>\n     3.\n     <em>\n      Atlantic Marine\n     </em>\n     governs the transfer analysis\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    As previewed above, TCC contends that under\n    <em>\n     Atlantic Marine\n    </em>\n    , the forum selection clause is to be given \"controlling weight in all but the most exceptional circumstances,\" and the court does not consider the parties' private interests (deeming those factors to weigh entirely in favor of the preselected forum) and considers only the public interest factors in its analysis.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 581-82. Many courts (including this one) have concluded that the modified\n    <em>\n     Atlantic Marine\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    analysis applies only to mandatory clauses.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Emphasizing that the forum selection clause says that the parties \"submit to the\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      non-exclusive\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    jurisdiction of any State or Federal court located in San Jose, California,\" defendants maintain that the forum selection clause is permissive and that the modified\n    <em>\n     Atlantic Marine\n    </em>\n    analysis therefore does not apply. (Shinn Decl., Ex. C, Power Purchase Agreement \u00b6 22) (emphasis added).

Nevertheless, TCC having chosen to sue here, the express waiver precludes objections based on venue or inconvenient forum-in effect, rendering the clause mandatory with respect to this action. Accordingly, the court agrees with TCC that the modified\n    <em>\n     Atlantic Marine\n    </em>\n    analysis applies and thus, private-interest factors are deemed to weigh entirely in favor of the present forum, and the court considers only the public interest factors.\n    <em>\n     Atlantic Marine\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n     134 S.Ct. at 582\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

Local interest in the lawsuit\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    TCC plausibly asserts that California has an interest in having a local business's claim decided here. Defendants reiterate arguments that certain underlying events took place in New Jersey. But, for this factor, the court \"ask[s] only if there is an identifiable local interest in the controversy, not whether another forum also has an interest.\"\n    <em>\n     Boston Telecommunications\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496362\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/1201/#p1211\">\n     588 F.3d at 1211\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Accordingly, this factor weighs against transfer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <strong>\n     b. Court's familiarity with the law\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The Power Purchase Agreement and Guaranty provide that California law governs. Defendants point out that basic contract law elements are the same in California and New Jersey; and, this court finds that New Jersey courts are capable of applying California law. However, as TCC argues, this court undoubtedly is more familiar with California law. Moreover, as discussed above, the parties agreed to the governing law provisions in the contracts between them. This factor weighs against transfer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <strong>\n     c.

This factor is neutral.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    <strong>\n     f. TCC's choice of forum\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    As the plaintiff in this action, TCC's choice of forum is given deference. And, indeed, for all the reasons discussed above, TCC's decision to sue here coincides with the preselected forum, as to which no objections based on venue or inconvenient forum may be made.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    In any event, defendants have not made a sufficiently strong showing of inconvenience to overcome TCC's choice.\n    <em>\n     Decker Coal Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1111501\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/805/834/#p842\">\n     805 F.2d at 843\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . They argue that TCC's choice should receive minimal consideration, pointing out that they negotiated and signed the subject agreements in New Jersey. But, as discussed above, the parties' contracts were also negotiated and executed in California by TCC. Defendants note that TCC's communications (i.e., the demand letters and the letter advising that it had retained counsel to pursue collection efforts) were directed to defendants in New Jersey. But, defendants have not explained why that fact makes California any more inconvenient for defendants than New Jersey is for plaintiff.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    That leaves defendants' argument that the court should consider the Green Life Solar Installation Contract, which contains a forum selection clause designating New Jersey as the place for dispute resolution. Defendants essentially argue that the Installation Contract's forum selection clause should be given precedence over the Power Purchase Agreement's forum selection clause because the Installation Contract concerned the \"main\" solar project, whereas the Power Purchase Agreement pertains to the project's funding. They contend that the Power Purchase Agreement was \"subsumed\" within the Installation Contract because (1) the Church's obligations under the Installation Contract were conditioned on obtaining financing with TCC through the Power Purchase Agreement; and (2) the Power Purchase Agreement, in turn, requires the Church to \"cause the [solar power system] to be designed, engineered, installed and constructed in accordance with the terms of the Installation Contract.\" (Shinn Decl., Ex. B at 1; Ex. C at \u00b6 2.1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Based on the record and arguments presented, defendants fail to convince. Although certain factors suggest that the Installation Contract and Power Purchase Agreement are intertwined, defendants have not cited authority addressing the circumstances presented here-where one side seeks to enforce a forum selection clause in a contract (not at issue) against a non-signatory who seeks to enforce a competing forum selection clause in a different contract that is at issue. For that reason, defendants' citation to\n    <em>\n     Medina v. OANDA Corp.\n    </em>\n    , No. 5:16-cv-02170 EJD,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201159572\">\n     2017 WL 1159572\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (N.D. Cal., Mar. 29, 2017) is unpersuasive. In\n    <em>\n     Medina\n    </em>\n    , the court concluded that a forum selection clause in a customer contract between the parties applied to their dispute over plaintiff's account (even though the plaintiff was not suing on that agreement), because that contract contained a clause that broadly covered not only proceedings that arose \"directly or indirectly under the Agreement,\" but also those that arose \"in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *10. That does not fit the situation here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Because the majority of public interest factors weighs against transfer, with others being neutral, the court concludes that defendants' motion for transfer should be denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Based on the foregoing, the court denies defendants' Fed.

As noted, however, the situation here is the reverse of that presented in\n     <em>\n      Atlantic Marine\n     </em>\n     , in that it is plaintiff TCC who argues that the forum selection clause prevents this case from being transferred away from this district, its chosen forum.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-115\">\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      GDG Acquisitions, LLC v.
