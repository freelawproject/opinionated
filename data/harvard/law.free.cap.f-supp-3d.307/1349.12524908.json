PSOF at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Avalon was owned by David Unger and Benjamin Brandes. DSOF at \u00b6 3. Avalon was licensed by the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") as a Small Business Investment Company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.

The goal of the SBA Receiver was to marshal and liquidate all assets of Avalon and to satisfy the claims of creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. David Unger and Benjamin Brandes were dismissed as officers and directors of Avalon in the same Consent Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.

He administered the Receivership including facilitating potential sales of Window and Unite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Stern testified that the SBA Receiver was the majority stockholder of Avalon and had ownership interest in Unite and Window, but it \"did not step into the shoes of any of the officers or directors of these two [companies], nor did it direct-contrary to what has been alleged, the receiver never directed the operations of Window or Unite.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stern Depo. at 7, 13-14 [Doc. 20].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Stern further clarified that the SBA Receiver was actually a committee of three people-Thomas Morris, Director; Jerome Fowlkes, Financial Analyst; and Arlene Messinger, in-house attorney for the Receiver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.

DSOF at \u00b6 14. By the third and fourth quarters of 2009, Window and Unite had about 100 employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff was aware that the companies were required to make payroll tax deposits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Until about March 2009, both Window\n   and Unite used a third-party payroll company, Netchex, to automatically process and remit payroll tax withholding to the IRS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. After March 2009, payroll tax deposits for Window and Unite were made manually.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff learned that Window and Unite were no longer using Netchex when he returned from medical leave but did not take any action to change that.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Window and Unite did not use any special procedures to ensure payroll tax deposits were made or to segregate trust fund withholdings from general operational funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Beginning in March 2009 through the end of 2009, Window and Unite failed to pay numerous payroll tax deposits and ran up substantial payroll tax debts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. A portion of the taxes are trust fund taxes which are owed by Window's and Unite's employees and withheld from their wages by the company and held in trust for the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff participated in financial decisions for Window and Unite, such as signing and reviewing terms of a loan agreement in December 2007 in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. After the SBA Receivership began, Plaintiff continued to participate in financial decisions for both companies, including evaluating and making recommendations about offers to purchase Window and Unite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff managed a three-person accounting staff and had the authority to change accounting policies and procedures for Window and Unite in conjunction with the Chief Executive Officer and other officers so as to effectuate major accounting changes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. During the time period at issue, Window and Unite did not use an outside accountant and all accounting functions were handled internally by Plaintiff and his staff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Plaintiff prepared and filed Window's and Unite's Form 1065 partnership tax returns and Schedules K-1 from 2007 through 2009. He also prepared their Forms 1120.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. During the third and fourth quarters of 2009, Plaintiff had signature authority over Window's and Unite's bank accounts and lines of credit, as well as a corporate credit card he used to pay vendors and other creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Stern testified that he did not have any responsibility for filing or paying taxes for Window or Unite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stern Depo. at 35. He testified that the Receiver \"did not take over the operation, finances, the hiring, the firing, the publication, or any other aspect of either company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36. Mr. Stern testified that the Receivership did not have the ability to file any tax returns or to make any tax decisions for Window or Unite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Prior to the Receivership, Plaintiff's ordinary procedure for paying operating expenses was to review with his accounting staff invoices as they were received, enter them into the companies' QuickBooks programs, and pay bills. DSOF at \u00b6 29. After May 2009, Plaintiff reviewed monthly financial reports which included cash flow and outstanding accounts receivable. Plaintiff periodically sent these reports to the SBA Receiver and Michael Kitchens, Chief Operating Officer of Window and Unite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. On several occasions during the third and fourth quarters of 2009, Plaintiff paid employee salaries out of his own funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. Plaintiff filed annual financial reports for Window and Unite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. He also filed Limited Liability Company registrations for Window and Unite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. Plaintiff had the authority to hire and fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. Plaintiff also had the authority as an officer of Window\n   to decide whether to accept a Settlement Agreement related to a dispute with a Washington, D.C. landlord.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36 (citing [Doc. 23-18, Ex. 16] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Window and Unite maintained a bank account with M &amp; T Bank which was used for both payroll and operating expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. During the third and fourth quarters of 2009, Plaintiff regularly signed payroll checks from the Window and Unite M &amp; T bank account, either by hand or with a signature stamp.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. Plaintiff supervised the accounting staff of Window and Unite who wrote checks from the companies' M &amp; T bank accounts to pay operating expenses and payroll.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. As Chief Financial Officer for Window and Unite, Plaintiff maintained payroll records, including federal and state tax deposit withholding information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. Until 2007, Window's and Unite's quarterly payroll tax returns (Form 941) were prepared by an outside accountant. After that time, Plaintiff prepared and filed the Forms 941.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. Plaintiff signed and delinquently filed Window's and Unite's Forms 941 for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 on January 28, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. Plaintiff stated he was aware of the deadline, but did not timely file the forms \"due to an oversight\" caused by inadequate staffing in the accounting department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff knew that Window and Unite were not remitting payroll tax deposits as early as May 8, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44. Plaintiff compiled detailed schedules of payroll tax withholding from both state and federal jurisdictions. On several occasions, Plaintiff provided these schedules to the SBA Receiver noting that the payroll tax withholdings were not being paid over in order to pay other operating expenses of Window and Unite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. During the third and fourth quarters of 2009, Plaintiff continued to be aware that withheld payroll taxes were not being paid over the IRS in order to pay other operating expenses, such as payments to drivers, printers, and employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. He testified that the \"payroll taxes could have been paid\" but then the \"companies would have been shut down. The critical vendors would not have been paid, so taxes could have been paid.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Myers Depo. at 53 [Doc. 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff was concerned about the possibility that he would face personal liability as a result of his failure to remit Window's and Unite's withheld payroll taxes to the IRS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DSOF at \u00b6 47. On October 14, 2009, Plaintiff stated he was concerned about his liabilities because \"certain decisions have been made\" in order to keep the businesses open until a buyer could be found.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In October 2009, Plaintiff sought and obtained legal counsel in anticipation of these liabilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff and the Board of Directors for Window and Unite obtained outside counsel and filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 on November 13, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49. The SBA Receiver was not involved in the decision to file bankruptcy, first learned of the bankruptcy after the petition had been filed, and was informed by Plaintiff that Window and Unite would wind up and close their offices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 4, 2014, a delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury assessed trust fund penalties with respect to Unite Media, LLC against Steven Myers pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206671\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 6672 for the tax period September 30, 2009 in the amount\n   of $98,558.17 and for the tax period December 31, 2009 in the amount of $30,592.59.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206671\">\n    at \u00b6 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff contends that once Avalon was put into receivership, the Receiver was the only one with the power and authority to control Avalon, as well as Window and Unite, in which Avalon held a controlling interest. Because Plaintiff did not have any authority or control to decide which creditor to pay, he avers he cannot be a \"responsible person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Government contends that Plaintiff was both a responsible person and willfully failed to pay the payroll taxes because Plaintiff had the responsibility for collecting, accounting for, or paying the taxes withheld from Window's and Unite's employees. Plaintiff was aware of the fact that the trust fund taxes were not being paid and despite that knowledge, paid other creditors first. The Government asserts that the SBA Receiver took over Avalon, but did not take over the day-to-day operations of Window and Unite so as to either relieve Plaintiff of his status as a \"responsible person\" or provide him any defense for not assuring that the payroll taxes were remitted to the IRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

He had control over the corporations' financial affairs with the authority to disburse funds. As a certified public accountant and a comptroller for other companies, Plaintiff had the financial sophistication to understand the nature of the payroll tax deduction and trust fund system. He was responsible for making the tax filings of Window and Unite. He had the authority to hire and fire. Plaintiff played an important role with the other corporate officers in making financial decisions, especially as Window and Unite had increasing business problems, including signing and reviewing the terms of $750,000 and $500,000 loans with M &amp; T Bank. He also gave final approval-at the request of Brian Stern-for a settlement agreement regarding litigation with the landlord of the companies' Washington, D.C. office space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   After David Unger left Avalon on July 15, 2009, Plaintiff became Co-President of Avalon and Chief Financial Officer of Window and Unite. He managed a three person accounting team which handled payments to Window's and Unite's payments to creditors and vendors. The accounting staff had to prepare and file tax returns for Window and Unite. Plaintiff, himself, signed the companies' Form 941 quarterly tax returns. Plaintiff had the authority to write checks and disburse funds. Because Window's and Unite's payroll tax withholdings were never segregated from their general operating funds, Plaintiff had the ability to pay the payroll taxes from those funds because he had the check writing authority over those funds. Finally, Plaintiff, along with the other corporate officers of Window and Unite-and without the knowledge, input, or approval of the SBA Receiver-made the decision to place Window and Unite into bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   With respect to \"willfulness,\" Plaintiff certainly knew that Window and Unite were not paying their payroll taxes as early as May 8, 2009. He provided other corporate officers and the SBA Receiver with records showing that Window and Unite had unpaid payroll tax withholdings. And Plaintiff regularly made payments to other creditors such as vendors, printers, drivers, and other employees instead of setting aside the payroll taxes. Plaintiff understood the gravity of the situation because he was concerned about his personal liability for the taxes. This would appear to establish willfulness as a matter of law, but Plaintiff argues that he had reasonable cause for his failure because he claims he was directed by the SBA Receiver to not pay the taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Essentially, Plaintiff's argument boils down to (1) the SBA Receiver told him not to pay the taxes and (2) he had to follow the instructions of the Receiver because the Receiver was an arm of the federal government. The Court extensively recited above Plaintiff's testimony concerning instructions he was given by Brian Stern, the principal agent for the SBA Receiver. Even Plaintiff's own testimony; however, shows that Mr. Stern never gave him an explicit instruction not to pay the taxes, although there is no dispute that Mr. Stern was at least aware of the fact that the payroll taxes were not being remitted to the Government at the same time that certain creditors and vendors were being paid. At most, Plaintiff testifies that Mr. Stern suggested as much because he told Plaintiff that he needed to \"sharpen his pencil\" and find the money somewhere as Mr. Stern wanted the businesses to operate as long as they could in order to facilitate a sale to a third party. As such, the Court finds there is no evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the SBA Receiver explicitly instructed Plaintiff not to pay the taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Even if the Court were to find that a reasonable jury could determine that Mr. Stern's instructions were close enough to an order not to pay the payroll taxes, that does not mean that Plaintiff is no longer a \"responsible person\" under the statute. First, the Court finds no evidence in the record to support Plaintiff's claim that the SBA Receiver is an arm or agency of the federal government. The authority of the SBA Receiver stems from the Consent Order entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, not any executive branch agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consent Order [Doc. 18, Ex. 9]. The Consent Order applies to Avalon only. The terms of the Order state that the Receiver is appointed for the purpose of \"administering, marshalling and, if necessary, liquidating all of Avalon's assets to satisfy the claims of creditors, therefrom in the order of priority as determined by this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1. The Receiver \"shall have powers, authorities, rights and privileges heretofore possessed by the general partners, managers, officers, and directors of Avalon under applicable state and federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Plaintiff argues that he lost all power to do anything when the Receiver was appointed but the undisputed facts show otherwise. While it is true, as Plaintiff argues, that Avalon holds a majority interest in Window and Unite and thereby has certain voting rights with respect to the Board of Directors of Window and Unite, these rights say nothing about the day-to-day operation of Window and Unite. The undisputed testimony is that Plaintiff and the other corporate officers and staff of Window and Unite continued in their roles and continued to run the companies on a day-to-day basis even after the appointment of the Receiver. In Receivership, Plaintiff continued to direct the accounting staff of Window and Unite, he filed tax returns for the corporation, and signed checks, including\n   to vendors and employee payroll. None of those responsibilities was removed from his authority when the Receiver arrived. The fact that illustrates this reality most dramatically is that Plaintiff and the other corporate officers of Window and Unite voted to enter bankruptcy without even notifying or seeking any input from the SBA Receiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was Plaintiff's view alone that the SBA Receiver was speaking with the voice of the United States Government. No person on behalf of the Receivership ever indicated so to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Morris Depo. at 71.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Second, as the survey of Eleventh Circuit case law above demonstrates, the Court is unimpressed with arguments that \"my boss told me not to pay the taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thosteson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9115000\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1294/#p1298\">\n    331 F.3d at 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Acting, or rather failing to act, under orders from his superior does not negate his culpability under the statute.\");\n   <em>\n    Thibodeau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747946\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/1499/\">\n    828 F.2d at 1499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   as case which \"hold[s] that an otherwise responsible person cannot be relieved of this obligation when directed by another person not to pay the taxes\");\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539636\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/779/1567/\">\n    779 F.2d at 1572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (once taxpayer became \"responsible person,\" he was obligated by statute to pay these funds to IRS despite specific instructions from his corporate president to the contrary and rejecting district court's analysis that failure to follow instructions of corporate president was tantamount to embezzlement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth National Bank of Dallas v.
