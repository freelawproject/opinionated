(the \"Defendant\" or \"Mitsubishi\") alleging claims of breach of contract, breach of warranty and negligence regarding materials supplied for a construction project in New York City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is a motion by the Plaintiffs, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\" FED. R. CIV. P. \" or \"Rule\") 15 to amend the Plaintiffs' claims for breach of contract and breach of warranty, in accordance with this Court's Memorandum and Order dated September 19, 2017 (the \"Order\"). For the following reasons, the Plaintiffs' motion to amend is granted with respect to the breach of contract claim and denied with respect to the breach of warranty claim. As such, the Plaintiffs may only proceed with the breach of contract claim against Mitsubishi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As the Court has already detailed the factual allegations at issue in this motion in its Order, and the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, they will not be repeated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Relevant Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 27, 2017, the Plaintiffs commenced this action by filing the complaint\n   in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Suffolk County. The complaint set forth three causes of action: breach of contract, negligence and breach of warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 23, 2017, the Defendant filed a Notice of Removal, removing the action to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 20, 2017, the Defendant filed a motion to dismiss all of the Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). In the Plaintiffs' opposition memorandum, the Plaintiffs agreed to withdraw their negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the Court's Order, dated September 19, 2017, the Court dismissed the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") without prejudice, finding both the breach of contract and breach of warranty claim insufficient. Specifically, the Court found that the breach of contract claim \"failed to properly specify what the agreement ... consisted of and which provisions of any such agreement were violated.\" Order at 11-12. Further, the Court concluded that the Plaintiffs' consequential damages claim was conclusory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-15. With respect to the breach of warranty claim, the Plaintiffs failed to \"provid[e] allegations as to the existence of an express promise or representation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. The Plaintiffs were granted leave to file a motion to amend the FAC in a manner consistent with FED. R. CIV. P. 15 within thirty days of the Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 18, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the FAC. Attached to the motion was a proposed Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"). As this motion was filed within thirty days of the Order, the Court deems it timely. The Plaintiffs claim that the breach of contract claim is addressed by identifying the contract, the terms at issue, and the nature of the breaches. Allegedly, the SAC \"specifically pleads that consequential damages were both reasonably foreseeable and specifically contemplated by the parties at the time of contracting.\" Docket Entry (\"DE\") 15-1 at 5. The SAC also purportedly includes the warranty, the terms at issue, as well as the nature of the breaches.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. The Defendant maintains that the Plaintiffs fail to correct the deficiencies of the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a), which typically governs a motion to amend a complaint, states, in relevant part, \"A party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(2).

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In the SAC, the Plaintiffs specifically identify the Purchase Orders as the contract-at-issue for the breach of contract claim. They allege that the Defendant breached the contract when the Defendant failed \"to provide goods and materials that were conforming, acceptable, and in accordance with the specifications contained in the June 1, 2016 Purchase Orders[.]\" SAC \u00b6 97;\n   <em>\n    accord id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-106.

The SAC clearly does refer to agreements other than the Purchase Orders. However, the Plaintiffs have limited their breach of contract claim to breaches of the Purchase Orders. While other agreements may be relevant to the claim,\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the failure to comply with the terms of the Purchase Orders constitutes a breach of contract claim. In the Court's view, the Plaintiffs' identification of the contract-at-issue as well as the specific provisions upon which the claim is based is legally sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stadt v.

A claim for breach of contract cannot be sustained simply by a conclusory statement that the accused breached a contract.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Further, the Court finds that the remainder of the Defendant's contentions regarding the contract claim are premature at the current stage. Accepting the Plaintiffs' allegations in the SAC as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have satisfied the liberal pleading standard and has adequately pled that the Defendant breached the contract-at-issue. As such, the Court finds that the proposed changes to the breach of contract claim in the SAC are not futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Consequential Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Defendant further claims that the Plaintiffs' consequential damages claim under its breach of contract claim is deficient because the pleading lacks any factual basis. In opposition, the Plaintiffs contend that they sufficiently pled that the Defendant's breach caused foreseeable damage, including \"lost operational expenses due to underutilization of plant and operational capacities; extended project specific overhead expenses; costs associated with repeated production stops and re-starts and including; labor, equipment, and safety coordination costs and other expenses resulting from out of sequence work and demobilization and remobilization; engineering and labor replacement costs; material costs; project schedule recovery and damage mitigation costs.\" SAC \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In a breach of contract action, a plaintiff may seek two types of damages: (a) general damages to compensate the plaintiff based on the value of the performance that was promised in the contract; and (b) consequential damages, which provide additional compensation.\n   <em>\n    Lorena Intern.

Mitsubishi claims that the warranty is void because of the watermark on it indicating that it is a sample, as well as the lack of customer information written into the document. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court sees no reason why a sample agreement is insufficient to establish the existence of a material statement amounting to a warranty.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salon Fad v.

Sept. 14, 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   However, the SAC fails to allege that the warranty terms that the Plaintiffs cite were breached. Specifically, the Plaintiffs contend that Mitsubishi breached Sections A &amp; B(1)-(2) of the warranty, which covers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. Peel, check or crack except for such slight crazing or cracking as may occur on tightly roll-formed edges or brake bends at the time of forming pre-painted sheets, which is accepted as standard; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   B.

The gloss shall be measured using standard procedures as defined by \"Standard Test Method for Specular Gloss\", ASTM D523-89.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   SAC, Ex. P at 1. An examination of the SAC reveals that, even in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, there are no facts that allege a breach of the pertinent sections of the warranty. Rather, the Plaintiffs claim that the panels were \"inconsistent,\" \"not consistent in color, finish, or quality,\" contained \"significant and material differences,\" featured \"a different gloss than that used in the samples,\" \"differen[t] in the clear coat of the sheets,\" and contained \"a 'Mica' basecoat paint, rather than the 'Metallic' basecoat paint specified in the Purchase Orders.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 50-55. There is no allegations that the coating peeled, checked or cracked, chalked, faded, changed in color in excess of 5 color difference units or that gloss loss exceeded 40%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC. There are no facts that give rise to an inference that the warranty-at-issue was violated in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court notes that the Defendant addresses the Plaintiffs' vague references to various implied warranties. As the Plaintiffs fail to address that argument, it is deemed waived. Any attempt by the Plaintiffs to amend the FAC to include a claim regarding implied warranties is considered futile by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, the Plaintiffs allege for the first time in their reply brief, for the first time in this case, that in addition to the contract-based warranty claim, the Defendant violated Section 2-313 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code (\"NYUCC\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 25 at 20.

Accordingly, plaintiff's express warranty claim is not adequately pleaded and should be dismissed.\")\n   <em>\n    modified on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"93768\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/988/753/\">\n    988 F.Supp. 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   There is no reference to \u00a7 2-313 in the SAC. The sole mention of the NYUCC contained in the SAC alleges, in pertinent part, \"[t]hat the defendant ... breached express and implied warranties, including but not limited to the breach of implied warranties as to merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose as set out in the Uniform Commercial Code.\" SAC \u00b6 118. This is insufficient to assert a viable cause of action. The Plaintiffs' vague mention of the Uniform Commercial Code is ambiguous and from what the Court can glean, unconnected to a \u00a7 2-313 claim. Attempting to piece together disparate factual allegations in the SAC that could conceivably makeup a \u00a7 2-313 violation without expressly informing the Court what the express warranty is fails to satisfy the applicable pleading standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Further, the Plaintiffs have never referred to a NYUCC violation in any of their prior complaints or other pleadings. All prior pleadings allege\n   <em>\n    contractually-based\n   </em>\n   express warranty claims and failed to allege that any\n   <em>\n    separate, NYUCC-based\n   </em>\n   express warranties were breached. There was no attempt to assert such a claim prior to their reply brief. As such, the Plaintiffs' attempt to amend the FAC to add a NYUCC-based breach of warranty claim is denied as futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Accordingly, to the extent the Plaintiffs assert a claim for breach of warranty against the Defendant, the motion to amend that claim is denied as futile. The Plaintiffs' breach of warranty claim is hereby dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the reasons stated above, it is hereby:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , that the Plaintiffs' motion to amend is granted to the extent that the Court accepts the SAC as it pertains to the breach of contract claim; and it is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , that the Plaintiffs' motion to amend is otherwise denied; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , that the Plaintiffs' breach of warranty claim is hereby dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   It is\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
