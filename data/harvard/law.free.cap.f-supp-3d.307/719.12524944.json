GRAHAM, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Scioto Greenways Project in downtown Columbus reshaped the Scioto River by removing the Main Street Dam and narrowing and deepening the river channel. Plaintiffs CSX Transportation, Inc. and Norfolk Southern Railway Company each operate two railroad tracks that run across a bridge spanning the Scioto River a few hundred feet downstream of where the Main Street Dam was located. Knowing that the Project would affect the river's flow, CSX and Norfolk entered into contractual arrangements in 2014 with defendant Columbus Downtown Development\n   Corporation (CDDC). CDDC agreed to implement measures designed to protect the bridge's piers from \"scour,\" or the erosion of sediment around the bridge's foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they discovered in 2015 that the bridge had become unstable and shifted and that they spent $10 million to repair the bridge. Plaintiffs allege that CDDC and defendants Messer Construction Company (the construction manager at risk) and George J. Igel &amp; Company (a subcontractor) are liable for the damage because they failed to properly implement the scour protection measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The filing of the complaint, which has been amended, triggered the filing of third-party complaints and numerous counter- and cross-claims against entities involved in the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pending before the court are five motions for judgment on the pleadings-two filed by third-party defendant Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. and three filed by Messer. These motions seek dismissal of certain indemnification and contribution claims brought against the movants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Relationships Among the Parties\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to the start of the Project, CDDC contracted with Stantec to serve as the project engineer, as memorialized in a Professional Design Services Agreement of July 2, 2012. (Doc. 82-1). CDDC retained Stantec to complete geotechnical explorations and to conduct a hydraulic and scour analysis at the CSX bridge. Stantec prepared a written report concerning river restoration and greenspace development along a 1.2 mile stretch of the Scioto River. Stantec also provided design and engineering plans, which included bridge scour protection measures for the bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Stantec entered into a Subconsultant Agreement with third-party defendant MSK2 LLC on July 6, 2012. (Doc. 100-1). MSK2 agreed to provide support and park design services in connection with the Project. Stantec alleges that MSK2 prepared landscape designs which called for the removal of existing vegetation and for the planting of plants, shrubs and other vegetation throughout the Project's 1.2 mile stretch. (Doc. 100 at PAGEID # 1096, \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CDDC hired Messer in October 2012 to serve as the construction manager for the Project under a Standard Form of Agreement for Construction Manager at Risk (the \"CM Agreement\"). (Doc. 95 at PAGEID # 1036, \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Messer in turn entered into a Subcontracting Agreement with Igel whereby Igel agreed to perform river channel excavation work and related services. (Doc. 76-1). Messer alleges that the Subcontracting Agreement required Igel to perform scour protection work at the bridge piers. (Doc. 76 at PAGEID # 701, \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is alleged that Igel entered into some type of contract directly with CDDC. (Doc. 98 at PAGEID # 1049, \u00b6 5). Igel denies the existence of such a contract. (Doc. 106 at PAGEID # 1165, \u00b6 1). A copy of the alleged contract between Igel and CDDC is not on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   CSX and Norfolk have an agreement between themselves that CSX is the party responsible for maintenance and repair of the bridge. (Doc. 70 at PAGEID # 634, \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At some point, CSX retained third-party defendant STV Incorporated. STV provided\n   engineering services and reviewed Stantec's scour protection plans for CSX. (Doc. 41 at PAGEID # 187, \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 1, 2014, after the Main Street Dam had been removed, CSX entered into a Construction Agreement with CDDC. CSX granted a license to CDDC to access and cross the bridge and CDDC agreed to \"[c]onstruct grouted riprap scour protections around [the] bridge piers.\" (Doc. 99-1 at PAGEID # 1072). Section 1.1 of the Agreement provided that CSX had reviewed and approved of the various design plans prepared by Stantec. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at PAGEID # 1065). A schedule attached to the Agreement and signed by Messer provided that Messer would serve as CDDC's contractor to perform the work and would abide by the Agreement between CSX and CDDC. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at PAGEID # 1084).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In September and October of 2014, Norfolk entered into right of entry agreements with CDDC and with Messer, granting them access to Norfolk's lines on the bridge. (Doc. 99-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Parties' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   According to the amended complaint, CSX discovered in April 2015 that the bridge \"had shifted because it piers had settled and become unstable.\" (Doc. 70 at PAGEID # 633, \u00b6 21). CSX conducted an investigation, which led it to believe that \"CDDC and its contractors failed to protect, and/or undermined the structural integrity of the Bridge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 22). In order to keep the railroad tracks over the bridge in service, CSX had the bridge repaired and stabilized at a cost of $10 million. CSX demanded that CDDC and Messer pay the costs for the repairs, but they refused to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The amended complaint asserts claims for breach of contract against CDDC and Messer. CSX alleges that CDDC and Messer, in breach of the Construction Agreement, either failed to install scour protection, installed it improperly, or otherwise compromised the integrity of the bridge. Norfolk alleges that CDDC and Messer, in breach of the Right of Entry Agreements, performed their work in a manner that interfered with Norfolk's rail operations. CSX and Norfolk also assert claims for contractual indemnification against CDDC and Messer. In the alternative, plaintiffs allege that CDDC's and Messer's negligence in performing work on the Project caused damage to the bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Against Igel, plaintiffs assert a negligence claim alleging that Igel failed to properly install scour protection and left the bridge susceptible to damage in the course of dredging near the bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   CSX and Norfolk have also sued Cincinnati Insurance Company, from whom CDDC obtained Railroad Protective Liability insurance policies identifying CSX and Norfolk as named insureds. Plaintiffs allege that Cincinnati Insurance has breached the insurance policies by refusing to pay their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Igel's Third-Party Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Igel brings claims against Stantec, STV and MSK2. (Doc. 74). Igel denies that it was negligent in performing work on the Project. It asserts that Stantec's designs and plans for scour protection were flawed and negligently prepared. Igel further alleges that STV, having been retained by CSX to review Stantec's scour protection plans, performed its review services negligently and improperly approved of the plans. As to MSK2, Igel alleges that its landscaping designs directed contractors to remove trees and shrubs which were growing from the base of the bridge piers and that removal of the trees and shrubs left holes which caused the bridge's foundation to shift or settle. Igel alleges that the damage to the bridge was proximately\n   caused by the negligent acts of Stantec, STV and MSK2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Against each of these three parties Igel asserts a claim for implied indemnification. Igel alleges that, to the extent it is found liable for any portion of the damage to the bridge, its actions were passive and secondary to the active and primary negligence of Stantec, STV and MSK2. Igel also asserts claims for contribution against Stantec, STV and MSK2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Messer's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Messer brings crossclaims against Igel, Stantec and STV. (Doc. 76). Messer alleges that, to the extent it is found liable for the damage to the bridge, it is entitled to express indemnification under its Subcontracting Agreement with Igel. Messer further asserts claims for implied indemnification and contribution against Igel, Stantec and STV, alleging that its actions were passive and secondary to the active and primary negligence of those parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Messer also brings crossclaims for implied indemnification and contribution against MSK2. (Doc. 90).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Messer has filed a third-party complaint Ohio Farmers Insurance Company. (Doc. 77). Messer alleges that on December 11, 2013, Igel obtained a performance bond from Ohio Farmers, in accordance with the terms of Messer's Subcontracting Agreement with Igel. Messer alleges that the terms of the bond imposed a surety obligation on Ohio Farmers. Messer asserts claims for express and implied indemnification and contribution, alleging that Messer is entitled to recovery from Ohio Farmers as surety for Igel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    4. CDDC's Crossclaims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CDDC brings a crossclaim against Stantec. (Doc. 89). CDDC alleges that it retained Stantec to prepare scour protection plans for the bridge but that Stantec did not exercise ordinary care in performing its professional design services. CDDC alleges that Stantec failed to properly determine the impact of river flow on the piers and failed to design appropriate scour countermeasures. CDDC asserts claims for professional negligence, breach of the Professional Design Services Agreement, contractual indemnification and contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   CDDC also brings a crossclaim against STV. (Doc. 50). It alleges that STV, upon reviewing Stantec's plans on behalf of CSX, recommended that certain changes be made, including using non-grouted riprap instead of grouted riprap. CDDC alleges that the changes made by STV resulted in damage to the bridge, and it asserts claims for implied indemnification and contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Stantec's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Stantec brings a crossclaim against Messer, alleging that the CM Agreement between CDDC and Messer contained an indemnity clause which obligates Messer to indemnify the \"Indemnified Parties\" for claims and damages arising in connection with the Project. (Docs. 95). Stantec asserts a claim for indemnification, alleging that it falls within the definition of \"Indemnified Parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Stantec asserts crossclaims against MSK2. (Doc. 100). Stantec alleges that pursuant to their Subconsultant Agreement, MSK2 provided landscaping plans which directed contractors to remove trees and shrubs embedded in the bridge's piers. Stantec alleges that removal of the plants created holes which caused the bridge's foundation to shift. Stantec asserts claims for professional negligence, breach of the Subconsultant Agreement and contractual indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Stantec brings a counterclaim against CDDC. (Doc. 111). According to Stantec, the parties executed a modification of their Professional Design Services Agreement, providing that Stantec would receive $80,000 for performing additional services\n   not contemplated by the Agreement. Stantec asserts a claim for breach of contract, alleging that it performed the additional services but CDDC failed to pay it the amount due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    6. MSK2's Crossclaims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   MSK2 brings crossclaims against Messer and Igel. (Docs. 97, 98). As to Messer, MSK2 makes allegations and claims similar to what Stantec made. MSK2 alleges that it is entitled to indemnification under the CM Agreement because MSK2 falls within the definition of \"Indemnified Parties.\" MSK2 asserts claims against Messer for indemnification and contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As to Igel, MSK2 alleges that Igel entered into a contract with CDDC. This contract allegedly contains the same indemnity clause which appears in the CM Agreement between Messer and CDDC. MSK2 alleges that it is one of the \"Indemnified Parties\" under the contract between Igel and CDDC because it falls within the definition of MSK2 asserts claims for indemnification and contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    7. STV's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   STV brings a counterclaim against Igel and crossclaims against Messer and CDDC. (Doc. 41). STV denies that it was negligent in reviewing, on behalf of CSX, Stantec's plans for scour protection. STV alleges that, to the extent it is found liable for any part of the damage to the bridge, its actions were passive and secondary to the active and primary negligence of Igel, Messer and CDDC. STV asserts claims for implied indemnification and contribution against these parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   STV has dismissed without prejudice crossclaims (doc. 41) that it had brought against Stantec for implied indemnification and contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"After the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial-a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). The standard applied to motions for judgment on the pleadings is the same standard applicable to motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hindel v.

Stantec prepared scour protection plans for the Project, in which Messer and Igel were also involved, but Stantec did not have direct dealings with those parties. Stantec relies on\n   <em>\n    Waverly City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.

App. Dec. 30, 2008). The Waverly school district and the Ohio School Facilities Commission (OSFC) agreed to co-fund and co-own a project to construct new school buildings. The school district entered into a Professional Design Services Agreement with Triad Architects, Inc. to design and construct HVAC systems for the project. Triad retained National Engineering, Ltd. to perform certain design services. After the new buildings opened, the coils in the HVAC systems froze and the school district and OSFC sued Triad for breach of contract and professional negligence. Triad filed a third-party complaint against National for breach of contract and indemnification. National then filed claims for indemnification against the school district and OSFC, alleging that the school district was negligent in maintaining and operating the HVAC systems and that OSFC was negligent in making a change to National's design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The appellate court in\n   <em>\n    Waverly\n   </em>\n   held that National failed to state a claim for indemnification against the school district and OSFC. It found, without further elaboration: \"National's only relationship to OSFC and Waverly is as Triad's subcontractor .... We find no authority for concluding that the tenuous relationships between the parties here are sufficient to create an implied contract of indemnity. Any liability that National may incur arises not as a result of any relationship to the alleged wrongdoers, but by virtue of National's contractual relationship with Triad.\"\n   <em>\n    Waverly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205423269\">\n    2008 WL 5423269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Stantec likens Messer and Igel to the subcontractor, National, in\n   <em>\n    Waverly\n   </em>\n   . Stantec emphasizes that it, like the school district and OSFC, did not have a direct relationship with the parties seeking indemnification. According to Stantec, Messer and Igel did not perform work on Stantec's behalf or under Stantec's control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The court finds Stantec's argument to be unpersuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Waverly\n   </em>\n   , the court rejected an indemnification claim brought by a subcontractor against the project's owners, who suffered injury when the coils froze. Here, Messer and Igel are not asserting claims against CSX, which suffered injury when the bridge shifted, but against Project Engineer Stantec. As alleged in the pleadings, Messer's and Igel's exposure to liability arises from their use of, and adherence to, Stantec's scour protection designs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, National did not allege that it relied on OSFC's change to the HVAC plans; rather, National alleged that OSFC made a subsequent change to National's \"original HVAC system design.\"\n   <em>\n    Waverly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205423269\">\n    2008 WL 5423269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   One Ohio court, after surveying the case law regarding the relationship\n   required to impose a duty to indemnify, observed that \"in all of them the uniting thread is the existence of a common duty toward or a common goal affecting the injured party shared by two or more persons of entities not otherwise acting in concert or in pari delicto.\"\n   <em>\n    Cochran v.

Ohio May 9, 2005) (stating that the primary and secondary tortfeasors must owe \"a common duty to the injured party\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although the court in\n   <em>\n    Waverly\n   </em>\n   did not explain its holding in terms of a common duty, the case illustrates the dividing line Ohio law creates in determining whether a right of implied indemnification arises. In\n   <em>\n    Waverly\n   </em>\n   , the parties from whom National sought indemnification-the school district and OSFC-were also the injured parties. It would have been nonsensical to speak of National sharing a common duty with the school district and OSFC to the injured parties. As the court in\n   <em>\n    Waverly\n   </em>\n   pointed out, National's exposure to liability did not arise because of its relationship to the alleged primary tortfeasors, but because of its contractual arrangement with Triad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here, by contrast, the pleadings allege the existence of relationships from which one can reasonably infer that Messer and Igel shared a common duty or goal with Stantec. Each party was hired to work on the Scioto Greenways Project, and specifically to provide scour protection for the CSX bridge. CDDC retained Stantec as the Project Engineer to conduct a hydraulic and scour analysis of the river and to prepare scour protection plans for the bridge. CDDC then hired Messer as the Construction Manager at Risk to deliver the Project, including implementing Stantec's scour protection plans. Messer in turn hired Igel as a subcontractor to perform scour protection work at the bridge piers in accordance with Stantec's plans. Thus, the pleadings sufficiently allege that Stantec, Messer and Igel had a common duty and a shared goal of providing scour protection to the bridge for the benefit of the injured parties, CSX and Norfolk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Stantec also relies on\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1726073\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/68/14/#p16\">\n    68 Ohio St.3d at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20N.E.2d%2030\">\n    623 N.E.2d at 31-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but that case too illustrates why the alleged relationships in this case are sufficient to support a claim. In\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   the parents of a newborn infant sued an obstetrician and a pediatrician for medical malpractice. The obstetrician's medical malpractice insurer asserted an indemnification claim against the pediatrician. The Ohio Supreme Court rejected the claim because the two physicians owed \"separate and distinct\" duties to the patient.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1726073\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/68/14/#p16\">\n    68 Ohio St.3d at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20N.E.2d%2030\">\n    623 N.E.2d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The obstetrician was responsible for delivering the infant, while the pediatrician was responsible for post-birth care. \"They acted independently of one\n   another and are, therefore, responsible only for the results of their own negligence, if negligent at all.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20N.E.2d%2030\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20N.E.2d%2030\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Stantec argues that it cannot be liable to indemnify Messer and Igel simply because each participated in the Project, much like the physicians in\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   did not owe a common duty merely because both \"were on the scene\" and provided care to the infant. Stantec asserts that Messer and Igel acted independently of Stantec in performing work on the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The court disagrees. The pleadings allege that Messer, Igel and Stantec each had specific and interrelated involvement in providing scour protection for the bridge. That is, Messer's and Igel's indemnification claims do not rest on their participation in the Project as a whole-the Project, after all, was broad in its scope. Rather, the claims rest on the parties' particular work on the same scour protection measures: Stantec designed them, Messer agreed to put them into place and Igel constructed or installed them. It is alleged that, unlike the physicians in\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   , Messer and Igel were not working independently of Stantec but were relying on and complying with Stantec's plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds that the pleadings sufficiently allege the existence of a relationship whereby Messer and Igel have a right of indemnification against Stantec.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

In\n   <em>\n    Mosser\n   </em>\n   , the State of Ohio hired an architecture firm (Munger) to design a new building for a medical college. Munger's design's included plans for a trench drain.

Mosser in turn hired a subcontractor (Western Waterproofing) to install a membrane lining in the trench drain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Water and mold were found inside the building after it was completed. To resolve the medical college's claims against it, Mosser spent $1 million to rebuild the trench drain. Mosser then sued Munger for implied indemnification.

Again, Messer and Igel deny negligence on their part. But they allege that if they are found to be liable to CSX and Norfolk-who claim that Messer and Igel negligently performed scour protection work on the bridge-then their liability should be shared by Stantec, who provided them with flawed scour protection plans. These allegations support a plausible inference of joint and several liability-that Messer and Igel participated in, cooperated with or adopted Stantec's actions pursuant to a common plan, or that Messer and Igel performed negligent work which combined with Stantec's negligent plans to produce a single injury to the bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Accordingly, Stantec's motions for judgment on the pleadings are denied as to the contribution claims of Messer and Igel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Messer's Motions as to the Indemnification Claims of Stantec and MSK2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Stantec (Project Engineer) and MSK2 (a subconsultant for Stantec) each assert crossclaims for contractual indemnification against Messer (Construction Manager at Risk). They allege that the Construction Manager at Risk Agreement\n   between CDDC and Messer contains an Indemnification Clause by which Messer agreed to indemnify all \"Indemnified Parties\" for claims and damages arising in connection with the Project. Stantec and MSK2 further allege that the term \"Indemnified Parties\" is defined to include the \"Architect/Engineer\" and other \"consultants.\" (Doc. 95 at PAGEID # 1037, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; Doc. 97 at PAGEID # 1044, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Neither Stantec nor MSK2 allege that they were parties or signatories to the CM Agreement. Messer contends that they must therefore show they were intended third-party beneficiaries in order to enforce the terms of the Agreement. They cannot do so, according to Messer, because the Agreement contained a separate provision, entitled \"No Third-Party Interest,\" expressing the intent of Messer and CDDC that no outside party have an enforceable interest in the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The court begins by noting that the CM Agreement is not a part of the record at this stage. Stantec and MSK2 did not attach it to their crossclaims; Messer did not attach the Agreement to its answers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(a) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c). Each of Messer's motions for judgment on the pleadings state that the Agreement is attached to the motion, but it is not. Stantec attached to its response brief a standard form document that Stantec says is a copy of the Agreement. (Doc. 119-1). But the attached document is unsigned and undated, and Stantec has not otherwise established that the document is a true and accurate copy of the CM Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   That being said, the document submitted by Stantec contains a No Third-Party Interest Clause whose language matches the language on which Messer relies in its motions for judgment on the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robins v.

Messer contends that one potential construction is that the Indemnification Clause is enforceable only by CDDC, who could demand indemnity on behalf of any third party covered by the provision. In the alternative, Messer argues that the No Third-Party Interest Clause should trump the Indemnification Clause because it provides a specific statement of the contracting parties' intention not to benefit third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The court finds that it is unable to resolve these interpretative issues at this stage.

The unsigned copy of the CM Agreement does not have such accompanying materials, but it is plausible that the executed Agreement in fact does. The court is unwilling to declare what the CM Agreement means as a matter of law when it is not assured that it has the whole Agreement before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   But even if having the whole Agreement would fail to shed further light on the parties' intentions regarding third parties, the court finds that Messer, the movant, has not shown that it is entitled to judgment on the pleadings. Messer's theory that the Agreement can be reasonably interpreted to mean that only CDDC can enforce the indemnity obligation is not well-developed or supported in the briefs. (Doc. 132 at PAGEID ## 1459-60) (citing cases that do not support the theory). It is not apparent to the court how it would be reasonable to interpret the Agreement as leaving the indemnification rights of all Indemnified Parties to the mercy of CDDC. Messer does not argue that CDDC, which had direct contractual relationships with other entities, including Stantec, separately agreed with any of the Indemnified Parties to enforce their rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Nor has Messer carried its burden as to the argument that the No Third-Party Interest Clause should prevail over the Indemnification Clause because it provides a more specific statement of the contracting parties' intention. Stantec and MSK2 have presented an equally plausible position from the pleadings that the Indemnification Clause is the more specific provision. Each clause contains an express statement of the parties' intentions-first, that Messer promises \"to the fullest extent permitted by the law\" to indemnify the\n   Indemnified Parties, and then, that no third party has a right or interest arising from the Agreement. The court is not convinced that the canon of contract interpretation relied upon by the parties will be what decides this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Finally, Messer cites\n   <em>\n    Walls, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Walls\n   </em>\n   building owner Atlantic asserted an indemnification claim against Walls based on a subcontract between general contractor Beers and subcontractor Walls to install drywall. The subcontract did not contain an indemnification clause, but it did incorporate by reference a general contract between Atlantic and Beers. The general contract provided that Beers would indemnify Atlantic and that, as added protection for Atlantic, Beers would procure agreements from its subcontractors to indemnify Atlantic (which Beers failed to do with Walls). The court found that the subcontract incorporated the general contract's provision that subcontractors would agree to indemnify Atlantic.\n   <em>\n    Walls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"637784\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/186/389/\">\n    186 Ga.

However, in determining whether Atlantic was an intended third-party beneficiary to the subcontract, the court found that the incorporated indemnity clause was trumped by the express language Beers and Walls used in the subcontract to state that there would be no third-party beneficiaries:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   [T]he subcontract specifically provides that Beers and Walls \"agree ...

Does Indemnification Cover Claims Between the Contracting Parties?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   CSX and Norfolk have asserted claims for contractual indemnification against Messer. CSX alleges that its Construction Agreement with CDDC and Messer contained an indemnification clause whereby CDDC and Messer agreed to indemnify CSX for all property damage arising from the negligence or misconduct of CDDC, Messer or their contractors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CSX Construction Agr. at \u00a7 11.1. Norfolk alleges that its Contractor Right of Entry Agreement with Messer contained a provision whereby Messer agreed to indemnify Norfolk for all property damage arising from the presence of Messer and its subcontractors on or near the bridge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norfolk Right of Entry Agr. at \u00b6 (v). CSX and Norfolk allege that CDDC, Messer and\n   their subcontractors caused the damage to the bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Messer argues that the indemnity provisions are triggered only when a claim or demand is made by an injured third party against CSX or Norfolk. Messer points out that the complaint does not allege that any third party has made a claim against plaintiffs. In response, plaintiffs argue that the provisions are worded broadly enough to cover not only third-party claims but also claims between the parties themselves for damages suffered directly by CSX and Norfolk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   As Messer notes, this issue came before the court in\n   <em>\n    Mead Corp. v.

There, the indemnity clause was broadly worded and not specifically limited to third-party claims. The court did not find any controlling case law on the issue of whether an indemnity provision applies to disputes between the contracting parties, and it found a conflict in the case law outside of Ohio: some jurisdictions adhered to the traditional understanding of indemnity as applying to only third-party claims, while some held that when parties choose broad language, courts should enforce their agreement and apply indemnity provisions to claims between the contracting parties.\n   <em>\n    Mead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11099291\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/141/914/\">\n    141 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   921-22 (citing cases).

The CSX Construction Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Applying the Sixth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Mead\n   </em>\n   to the case at hand, the court finds that Messer, at this early stage, has not demonstrated as a matter of law that the CSX Construction Agreement is ambiguous regarding the scope of the Indemnification Clause. The Clause provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Agency [CDDC] and its Contractors [Messer] shall indemnify, defend, and hold CSXT [CSX Transportation] and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims, demands, payments, suits, actions, judgments, settlements, and damages of every nature, degree and kind (including direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, and punitive damages), for any injury [to a person] ... [and] for the loss of or damage to any property whatsoever (including but not limited to property owned by or in the care, custody, or control of CSXT, its affiliates, Agency or its Contractors ...), arising directly or indirectly from the negligence, recklessness or intentional wrongful misconduct of the Contractors, Agency, and their respective agents, employees, invitees, contractors, or its contractors' agents, employees or invitees in the performance of work in connection with the Project or activities incidental thereto, or from their presence on or about CSXT's property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   CSX Construction Agr., at \u00a7 11.1. This language is broad and appears to cover payments made by CSX for damage to CSX's property arising from Messer's negligence in performing work on the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Messer argues that the court, as it did in\n   <em>\n    Mead\n   </em>\n   , should look to other language in the contract in considering how to interpret the scope of the Indemnification Clause. Messer contends that construing the provision broadly would render meaningless the Cost of Project Reimbursement Clause, under which CDDC agreed to reimburse CSX for certain costs and expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CSX Construction Agr. at \u00a7 4. If CSX can recover its expenses for repairing the bridge through indemnification, then what purpose does the Cost of Project Reimbursement clause serve, Messer asks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Messer's argument rests on an untenable reading of the Cost of Project Reimbursement Clause. That provision covers anticipated costs related to the Project and are specifically identified as being in the nature of travel, lodging, telephone, mailing, equipment, tools, supplies, labor, and out-of-pocket expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CSX Construction Agr. at \u00a7 4.1. The Clause does not speak to damage to property arising from CDDC's or Messer's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Messer's next argument likewise fails. Messer contends that the notice provision of the Indemnification Clause-requiring Messer to notify CSX of any injury or damage arising out of the Project-would be rendered superfluous under CSX's theory because there is no need to notify CSX of an injury to itself, of which it already must know.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CSX Construction Agr. at \u00a7 11.4. This argument overlooks the possibility that CSX might suffer injury of which it would not immediately be aware; i.e., Messer's negligence could cause property damage which would otherwise take CSX some time to discover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Accordingly, Messer's partial motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied as to CSX's indemnification claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Norfolk Right of Entry Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The court reaches a different conclusion when applying the Sixth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Mead\n   </em>\n   to Norfolk's Contractor Right of Entry Agreement. The Agreement contains\n   the following provision whereby Messer agrees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   to indemnify and save harmless Company [Norfolk], its officers, agents and employees from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, suits, judgments, costs, expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees) and liability resulting from ... injury to or death or any person ... and damage to or loss of any property, including without limitation that belonging to or in the custody of Licensees [Messer and its subcontractors], arising or in any manner growing out of the presence of either the Licensees or the Licensee Property, or both, on or about the Premises, regardless of whether negligence on the part of Company, its officers, agents or employees causes or contributed to said loss of life, personal injury or property loss or damage in whole or in part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Norfolk Right of Entry Agr. at \u00b6 (v).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   As an initial matter, this provision lacks certain language that helped give the CSX Agreement its broad sweep. It does not include \"payments\" within its scope. Nor does it expressly encompass damage to property \"owned by or in the care, custody, or control of\" the railroad company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Moreover, Messer argues that the \"regardless\" proviso at the end of the paragraph demonstrates the parties' intent to limit the Indemnification Clause to third-party claims. Messer contends that it would be nonsensical for Messer to be obligated to indemnify Norfolk for injury or damage to Norfolk regardless of whether Norfolk negligently caused the loss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Norfolk has not offered a direct response to Messer's argument, but simply argues that the wording of the Indemnification Clause is broad. The court agrees with Messer that the \"regardless\" proviso makes sense only in the context of third-party claims-that Messer agreed to indemnify Norfolk for injury or damage to third parties even if Norfolk caused or contributed to the injury or damage. To include direct injuries to Norfolk within the scope of the Indemnification Clause in essence would require Messer insure Norfolk against itself. But there is no suggestion anywhere in the Right of Entry Agreement that its purpose or scope included obligating Messer to indemnify Norfolk for self-inflicted harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The court finds that the Indemnification Clause is ambiguous at best. Even if the first part of the Clause can be read to cover claims between the contracting parties, the \"regardless\" proviso supports the narrower interpretation that Norfolk cannot seek indemnity for damage to itself. It is undisputed that Norfolk is the drafter of the Agreement, which bears Norfolk's name and file identifier at the top of the first page. Resolving the ambiguity in favor of Messer, the court finds that the Indemnification Clause must be interpreted to exclude claims between the contracting parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9333705\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/790/\">\n    319 F.3d at 798-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Accordingly, Messer's partial motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted as to Norfolk's indemnification claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

The court, however, finds that the pleadings support a reasonable inference that Messer and Igel followed Stantec's plans. Messer alleges that Stantec created \"plans and specifications\" for excavation and for riprap scour protection and that Messer's work in connection with the Project \"complied with all its obligations, including plans and specifications.\" (Doc. 76 at PAGEID # 705, \u00b6 11). Igel admitted in its answer that its contract with Messer required it to perform work \"in accordance with\" the documents \"prepared by Stantec.\" (Doc. 17-3 at PAGEID # 98; Doc. 36 at PAGEID # 167, \u00b6 2). And Igel alleges that Stantec prepared the plans for bridge scour protection.

The indemnification claim was in substance the same as a claim for breach of warranty, and the warranty provision stated that it was an \"exclusive\" remedy.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    In contrast, the CSX Agreement is not susceptible to a reading that would have CSX being indemnified for the results of its own negligence because the duty to indemnify is limited to losses arising from the negligence of CDDC, Messer or their contractors.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
