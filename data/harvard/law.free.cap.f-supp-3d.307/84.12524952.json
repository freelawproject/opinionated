(\"defendant\"), a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in San Diego, California. The complaint alleges that defendant failed to abide by the terms of a certain convertible note issued by defendant to plaintiff, and seeks injunctive relief, damages of not less than one hundred thousand dollars, and an award of costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the court is plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to liability and damages on the complaint's second, fifth, and sixth claims for relief. Defendant opposes the motion, and has submitted what defendant refers to as an opposition and cross-motion for summary judgment as to damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the court denies in its entirety plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to claim five, which seeks recovery for defendant's breach of contract on a conversion theory, as conversion is not the appropriate cause of action on the facts here. Additionally, the court grants plaintiff's motion as to liability with respect to claim two, which seeks recovery on a breach of contract theory, and claim six, which seeks an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to a contractual provision. Further, the court denies plaintiff's motion without prejudice as to damages on claim two, and as to an award of, as opposed to a finding of liability for, attorneys' fees. Finally, to the extent defendant's opposition constitutes a cross-motion, the court denies it in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff and defendant are diverse and, because the complaint seeks damages in the amount of \"not less than\" $100,000 with respect to its second and fifth claims for relief, (Compl. at 12), the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. The court therefore has diversity jurisdiction over the instant action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scherer v.

Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to plaintiff's claims in the instant dispute occurred in this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The court notes that defendant's Local Civil Rule 56.1 statement in opposition to plaintiff's motion and in support of defendant's cross-motion includes a number of denials, partial denials, and qualifications that are not supported by any citation to admissible evidence. The court does not endeavor to note each of defendant's unsupported denials, and instead summarizes the material facts that are supported by admissible evidence and are not genuinely in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Note\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 16, 2015, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement by and between plaintiff and defendant, (the \"SPA,\" Lerman Declaration in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Lerman MSJ Decl.\"), ECF No. 47-2, Ex L, ECF No. 47-4), defendant issued a Convertible Redeemable Note, (the \"Note,\" Lerman Declaration in Support of Plaintiff's Application for Preliminary Injunctive Relief (\"Lerman PI Decl.\"), ECF No. 2-5, Ex. A, ECF No. 2-6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the principal amount of $52,500, with interest accruing at 8%\n   <em>\n    per annum.\n   </em>\n   (PSMF \u00b6 5; DSMF \u00b6 5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 18, 2015, plaintiff funded the Note in an amount of $50,000, representing the Note's principal less $2,500 in defendant's attorneys' fees. (PSMF \u00b6 6, DSMF \u00b6 6.) The Note is governed by New York law, (Note \u00a7 14), and includes a conversion feature entitling its holder to, \"at its option, at any time,\" convert \"any amount of the principal face amount then outstanding,\" as well as \"[a]ccrued but unpaid interest,\" into defendant's common stock. (Note \u00a7 4(a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Note provides that if its holder wishes to exercise its conversion right, it must comply with the requirements set forth in section 4(a) of the Note and provide \"the Company,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , defendant, with \"written confirmation that th[e] Note is being converted ( [a] 'Notice of Conversion') in the form annexed [to the Note] as Exhibit A.\" (Note \u00a7 3.) Exhibit A to the Note, in turn, consists of a form of Notice of Conversion (the \"Form of Notice\"), which, in addition to indicating the information that the Note's holder must convey to convert debt under the Note to shares, states that it is \"To be Executed by the Registered Holder [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , LG Capital] in order to Convert the Note.\" The Note further provides that \"[t]he date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date.\" (Note \u00a7 3.) Although the Note itself does not include a separate, specific provision governing how notices may be given, section 5(f) of the SPA provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [a]ny notice or other communication required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be deemed effective (a) upon hand delivery or delivery by facsimile, with accurate confirmation generated by the transmitting facsimile machine, at the address or number designated below ... or delivery via electronic mail, or the first business day following such delivery (if delivered other than on a business day during normal business hours...) or (b) on the second business day following the date of mailing by express courier service ... or upon actual receipt of such mailing, whichever shall first occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The SPA then sets forth specific physical addresses for the parties to receive notice, and, in relevant part, states that notices to defendant should be sent to the\n   attention of \"Daniel Bland, CEO,\" and notices to plaintiff should be sent to the attention of \"Joseph Lerman, Manager.\" (SPA \u00a7 5(f).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Also relevant to the instant action, the Note sets forth a formula for determining the price of defendant's common stock for purposes of conversion. Specifically, it provides that the conversion price will be\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   equal to 60% of the lowest trading price of the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTCQB exchange [on] which [defendant's] shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common Stock may be traded in the future ... with a floor of $0.00001 per share, for the fifteen prior trading days including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by [defendant] or its transfer agent (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax or other electronic method of communication to the Company or its transfer agent after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing price).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (Note \u00a7 4(a) (emphasis omitted).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 12 of the Note requires that defendant create a share reserve by \"issu[ing] irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 3,684,000 shares of its Common Stock for conversions under th[e] Note.\" It also provides that defendant \"should at all times reserve a minimum of four times the amount of shares required if the note would be fully converted,\" and that the reserve \"shall be replenished as needed to allow for conversions of th[e] Note using said 4x reserve.\" (Note \u00a7 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Note further provides that, upon delivery of a Notice of Conversion, \"[i]f the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded.\" (Note \u00a7 4(a).) Additionally, defendant's failure to deliver common stock \"without restrictive legend within 3 business days of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion\" to the Note's holder pursuant to the Note's conversion provisions constitutes an event of default. (Note \u00a7 8(k).) Other events of default set forth in the Note include defendant's failure to perform or observe any \"covenant, term, provision, condition, agreement, or obligation under th[e] Note,\" (Note \u00a7 8(c) ), and failure by the defendant to remain \" 'current' in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\" (Note \u00a7 8(m).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Note provides that unless a default is cured within five days or \"waived in writing by the Holder,\" the holder may accelerate the Note's maturity, that is, \"consider th[e] Note immediately due and payable.\" (Note \u00a7 8.) Further, the Note provides for a default interest rate of \"24%\n   <em>\n    per annum\n   </em>\n   or, if such rate is usurious or not permitted by current law,... the highest rate of interest permitted by law\" upon an event of default. (Note \u00a7 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 8 of the Note also sets forth certain \"penalt[ies]\" for breaches of specific sections. For instance, the \"penalty\" for a \"breach of [s]ection 8(k),\" which requires that defendant deliver common stock within three days of defendant's receipt of a Notice of Conversion, is $250 per day that the shares are not issued beginning on the fourth day after issuance of the conversion notice, and $500 per day beginning on the tenth day. (Note \u00a7 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Further, the Note provides for a cash payment to its holder by defendant in the event defendant \"fails for any reason to deliver the Holder the conversion shares\n   by the 3rd business day following the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to [defendant].\" (Note \u00a7 8.) Specifically, should defendant fail to deliver shares by the third business day after receiving a Notice of Conversion, a \"Failure to Deliver Loss\" is to be calculated by multiplying the \"[h]igh trade price at any time on or after the day of exercise\" by the \"[n]umber of conversion shares.\" (Note \u00a7 8.) The holder may elect to demand cash payment in the amount of the Failure to Deliver Loss by \"provid[ing] [defendant] written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Failure to Deliver Loss.\" (Note \u00a7 8.) Should the holder so elect, defendant must \"make the Holder whole\" by paying the Failure to Deliver Loss in cash. (Note \u00a7 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, the Note provides that defendant shall reimburse the Note's holder \"for its attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution\" of any \"action or proceeding to enforce any provisions of th[e] Note,\" should the holder prevail in such an action. (Note \u00a7 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Note \u00a7 7 (\"The Company agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred by the holder in collecting any amount due under this Note.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Instant Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant became delinquent in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on November 22, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PSMF \u00b6 17; DSMF \u00b6 17.) On March 14, 2016, defendant filed an SEC Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2015 and thereby became current in its SEC filings. (PSMF \u00b6 18; DSMF \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The next day, March 15, 2016, plaintiff sent by e-mail a document styled as a \"Notice of Conversion\" (the \"March Notice,\" Lerman PI Decl. Ex. C, ECF No. 2-8) to defendant (specifically, to defendant's CEO, Daniel Bland) and to defendant's transfer agent (the \"Transfer Agent\"). (PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 19, 26.) Defendant admits that, with respect to the March Notice, plaintiff \"purported to submit a Notice of Conversion\" to \"[defendant's] CEO\" by e-mail, but, in sum and substance, denies that the March Notice was of any legal effect. (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 19, 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The March Notice contained several pieces of information that are also set forth in the Form of Notice annexed to the Note as Exhibit A, including the dollar amounts of principal and interest to be converted, the number of shares to be issued, the name of the borrower, the date of conversion, the applicable conversion price, plaintiff's EIN, the name in which the shares were to be registered, and the name of the account and account number to which the shares were to be sent. (PSMF \u00b6 20;\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Form of Notice, Note, Ex. A\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   March Notice.) Additionally, the March Notice was executed by Gabe Sayegh and lists his title as a \"Vice President\" of plaintiff. (PSMF \u00b6 21; March Notice.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the March Notice, plaintiff requested that defendant convert $7,500 in loan principal\n   and $445.48 in accrued and unpaid interest of the note into 174,242 shares of defendant's common stock, representing a conversion price of $0.0456 per share. (PSMF \u00b6 27; DSMF \u00b6 27; March Notice.) On April 27, 2016, an employee of defendant's Transfer Agent advised plaintiff in an e-mail that the Transfer Agent \"d[id] not have a reserve in place to process conversions\" and would \"need authorization from [defendant] to issue shares from the treasury.\" (PSMF \u00b6 29; Lerman PI Decl. Ex. D, ECF No. 2-9 (attaching e-mails);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DSMF \u00b6 29 (referring to language in Transfer Agent's e-mail).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant never honored the March Notice, (PSMF \u00b6 28; DSMF \u00b6 28), and on May 3, 2016, plaintiff rescinded the March Notice and executed and delivered a new Notice of Conversion (the \"May Notice,\" Lerman PI Decl. Ex. F, ECF No. 2-11). (PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 37; DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 37.) The May Notice, like the March Notice, was executed by Mr. Sayegh, and plaintiff submitted it to defendant via Mr. Bland and the Transfer Agent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 36-37;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 36-37 (arguing that the May Notice was not valid but not disputing that plaintiff executed it and submitted it to defendant).) The May Notice requested that defendant convert all amounts outstanding under the Note, that is, $52,500 in principal and $4,809.86 in interest, into 1,699,580 shares of defendant's common stock at a conversion price of $0.03372 per share. (PSMF \u00b6 38;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DSMF \u00b6 38 (arguing that the May Notice was not valid but not disputing its content).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After submitting the May Notice, plaintiff once again received a notification from the Transfer Agent that there were not sufficient shares available to the Transfer Agent to fulfill the conversion request. (PSMF \u00b6 39; DSMF \u00b6 39.) The Transfer Agent explained that the shares were unavailable because no share reserve was in place and defendant had not executed irrevocable transfer agent instructions. (PSMF \u00b6 39; DSMF \u00b6 39.) To date, plaintiff has not received the shares. (PSMF \u00b6 40; DSMF \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant has presented a supplemental declaration of Mark Geoghegan (\"Geoghegan Supp. Decl.,\" ECF No. 49-1), defendant's director of finance, detailing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , his negotiations with plaintiff during the period that plaintiff served the March and May Notices of conversion. (Geoghegan Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.) The Geoghegan supplemental declaration is neither signed nor dated. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Geoghegan Supp. Decl.) In it, Mr. Geoghegan states that \"from the outset of the litigation,\" defendant offered to deliver conversion shares pursuant to the May Notice, but was rebuffed by plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff commenced the instant action by filing a verified complaint on May 31, 2016, four weeks after submitting the May Notice. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.) Immediately after filing the complaint, plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction requiring, in relevant part, that defendant immediately provide fully executed irrevocable instructions to the Transfer Agent regarding the share reserve, and immediately deliver 1,699,580 shares of its common stock to plaintiff. (Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law\n   in Support of Motion for Preliminary Relief, ECF No. 2-1, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On July 7, 2016, the court held a hearing regarding plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, which was ultimately held in abeyance pending settlement discussions between the parties. A settlement conference was held on July 28, 2016 but was not successful. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry, ECF No. 17.) Nevertheless, following the settlement conference, on August 1, 2016, the parties requested that plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction continue to be held in abeyance pending further settlement discussions. (Parties' Joint Letter, ECF No. 19.) The court continued to hold the preliminary injunction motion in abeyance until November 9, 2016, when the court deemed plaintiff's preliminary injunction motion withdrawn in light of a joint status letter filed by the parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   November 9, 2016 Docket Order.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The court granted plaintiff leave to file the instant motion on February 27, 2017, and the motion was submitted to the court on May 1, 2017. Through the instant motion, plaintiff seeks summary judgment on its second, fifth, and sixth claims for relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law (\"Mem.\"), ECF No. 47-11, at 1, 18.) Plaintiff's second and fifth claims relate to defendant's failure to deliver shares under the terms of the Note and seek damages for the failure to deliver \"in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than one-hundred thousand dollars.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-57, 71-72.) The only difference between the complaint's second and fifth claims for relief is that the second claim is for breach of contract, and the fifth claim is styled as one for conversion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397234\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/59/#p63\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The sixth claim for relief seeks an award of \"costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by [plaintiff] in collecting any amount under the Note.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition to seeking a finding that defendant is liable to plaintiff for failure to perform its obligations under the Note, plaintiff seeks an award of damages at the summary judgment stage, and offers two alternative damages calculations for the court's consideration. (Mem. at 9-10.) The first of these calculations is based on outstanding principal and interest due on the Note and the \"penalty\" for plaintiff's failure to deliver conversion shares as set forth in section 8 of the Note, which plaintiff characterizes as a liquidated damages provision, and results in a damages amount of $256,328.91. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-14.) The second of these calculations is based on the Note's \"Failure to Deliver Loss/Make-Whole\" provision and results in a damages amount of $203,949.60. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Although plaintiff seeks summary judgment as to its entitlement to attorneys' fees, plaintiff does not, in its memorandum of law or otherwise, state the amount of attorneys' fees to which plaintiff believes it is entitled. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18.) Additionally, plaintiff has not submitted any billing records or other relevant information regarding the amount of attorneys' fees that plaintiff seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant opposes plaintiff's motion and seeks summary judgment limiting plaintiff's recovery, if any, to delivery of 1,699,580 shares of common stock in defendant under the May Notice.

First, defendant argues that the March and May Notices did not conform to the Form of Notice. (Opp. at 7-8.) Second, defendant contends that the March and May Notices are invalid because they were\n   sent to defendant's CEO, Mr. Bland, and not to Mark Geoghegan, \"who was designated as [defendant's] representative to whom inquiries regarding issued shares should be addressed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Third, defendant asserts that the March and May Notices were \"not properly executed since they were not executed by the Registered Holder of the Note,\" based on defendant's contention that Mr. Joseph Lerman was plaintiff's \"designated signatory\" because the Securities Purchase Agreement indicates that notices to plaintiff should be sent to Mr. Lerman's attention.

Gen. Oblig. Law \u00a7 5-511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The court therefore addresses defendant's civil usury defense with defendant's other defenses to, and arguments regarding, liability, and concludes that all are baseless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The court first addresses defendant's contention that the March and May Notices failed to comply with the Form of Notice as set forth in Exhibit A to the Note. Notably, defendant does not, anywhere in its papers, actually explain how the March and May Notices differ from the Form of Notice, much less why these differences suffice to render the March and May Notices ineffective. Defendant's opposition contends that Mr. Geoghegan \"noted\" in a declaration filed earlier in this action that the March and May notices were not compliant, (Opp. at 7), and that its statement of material facts \"demonstrate[s]\" that the notice was noncompliant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) However, a review of the relevant Geoghegan declaration reveals that it contains only a conclusory statement that the \"conversion notices are not in the specific format required by Exhibit A to the Note.\" (Geoghegan Declaration in Opposition to Plaintiff's Application for Preliminary Injunctive Relief, ECF No. 13-1, \u00b6 16.) Defendant's statement of material facts parrots Mr. Geoghegan's conclusory assertion and adds similar conclusory statements of its own, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 20, 35), but is lacks any explanation of the substance or import of the purported differences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Furthermore, plaintiff's statement of undisputed material facts sets forth in detail the required information called for by the form Notice of Conversion and notes that this information is contained in the March and May Notices. (PSMF \u00b6 20.) In response to plaintiff's showing, defendant's Local Civil Rule 56.1 statement offers argument regarding the course of dealings between plaintiff and defendant, and argument as to who may properly execute a Notice of Conversion on behalf of plaintiff. (DSMF \u00b6 20.) After this digression, defendant's response incorporates images of the Form of Notice and the March Notice and states, in a conclusory manner, that the \"notices are different and not all information is identical.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In opposing summary judgment defendant relies entirely on conclusory statements that the March and May Notices are invalid, but fails to provide \"concrete particulars,\" perhaps hoping that the court will scour the March and May Notices and find a triable issue of material fact. Defendant has failed in its obligation to submit evidence and legal arguments in opposition to plaintiff's properly submitted summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BellSouth Telecommunications\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7640415\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/603/#p615\">\n    77 F.3d at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An adverse party may not rest upon mere conclusory allegations or denials. The party opposing the motion for summary judgment must set forth concrete particulars. It is not sufficient merely to assert a conclusion without supplying supporting arguments or facts.\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Despite defendant's failure, the court has reviewed the March and May Notices, and finds that they comply with the Note's requirements. There are two immaterial differences between the Form of Notice and the March and May Notices. First, the March and May Notices include a statement, not present in the Note's Form of Notice, that \"[n]o fee will be charged to the Holder for any conversion, except for transfer taxes, if any.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   March Notice and May Notice\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Note Ex. A.) Second, the March and May Notices request that defendant issue a certificate or certificates for the conversion shares in the name of plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Neither of these additions, however, is clearly contrary to the terms of the Note, nor does either detract from the overall import of the March and May Notices. Moreover, defendant submits no explanation as to why the inclusion of the aforementioned language would invalidate what is otherwise clearly a valid Notice of Conversion that contains all of the information called for in the Form of Notice attached as Exhibit A to the Note. Thus, on the record before it, the court concludes that the March and May Notices complied with the form Notice of Conversion and were submitted to defendant in the proper form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Next, the court finds that the March and May Notices were properly executed and delivered to defendant. The Form of Notice attached as Exhibit A to the Note indicates that it is to be \"[e]xecuted by the Registered Holder in order to [c]onvert the Note,\" and there is no dispute that plaintiff is the registered holder. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSMF \u00b6 5; DSMF \u00b6 5 (both indicating that Note was issued to plaintiff).) Based on the March and May Notices themselves, there can be no dispute that Mr. Sayegh, a vice president of plaintiff, executed both. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March Notice; May Notice.) Moreover, both the March Notice and the May Notice clearly stated Mr. Sayegh's title and indicated that he was executing the document on behalf of plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff has offered an uncontroverted statement that Mr. Sayegh had the authority to execute both documents. (PSMF \u00b6 22; Lerman MSJ Decl., ECF No. 47-2, \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In response, defendant asserts that it \"has no information as to whether a Mr. Gabe Sayegh, VP of LG[,] executed the Notices of Conversion,\" and states that Mr. Sayegh \"was unknown and remains unknown to [defendant],\" and \"all communications regarding the Note and any issued shares thereunder were between [Ahron] Fraiman [on behalf of plaintiff] and Mr. Geoghegan.\" (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) Defendant's\n   foregoing attempt to create an issue of fact regarding the validity of the March and May Notices must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The March and May Notices clearly indicated Mr. Sayegh's power to act as an agent of plaintiff, which has at all relevant times been the Note's registered holder and which, as a corporate entity, can act only through agents. Defendant offers absolutely no basis to doubt Mr. Sayegh's authority other than the dubious assertion that he \"was ... and remains unknown\" to defendant, even though plaintiff verified that Mr. Sayegh was authorized to execute both Notices of Conversion, (PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; Lerman MSJ Decl. \u00b6 4), each of which defendant acknowledges it received.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant's contention that the Notices of Conversion were not properly executed because Mr. Lerman did not sign them is wholly without merit. Defendant's only basis for this contention is that Mr. Lerman was \"the designated signatory for the Registered Holder\" because the SPA designated Mr. Lerman as the person to whose attention notices under the SPA should be sent. (Opp. at 7-8.) Defendant's contention makes no sense: the relevant portion of the SPA speaks to who should\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   notices under the SPA, not who may execute Notices of Conversion under the Note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Turning to the delivery of the March and May Notices, the court observes that the Note itself only requires that the Note's holder \"give [defendant] written confirmation that th[e] Note is being converted in the form annexed [to the Note] as Exhibit A,\" (Note \u00a7 3), and does not designate a specific person as the proper recipient of the Notice. The Note also clearly contemplates that a Notice of Conversion may properly be \"delivered by fax or other electronic method of communication.\" (Note \u00a7 4(a).) The SPA's more robust and detailed notice provision, also provides that notices must be in writing and allows for delivery by e-mail. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7 5(f).) The SPA also provides that notices to defendant shall be sent to the attention of Mr. Bland, defendant's CEO, \"or to such other address as [defendant] shall have specified most recently by written notice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   There is no dispute that plaintiff delivered the March and May Notices by e-mail to Mr. Bland, defendant's CEO. (PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 19, 26, 37; DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 19, 26, 37.) Plaintiff, therefore, properly delivered the Notice of Conversion under the terms of the Note and under the notice provisions of the SPA, to the extent those are applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendant's contention that the March and May Notices should have been delivered to Mr. Geoghegan is wholly without merit. The sole basis for this contention is a single e-mail message that defendant's Transfer Agent sent Mr. Fraiman, an employee of plaintiff, stating that \"[defendant] has instructed us to forward inquiries regarding its issued shares to [Mr.] Geoghegan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Opp. at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Correspondence\n   from Transfer Agent, Geoghegan Supp. Decl. Ex. B, ECF No. 49-3.) This correspondence does not suffice to render the March and May Notices improperly delivered for at least three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, the relevant correspondence between the Transfer Agent and Mr. Fraiman relates to \"inquiries regarding [defendant's] issued shares,\" not to Notices of Conversion or any other notices under the Note or the SPA, and as such is irrelevant to the issues presently before the court. Second, the correspondence is from a third party, not from defendant, and states only that defendant \"has instructed [the Transfer Agent] to forward inquiries regarding its issued shares to [Mr.] Geoghean.\" (Correspondence from Transfer Agent.) The Transfer Agent's e-mail thus states that defendant asked the Transfer Agent to forward notices, not that the defendant gave the Transfer Agent authority to act on defendant's behalf and alter plaintiff's notice obligations under the Note and/or SPA. Third, even if the correspondence from the Transfer Agent were relevant to notice procedures under the Note or SPA, and even if it were a communication properly made on behalf of defendant by the third-party Transfer Agent, the message from the Transfer Agent was not sent to plaintiff in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in the SPA. Those procedures, in relevant part, require that notices to plaintiff under the SPA be sent to Mr. Lerman, but the Transfer Agent's correspondence was directed to Mr. Fraiman. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7 5(f).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   On the undisputed record before the court, therefore, plaintiff is entitled to a finding that the March and May Notices were properly executed and delivered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Turning to defendant's contention that the Note is usurious, the court concludes that defendant's position is without a basis in law. Defendant raises only civil usury, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 9-10), which is a defense to liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Oblig.%20Law%20%C2%A7%205-511\">\n    N.Y.

Section 8 of the Note also provides for reimbursement for attorneys' fees in the event that the Note's holder \"shall commence an action... to enforce any provisions of th[e] Note ...

Defendant appears to contend that attorneys' fees and expenses should be considered as part of the court's usury analysis, (Opp. at 10), but offers no basis for treating attorneys' fees and expenses, which clearly are not interest under the Note, as interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant has failed to comply with the terms of the Note, plaintiff has commenced an action to enforce the Note's provisions, and, because the court has granted summary judgment as to plaintiff's second claim for relief, plaintiff has prevailed in that action.

(Opp. at 9-10.) The basis for this contention is unclear.

Specifically, plaintiff's damages must be calculated based on the market price of defendant's shares as of the date of the breach. The Note provides that the \"conversion shall be effectuated by [defendant] delivering the shares of Common Stock to the holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion.\" (Note \u00a7 4(a).)

Accordingly, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to breach of contract damages is denied, without prejudice to plaintiff's ability to supplement the record with the information necessary to calculate plaintiff's actual damages and renew its motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 16-18.) The court has already determined defendant is liable for fees, but concludes that it lacks sufficient information to render such an award on the current record. The Note provides for payment of \"\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   attorneys' fees and expenses.\" (Note \u00a7 7.) In determining the reasonableness of fees incurred, the court must \"bear in mind\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the case-specific variables that we and other courts have identified as relevant to the reasonableness of attorney's fees in setting a reasonable hourly rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass'n v.

Although the court has granted summary judgment as to liability for attorneys' fees, the balance of plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to attorneys' fees is denied for lack of record evidence to support a specific award of fees. This denial is without prejudice to plaintiff's ability to renew its motion for an award of attorneys' fees in a specific amount upon submission of proper documentation; however, plaintiff may not renew its request for a fee award until after the court has determined the amount of damages to which plaintiff is entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED in its entirety and plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   (1) Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to the complaint's fifth claim, for conversion, is DENIED and that claim is dismissed as duplicative of plaintiff's breach of contract claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   (2) Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to liability with respect to the complaint's second claim, for breach of contract, is GRANTED.

(PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 42-43; DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) Section 8 of the Note provides that, in the event a breach of section 8(m) \"occurs or is continuing after the [six-]month anniversary of the Note,\"\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    December 16, 2015, \"the Holder shall be entitled to use the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period as a base price for conversion.\" (Note \u00a7 8.) However, plaintiff does not invoke section 8's conversion share price adjustment provision in connection with the instant action, and the court therefore need not determine whether or how it applies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Although not expressly stated by either party's Local Civil Rule 56.1 statement, it appears that plaintiff submitted the May Notice to defendant via e-mail.

For instance, the March and May Notices request that defendant \"Fedex\" the conversion shares, although the corresponding portion of Form of Notice states that \"[s]hares are to be sent or delivered to the following account.\" The March and May Notice also state the principal and interest being converted, rather than aggregating the two into one total conversion amount, and indicate the principal balance remaining on the Note, which the Form of Notice does not call for. Additionally, the Form of Notice has language that applies only where the \"[s]hares are to be issued in the name of a person other than the undersigned,\" which is clearly not the case here. Even if defendant expressly argued that these differences render the March and May Notices ineffective, which defendant does not, the court would reject that argument, and does not address these discrepancies further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The court also notes that correspondence referenced in the parties' motion papers includes both Mr. Fraiman and Mr. Sayegh, as well as defendant's representatives, and clearly indicates that Mr. Sayegh has an e-mail account associated with plaintiff. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Lerman PI Decl. Ex. G, ECF No. 2-12.) Additionally, defendant's assertion that it had previously dealt with Mr. Fraiman is of no moment, as defendant submits no evidence that Mr. Fraiman was plaintiff's exclusive agent with respect to its conversion rights under the Note.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Defendant's contention is also confusing in light of plaintiff's suggestion that it doubts Mr. Sayegh's agency because defendant had previously dealt with Mr. Fraiman.

Defendant does not contend that plaintiff's attorneys' fees that were initially paid in connection with the parties' entry into the SPA and Note transaction, and which account for the $2,500 difference between the face amount of the Note and the amount for which plaintiff funded the Note, were \"disguised interest.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Defendant's contention also appears to be in tension with its prior arguments in this action. Specifically, although defendant now contends that money damages are not available to plaintiff, in opposing this preliminary injunctive relief, defendant asserted that plaintiff \"ha[d] not demonstrated-and c[ould] not\" demonstrate the inadequacy of money damages. (Defendant's Memorandum in Opposition to Preliminary Relief, ECF No. 13, at 4-5.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    To illustrate the disconnect between the daily penalties and actual damages, had plaintiff issued a Notice of Conversion calling for the delivery of a single share, a failure to honor that Notice of Conversion would result in \"penalties\" of $1,000 as of the seventh business day after delivery of the Notice of Conversion. The record reflects that defendant's shares have not traded at a price above fifteen cents at any time relevant to this action, and such a penalty would be vastly disproportionate, particularly considering that the failure to deliver loss would be no more than a few cents in the aforementioned situation. The converse situation is also conceivable: were a Notice of Conversion to call for delivery of a large number of shares, and were delivery to be delayed for a few days, the \"penalties\" might be nowhere near plaintiff's actual loss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Plaintiff cannot contend that this guaranteed higher payout accurately reflects damages arising from plaintiff's inability to hold defendant's shares and sell them on the market upon the shares' appreciation in value. The proposition that plaintiff would have been able to time its sale of shares to avail itself of the shares' high trading price at \"any time\" after delivery of the Notice of Conversion is wholly speculative.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     LG Capital Funding\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203973921\">\n     2017 WL 3973921\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (\"Judge Kuo rejected the plaintiff's proposed lost profits calculation, finding that the plaintiff did not provide any support for its assumption that it would have sold the stock when it was at its highest price, as opposed to any other time.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Plaintiff's actual damages are based on the May Notice, because, although the March Notice was valid, there is no dispute that plaintiff rescinded it.
