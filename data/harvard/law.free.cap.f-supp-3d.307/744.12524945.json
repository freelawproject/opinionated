All five defendants filed separate Motions to Dismiss Parker's Amended Complaint (Docs. 18-22). Parker also moved to strike portions of Defendants' reply briefs, or in the alternative, for leave to file a sur-reply (\"Parker's Motion to Strike\"). (Doc. 36). The motions are fully briefed and ripe for disposition. For the following reasons, each of the individual defendants' Motions to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ; Strawser's Motion to Dismiss\n   is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   , and Parker's Motion to Strike is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Parker discloses her transgender status and is harassed by co-workers.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Parker began working for Strawser as a truck driver in 2009. (Doc. 10, Am. Compl. \u00b6 34). In 2012, Strawser promoted Parker to line truck driver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37). Shortly thereafter, Parker began transitioning her gender from male to female. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40). Although born male, Parker identifies as transgender and was diagnosed by her physician with gender dysphoria in September 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Parker disclosed her gender dysphoria diagnosis and her gender transition to Strawser in September 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41). When Parker made this disclosure to her immediate supervisor, Dale Ernst, he stated, \"you had better be ready to be picked on.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). Following this disclosure, Ernst began \"writing up Parker for allegedly not executing her job duties or for non-existent/minor errors as evidence\" (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , errors in her log book), which had not occurred prior to the disclosure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49). Other, non-transgender employees were not written up for similar minor or unsubstantiated errors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Parker was also subjected to \"constant and continuing harassment\" due to her transgender and transitioning status from her co-workers, in particular, Floyd Kelly and Brian Tucker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57). Kelly made \"repeated derogatory and discriminatory gender, gender identity, and transition comments and jokes\" and stated to Parker on multiple occasions that \"Kelly believed that Parker was really a male, who was attracted to other males.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-59). Kelly and Tucker would make comments such as \"[Parker's] performance was typical 'because you [Parker] drive like a woman,\" and \"we have to be really careful of what we say around him,\" and would purposely misgender Parker (by referring to her with male pronouns). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As part of her job duties, Parker was assigned to share a hotel room with a male co-worker, Ralph Holsinger, in September 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64). Kelly made comments stating that Parker and Holsinger were having a sexual relationship and stated to Holsinger that Holsinger was a homosexual due to the rooming arrangements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64-65). Parker complained to Ernst regarding Kelly's comments, which Parker felt constituted sexual harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67). Directly following Parker's complaint, Kelly's harassment of Parker intensified, and the two ended up in a physical altercation as a result of the harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68, 71). Only Parker received a negative year-end performance review from Ernst, despite being the target of harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The harassment continued in 2013. During one of Parker's work-related hotel stays, Kelly disclosed to the hotel staff that Parker was transgender, and a hotel staff member \"called Parker to the front desk, simply to see what she looked like.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-79). On another occasion, Parker walked into a hotel lobby wearing traditionally female clothing, and Kelly stated, \"I wish you wouldn't do that because you are making us look bad.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80). Kelly further stated on other occasions, \"can't you just dress like a man?\" and \"you make for an ugly woman.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Parker's therapist requests accommodations from Strawser on Parker's behalf.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In April 2013, Parker's therapist, Dr. Frederick Peterson, wrote a letter to Freda Grote, Strawser's Human Resources Manager, informing Grote of Parker's gender\n   dysphoria and requesting that Strawser accommodate Parker by allowing her to use female restrooms, and to refer to her using the female gender terminology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-87). Grote told Parker that she could only make such accommodations if Parker provided documentation showing that everything was \"legal,\" but did not explain what she meant by \"legal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At about the same time in April 2013, Parker also disclosed to Grote that Parker would soon begin taking medication (such as hormone treatments) to help her transition her physical gender, and asked whether Parker's medical insurance would cover sex reassignment surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90-93). Grote denied Parker's inquiry, without looking into whether Strawser's medical insurance would cover such a surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Parker is sexually assaulted by a co-worker.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In July 2013, Parker was sexually harassed and sexually assaulted by a co-worker, Terry Jordan. Parker reported the assault and Strawser immediately terminated Jordan, but other co-workers blamed and harassed Parker for Jordan's termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-102). On the same day Jordan was terminated, Strawser moved Parker's work station to the workshop, which was viewed by Strawser employees as a form of punishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103-104). Further, following Jordan's termination, Ernst would \"scream at Parker on occasion\" and \"stated that he would treat Parker better if she performed sexual favors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-07). Parker did not solicit any such sexual conduct or activity from Ernst, and asked that he not make such requests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    D. La Joye asks Parker to resign.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In spring of 2014, Parker contacted her superintendent, Ben La Joye, and asked if there was anything he could do to curb the harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114-16). La Joye said there was nothing he could do, and declined her request to rearrange the crew to ensure Parker would no longer have to work with Kelly or Tucker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 117-18). La Joye told her that \"if she was not tough enough to handle the harassment, she was not tough enough to work in construction,\" and instructed Parker to text him stating that she was resigning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 119-121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As instructed, Parker texted her resignation to La Joye, and also sent a message to human resources stating that if Strawser could not remedy the constant sexual harassment, Parker would have to resign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 122-123). Grote called Parker and asked her to withdraw her resignation and engage in a discussion with La Joye, Grote, and Chris Anspaugh (president of Strawser). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124). This meeting was held in May 2014, at which Parker was told that \"accommodating transgender employees was a 'work in progress' at Strawser, and that they would attempt to remedy the harassment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125-127). Despite this assertion, Strawser did not take any meaningful measures to end the harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Parker is demoted and replaced by Kelly.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In June or July 2014, Strawser demoted Parker from her line truck driver position, resulting in a pay cut of approximately $3.00/hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 129-30). Strawser placed Kelly in the line truck driver position that Parker previously held, for which Parker alleges Kelly was unqualified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 131-33). The demotion came two to three months after Parker made protected complaints concerning sexual harassment during her meeting with Grote, La Joye, and Anspaugh. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Parker complained about her demotion to Ernst and Grote and stated that she believed Kelly had been treated more favorably\n   due to Parker's gender, disability, and protected complaints, because Parker was more qualified than Kelly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 134-36). Parker also sent text messages to Grote and La Joye stating she would not \"stand for\" unfair treatment, in reference to her demotion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139). Two to three weeks after Parker's demotion, Parker was suspended without pay for sending these texts, which Strawser perceived as threatening. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 137-41). Strawser also instructed Parker to see a Strawser-approved therapist, or else she would be terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142). Although no other Strawser employees had ever been required to see a therapist, Parker complied and was permitted to return to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 143-46). Parker continued to be harassed upon her return. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In late August or early September 2014, Ernst screamed and cursed at Parker for making an incorrect entry in her log book (which he did not do with other employees), and later screamed and cursed at Parker again, accusing her of making up her discrimination complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 148-154). Later, Parker sent Ernst a text message asking him to refrain from cursing and yelling at her for minor mistakes. Ernst called Parker in response and told her \"be a man\" and \"act like a man.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 151-152). Parker complained to La Joye about Ernst's conduct, but Ernst received no discipline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 155-56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Parker is terminated for insubordination.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 19, 2014, Michael Zamborski, a project manager for Strawser, instructed Parker to move a loader truck. Parker refused because per Department of Transportation regulations, she would be unable to move the truck without triggering a ten-hour break period as she had already worked a full day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 158-162). Strawser then terminated Parker's employment for insubordination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 163). Strawser's termination letter addressed Parker as \"Mr. Parker,\" which Parker felt constituted sexual harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164, 167).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Parker files a charge of discrimination with the EEOC.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Following her termination, Parker filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") alleging \"discrimination on the basis of sex, disability, and retaliation when [Strawser] subjected her to less favorable terms and conditions of employment, harassment, demotion, and termination.\" (Doc. 10-2, EEOC Determination Letter at 1). On March 28, 2017, the EEOC issued Parker a determination letter, finding \"that the evidence substantiates that [Parker] was harassed on the basis of sex, in violation of Title VII. However, the [EEOC was] unable to conclude that she was sexually harassed, retaliated against, demoted or discharged. The [EEOC] makes no finding regarding the allegation of disability discrimination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Parker received a right to sue letter from the EEOC on April 12, 2017. (Doc. 10-1, Right to Sue Letter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Parker commenced this action on June 21, 2017, asserting eight counts of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation on the basis of sex under Title VII, disability discrimination under the ADA, and corresponding state law claims under Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4112. (Doc. 1, Compl.). She later amended her Complaint on July 17, 2017, to correct an error in Defendant Chris Anspaugh's name. (Doc. 10). All five defendants now move separately\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to dismiss\n   Parker's Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD FOR DISMISSAL UNDER RULE 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under the Federal Rules, any pleading that states a claim for relief must contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim\" showing that the pleader is entitled to such relief. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). To meet this standard, a party must allege sufficient facts to state a claim that is \"plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp. v.

In considering whether a complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the Court must \"construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept its allegations as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio Police &amp; Fire Pension Fund v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Parker asserts eight claims in her complaint: four against Strawser only (Title VII gender discrimination, Title VII sexual harassment, Title VII retaliation, and ADA disability discrimination) and four against Strawser and all four individual defendants (Chapter 4112 gender discrimination, Chapter 4112 sexual harassment, Chapter 4112 retaliation, and Chapter 4112 disability discrimination). The Court will first consider whether Chapter 4112 imposes individual liability on supervisors and managers like Ernst, Grote, La Joye, and Anspaugh, and then consider whether Parker's gender dysphoria and transgender status qualify her as a member of a protected class under the ADA and Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The individual defendants are not liable under Chapter 4112.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The individual defendants are not \"employers\" for purposes of Parker's discrimination and harassment claims under \u00a7 4112.02(A).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants argue that Ernst, Grote, La Joye, and Anspaugh are not proper defendants in this action because Chapter 4112 does not impose individual liability on managers and supervisors. Parker argues that each of the individual defendants is subject to liability because R.C. \u00a7 4112.02(A) prohibits discrimination by \"employers,\" and the definition of \"employer\" in Chapter 4112 extends to \"any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer.\" R.C. 4112.01(A)(2). This stands in contrast to the definition of \"employer\" under Title VII and the ADA, which extends to \"any agent of [an employer],\" and which courts\n   have consistently held does not impose liability on individuals. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e(b), 12111(5)(a) ;\n   <em>\n    Wathen v.

Parker also alleges that she was retaliated against for making protected complaints about discrimination and harassment on the basis of her sex and disability. In contrast to \u00a7 4112.02(A), which makes it an unlawful discriminatory practice \"[f]or\n   <em>\n    any employer\n   </em>\n   , because of the...sex...[or] disability of any person, to discharge without just cause, to refuse to hire, or to otherwise discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter\n   directly or indirectly related to employment\" (emphasis added), Parker's retaliation claims are governed by \u00a7 4112.02(I), which makes it an unlawful discriminatory practice \"[f]or\n   <em>\n    any person\n   </em>\n   to discriminate in any manner against any other person because that person has opposed any unlawful discriminatory practice defined in this section.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A defendant therefore need not be an \"employer\" in order to be subject to liability for discriminatory retaliation under Chapter 4112.\n   <em>\n    Longoria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206658675\">\n    2015 WL 6658675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. This result is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Hauser\n   </em>\n   , in which the Ohio Supreme Court recognized identical language in \u00a7 4112.02(J) (imposing liability against \"any person\" who aids and abets any discriminatory practice) as an example of the language the legislature could have used to impose individual liability for discrimination and sexual harassment under \u00a7 4112.02(A) had it so chosen.\n   <em>\n    Hauser\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Ernst, Grote, La Joye, and Anspaugh are therefore not improper individual defendants for Parker's retaliation claims\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   But in order to survive a motion to dismiss the retaliation claims, Parker must allege retaliatory adverse actions taken by an individual defendant. And this Parker has failed to do. The retaliatory actions she alleges are that (1) \"Strawser moved Parker to the work shop\" after she reported Jordan's sexual assault (Doc. 10, Am. Compl. \u00b6 103); (2) \"Strawser demoted Parker from her line truck driver position\" and \"Strawser placed Kelly in Parker's line truck driver position\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 129-31); (3) \"Strawser terminated Parker for alleged insubordination,\" even though complying with her supervisor's request would have meant violating Department of Transportation regulations.

For the first three of these alleged retaliatory actions, Parker's Amended Complaint attributes these actions only to \"Strawser\" as a whole, such that the Court cannot plausibly infer which particular employee was allegedly responsible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103, 129-31, 163).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As for the negative performance evaluations and unwarranted discipline following her complaints of harassment, Parker attributes these actions to Ernst (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-74, 148-54) and Grote (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110-13). However, Parker does not allege that she suffered any harm from these reviews or write ups. Her demotion and ultimate termination occurred ten to 18 months after each of the negative reviews and write-ups, and she does not allege that either was motivated by Ernst's or Grote's negative reviews or write ups.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

The ADA and Chapter 4112 each provide that \"gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments\" are excluded from coverage.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012211\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ; O.R.C. \u00a7 4112.01(A)(16)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In response, Parker cites an Eastern District of Pennsylvania case in which the court surmised that in enacting the ADA's exclusion for gender identity disorders, Congress was truly concerned with making sure that \"\n   <em>\n    non-disabling\n   </em>\n   conditions that concern sexual orientation or identity\" were not covered.\n   <em>\n    Blatt v.

Pa. May 18, 2017) (emphasis added). Since Blatt alleged she was substantially limited by her gender dysphoria in the major life activities of \"interacting with others, reproducing, and social and occupational functioning,\" the court determined that the plaintiff's gender dysphoria was\n   <em>\n    disabling\n   </em>\n   , and therefore Blatt's gender dysphoria was not encompassed by the \u00a7 12111(b)(1) exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But this Court can find no support, textual or otherwise, for the\n   <em>\n    Blatt\n   </em>\n   court's interpretation. The exclusion plainly applies to all \"gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments,\" without any regard to whether the gender identity disorder is disabling. Further, whether a condition is \"disabling,\" according to the\n   <em>\n    Blatt\n   </em>\n   court, depends on whether the condition substantially limits one or more major life activities. But limitation of major life activities is a requirement for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   conditions qualifying as a \"disability\" under the ADA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Thus, gender identity disorders that do not substantially limit a major life activity are already excluded from coverage, and an additional exclusion for any non-disabling condition would be superfluous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Daniel v.

Parker cites a number of medical journal articles reporting that individuals with gender dysphoria exhibit differences in brain structure and physiological responses compared to control groups. (Doc. 27, Pl.'s Resp. at 23 n. 146). Parker concludes that this research proves that gender dysphoria results from physical impairments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   But the Court is limited in its review under Rule 12(b)(6) to Parker's allegations in her Amended Complaint and may not consider outside evidence.\n   <em>\n    Hensley Mfg. v.

Nowhere in the Amended Complaint did Parker allege that her gender dysphoria was caused by a physical impairment or that gender dysphoria always results from a physical impairment. Moreover, the Court is not convinced that a mere difference in brain structure or physiology, by itself, is necessarily a \"physical impairment\"-it may have physical underpinnings in the brain, but not every physical difference between two groups implies that one of the groups is impaired in some way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The language of the statutes make clear that Congress and Ohio's General Assembly contemplated that some gender identity disorders result from physical impairments and some do not; those legislative bodies chose to protect from disability discrimination only those that do. It was therefore Parker's obligation to allege in her Amended Complaint that her gender dysphoria is caused by a physical impairment. Having failed to do so, her disability claims under the ADA and Chapter 4112 are foreclosed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Strawser argues that Parker cannot succeed on any of these claims because transgender individuals are not a protected class under Title VII or Chapter 4112. In support of this argument, Strawser cites an Eastern District of Michigan case which held that \"transgender or transsexual status is currently not a protected class under Title VII.\"\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v.

She reported the harassment to Strawser on multiple occasions, but the harassment either persisted\n   or intensified. (Doc. 10, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 75). When she reached out to La Joye, he expressly told her that there was nothing he could do to curb the harassment and that if she couldn't handle it, she should resign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114-121). Even after Grote asked her to withdraw her resignation and speak with senior Strawser officers about her experiences, and she was told at that meeting that Strawser would attempt to remedy the harassment, Strawser took no meaningful measures to improve the situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 124-128). Accepting all of Parker's allegations as true, she has sufficiently pleaded that Strawser was negligent in its response to the harassment reported by Parker. She has therefore sufficiently pleaded a claim for sexual harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Parker has stated a claim for retaliation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice \"for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ...because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Similarly, R.C. \u00a7 4112.02(I) makes it an unlawful discriminatory practice \"[f]or any person to discriminate in any manner against any other person because that person has opposed any unlawful discriminatory practice defined in this section.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under these provisions, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she engaged in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) the defendant knew she engaged in this protected activity; (3) thereafter, the defendant took an employment action adverse to her; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214399\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/566/\">\n    378 F.3d at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Strawser challenges Parker's allegations as to the first and fourth of these elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Protected activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   First, Parker alleged she engaged in protected activity when she complained to her superiors, on multiple occasions, that she was being harassed by her co-workers because of her transgender status. Complaints made to superiors are a protected activity under Title VII.\n   <em>\n    Wasek v. Arrow Energy Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892053\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/463/#p469\">\n    682 F.3d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469 (6th Cir. 2012). Strawser's argument that these complaints are not protected by Title VII rests on its previously-rejected argument that Title VII does not reach discrimination on the basis of transgender status. And although\n   <em>\n    R.G. &amp; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes\n   </em>\n   was decided by the Sixth Circuit only after Parker made her complaints, a plaintiff need only have a good faith belief that the complained-of action violates Title VII in order to invoke its retaliation protections.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Univ. of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11214346\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/561/#p580\">\n    215 F.3d 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 580 (6th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, Parker has sufficiently alleged that she engaged in protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As to the fourth element, Parker expressly alleged that that \"Strawser's actions [moving her to the workshop, demoting her, issuing unwarranted discipline, and terminating her employment] were retaliatory in nature based on Parker's opposition to the unlawful discriminatory conduct.\" (Doc. 10, Am. Compl. \u00b6 193). Strawser asserts that this type of conclusory allegation is insufficient to satisfy Rule 12(b)(6), and that the only\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   allegations Parker makes regarding causation are that her protected complaints were made prior to her demotion and termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mickey v. Zeidler Tool &amp; Die Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047889\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/516/#p525\">\n    516 F.3d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (6th Cir. 2008) (where some time has elapsed between the protected activity and the adverse action, as opposed to when the adverse action\n   immediately follows the protected activity, \"the employee must couple temporal proximity with other evidence of retaliatory conduct to establish causality.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   While none of the material adverse actions alleged by Parker occurred immediately on the heels of any of her complaints, Parker has alleged other facts that add plausibility to the causation allegation. First, Strawser demoted Parker from her position as line truck driver and replaced her with Kelly, one of Parker's most frequent harassers, about whom Parker had complained to Strawser, and who Parker alleges was unqualified for the position. (Doc. 10, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 131-33). Further, Strawser's stated reason for terminating Parker's employment-insubordination-is inconsistent with Parker's allegations that she could not have complied with her supervisor's request without violating Department of Transportation regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 158-62). Considered against the backdrop of Strawser's repeated failure to take any meaningful action to address the harassment complained of by Parker, these allegations are sufficient to raise a plausible inference that Parker's demotion and termination were motivated in part by her protected complaints. She has therefore sufficiently pleaded a claim for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Motions to Dismiss of Anspaugh, Ernst, Grote, and La Joye (Docs. 19-22) are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59, 65). Strawser is correct that the Sixth Circuit's most recent opinion concerning sexual orientation under Title VII held that it did not create a protected class.\n    <em>\n     Vickers v. Fairfield Med.

However, the Court is satisfied that these comments related at least in part to Parker's transgender status by suggesting that Parker was \"really a male,\" as opposed to her identification as female.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
