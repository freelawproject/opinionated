Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a dispute between siblings about money owed from a failed real estate investment. Plaintiff Zora Dugan claims that her brother, Defendant Miroslav Vlcko, breached a contract with her by not paying her back on a promissory note. Plaintiff moved for summary judgment. Dkt. 19. Defendant failed to respond until the Court entered a text only order instructing him to do so. Defendant then he filed a consolidated response and cross motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set out below, Defendant's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment will be DENIED, and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment will be GRANTED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2007, Plaintiff invested approximately $150,000 in WV Investments LLC, a real estate venture majority-owned and managed by her brother. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 89. The money was for a shopping center to be located in the greater D.C. area. From the record, it does not appear that anything memorialized this investment in writing. Nonetheless, Plaintiff received monthly disbursements as returns on this investment from October 2007 through June 2012. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or around September 29, 2011 Defendant emailed Plaintiff to let her know that the shopping center was being sold, with an anticipated closing of February 1, 2012. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 389; Dkt 11-1 at Pg ID 108. In that email he also stated \"when the loan closes [Plaintiff] will receive the unpaid portion of [her] original contribution, and [her] percentage of the net sale proceeds\" after the closing costs and expenses were deducted. Dkt. 11-1 at Pg ID 108.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff continued receiving monthly disbursements until June 2012. But she did not receive a check for her original investment or any percentage of the net sale proceeds. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 90. Plaintiff made repeated requests to Defendant during July and August 2012 for a return of her principal investment, but Defendant told her he did not have the money. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 24, 2012 Defendant emailed Plaintiff and stated \"My records show that you're owed $80,377.00 return on your original investment, and $116,039.44 as a return on percentage interest, for a total of $186,416.44.\" Dkt. 11-2 at Pg ID 110. In that same email Defendant told her he would make her the same \"deal\" he had extended to another investor in the property-\"50% interest on your money from 9/1/12 until you get paid\"-if she would agree not to collect this debt and allow him to use the funds in a new investment: a return of 50% interest on the outstanding amount from September 1, 2012 until she got paid. Dkt. 11-2 at Pg ID 110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff responded on September 25, 2012 to clarify the terms of the loan. Dkt. 11-2 at Pg ID 110. In his same-day responses to her questions Defendant told her 1) the 50% interest rate would be for each year of the loan; 2) the life of the loan would be until Defendant and his LLC could recoup \"the $8,000,000 cash I have in the projects,\" and likely by year-end; 3) the loan would be to WV Urban Developments guaranteed by Defendant and Richard Walker (Defendant's partner in the LLC). Dkt. 11-2 at Pg ID 110. According to Plaintiff, Defendant advised her that he\n   would execute a Promissory Note containing the agreed upon terms. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After this email exchange, however, Defendant failed to send Plaintiff a Promissory Note for the loan. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 91. Finally, after several requests from Plaintiff, Defendant emailed the Note to Plaintiff on June 20, 2013. Dkt. 11-3 at Pg ID 112. Signed by Defendant and Richard Walker\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the Note guaranteed payment of $194,288.92 annually to Plaintiff, representing a 20% return on the loan amount. It was effective as of December 12, 2012, personally guaranteed by Defendant and Walker, and payable on demand. Dkt. 1-4 at Pg ID 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Upon seeing that the Note contained a 20% interest term instead of the 50% that she and Defendant had previously discussed, and that it was effective as of December 2012 rather than September 2012, Plaintiff emailed Defendant on June 24, 2013 and asked him to send her \"a new note\" with the 50% interest term and a September 1, 2012 effective date. Dkt. 11-5 at Pg ID 117. Defendant replied the same day and told her he could not include a 50% interest term in the Note because it was criminal usury and that they would \"talk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Plaintiff's deposition testimony she and Defendant spoke on the phone shortly after this email exchange and he reiterated that 50% interest was usurious which was why he had included a 20% term instead. Dkt. 27-1 at Pg ID 363, 79:18-81:12. She testified that she understood this to mean that 20% was non-usurious and thus enforceable and that she agreed to the loan under those terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant does not dispute that this phone conversation occurred or what was discussed during it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   No interest payments were made on the Note. Plaintiff claims she made her first demand for payment on the Note over the phone in late 2013, and made several subsequent demands throughout 2014. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 92. Plaintiff states that Defendant responded by indicating that all of the funds she had lent had been used by WV Urban Investments LLC on options to purchase real property, but that those investments had fallen through and she was out of luck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant does not appear to dispute this account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In Spring 2015 Plaintiff received an income tax form from Defendant for WV Urban Investments LLC known as a K-1 form. A K-1 form reports income or losses from a partnership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This form named Plaintiff as a partner in WV Urban Investments LLC, though she claims she never joined the partnership. The K-1 form showed an \"ordinary business income loss\" of $193,320. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 92; Dkt. 11-7 at Pg ID 124 (2014 K-1 for WV Urban Investments LLC). Plaintiff claims Defendant told her to write off the loss on her\n   taxes, which she did not do. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 3, 2016 Plaintiff made her final demand for payment on the Promissory Note in writing. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 92; Dkt. 11-8 at Pg ID 129-30 (demand letter from Plaintiff's lawyer). In that letter Plaintiff request a payment of $330,938.79, which she calculated as her principal investment ($194,288.93) plus the 20% per year interest ($136,649.87) over the course of three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant did not respond to that letter, and has made no payments on the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff filed this suit on September 9, 2016. Dkt. 1. In her Amended Complaint, filed November 28, 2016, she claimed: 1) default on promissory note; 2) breach of contract; 3) unjust enrichment; 4) fraudulent misrepresentation; 5) silent fraud; 6) bad faith promise; 7) negligent misrepresentation; and 8) innocent misrepresentation. Dkt. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant meanwhile filed a Third-Party Complaint against Richard Walker, his partner in WV Investments LLC and the other personal guarantor of Plaintiff's Promissory Note on November 21, 2016. Dkt. 9. The two Defendants entered into a Consent Judgment on January 25, 2017 under which Third-Party Defendant Walker agreed to indemnify Defendant Vlcko for 50% of any judgment Plaintiff won against Defendant Vlcko plus 50% of Defendant Vlcko's costs in defending against this action. Dkt. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff moved for summary judgment on April 4, 2017. Dkt. 240. When Defendant failed to respond, the Court issued a text only order on September 6, 2017 ordering Defendant to respond by September 22, 2017. Defendant filed a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on September 22, 2017. Plaintiff responded on October 13, 2017, Dkt. 29, and Defendant replied on October 27, 2017. Dkt. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A hearing on the cross motions for summary judgment was held on December 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff has made eight claims: 1) Default on Promissory Note; 2) Breach of Contract; 3) Unjust Enrichment/Quantum Meruit (as an alternative to breach of contract theory); 4) Fraudulent Misrepresentation; 5) Silent Fraud; 6) Fraud Based on Bad-Faith Promise; 7) Negligent Misrepresentation; 8) Innocent Misrepresentation. For each cause of action Plaintiff has requested the same relief: a judgment against Defendant in the amount of $344,107.26-the amount she alleges she is owed under the terms of the promissory note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Default on Promissory Note/Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Defendant is in default on the signed Promissory Note that he emailed to her on June 24, 2013, and has thus breached their contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant argues that the Promissory Note is not enforceable because 1) there was no consideration exchanged for it and 2) Plaintiff is not the holder in due course of the Note. Finally the Defendant argues that even if the Note is enforceable, the 20% interest rate is usurious under Michigan law and may not be enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Promissory Note is a negotiable instrument under the UCC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In order to be a cognizable negotiable instrument under the UCC as adopted by Michigan, the Promissory Note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 a) must be payable to the bearer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 b) on demand or at a definite time, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 c) must not contain an undertaking other than payment of money (i.e. it cannot impose any other additional conditions of performance for payment).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   MCLA \u00a7 440.3104(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff's Promissory Note satisfies this definition because it is a) payable \"to the order of Zora Dugan\"; b) payable \"in full at any time or in part from time to time\"; and c) does not include any other additional requirement with which Plaintiff must comply in order to receive that promised payment on demand. Dkt. 1-4 at Pg ID 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Additionally the Note is \"certain as to the sum paid\"-$194,288.92 plus interest at 20% per annum-\"and the time of payment\"-it states \"effective as of December 12, 2012.\"\n   <em>\n    First Nat.

Dkt. 30 at Pg ID 432-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In support of this argument, Defendant points to Plaintiff's own testimony that she never possessed nor requested an\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   copy of the Promissory Note. Therefore, Defendant argues, she cannot now enforce it. Dkt. 27 at Pg ID 325. Defendant does not explain where the requirement that the possessed instrument be a \"wet-ink\" instrument comes from, nor does Defendant raise any argument about the authenticity of the emailed copy-or his signature on it-that Plaintiff has presented to the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In supplemental briefing submitted to the Court after the summary judgment hearing, Defendant reiterated similar arguments. Defendant's line of reasoning goes that 1) Plaintiff is not the \"Holder\" of the promissory note as defined under \u00a7 440.1201(2)(u) because she does not have \"possession\" of the original promissory note; and 2) Plaintiff does not have \"possession\" of the original promissory note because it was neither \"issued\" by Defendant under MCL \u00a7 440.3105, nor \"delivered\" to her by Defendant under MCL \u00a7 440.1201(2)(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ). Dkt 33 at Pg ID 443.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To satisfy the definition of a holder of an instrument a person must be either i) in possession of negotiable instrument that is payable either to the bearer or to an identified person that is the person in possession; ii) in possession of a negotiable tangible document or title if the goods are deliverable either to bearer or to the order of the person in possession, or iii) a person in control of a negotiable electronic document of title. MCL 440.1201(u)(i)-(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Regarding Defendant's first argument that Plaintiff did not have \"possession\" of the Promissory Note because the Note was not \"issued\" by Defendant pursuant to MCL \u00a7 440.3105 : \u00a7 440.3105(1) defines \"issue\" as the \"first delivery of an instrument by the make or drawer, whether to a holder or non-holder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person.\" Thus Defendant's argument turns on whether the \"delivery\" of the Promissory Note via email was sufficient under the definition of \"delivery\" in MCL \u00a7 440.1201(2)(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ), which reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"Delivery\" means either of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (i) With respect to an electronic document of title, a voluntary transfer of control\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (ii) With respect to an instrument, document of title, or chattel paper, a voluntary transfer of possession\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Under the plain reading of this definition, the key requirement for delivery of an instrument, like a promissory note, is the \"voluntary transfer of possession.\" MCL \u00a7 440.1201(2)(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant has made no argument here that he did not voluntarily submit the Promissory Note to Plaintiff when he sent a signed copy to her via email. Thus the email appears to satisfy the plain meaning of a \"voluntary transfer of possession.\" Moreover, Defendant has not cited, nor has the Court found, any case law from this jurisdiction or Michigan state courts interpreting the delivery requirement to preclude this type of promissory note transfer. Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-CV-12634,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201913415\">\n    2009 WL 1913415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.

MCL 438.61(a).

Plaintiff contends these statements constituted a representation about a material part of their agreement.

But a reasonable jury could also conclude, as Defendant argues, that the only representation Defendant made to Plaintiff was that 20% was not\n   <em>\n    criminally\n   </em>\n   usurious, not technically a misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Representation was false\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Assuming the inferred misrepresentation was that 20% interest was non-usurious, a jury could reasonably find that this representation was legally inaccurate as discussed above and thus false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Knowingly false or reckless disregard for truth\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiff has not offered specific evidence establishing that Defendant\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that an interest rate of 20% constituted civil usury under Michigan law. Her argument appears instead to be that he should have known given his familiarity with banking law-in other words, though she does not characterize her argument this way, that he offered her 20% interest after recklessly disregarding the possibility that that the revised interest rate might also be unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 19 at Pg ID 268, 273.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Defendant argues that he did not deal with these types of loan transactions regularly in his work as an attorney, but admits that he had \"the expertise to research the usury statute to determine if 20% was usurious.\" Dkt. 27 at Pg ID 331. Defendant further argues that he did not conduct this research because Plaintiff did not ask him to do so, and he did not have any other affirmative obligation to do so. A reasonable jury could find either way on the question of whether Defendant acted with reckless disregard as to the falsity of the representation that 20% interest was non-usurious by failing to conduct further research.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    iv. Representation with the intention that Plaintiff rely on it\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Defendant's email communications with Plaintiff about the Note indicate it was his intent that the interest rate serve as an incentive for Plaintiff to loan him the money he owed her. Defendant stated in his\n   September 24, 2012 that he would \"make [Plaintiff] the same deal\" he offered another investor, which was the 50% interest rate. Dkt. 11-2 at Pg ID 110; Dkt. 11-3 at Pg ID 112; Dkt. 1-6 at Pg ID 121. He emailed her the Note on June 20, 2013, which contained the 20% interest rate instead. Dkt. 11-3 at Pg ID 112; Dkt. 11-4 at Pg ID 2. When Plaintiff replied on June 24, 2013 asking Defendant to send her a new note with the previously agreed upon 50% interest term, Defendant responded that 50% was criminal usury, but stated \"we'll talk.\" Dkt. 11-5 at PG ID 117. At this point Plaintiff had not accepted the loan terms. When they spoke on the phone shortly after the June 24, 2013 email exchange Defendant's representations about the terms of the loan-specifically the interest rate, which was Plaintiff's sticking point for agreeing to the loan-were made for the purpose of getting Plaintiff to agree to the loan arrangement laid out in the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Defendant attests that he did not intend the Note to be a promissory note, which is dubious given that he drafted it and titled it \"Promissory Note.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11-4 at Pg ID 115. He then states that he did have \"every intention of paying [Plaintiff] back under its terms.\" Dkt. 27-2 at Pg ID 390. Neither of these statements nor any argument in Defendant's briefing directly addresses his intent in telling her he was guaranteeing the Note at 20% interest because 50% was criminally usurious.

Defendant has not disputed that Plaintiff is owed this money, and in fact testified that he had every intention of paying it to her-just not pursuant to the Note, which he does not believe is enforceable. Dkt. 27-2 at Pg ID 389.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   There is thus no dispute of material fact that Plaintiff has suffered economic loss as a result of her reliance on Defendant's representation regarding the interest rate; namely the amount in interest that she would be owed under the 20% interest term of the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Because Plaintiff has not established that as a matter of law on this record Defendant made a material misrepresentation that 20% was a generally non-usurious interest rate or that he did so either with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard as to its falsity the Court denies Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to her fraudulent misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    2.
