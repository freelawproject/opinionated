The property at issue includes approximately $15 million in cash and seized funds from several bank accounts; Claude Monet's\n   <em>\n    L'\u00c9glise et La Seine \u00e0 V\u00e9theuil\n   </em>\n   and Alfred Sisley's\n   <em>\n    Langland Bay\n   </em>\n   (and other paintings); and sundry personal items (including jewelry, carpets, pens, boxes, and a jade and wooden screen). The District Attorney for New\n   York County (\"District Attorney\" or \"DANY\") seized the contested assets during its criminal investigation and prosecution of Vilma Bautista, a confidante and personal secretary of Imelda Marcos. The DANY, an innocent stakeholder with no claim of ownership to the Interpleader Property, transferred the property to this Court so that the rightful owner or owners could be determined. Among the claimants are: the Republic of the Philippines (\"Republic\"); a class of human rights victims led by Jose Duran, who are judgment creditors against Imelda Marcos (\"Class Plaintiffs\"); Vilma Bautista, who in addition to serving as Imelda Marcos's personal aide during the relevant time period also worked for the Philippine government from 1966 until 1986, including as a Foreign Service Officer for the Philippine Mission to the United Nations; and the Golden Budha Corporation along with the Estate of Roger Roxas (together, \"Roxas\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court are seven motions, comprising five cross-motions for summary judgment, one motion to dismiss, and one motion for imposition of attorneys' retaining and charging liens. The motions are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \u2022 Class Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment against the Republic (Dkt. # 193);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022 Class Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment against Roxas (Dkt. # 369);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 Bautista's motion for summary judgment against Class Plaintiffs and the Republic (Dkt. # 201);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Bautista's motion for summary judgment against Roxas (Dkt. # 377);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Roxas's motion for summary judgment against Class Plaintiffs and Bautista (Dkt. # 383);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 The Republic's motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to stay the case (Dkt. # 411); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Simon &amp; Partners LLP's (\"S&amp;P's\") motion to authorize imposition of attorneys' retaining and charging liens (Dkt. # 357).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court addresses each motion in turn. For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies each motion except S&amp;P's motion to authorize imposition of attorneys' liens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This interpleader action is the latest in what is now a long series of proceedings-spanning decades and pursued in numerous jurisdictions\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -in which claimants\n   have sought ownership over assets that Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos allegedly misappropriated during Mr. Marcos's tenure as President of the Philippines. A full recitation of the history of the disputes between Mr. and Mrs. Marcos, on one side, and the claimants, on the other, would fill volumes. Rather than engage in such an exhaustive factual recitation, the Court instead focuses on the facts that pertain directly to the pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Ferdinand Marcos's Presidency, and the Presidential Commission on Good Government\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ferdinand Marcos served as President of the Philippines from 1965 until 1986. (Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6 2). He was elected to two terms in office, in 1965 and 1969. Rather than leaving office at the end of his second term, as required under the Philippine Constitution, Mr. Marcos instead imposed martial law in September 1972. He \"confiscated businesses[,] particularly those of his adversaries[,] and ordered mass arrest and detention which, in many instances, resulted in the torture of political opponents, critics, independent publishers[,] and journalists[.]\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In February 1986, a popular uprising removed Mr. Marcos from office, and he and Mrs. Marcos fled to Hawaii. (Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6 3). On February 25, 1986, Corazon Aquino was sworn in as the new President of the Philippines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). Shortly after her inauguration, President Aquino enacted Executive Order No. 1, which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , created the Presidential Commission on Good Government (\"PCGG\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). The PCGG was charged with recovering assets that Mr. Marcos, Mrs. Marcos, and their family had misappropriated during the Marcos presidency. To date, the PCGG has collected over 8 million pages of documents relating to Mr. and Mrs. Marcos's assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 1986, the PCGG established an office in New York City to track down assets that Mr. and Mrs. Marcos had acquired. (Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6 23). It identified artwork that had been removed from properties in New York City, including a townhouse at 13-15 East 66th Street, which was owned by the Republic but had been used as a residence by Mr. and Mrs. Marcos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). Artwork had similarly been removed from an apartment in the Olympic Tower at 641 Fifth Avenue that Mr. and Mrs. Marcos had used as a private residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The PCGG inventoried the paintings that had been displayed at the New York properties. (Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6 24). Using bills, invoices, and labels placed on the walls where the paintings had been hung, the PCGG created a list of specific works of art that had gone missing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28). The PCGG then took several steps to try to locate the missing artwork. It served subpoenas\n   <em>\n    duces tecum\n   </em>\n   on art galleries and auction houses in New York and elsewhere, including Marlborough Gallery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). It launched a campaign, called \"Where's the Art?\", aimed at increasing public awareness of the PCGG's efforts to recover the artwork and ratcheting up the pressure on Mr. and Mrs. Marcos to return whatever artwork they possessed. On June 23, 1986, the PCGG issued a press release in which it \"ask[ed] artists, school children, media specialists, the general\n   public and the press to cheerfully join the campaign by writing to Mrs. Marcos on Where's the Art? postcards[.]\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 13). That press release included a list of missing paintings; the list made specific reference to Monet's\n   <em>\n    L'\u00c9glise et La Seine \u00e0 V\u00e9theuil\n   </em>\n   and Sisley's\n   <em>\n    Langland Bay\n   </em>\n   , but made no mention of Monet's\n   <em>\n    Le Bassin aux Nymph\u00e9as\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Interpleader Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The DANY seized most of the Interpleader Property from Bautista and from bank accounts holding funds in Bautista's or her sisters' names on July 18 and July 19, 2011. (Compl. \u00b6 19). The seized property included: (i) 10 paintings, a Serafian Isfahan rug, and $251,142 in cash from Bautista's Manhattan residence; (ii) 114 items of jewelry and $2,386 in cash from the residence of Bautista's sisters; (iii) 42 paintings and a rug from Bautista's Long Island residence; and (iv) approximately $13,654,349.32 from bank accounts in Bautista's name and $1,270,000 from an account jointly controlled by Bautista and one of her sisters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20). The DANY also froze six life insurance or annuity accounts in Bautista's name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20). And on July 28, 2011, Hoffinger, Stern &amp; Ross LLP, Bautista's former attorneys, surrendered two additional paintings in connection with the criminal action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The 1975 Acquisition of Monet's\n    <em>\n     L'\u00c9glise et La Seine \u00e0 V\u00e9theuil\n    </em>\n    and Sisley's\n    <em>\n     Langland Bay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 12, 1975, Marlborough Gallery in London sold six paintings on consignment-for a total of $450,000, of which $200,000 was paid at the time of sale-to Fe Gimenez, personal secretary and confidante of Imelda Marcos, on Mrs. Marcos's behalf. (Swift Decl., Ex. 2). The paintings included Monet's\n   <em>\n    L'\u00c9glise et La Seine \u00e0 V\u00e9theuil\n   </em>\n   , which sold for $138,000, and Sisley's\n   <em>\n    Langland Bay\n   </em>\n   , which sold for $82,000. The Sales Report lists Mrs. Gimenez's address as \"Study Room, Malacanang Palace, Manila, Philippines.\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 2). The delivery instructions state: \"All taken except Moore[,] which should be delivered to the Philippines['] London Embassy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Consignment Note, on Marlborough Gallery's letterhead and dated November 26, 1975 (when the paintings were dispatched), is addressed to \"Madame Marcos, Malacanang Palace, Manila, Philippines.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The 1977 Acquisition of Monet's\n    <em>\n     Le Bassin aux Nymph\u00e9as\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 31, 1977, Mrs. Marcos purchased nine paintings from Marlborough Gallery for a total of $2.9 million. (Swift Decl., Ex. 3). The most expensive was Monet's\n   <em>\n    Le Bassin aux Nymph\u00e9as\n   </em>\n   (the \"Water Lily\" painting), which sold for $791,800. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The money used to purchase the paintings came from a Swiss bank account held in the name of Trinidad Foundation, a foundation created in 1970. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 5; Republic Opp. Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6 17). Mrs. Marcos was the primary beneficiary of the Trinidad Foundation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 1986, after Mr. Marcos was removed from office, the Swiss government froze several of the Trinidad Foundation's bank accounts. It did so based on the Republic's claim that all of the money in the accounts had been misappropriated by Mr. and Mrs. Marcos, and that the Republic was the rightful owner. (Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6 31). In August 1991, the Swiss government provided documentation of transactions that had been processed through the Trinidad Foundation's bank accounts, including specific references to the March 29, 1977 payment of $2.9 million to the London bank account of Marlborough Fine Arts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Display and Subsequent Removal of the Paintings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   During the Marcos presidency, artwork purchased on behalf of Mrs. Marcos was displayed at the townhouse at 13-15 East 66th Street in New York City. (Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). The Republic owned that property, which served as the Philippine Consulate in New York, though it was also used by Mr. and Mrs. Marcos as a private residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mrs. Marcos also displayed some of the artwork at a second residence in New York, an apartment in the Olympic Tower. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Bautista took possession of the paintings, though the timing of her appropriation of the paintings is a point of speculation and of some contention. Class Plaintiffs assert that, \"[i]n late 1985 or early 1986, the three paintings were removed and hidden by Bautista[.]\" (Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6 20). The Republic, by contrast, is unwilling to provide even a general timeframe for Bautista's appropriation of the paintings. It states merely that \"[t]he time period when the[ ] [paintings] were taken is yet unclear.\" (Republic Opp. Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6 20). What is undisputed is that, when officials from the PCGG searched for the paintings after Mr. Marcos was swept from power in 1986, it did not find them in either the townhouse or the Olympic Tower apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Bautista's Sale of the Water Lily Painting, and Her Subsequent Prosecution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Sale of the Water Lily Painting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 14, 2010, Bautista sold the Water Lily painting to a London gallery for $32 million. (Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6 34). In connection with that sale, Bautista provided the purchaser with a Certificate of Authority, signed by Mrs. Marcos and dated June 21, 1991, stating that Bautista was \"[Mrs. Marcos's] authorized representative to offer and negotiate, on [Mrs. Marcos's] behalf, the sale and/or disposition of [Monet's Water Lily painting.]\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 11). It further indicated that Bautista was \"authorized to sign, on [Mrs. Marcos's] behalf, the corresponding deeds of transfer of ownership of [the] painting[ ]\" and \"to receive and/or sign receipts for the proceeds of the sale of [the] painting[ ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In a letter issued to the purchaser of the Water Lily painting, Bautista explained that, during one of Mrs. Marcos's visits to New York in 1991, \"a number of original copies of a pro forma Certificate of Authority [were] prepared and notarized ... and each one was signed by Mrs. Marcos.\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 12). For each, \"the central section where the description of the asset to be sold ... was left blank for later completion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In February 2010, Bautista \"used one of the signed and notarized Certificates of Authority and typed in the appropriate section therein the description for the painting now being sold.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She went on to note that \"Mrs. Marcos believes that all her correspondence as well as other communications are always subject to constant monitoring and surveillance by the government (both Philippine and U.S.),\" and thus that \"confidentiality should always be preserved and maintained for all sensitive matters such as the sale of the [p]ainting in question.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Bautista further stated that she had \"received instructions from [Mrs. Marcos] to sell the [p]ainting, and [Mrs. Marcos] [wa]s aware of the sale.\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 12). She was \"acting as [Mrs. Marcos's] agent with authority to sell the [p]ainting of which [Bautista] ha[d] physical possession[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The painting \"ha[d] been in [Bautista's] possession for a good number of years and ha[d] been kept in different locations in New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Bautista did not \"have any documentary record of when the [p]ainting was purchased by Mrs. Marcos,\n   but to the best of [Bautista's] recollection ... it was bought together with other paintings in London during the late 70s or early 80s.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Bautista closed by stating: \"In entering into the Agreement and at the Closing, I shall continue to act as [Mrs. Marcos's] authorized agent and representative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Bautista's Criminal Prosecution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In 2011, the DANY launched an investigation into the sale of the Water Lily painting, which investigation culminated in Bautista's indictment on October 8, 2012. (Bautista 56.1 \u00b6 22). Bautista was \"charged with having illegally conspired to possess and sell valuable works of art acquired by Marcos during her husband's presidency, keep the proceeds for herself, and hide those proceeds from New York State tax authorities and others.\" (Compl. \u00b6 16). She and her co-conspirators \"attempted to sell the paintings covertly using a variety of illicit means.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). After selling the Water Lily painting, Bautista received $32 million dollars, \"paid her accomplices 'commissions,' and kept the rest of the money herself.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). And in April 2011, Bautista filed a 2010 tax return that did not mention the sale or any income derived therefrom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On November 18, 2013, after a five-week trial, Bautista was found guilty on all counts, including Conspiracy in the Fourth Degree, Criminal Tax Fraud in the First Degree, and Offering a False Instrument for Filing in the First Degree. (Compl. \u00b6 18). The criminal action determined that \"Bautista was not the rightful owner of the [paintings], including the Water[ ] Lily painting[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). On October 20, 2015, the Appellate Division reversed the conspiracy conviction (but affirmed the remaining convictions) after finding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"[t]he trial court erred in reading or paraphrasing approximately eight sentences from an order of the Supreme Court of the Philippines ... [where] [o]nly one sentence read by the court to the jury purported to state the law of the Philippines[.]\"\n   <em>\n    People\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bautista\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4367972,4353046\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/132/523/\">\n    132 A.D.3d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353046\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/132/523/4353046/#p49\">\n    18 N.Y.S.3d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (1st Dep't 2015). The DANY elected not to retry Bautista on the conspiracy conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Prior Judgments That Claimants Seek to Enforce in This Interpleader\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Roxas's Hawaii Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Roxas brought suit against Mr. and Mrs. Marcos in Hawaii state court on February 19, 1988, alleging then-as he\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   does now-that, in January 1971, he discovered a \"lost treasure\" that was reputed to have been left by General Tomoyuki Yamashita (the \"Yamashita Treasure\") in underground tunnels in Baguio City in the Philippines. (Roxas 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 32-33). The treasure included a Buddha statue made of one metric ton of gold, handfuls of uncut diamonds, and boxes filled with gold bars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-7). Roxas further alleged that, in May 1971 and again in July 1972, he was taken into custody and tortured at President Marcos's direction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-13). Roxas claimed that, in late 1974, government soldiers seized the Yamashita Treasure and that Marcos subsequently sold much, if not all, of the gold. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Hawaii lawsuit sought compensation for Roxas's torture and false imprisonment, as well as for the treasure that [Mr. Marcos] had allegedly converted. (Roxas 56.1 \u00b6 33). Mr. Marcos died on September 28, 1989, and Mrs. Marcos stipulated that she would serve as the decedent's representative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37). The case went\n   to trial in the summer of 1996. On July 19, 1996, the jury issued a verdict: It found Mr. Marcos\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   liable and awarded Roxas $6 million in damages for battery and false imprisonment; $1.3 million for the golden Buddha statue; $100,000 for seventeen gold bars and $5,000 for a coin collection taken from Roxas's house; and $22 billion for the gold bullion that Mr. Marcos had converted from an underground storage area, which constituted the bulk of the Yamashita Treasure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 45-50). The verdict was issued against Mr. Marcos and subsequently amended by the intermediate appellate court to reflect that it was a judgment against Mr. Marcos's estate (the \"Marcos Estate\" or the \"Estate\") and against Imelda Marcos as the Estate's personal representative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Mrs. Marcos appealed. (Roxas 56.1 \u00b6 51). The Hawaii Supreme Court addressed two issues relevant to the instant action. Preliminarily, it assessed whether the lower court had erred in appointing Mrs. Marcos as representative of the Marcos Estate. It held that, even though \"an heir of an undistributed estate ... is not a 'proper party' for substitution,\" Mrs. Marcos was \"judicially estopped from attempting to renounce her prior disingenuous position regarding her legal status[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Roxas\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marcos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/\">\n    89 Hawai'i 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/\">\n    969 P.2d 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1240 (1998). For this reason, the court rejected Mrs. Marcos's argument that the judgment should not have been entered against her as representative of the Estate. As the court noted, \"in order to achieve manifest justice consistent with the doctrine of judicial estoppel, the equities of this case require us to hold Imelda personally liable, at least to the extent of her interest in the assets of the Marcos Estate[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1244.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The court next addressed whether Roxas had produced sufficient evidence to support the verdict. It began by noting that \"Ferdinand's witnessed possession of large amounts of gold, combined with the testimony of [co-conspirators] that at least some of the gold was resmelted and surreptitiously sold, constitute[d] sufficient corroboration of the testimony that Ferdinand was attempting to launder and fraudulently convey Roxas's gold.\"\n   <em>\n    Roxas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/\">\n    969 P.2d at 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further found that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Mr. Marcos had converted some of the Yamashita Treasure and had battered and falsely imprisoned Roxas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1256-60. It therefore upheld the damage award as to the battery and false imprisonment claims, as well as the damages flowing from the theft of the golden Buddha statue and the seventeen gold bars and coin collection taken from Roxas's home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1266-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   However, the court reversed the portion of the verdict awarding Roxas $22 billion for \"one storage area\" of gold bullion.\n   <em>\n    Roxas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/\">\n    969 P.2d at 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found that the testimony regarding the quantity of gold in the storage area was \"extremely vague.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1260 (\"For example, Jonsson testified that the room he had seen was '\n   <em>\n    [m]aybe\n   </em>\n   40 feet by 20,\n   <em>\n    something like that\n   </em>\n   ' ... and that he 'believed' that the ceiling was twelve feet tall, '[m]aybe more.\n   <em>\n    I don't remember\n   </em>\n   .' \" (emphases in original) ). Because the testimony was so imprecise, it \"afforded the jury no legitimate basis for determining damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The vacillations in the testimony concerning volume admitted a \"margin of error comprising thousands of tons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the court overturned the $22 billion award for the gold bullion. Roxas was left\n   with a judgment of $6 million in damages for battery and false imprisonment, and $1,405,000 for the theft of the golden Buddha statue and the seventeen gold bars and coin collection taken from Roxas's house (the \"Roxas Judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

In that complaint, the DANY identified various parties that had already asserted or were expected to assert claims to the Interpleader Property, including: the Republic, Class Plaintiffs, Bautista and her sisters, Imelda Marcos, and an unnamed artist and museum in the Philippines. Of those parties, only the Republic, Class Plaintiffs, and Bautista remain in this action.

Two-Step Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Interpleader actions typically proceed in two stages. In the first stage, the Court determines \"that the requirements of \u00a7 1335 are met and reliev[es] the plaintiff stakeholder from liability[.]\"\n   <em>\n    N.Y. Life Ins.

In the instant matter, the Court has already determined that interpleader was proper and ordered the deposit of the Interpleader Property into the Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 72). The second stage of the interpleader process requires the Court to adjudicate the parties' adverse claims on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Truck-A-Tune, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Re\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1194974\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/856/77/#p79\">\n    856 F.Supp. 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79 (D.

Equitable Nature of Interpleader Remedy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Interpleader actions are often characterized as equitable in nature. The Second Circuit has observed that \"[i]nterpleader is an equitable proceeding,\"\n   <em>\n    Truck-A-Tune, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10502848\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/60/\">\n    23 F.3d at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and district courts have long held similarly,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    William Penn Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Viscuso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3096797\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/569/355/#p362\">\n    569 F.Supp.2d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 362 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (\"Although sanctioned by statute, interpleader is fundamentally an equitable remedy.\");\n   <em>\n    Citigroup Glob. Mkts., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    KLCC Invs., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 06 Civ. 5466 (LBS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20102128\">\n    2007 WL 102128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 11, 2007) (\"[I]nterpleader is an equitable remedy that should be applied liberally[.]\");\n   <em>\n    Irving Tr. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Leisure Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"431996\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/93/102/#p110\">\n    93 F.R.D. 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (\"Interpleader is an equitable\n   device[.]\"). References to interpleaders as an equitable remedy appear with such frequency-but with such little exposition-that claimants would be forgiven for wondering what role, if any, the remedy's equitable nature plays in a court's adjudication of the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This Court therefore pauses to provide some explanation of the contours of interpleaders' equitable nature. The Court is compelled to do so here, in part because some of the claimants evince a rather expansive-and, in this Court's view, impermissibly broad-understanding of interpleaders' equitable nature. For example, in Roxas's opposition to Class Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, Roxas suggests that this Court may consider equitable principles even where they might conflict with traditional legal principles and that the Court may exercise its broad discretion to fashion a remedy that achieves equity but derogates well-established legal principles. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roxas SJ Opp. Class Plaintiffs 14 (\"In sum, in weighing the equities among the parties, the Court should favor [Roxas].\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court does not understand its discretion to be quite so broad, nor the equitable principles that apply to interpleader actions to be quite so far-reaching. To be sure, interpleader is an equitable remedy. But the Court is still required to apply legal principles in adjudicating the merits of the parties' claims. The U.S. Supreme Court has advised that \"[c]ourts of equity can no more disregard statutory and constitutional requirements and provisions than can courts of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587457\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1378/#p1385\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1385,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587457\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1378/#p1385\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    I.N.S.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pangilinan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225681\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/875/#p883\">\n    486 U.S. 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225681\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/875/#p883\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225681\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/875/#p883\">\n    100 L.Ed.2d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) ). In the interpleader context, courts in this Circuit have held-properly so-that legal, rather than equitable, principles govern the adjudication of the merits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    XL Specialty Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lakian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274757\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/243/434/#p448\">\n    243 F.Supp.3d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 448 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (\"[Party's] appeal to the Court's equitable powers does not justify deviating from the clear legal principles in this case.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   A review of the context in which courts discuss the equitable nature of interpleaders is revealing: Courts most often do so in deciding whether to allow an interpleader to go forward at all; they rarely do so in adjudicating the merits of the parties' competing claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Truck-A-Tune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10502848\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/60/\">\n    23 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   63 ;\n   <em>\n    Great Wall De Venezuela C.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Interaudi Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358389\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/117/474/#p483\">\n    117 F.Supp.3d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483-84 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    Viscuso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3096797\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/569/355/#p362\">\n    569 F.Supp.2d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The equitable nature of the remedy, in other words, applies principally at step 1 (determining whether interpleader is proper), not at step 2 (deciding the merits). To the extent that a court has greater discretion in the interpleader context than it does in other contexts, that discretion finds its currency in a court's decision to permit a plaintiff to consolidate multiple adverse claims into a single action in order to \"protect [the plaintiff] from vexatious and multiple litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.

Choice of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court addresses the threshold issue of which law should apply to the parties' claims. At the motion to dismiss stage, this issue was raised, with Class Plaintiffs and\n   the Republic advancing competing views of the applicable law. Then, the Republic argued that Philippine Law R.A. 1379 applies to-and is dispositive of-the question of ownership of the Interpleader Property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 89 at 9-10). Class Plaintiffs, for their part, argued that Philippine law did not apply, and that the action instead was governed by New York law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 99 at 3-7). Class Plaintiffs suggested, in the alternative, that the law of Switzerland or Liechtenstein might apply to some subset of questions regarding the funds that the Trinidad Foundation had deposited in a Swiss bank account, but that, in any event, Philippine law could not apply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 n.3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In denying the motion to dismiss, this Court wrote at some length on the choice of law issue, which it characterized as \"[p]erhaps the most perplexing issue presented[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Philippines I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%209022580\">\n    2016 WL 9022580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

The Court found that, under either statute, New York choice of law principles apply.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 312). And as the Court explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in note 5, it will only consider the expert affidavit for limited purposes, as it was submitted alongside an amended brief that was filed late and without leave of Court or consent of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The parties' briefs themselves fail adequately to address the choice of law issues. If anything, choice of law seems to have receded from the parties' view. Whereas the Republic devoted several pages to the issue in its opposition to the motion to dismiss (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 89 at 9-14), its opposition to Class Plaintiffs' pending summary judgment motion contains but a single parenthetical on point (Republic SJ Opp. Class Plaintiffs 4). The Republic merely states that, \"[i]n the end, regardless of what law applies (i.e.[,] even if R.A. 1379 does not apply, which we do not concede), the general principle that no [one] may take advantage of their own wrong ... forecloses any statute of limitations argument[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Far from providing the Court with the requisite analysis or expert testimony on point, the Republic instead opines that it \"perhaps ... spent too much of the Court's time addressing the choice-of-law analysis [at the motion to dismiss stage.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To the contrary: The Court had expected that the Republic would expend more effort, and provide greater analysis, to elucidate the choice of law issue. Instead, the Republic and the other claimants have analyzed each of the issues in this interpleader action-with two exceptions discussed below-under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Second Circuit has held that courts need not \"examine foreign legal sources independently ... in the absence of any suggestion that such a course will be fruitful or [that the court will receive] any help from the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Bartsch\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2103158\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/391/150/\">\n    391 F.2d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155 n.3 (2d Cir. 1968).

As attested by Mr. Agcaoili, Article 748 of the Philippine New Civil Code establishes that, for any donation of personal property worth more than five thousand Philippine pesos (equivalent to approximately $95, as of the date of this Opinion), \"the donation and acceptance shall be made in writing. Otherwise, the donation shall be void.\" (Dkt. # 312 \u00b6 24). The Philippine Supreme Court has enforced this requirement: In a case involving a donation of 3,297,800 pesos, where the acceptance was not in writing, the court held that the donation was invalid under Article 748. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25).

In property disputes, \"New York choice of law rules require the application of an interests analysis, in which the law of the jurisdiction having the greatest interest in the litigation [is] applied and ... the facts or contacts which obtain significance in defining State interests are those which relate to the purpose of the particular law in conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    Pertamina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313298\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/70/#p84\">\n    313 F.3d at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As to the Deed of Assignment's validity, there can be little doubt that the Republic has the greatest interest in having its law apply. The Deed was signed on August 5, 1983, by Imelda Marcos, then-First Lady of the Philippines, at the Malacanang Palace in Manila. (Dkt. # 208-5). The notary public who witnessed the signature, Eliseo A. Razon, attested that the Deed was executed \"in the City of Manila.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). And the Deed itself is being held by the Clerk of Court at the Regional Trial Court in Manila. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A review of the\n   Deed's contents reveals but a single connection to New York: At the time, Bautista resided at 210 West 70th Street in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But even that fact does not militate against applying Philippine law, given that Bautista was sent to New York by the Philippine government in connection with her work as a Philippine Foreign Service Officer. This constellation of facts establishes that the Republic has the greatest interest in having its law determine the validity of the Deed. Accordingly, the Court will apply Philippine law to that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

With one exception, the Court considers each motion separately, as the motions raise unique questions of fact and law.

The Court Remains Unpersuaded That Class Plaintiffs Have Standing to Bring This Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court begins by addressing an issue that it raised in its January 20, 2016 Order denying Class Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss-namely, Class Plaintiffs' standing to file a motion against cross-claims in which they are not named.\n   <em>\n    Philippines I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%209022580\">\n    2016 WL 9022580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3. Then, the Court was \"concerned about their standing to file a motion to dismiss given the state of pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. It noted the tension between procedures that apply to interpleader actions-whereby each claimant is adversarial to the others and is expected to respond to the others' claims-and rules governing motion practice more generally in federal court, according to which a party \"lacks standing to attack the legal sufficiency of those other counts\" to which \"he has not been named as a defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dover Ltd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    A.B.

The fact that the dispositive motion is now brought under Rule 56, rather than Rule 12, does not render the issue moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dover, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202987054\">\n    2006 WL 2987054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (\"[D]efendant lacks standing to move for dismissal or summary judgment with respect to count in which he is not named[.]\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Std.

Del. Dec. 8, 1994) ). In their motion for summary judgment, Class Plaintiffs assert that \"[t]his Court's January 20, 2016 decision ..., questioning the standing of one interpleader defendant to attack the claims of another, was limited to Rule 12 motions.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Br. Republic 11 n.8). The Court does not share Class Plaintiffs' view. To be sure, the Court stated that it was \"concerned about [Class Plaintiffs'] standing to file a\n   <em>\n    motion to dismiss\n   </em>\n   given the state of the pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Philippines I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%209022580\">\n    2016 WL 9022580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (emphasis added). But nothing in the Opinion suggests that the Court's analysis would somehow not apply equally to summary judgment motions. To the extent the Court focused its analysis on Class Plaintiffs' standing to bring a motion to dismiss, it did so because that was the motion pending before it, not because its concern was confined to Rule 12(b)(6) motions. And Class Plaintiffs have provided no reason to distinguish-for purposes of the standing issue-between motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Court is struck that Class Plaintiffs' most recent submissions fail to address the Court's concerns in any meaningful way. Class Plaintiffs merely restate, in conclusory terms, their previous position that \"[t]he nature of a statutory interpleader is that a defendant may assert his own claims to the property at issue and dispute the claims of others to that property.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Br. Republic 11). They cite no new authority; as before, they rely on the\n   <em>\n    Barry Fisher Law Firm\n   </em>\n   decision that this Court previously found unpersuasive. And though they still maintain that they have a levy on the property and that such levy confers standing, they have provided no authority at all suggesting that a party may, by operation of a levy, move for summary judgment against claims in which it is not named. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Class Plaintiffs have failed to assuage any of the Court's concerns regarding standing. For this reason, the Court continues to question Class Plaintiffs' standing to file dispositive motions, including this motion for summary judgment. Still, the Court proceeds to address Class Plaintiffs' substantive claims that (i) the Republic lacks standing to bring most of its cross-claims, and (ii) all of the cross-claims are time-barred under the relevant statutes of limitations. For the reasons stated below, the Court rejects both claims on their merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Republic Has Standing to Bring Each Cause of Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Class Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on seven of the Republic's eight causes of action,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that those claims \"must be dismissed for lack of standing because the Republic is not the 'owner' of the paintings or the proceeds therefrom.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Br. Republic 18). As Class Plaintiffs would have it, the Republic lacks standing to bring the following claims: conversion, aiding and abetting conversion, unjust enrichment, misappropriation of public property, New York Executive Law \u00a7 632-a(3), monies had and received, and replevin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-20). Class Plaintiffs' position is that each of these causes of action may be brought solely by the owner of property at issue, and \"[s]ince the Republic is not the owner of the paintings, it has no legally protected interest in the paintings or the proceeds from their sale, and may not assert the rights of the owner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Despite Class Plaintiffs' claims to the contrary, the Court cannot find, as a matter of law, that the Republic lacks standing to bring these claims. To begin, Class Plaintiffs misconstrue the law when they suggest that these seven causes of action may only be brought by parties who owned and possessed the personal property at stake. In\n   <em>\n    Torrance Construction, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jaques\n   </em>\n   , an employer brought claims for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , aiding and abetting conversion, money had and received, and constructive trust against defendants who had stolen money and used that money for personal purchases used to make improvements to defendants' home.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4161962\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/127/1261/\">\n    127 A.D.3d 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4161962\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/127/1261/\">\n    8 N.Y.S.3d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 443-44 (3d Dep't 2015). Though the plaintiff had not physically possessed any of the items purchased with the stolen money, the court upheld each of these claims. So too have courts in this District. For example, a court in this District explained that, \"[t]o establish a cause of action in conversion, the plaintiff must show legal ownership\n   <em>\n    or an immediate superior right of possession\n   </em>\n   to a specific identifiable thing[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Dore\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wormley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001884\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/690/176/#p183\">\n    690 F.Supp.2d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 183 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To establish standing to bring a replevin claim, a plaintiff need only \"establish that the defendant is in possession of certain property of which the plaintiff claims to have a superior right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001884\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/690/176/#p183\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the Republic claims to have a right to the property superior to any of the other claimants.

As Class Plaintiffs note, \"[a] claim arising under New York Executive Law \u00a7 632-a(3) requires that the Republic be a 'victim' of a crime.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Br. Republic 20);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ciafone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kenyatta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2877889\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/27/143/\">\n    27 A.D.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2877889\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/27/143/\">\n    807 N.Y.S.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119 (2d Dep't 2005). The Republic has alleged as much here. It has also sufficiently alleged a claim of misappropriation of public property.

That the property was purchased with misappropriated funds, rather than stolen directly from the Republic, would not strip the Republic of standing to bring these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   But Class Plaintiffs' argument fails for a more fundamental reason: The Court cannot conclude at this juncture that Mrs. Marcos, and not the Republic, owned and possessed the paintings when purchased and subsequently displayed at the townhouse in New York City. The fact that Mrs. Marcos was First Lady of the Philippines at the time of the purchase raises genuine disputes as to whether she owned and possessed the paintings in her personal capacity, or if she did so in her capacity as a public servant. The Republic's claim that Mrs. Marcos paid for the paintings with public funds means that this Court cannot conclude that Mrs. Marcos ever owned the paintings. And the record creates genuine questions of material fact on this point. The Sales Report for Monet's\n   <em>\n    L'\u00c9glise et La Seine \u00e0 V\u00e9theuil\n   </em>\n   and Sisley's\n   <em>\n    Langland Bay\n   </em>\n   lists the purchaser's address as \"Study Room, Malacanang Palace, Manila, Philippines\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 2), and the paintings were \"delivered to the Philippines['] London Embassy\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Consignment Note is addressed to \"Madame Marcos, Malacanang Palace, Manila, Philippines.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Similarly, the Sales Report for Monet's Water Lily painting indicates that it was sold to the \"First Lady of the Philippines.\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 2). And, during the Marcos presidency, the artwork was displayed at a townhouse in New York City that was owned by the Republic. (Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). The question of ownership would persist even if Mrs. Marcos had physical possession over the paintings, and is captured, rather poignantly, by the dual status of the townhouse in which the paintings were displayed: The property served as both the Philippine Consulate and as one of Mrs. Marcos's private residences. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   On this record, the Court cannot find that, at the time of purchase or at any time thereafter, the paintings were properly owned and possessed by Mrs. Marcos rather than by the Republic. The fact that Mrs. Marcos was a public figure, who allegedly misused public funds to purchase paintings delivered to the Philippine Embassy in London and displayed at the Philippine Consulate in New York, raises genuine disputes of fact as to the paintings' ownership. Even if Class Plaintiffs had construed New York law correctly-which they have not-lingering questions surrounding ownership of the paintings preclude any finding that the Republic lacks standing to bring the contested causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Rule 41 Does Not Preclude the Republic's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Class Plaintiffs also attack the Republic's standing by relying on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(B), which provides that a plaintiff may dismiss a lawsuit against a defendant unilaterally and without prejudice, \"[b]ut if the plaintiff previously dismissed any federal- or state-court action based on or including the same claim, a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(B). Known as the \"two-dismissal rule,\" this provision under Rule 41(a)(1) may be asserted to bar a new suit based on a claim that has twice been dismissed without court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Class Plaintiffs observe that, in 1986, the Republic brought suit against Mr. and Mrs. Marcos in the Southern District of New York (\"S.D.N.Y.\"), the Southern District of Texas (\"S.D. Tex.\"), and the Central District of California (\"C.D. Cal.\"). The Republic voluntarily dismissed all three lawsuits, twice by filing stipulations of voluntary dismissal that were \"so-ordered\" by the courts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Plaintiffs SJ Br. Republic 21; Swift Decl., Ex. 9-10). Class Plaintiffs note that, in all three cases, \"[t]he Republic contended that [Mrs. Marcos] participated and conspired in looting billions of dollars belonging to the Republic during the entire period of the Marcos presidency.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Reply Republic 7). \"That is also the rationale of the Republic's interpleader claims in the instant lawsuit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Republic disagrees with Class Plaintiffs on two critical points.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , it contends that the prior cases were dismissed pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2), not 41(a)(1), such that the two-dismissal rule cannot apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   It claims that the dismissal of the S.D.N.Y. and S.D. Tex. actions \"were done\n   <em>\n    pursuant to Court Order\n   </em>\n   .\" (Republic SJ Opp. Class Plaintiffs 38).\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , it disagrees with Class Plaintiffs' suggestion\n   that the claims in this interpleader action are the same as those in the prior cases. \"Each and every one of these lawsuits by the Republic involved similar legal\n   <em>\n    theories\n   </em>\n   , i.e.[,] a theory of misappropriation of government monies to acquire assets for themselves, but the\n   <em>\n    claims\n   </em>\n   in each case were different.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Court agrees with Class Plaintiffs that the S.D.N.Y. and S.D. Tex. actions were dismissed pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1), not Rule 41(a)(2). The Stipulation of Dismissal for the S.D.N.Y. action, dated April 22, 1994, was executed by the Republic and several of the defendants. (Swift Decl., Ex. 9). The district judge's signature appears under a \"So Ordered\" stamp. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On its face, the dismissal does not appear to have been ordered by the court under Rule 41(a)(2). Similarly, the S.D. Tex. dismissal, issued by the judge on July 2, 1986, specifically indicates that it was issued pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1). It states: \"Upon consideration of Plaintiff's Notice of Dismissal, it is hereby [ordered] that this action be ... dismissed without prejudice[.]\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 10). The text of that order makes clear that the Republic had already filed a notice of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Still, the Court finds that the two-dismissal rule does not apply. The Court disagrees with Class Plaintiffs' assertion that these actions all advance the same claims. The Second Circuit has explained that the two-dismissal rule is to be strictly construed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poloron Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lybrand Ross Bros. &amp; Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1068182\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/534/1012/#p1017\">\n    534 F.2d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1017 (2d Cir. 1976). Applying a narrow construction of the \"same claim\" requirement, the Court cannot find that the claim here-where the Republic seeks recovery of the Interpleader Property-is the same as the claim in the S.D.N.Y. action, which involved five pieces of New York real estate; the claim in the S.D. Tex. action, which involved Texas real estate; or the C.D. Cal. action, which involved currency and personal property in certain banks in California and Hawaii. (Republic SJ Opp. Class Plaintiffs 39). Though each case involved claims of misappropriation of public property, the contested property was distinct. That is sufficient to distinguish the claims, for purposes of the two-dismissal rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   But even if this Court were to find that the present claims are identical to those pursued in previously dismissed cases, it still would not apply the two-dismissal rule. The Second Circuit has held that the two-dismissal rule is \"an exception to the general principle, contained in Rule 41(a)(1) and honored in equity prior to the adoption of the Federal Rules, that a voluntary dismissal of an action does not bar a new suit based upon the same claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Poloron Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1068182\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/534/1012/#p1017\">\n    534 F.2d at 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For that reason, \"[w]here the purpose behind the 'two[-]dismissal' exception would not appear to be served by its literal application, and where that application's effect would be to close the courthouse doors to an otherwise proper litigant, a court should be most careful not to construe or apply the exception too broadly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1068182\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/534/1012/#p1017\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Application of the two-dismissal rule in the present action would not serve the statute's intended purpose. There is no evidence that the Republic has acted in bad faith or that it seeks to harass Mrs. Marcos or any of the claimants by filing, dismissing, and then refiling identical claims. The Republic did not, strictly speaking, bring this action. And the previously dismissed cases were brought more than two decades ago. Applying the two-dismissal rule here would prevent a purported victim of a sprawling crime-one where items purchased with misappropriated funds turn up decades apart and in numerous jurisdictions-from asserting a claim to the fruits of the crime. That, this Court believes, would be anathema to the\n   purpose of the two-dismissal rule. For that reason, the Court will not apply the two-dismissal rule to the Republic's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    d. The Statute of Limitations Applies to Four of the Republic's Claims, Though Even Those Claims Survive by Operation of Equitable Tolling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Class Plaintiffs next assert that (i) all of the Republic's causes of actions are barred by the applicable New York statutes of limitations and (ii) equitable tolling does not apply. The Court agrees that four of the Republic's eight causes of action were brought outside the statutory period, but it cannot find, on this record, that equitable tolling does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

New York courts typically discuss the demand-and-refusal rule in the context of\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchasers, not donees or others who might have innocently taken possession of the property. To be sure, this Court is unaware of any case in which a New York court has distinguished between purchasers and donees for purposes of the demand-and-refusal rule. And language adopted by some courts strongly suggests that the demand-and-refusal rule applies to innocent possessors, not just innocent purchasers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Grosz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823522\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/772/473/#p481\">\n    772 F.Supp.2d at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the demand-and-refusal rule applies to \"a[ny] person who lawfully comes by a chattel\"). Yet given the paucity of cases explicitly applying the demand-and-refusal rule to donees, the Court has some reservations in deciding that it applies to the remainder of the Interpleader Property. And of course, the demand-and-refusal rule would not apply to Bautista if she had been complicit with Mrs. Marcos in misappropriating the paintings or the funds used to purchase them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Despite these misgivings, the Court cannot foreclose the possibility that the demand-and-refuse rule applies to the remainder of the Interpleader Property. It can neither hold that the demand-and-refusal rule, as a matter of law, only applies to\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchasers, nor, on this record, that Bautista was complicit in misappropriating the Interpleader Property.

Although the Republic asserts the enrichment and money had and received claims against Bautista, her sisters, and Mrs. Marcos, and the misappropriation claim against Bautista and Mrs. Marcos, the gravamen of the Republic's pleadings is the misappropriation of public funds by Mr. and Mrs. Marcos in the 1970s and 1980s. Under the Republic's theory, any further enrichment or payments-for example, from the sale of the painting-stemmed from the initial misappropriation, and must therefore be considered derivative of the initial theft.

They seem to have understood this Court's January 20, 2016 Opinion as having already decided that there was no active concealment and misrepresentation, and thus that equitable tolling could only apply if Bautista and Mrs. Marcos owed the Republic a fiduciary duty. Yet that Opinion did no such thing. To be sure, the Opinion states that \"Class Plaintiffs' argument fails ... because it ignores the Cross-Claims' allegations concerning Marcos's and Bautista's positions in the Philippine government[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Philippines I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%209022580\">\n    2016 WL 9022580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Yet in stating that the Court could not grant a motion to dismiss because Class Plaintiffs failed to address the fiduciary duty issue, the Court did not-expressly or implicitly-opine on the antecedent question of whether Mrs. Marcos and Bautista engaged in active concealment and misrepresentation. The Court turns to that question now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   On the record before it, the Court cannot exclude the possibility-or even find that it was improbable-that Mrs. Marcos and Bautista engaged in a campaign of active concealment that included affirmative misrepresentations aimed at preventing other parties from seeking to recover the Interpleader Property. In July 1983, Mrs. Marcos executed a Deed of Assignment of questionable legality, purporting to transfer ownership of several paintings-including the three paintings at issue here-to her personal confidante and aide (i.e., Bautista) who, shortly after the revolution that swept Mr. Marcos from office, took the paintings to her private residence in Long Island.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The record includes evidence that Mrs. Marcos and Bautista actively concealed, including by making material misrepresentations, their possession of the paintings. As Class Plaintiffs acknowledge, in 1985, Bautista was required to disclose her assets to the Republic. She executed, under oath, a Statement of Assets and Liabilities. (Dkt. # 213-1). In it she \"listed assets totaling $117,000, consisting of a car, jewelry, furniture/appliances and bank deposits.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Opp. Bautista 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   She did not make any mention of any paintings, which she now claims had been gifted to her in 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Bautista has also made what appear to be affirmative misrepresentations under oath about the 2010 sale of the Water Lily painting. At her deposition-as she has done in this interpleader action-she claimed to be the owner of the Interpleader Property, including the Water Lily painting. (Swift Decl. Opp., Ex. 1 at 88-90). Yet the Certificate of Authority that Bautista produced to the purchaser indicates that the painting belonged to Mrs. Marcos\n   and that Bautista was merely acting as Mrs. Marcos's authorized representative. (Dkt. # 213-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Similarly, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, executed in connection with the sale of the Water Lily painting on August 2, 2010, states that Bautista was \"acting as the exclusive agent for an undisclosed owner\" and that Bautista had \"been authorized by the Owner to sell the Painting[.]\" (Dkt. # 213-4). And the letter of explanation that Bautista provided to the buyer, dated September 9, 2010, provides further circumstantial evidence of active concealment by Mrs. Marcos and Bautista. It states that Mrs. Marcos \"believes that ... confidentiality should always be preserved and maintained for all sensitive matters such as the sale of the Painting in question\"; \"[t]he Painting has been kept in [Bautista's] possession for a good number of years ... in different locations in New York\"; and Bautista \"d[id] not have any documentary record of when the Painting was purchased[.]\" (Dkt. # 213-3). Mrs. Marcos, for her part, steadfastly refused to answer questions regarding the artwork and invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege throughout a deposition in a related matter pending in the Central District of California. (Republic SJ Opp. Class Plaintiffs 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Taken together, these facts preclude a finding that Bautista and Mrs. Marcos were not actively concealing the paintings by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , making material omissions and affirmative misrepresentations to opposing parties and the purchaser of the Water Lily painting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Nor can the Court find that the Republic has failed to make reasonable efforts or exercise due diligence in their attempts to recover the artwork, as required under New York law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin Hilti Family Tr.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Knoedler Gallery, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182006\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/137/430/#p467\">\n    137 F.Supp.3d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). On the contrary, the evidence suggests that the PCGG has made concerted efforts to track down various assets, in multiple jurisdictions, that Mr. and Mrs. Marcos allegedly misappropriated from the Republic. The PCGG went to considerable lengths to identify specific works of art that had gone missing. (Class Plaintiffs 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25). It served subpoenas on art galleries and auction houses in New York and elsewhere, including Marlborough Gallery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). It launched a \"Where's the Art?\" campaign, and on June 23, 1986, issued a press release asking the public to \"join the campaign by writing to Mrs. Marcos on Where's the Art? postcards[.]\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 13). And since then, it has participated in numerous lawsuits aimed at acquiring whatever assets it has been able to trace to the funds that Mr. and Mrs. Marcos had allegedly misappropriated.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    ENC Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730861\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/885/\">\n    464 F.3d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Rep. of Philippines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11413287\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/309/1143/\">\n    309 F.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2002). On this record, the Court cannot find that the PCGG failed to exercise reasonable diligence in their attempts to recover the Interpleader Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   For these reasons, the Court denies in full Class Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment against the Republic. It turns next to the motions for summary judgment against Roxas, filed by Class Plaintiffs and Bautista. Although the motions were filed separately, Bautista's argument is analytically similar to, and subsumed by, Class Plaintiffs' arguments. In the interest of economy, the Court considers the motions together.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Court Denies Class Plaintiffs' and Bautista's Motions for Summary Judgment Against Roxas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Court Cannot Conclude That the Roxas Judgment Is Unenforceable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Class Plaintiffs begin by asserting that the Roxas Judgment is unenforceable because it was entered against the Marcos Estate, and is only enforceable against Mrs. Marcos to the extent of her interest in the Marcos Estate. They assert that \"[i]t is well established on the record in this case that the four paintings were purchased by or on behalf of Imelda Marcos in the 1970's.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Br. Roxas 3). \"There is no evidence,\" they claim, \"that the paintings were ever the property of Ferdinand Marcos.\" (\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    d.\n   </em>\n   ). From this, they deduce that \"the paintings could not form part of the Marcos Estate\" and therefore cannot be used to satisfy the Roxas Judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   This argument has some superficial appeal. After all, it is uncontested that the Roxas Judgment was entered against Mrs. Marcos not to the full extent of her personal assets, but only to the extent of her interest in the Marcos Estate. It is similarly well-established that the paintings at issue were purchased on behalf of Mrs. Marcos, and that Ferdinand Marcos's name does not appear in any of the documents related to the purchase and sale of those paintings. And it is tempting to conclude, as Class Plaintiffs have done, that those facts alone establish that the Interpleader Property could not have been part of the Marcos Estate and therefore preclude enforcement of the Roxas Judgment in the present action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Yet to do so would be to assume away the very question driving this interpleader: Which party has the strongest claim to the Interpleader Property? The Court has already explained that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the Republic, rather than Mrs. Marcos, owned the Interpleader Property during the Marcos presidency. That alone suggests that Class Plaintiffs are wrong to argue that Mrs. Marcos must have owned the paintings because they \"were purchased by or on behalf of Imelda Marcos.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Br. Roxas 3). The paintings may well have been purchased on her behalf, but that does not mean that she, and she alone, owned the paintings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Just as the circumstances surrounding the paintings' purchase do not necessarily establish Mrs. Marcos's ownership, they also do not disprove Ferdinand's (and, by extension, the Marcos Estate's) interest in or ownership of the paintings. To the extent that Mrs. Marcos can credibly claim ownership over the paintings, a genuine dispute arises as to whether Mr. and Mrs. Marcos exercised joint ownership and control over the paintings. That dispute raises legal and factual questions-regarding the provenance of the money used to purchase the paintings, the distinctions between joint and personal property under Philippine law, and the manner in which Mr. and Mrs. Marcos divided their property, to name a few-that this Court cannot answer on the record before it. Accordingly, the Court rejects Class Plaintiffs' argument that the Roxas Judgment is necessarily unenforceable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Roxas's Constructive Trust Claim Survives Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Class Plaintiffs next take aim at Roxas's ability to recover under a theory of constructive trust, which theory hinges on Roxas's ability to trace the funds used to purchase the Interpleader Property back to the treasure that Mr. Marcos stole from Roxas. As Class Plaintiffs state: \"Because [Roxas] has no evidence the proceeds from the Roxas treasure were used to purchase the paintings at issue in this interpleader,\n   its claim must be dismissed.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Br. Roxas 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bautista SJ Br. Roxas 6 (\"[Roxas's] failure to provide any evidence that the paintings or any of [ the other] property at issue in this interpleader were purchased with the proceeds from the Roxas treasure warrants that summary judgment be granted.\") ). Class Plaintiffs' and Bautista's argument raises fact-intensive questions that themselves implicate complex legal issues. In particular, the Court must first address (i) whether the Roxas Judgment has issue-preclusive effect over the instant matter, (ii) whether to relax the tracing requirements, and (iii) which of Roxas's evidence the Court may consider in determining the viability of his constructive trust claim. The Court addresses each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

To begin with, central to Roxas's claim in the present action is whether Ferdinand Marcos stole Roxas's treasure. That issue was raised in the Hawaii action, and a jury found that Mr. Marcos was in fact liable on that very issue. The Roxas Judgment is final. And it is undisputed that the issue before this Court was central to the prior action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The more complicated question is whether, for\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   purposes, Class Plaintiffs can be considered to be in privity with either Mr. or Mrs. Marcos, both of whom were parties to the Hawaii action. Roxas attempts to sidestep the issue by arguing, unpersuasively, that the Court need not consider identity of parties because an interpleader action is an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceeding.

Grantor Tr.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rep. of Argentina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20Fed.%20Appx.%2030\">\n    616 Fed.Appx. 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32 (2d Cir. 2015) (summary order) (\"The judgment creditor stands in the shoes of the judgment debtor[.]\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ). In the instant action, Class Plaintiffs seek to assert the rights that Mrs. Marcos might have to the Interpleader Property. In this sense, they share an identity of interests and claims with Mrs. Marcos. Because Mrs. Marcos is a predecessor in interest to Class Plaintiffs, and the parties are for\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   purposes in privity, the Roxas Judgment is preclusive on the issue adjudicated previously-namely, that Marcos stole at least part of Roxas's treasure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amalfitano\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg\n   </em>\n   , No. 04 Civ. 2027 (NRB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202030313\">\n    2005 WL 2030313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

They assert, without any analysis or reference to factual or legal support, that Class Plaintiffs \"were not parties in [Roxas's] Hawaii cases and did not attend depositions or trial and examine witnesses.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Reply Roxas 6). Yet, as explained above, they need not have been parties to the action for the Roxas Judgment to have issue-preclusive effect. Moreover, the Court is troubled by Class Plaintiffs' inconsistency across their various briefs regarding the identity of issues between the instant action and prior lawsuits involving many of the same parties. In this instance, Class Plaintiffs assert that \"[t]he subject matter of th[e] [Hawaii action] was totally different than the subject matter of this case.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Reply Roxas 6). But in their motion for summary judgment against the Republic, Class Plaintiffs took the opposite position. There, they argued that Rule 41(a)(1) bars the Republic's standing because \"[e]ach of the complaints [in prior actions] alleged in the broadest terms the misappropriation of the Republic's property.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Br. Republic 21). To be sure, Class Plaintiffs did not cite the Hawaii action when they advanced their Rule 41 argument. But the broader point remains: Where it suits Class Plaintiffs, they see sufficient similitude between the present action and prior actions to strip the Republic of standing; where, as here, it does not, they find stark differences. Still, the Court does not hold Class Plaintiffs' inconsistency across briefs against them; instead, it finds that their issue preclusion argument fails on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that the Hawaii action has issue-preclusive effect on the present action, but only to the extent of the findings upheld by the Hawaii Supreme Court. That is, the Hawaii action is issue-preclusive as to whether Mr. Marcos committed battery against Roxas and converted some of Roxas's property-and that the damages included $6 million for battery and $1,405,000 for conversion of the golden Buddha statue and the seventeen bars of gold and personal coin collection taken from Roxas's residence. (Roxas 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 47-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   By contrast, the Court will not extend issue-preclusive effect to the jury's finding that Mr. Marcos converted $22 billion of gold, as the Hawaii Supreme Court found that the evidence was insufficient to support any such finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. This Court Will Relax, But Not Eliminate Altogether, the Tracing Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Having found that the Court is bound to accept the Hawaii court's adjudication as to whether Marcos stole from Roxas, the Court next turns to whether Roxas must trace the Interpleader Property to the stolen funds. Class Plaintiffs correctly note that, unless a court relaxes the tracing requirement, a constructive trust claim may only proceed where the claimant can trace the contested property back to the misappropriated funds. The Second Circuit has termed it \"hornbook law that before a constructive trust may be imposed, a claimant to a wrongdoer's property must trace his own property into a product in the hands of the wrongdoer.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Benitez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539588\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/779/135/#p140\">\n    779 F.2d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140 (2d Cir. 1985).

The very fact that the individual alleged to have misappropriated Roxas's assets was President of the Philippines at the time of the conversion sets this case apart. So too does the complex web of offshore foundations and secret bank accounts that Mr. and Mrs. Marcos used to move allegedly misappropriated funds. Finally, the amount of time that has passed since the misappropriation makes it particularly\n   unreasonable to require Roxas to produce evidence that illustrates, step by step, how Roxas's misappropriated funds were funneled from one account to another. For this reason, the Court will not require Roxas to trace, with scientific precision or forensic evidence, the money used to purchase the Interpleader Property back to the misappropriated funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   But that does not mean that the Court will not require Roxas to establish a close nexus between the stolen funds and those used to purchase the Interpleader Property. Even where courts have relaxed the tracing requirement, they have tended not to abandon it altogether. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Wilde\n   </em>\n   , the court relaxed the tracing requirement only \"[t]o the extent that a small part of these purchases is not traceable to the Citibank Accounts[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831720\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/576/595/#p604\">\n    576 F.Supp.2d at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court adopts a similar approach. Though the Court will not require Roxas to produce detailed forensic accounting reports or similar evidence that traces the money from the moment of misappropriation to the moment of purchase of the Interpleader Property, Roxas must still produce credible evidence that the funds used to purchase the Interpleader Property originated from Roxas's treasure, and not from any of Mr. and Mrs. Marcos's other putative sources of wealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The Court next turns to relevant questions regarding Roxas's proffered evidence-its admissibility, and its sufficiency at this stage of the litigation to meet the relaxed tracing standard that this Court has just described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Deposition Transcripts Proffered by Roxas Are Admissible and Sufficient to Survive Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Class Plaintiffs argue that substantially all of Roxas's evidence-which consists primarily of deposition transcripts from prior litigations-is inadmissible pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32(a)(8). That Rule states that \"[a] deposition previously taken may ... be used as allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(8). Here, Roxas asserts that Federal Rule of Evidence 807(a) -known as the \"residual exception\" to the hearsay rules-permits this Court to admit the contested evidence. Roxas also claims that Rule 32(a)(8) provides an independent basis upon which this Court may consider the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The Court begins by assessing the admissibility of the deposition testimony under Rule 32(a)(8), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   A deposition lawfully taken and, if required, filed in any federal- or state-court action may be used in a later action involving the same subject matter between the same parties, or their representatives or successors in interest, to the same extent as if taken in the later action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Fed.

Construed liberally, the current action involves the same subject matter as the previous lawsuits for which the depositions at issue were prepared-namely, Mr. Marcos's theft of Roxas's treasure, and Roxas's attendant right to the contested property. While the contested property at issue here may be different than that in prior cases, the subject matter at issue has not changed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Nor are the parties different, for purposes of Rule 32(a)(8). As the Court mentioned above, judgment creditors (Class Plaintiffs) stand in the shoes of judgment debtors (Mr. and Mrs. Marcos). It is undisputed that Mr. and Mrs. Marcos were represented by counsel at the prior actions, and at the depositions that Roxas seeks to admit as evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cathcart Decl., Ex. 2-4, 6-11, 16, 49-51).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In at least one instance, Class Plaintiffs themselves were represented by counsel at the deposition.

But even where they were not, their predecessors in interest-Mr. and Mrs. Marcos-were represented and had \"the same motive to cross-examine the deponent\" as Class Plaintiffs would have.\n   <em>\n    Fed.

In each prior deposition, Mr. and Mrs. Marcos had every incentive to establish that Mr. Marcos had not stolen Roxas's treasure or, in the alternative, that whatever was stolen was of little value. Here, Class Plaintiffs have the same interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fed. Hous. Fin.

Feb. 19, 2015). For this reason, under Rule 32(a)(8), Roxas may use the prior deposition testimony as evidence to support his claim to the Interpleader Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The question, then, becomes whether the deposition transcripts proffered by Roxas are sufficient to create a genuine dispute of material fact-that is, a genuine dispute as to whether the money used to purchase the Interpleader Property is derivative of the theft of Roxas's treasure. The Court notes that the Hawaii Supreme Court found much of the testimony regarding Roxas's treasure to have been too vague to support a $22 billion judgment for conversion of a storage area of gold.\n   <em>\n    Roxas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/\">\n    969 P.2d at 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the court observed, Roxas's \"evidence concerning the\n   <em>\n    quantity\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    value\n   </em>\n   of the gold observed by the percipient witnesses ... w[as] extremely vague.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases in original). For example, one of the percipient witnesses testified that \"the room he had seen was '\n   <em>\n    [m]aybe\n   </em>\n   40 feet by 20,\n   <em>\n    something like that\n   </em>\n   ' ... and that he 'believed' that the ceiling was twelve feet tall, '[m]aybe more.\n   <em>\n    I don't remember\n   </em>\n   .' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases in original). Another testified that the room containing the gold was \"\n   <em>\n    roughly\n   </em>\n   40 by 40\" with a ceiling that was \"\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   ten-foot high.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases in original). He further testified that \"[t]here were '\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   two,\n   <em>\n    possibly\n   </em>\n   three aisles,' which were '\n   <em>\n    not more than\n   </em>\n   four or five feet' wide, amidst the piles of gold which were 'stacked\n   <em>\n    almost\n   </em>\n   to the top.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   And yet, even if the evidence may have been too imprecise to allow a jury to calculate $22 billion in damages, it suffices to create a genuine dispute as to whether the vast majority of Mr. Marcos's wealth derived from the Yamashita Treasure, such that Roxas may meet the relaxed tracing standard that the Court discussed above. The testimony of John Buckley, a forensic accountant hired by the Republic to review Mr. and Mrs. Marcos's assets, helps Roxas survive this motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In relevant part, Buckley testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   I don't care how successful Mr. Marcos was as an attorney, you don't generate wealth in the hundreds of millions of dollars and billions of dollars.... So it came from somewhere. The most likely source, the most probable source, is the treasure that the Japanese buried in [the Philippines] when they exited the country.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   (Cathcart Dec., Ex. 51 at 29). While this testimony is not stated with the kind of precision that would likely sway a factfinder, at this stage of the litigation, it suffices to create a genuine dispute of fact regarding the source of the funds used to purchase the Interpleader Property. The constructive trust claim therefore survives summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Equitable Tolling Applies, Defeating Class Plaintiffs' Statute of Limitations Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Finally, Class Plaintiffs argue that Roxas's causes of action are time-barred by operation of the relevant statutes of limitations. This Court has already found that, in light of the compelling evidence of Bautista's and Mrs. Marcos's affirmative misrepresentations and efforts to conceal the Interpleader Property, it cannot conclude that equitable tolling does not apply, unless Roxas has failed to act with reasonable diligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin Hilti Family Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182006\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/137/430/#p467\">\n    137 F.Supp.3d at 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Ultimately, tolling can apply only when a plaintiff has acted with reasonable diligence[.]\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ). The Court therefore will not revisit the concealment or misrepresentation questions here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Instead, the Court examines whether Roxas has exhibited reasonable diligence in pursuing his claims against Mr. and Mrs. Marcos such that equitable tolling may apply. The Court notes that Roxas has participated in multiple lawsuits against Mr. and Mrs. Marcos. He intervened in a case brought before this Court in 1986 regarding ownership of Marcos property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rep. of the Philippines\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marcos\n   </em>\n   , No. 86 Civ. 2294 (PNL),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%20167353\">\n    1992 WL 167353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 1992). He also brought a suit of his own in Hawaii in 1988, which resulted in the Roxas Judgment. Where possible, he has sought to execute the Hawaii judgment. Given the lengths to which Mr. and Mrs. Marcos\n   appear to have gone to conceal ill-gotten assets, including the Interpleader Property, and given Bautista's possession of the artwork at issue here, the Court cannot find that Roxas's failure previously to assert claims against the Interpleader Property resulted from a lack of diligence. Rather, the record suggests that any such delay was likely caused by Mrs. Marcos's and Bautista's actions. Accordingly, the Court finds that Roxas has exhibited sufficient diligence for equitable tolling purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   For these reasons, the Court denies Class Plaintiffs' and Bautista's motions for summary judgment against Roxas. The Court next turns to Roxas's own motion for summary judgment against Class Plaintiffs and Bautista.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Roxas's Motion for Summary Judgment Against Class Plaintiffs and Bautista Fails\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Roxas's motion for summary judgment against Class Plaintiffs and Bautista is in many respects the mirror image of Class Plaintiffs' and Bautista's motions against Roxas. The difference is that Roxas here asserts that the record conclusively establishes Roxas's right to the Interpleader Property. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Roxas maintains that his claims are superior to those advanced by Class Plaintiffs and Bautista. His theory is that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the Interpleader Property was purchased with funds originating from Roxas's stolen treasure. As Roxas states: \"[T]he Hawaii litigation conclusively proves that Marcos stole a great treasure from Roxas,\" which \"formed the foundation of the Marcos[es'] wealth.\" (Roxas SJ Br. Class Plaintiffs, Bautista 13). Pointing to Buckley's testimony, Roxas \"submit[s] that the bulk, if not all, of the Marcos[es'] wealth came from the treasure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). In particular, Roxas leans on Buckley's statement that, \"[t]he most likely source [of Marcoses' wealth], the most probable source, is the treasure that the Japanese left buried in [the Philippines] when they exited the country.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Cathcart Decl., Ex. 51 at 29) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Contrary to Roxas's suggestion, there remain genuine disputes of material fact regarding the source of the funds used to purchase the Interpleader Property. In fact, for the reasons detailed above, the evidence barely suffices to allow Roxas to survive Class Plaintiffs' and Bautista's motions for summary judgment. The deposition testimony on which Roxas relies is vague and fails conclusively to establish the size or value of the treasure that Mr. Marcos stole from Roxas. This Court shares the Hawaii Supreme Court's concern with the proffered testimony regarding the size of the storage area of gold from which, Roxas claims, Mr. and Mrs. Marcos derived substantially all of their wealth. The Hawaii Supreme Court rightly characterized the evidence of the quantity of gold observed by the percipient witnesses as \"extremely vague.\"\n   <em>\n    Roxas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/\">\n    969 P.2d at 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   And Buckley's testimony, on which Roxas also relies heavily, is similarly vague. Buckley testifies that the Yamashita Treasure constituted the \"most likely source\" of the Marcoses' wealth. (Cathcart Dec., Ex. 51 at 29). While this testimony suffices to create a genuine dispute of fact as to the source of the Marcoses' wealth, it does not foreclose the possibility-or even the strong probability-that Mr. and Mrs. Marcos derived much of their wealth from others sources, and that the funds used to purchase the Interpleader Property came from those other sources.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , The World Bank,\n   <em>\n    Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) Initiative: Challenges, Opportunities, and Action Plan\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2.3 (2007) (\"The channels whereby the money was allegedly stolen [by Mr. Marcos] were diverse, including\n   the takeover of private companies; creation of monopolies ...; fraudulent government loans; bribes from companies; and skimming off foreign loans and raiding the public treasury.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Roxas's motion for summary judgment rests on the claim that \"the facts as found in [the Hawaii action], common sense, coupled with the Buckley deposition lead to the inescapable conclusion that the property in this action traces its roots back to the treasure found by Roxas.\" (Roxas SJ Br. Class Plaintiffs, Bautista 15-16). And yet the facts as found in Hawaii merely establish that Mr. Marcos battered Roxas and stole a golden Buddha statue, gold bars, and coins worth approximately $1.4 million. It does not establish that the seed money for substantially all of Mr. and Mrs. Marcos's vast wealth came from the Yamashita Treasure. Nor does Buckley's testimony establish as much. As mentioned, that testimony barely suffices to create a genuine dispute of material fact to defeat Class Plaintiffs' and Bautista's summary judgment motions. Even under the relaxed tracing standard that the Court has adopted, Roxas is not entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The Court next turns to Bautista's motion for summary judgment against Class Plaintiffs and the Republic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Bautista's Motion for Summary Judgment Against Class Plaintiffs and the Republic Fails\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   In her motion for summary judgment against Class Plaintiffs and the Republic, Bautista advances two principal claims: (i) Class Plaintiffs and the Republic lack standing, and (ii) the Republic's claims are time-barred under the relevant statutes of limitations. Both are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Class Plaintiffs and the Republic Have Standing to Bring Causes of Action Against Bautista\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Bautista attacks Class Plaintiffs' and the Republic's standing to bring any claims against her on the theory that the record conclusively shows that she is the rightful owner of the Interpleader Property. Bautista focuses primarily on the paintings at issue in this case. In her view, documentary evidence conclusively establishes that \"the owner of the property since August 5, 1983 has been Bautista ... [and that] [o]n August 8, 1983, Mrs. Marcos ... formally conveyed title [to the paintings] to Ms. Vilma Bautista\" by executing a Deed of Assignment. (Bautista SJ Br. Republic, Class Plaintiffs 12-13). As Bautista would have it, the Deed establishes that neither Class Plaintiffs nor the Republic owns the Interpleader Property and, in turn, requires this Court to grant her motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Bautista's argument, while ambitious, fails for several reasons.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , there is a genuine dispute as to the Deed's validity under Philippines law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court has received an expert affidavit from Class Plaintiffs stating that under Philippine law, the Deed qualifies not as an assignment but rather as a donation, because the conveyance was executed for no consideration. (Class Plaintiffs SJ Opp. Bautista 9). Bautista's own testimony supports the view that this was a gift. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Bautista's deposition in which she states unequivocally, with respect to the Deed, \"It's a gift.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   As noted by Class Plaintiffs' expert, and as confirmed by this Court, Article 748 of the New Civil Code of the Philippines dictates that a donation in excess of five thousand pesos is void unless the donation and acceptance is made in writing. (Class\n   Plaintiffs SJ Opp. Bautista 9). Nothing in the record suggests that Bautista accepted the conveyance of property from Mrs. Marcos in writing. Though the Court will not construe Class Plaintiffs' opposition brief as seeking summary judgment against Bautista-both because Class Plaintiffs have not moved for summary judgment against Bautista and because Class Plaintiffs' amended brief was filed late and without leave of court or consent of the parties-it has considerable misgivings regarding the Deed's validity under Article 748.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Bautista fundamentally misconstrues the Republic's claims. The Republic does not, as Bautista's argument implies, attack only the validity of the transfer of the paintings from Mrs. Marcos to Bautista. They also attack Mrs. Marcos's own claim to ownership over the Interpleader Property. If the Republic had conceded that Mrs. Marcos was the rightful owner of the property, and had it merely attacked the validity of the transfer to Bautista, a valid deed might provide a compelling basis to seek summary judgment against the Republic. But the Republic also contests Mrs. Marcos's ownership over the Interpleader Property; in the Republic's view,\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   was the rightful owner\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   . The Republic's view is that, even if Mrs. Marcos and Bautista had satisfied the requirements of Article 748, the conveyance would still have been ineffective because Mrs. Marcos purchased the property with misappropriated funds. Indeed, a victim has the right to \"follow [the] assets as far as it can trace them, and can recover its property from those with whom it has had no direct dealings.\"\n   <em>\n    T.D. Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10 Civ. 2843 (JG) (ARL),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204038826\">\n    2010 WL 4038826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 2010). For this reason, Bautista's argument regarding the Deed's validity misses the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , Class Plaintiffs and the Republic have produced compelling evidence-including Bautista's own actions and statements-suggesting that Mrs. Marcos never transferred ownership of the paintings to Bautista. For example, in 1985, Bautista \"did not list the paintings as her property in her [ ] sworn Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\" (Class Plaintiffs SJ Opp. Bautista 10). In 2010, when she sold the Water Lily painting, Bautista provided the purchaser with a Certificate of Authority stating that Bautista was \"[Mrs. Marcos's] authorized representative\" and that Bautista was \"authorized to sign, on [Mrs. Marcos's] behalf, the corresponding deeds of transfer of ownership of [the] painting[ ]\" and \"to receive and/or sign receipts for the proceeds of the sale of [the] painting[ ].\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 11). In a letter to the purchaser, Bautista further stated that she had \"received instructions from [Mrs. Marcos] to sell the [p]ainting, and [Mrs. Marcos] [wa]s aware of the sale.\" (Swift Decl., Ex. 12). She was \"acting as [Mrs. Marcos's] agent with authority to sell the [p]ainting of which [Bautista] had physical possession[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, Bautista also represented that, \"[i]n entering into the Agreement and at the Closing, I shall continue to act as [Mrs. Marcos's] authorized agent and representative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Even if the Deed were valid under Philippine law-something this Court will not decide at this juncture-Bautista's\n   statements raise genuine disputes of fact regarding her ownership of any of the Interpleader Property. For these reasons, the Court denies Bautista's motion for summary judgment against Class Plaintiffs and the Republic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   <strong>\n    b. None of the Republic's Causes of Action Is Time-Barred\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Like Class Plaintiffs, Bautista claims that the Republic's causes of action are time-barred under the relevant statutes of limitations. Bautista's arguments mirror those advanced by Class Plaintiffs, which the Court has already addressed above. Rather than repeat that discussion here, the Court incorporates it by reference and, for the reasons stated therein, rejects Bautista's argument that the Republic's claims are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Republic's Motion to Dismiss or Stay This Case Fails\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Having addressed the parties' motions for summary judgment, the Court now turns to the Republic's motion to dismiss this case in its entirety or, in the alternative, to stay the proceedings. The Republic's motion rests on three principal arguments: (i) the PCGG's limited waiver of sovereign immunity was invalid; (ii) international comity requires dismissal of this action; and (iii) the act of state doctrine mandates that this Court decline to exercise jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The Court begins with a brief review of the history of the Republic's involvement in this litigation. In November 2013, the Republic retained S&amp;P to represent it in this action. S&amp;P entered an appearance on March 7, 2014. (Dkt. # 17). By letter dated February 11, 2014, PCGG Chairman Andres D. Bautista and PCGG Commissioner Maita V. Chan-Gonzaga sent a letter to S&amp;P authorizing it \"to exercise a limited waiver of sovereign immunity on behalf of the Republic and/or the PCGG with respect to the matter to be commenced in the Southern District of New York concerning Vilma H. Bautista and assets seized from her possession[.]\" (Brown Decl., Ex. 1). The letter indicates that copies were furnished to the Philippine Solicitor General, Francis H. Jardeleza, and the Ambassador of the Philippines to the United States, Jose L. Cuisia, Jr. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The terms of the Republic's waiver expressly authorized the Republic to appear in this interpleader; it did not include any mechanism for revocation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Thereafter, the Republic actively participated in this action: It filed an answer and cross-claims, participated in discovery, defended a motion to dismiss, and filed and defended motions for summary judgment. It never so much as hinted at the possibility of revocation of the waiver. Quite to the contrary, at the first conference in this litigation-and in response to criticism from counsel for Class Plaintiffs regarding its unwillingness to appear in a related action in New York State Supreme Court-the S&amp;P lawyer representing the Republic stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   [W]e clearly have a very colorable claim to this property, and indeed I think if we were not willing to waive our foreign sovereign immunity both these matters should be dismissed, because as a necessary party we have certain rights. As a necessary party, these cases cannot go forward without us. What we could do is not show up here, run to the Philippines and try and get a judgment against the property there and then enforce it under U.S. law through the Department of Justice and State Department and other means that allow us to do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   We are not doing that. We are going to litigate this case, and we are here to do it. And we are offering limited immunity, but here in the federal court. We have a right to do that. It is a rare case indeed where I represent a sovereign nation\n   that has these sort[s] of rights, your Honor. But we have that right. We can appear here. We don't have to. And we won't appear [in state court].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   So I am not going to apologize for the fact that we are willing to waive our immunity. In fact, I think what we are doing goes above and beyond. We don't have to do this. We want to move the ball up the field.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   (Dkt. # 44 at 17-18). The Court took several actions in this litigation in reliance on this waiver, including in particular issuing oral and written decisions staying the state court action. (Dkt. # 57 (transcript of proceedings of February 19, 2015), 72 (written order) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Republic Has Waived Sovereign Immunity, and Such Waiver May Not Be Withdrawn at This Advanced Stage of the Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The Republic seeks dismissal under the theory that the PCGG lacked authority when it issued a limited waiver of sovereign immunity. Despite having actively litigated this case since 2014, the Republic now seeks to withdraw the PCGG's waiver because, the Republic claims, the waiver had not been authorized by the Office of the Solicitor General. The Republic further claims that counsel's failure to raise immunity until now cannot be deemed an implied waiver. (Republic MTD Br. 10). The Court disagrees, and it denies the Republic's request to withdraw its waiver of sovereign immunity for four reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the PCGG entered a valid waiver of sovereign immunity. Even if the PCGG required the Solicitor General's approval to issue the waiver-something that the Court cannot confirm on this record-the evidence suggests that the PCGG had secured such approval. The February 11, 2014 waiver, signed by the PCGG's Chairman and Commissioner, was copied to Ambassador Cuisia and Solicitor General Jardeleza. (Brown Decl., Ex. 1). The fact that the Solicitor General was copied belies the Republic's claim, advanced for the first time years into this litigation, that the Solicitor General had not been made aware of any such waiver. (Republic MTD Br., Ex 1 (\"Munsayac Aff.\") at 3). The Republic has produced no evidence to suggest that the Solicitor General's approval had to be sought in any particular form, or that approval would be communicated expressly in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Despite having been copied on the PCGG's letter to S&amp;P, neither the Solicitor General nor the Ambassador objected to the waiver. And, on numerous prior occasions in this District and elsewhere, the Republic had similarly waived its sovereign immunity and participated in litigation over Marcos assets; it was, in other words, a repeat player that cannot now claim to have been unaware of the effect of its waiver (in the case of the PCGG) or silence (in the case of the Solicitor General).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rep. of the Philippines\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marcos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1655928\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/806/344/\">\n    806 F.2d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1986) ;\n   <em>\n    Rep. of the Philippines\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Christie's\n   </em>\n   , No. 98 Civ. 3871 (RPP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201056300\">\n    2000 WL 1056300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y.

The Republic has failed to advance a credible claim that the limited waiver of sovereign immunity presented to this Court lacked validity; to the contrary, the record suggests that the PCGG had authority to exercise the waiver and that the Solicitor General and Ambassador had actual or constructive knowledge of the waiver but never objected to its validity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , even if the PCGG lacked actual authority to issue a waiver of sovereign immunity, the Republic implicitly waived its immunity by prosecuting this case for nearly three years.

The PCGG's February 11, 2014 letter to S&amp;P explicitly waived the Republic's immunity and failed to reserve any revocation rights. The Republic proceeded actively to litigate this case by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , filing an answer and cross-claims (that did not include a sovereign immunity defense); participating in numerous court conferences, where it never suggested that it might later withdraw its waiver; obtaining a stay of related state court litigation in which it refused to appear; defending against Class Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss; and filing and defending cross-motions for summary judgment. Over the course of the nearly three years that elapsed between the Republic's initial appearance in this matter and its decision to file the pending motion to dismiss, the Republic never made any mention that it might seek to withdraw its waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   The Republic attempts-unsuccessfully-to persuade the Court that its failure to raise an immunity defense cannot be construed as an implied waiver. To support that claim, the Republic relies principally on\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Department of Treasury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1230205\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/459/#p467\">\n    323 U.S. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1230205\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/459/#p467\">\n    65 S.Ct. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1230205\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/459/#p467\">\n    89 L.Ed. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1945). But unlike the case at bar,\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   involved an involuntary waiver of sovereign immunity.

There, the Republic and the PCGG asserted sovereign immunity from the beginning of the action, and had neither expressly nor implicitly waived their immunity. Here, of course, the Republic seeks to assert immunity years after its express waiver, and after the Republic has actively participated in all aspects of the case. For this reason,\n   <em>\n    Pimentel\n   </em>\n   has little bearing on the present action or on this Court's adjudication of the Republic's\n   pending motion.

Shipping Ltd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Flota Mercante Grancolombiana, S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1763387\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/830/449/#p452\">\n    830 F.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452 (2d Cir. 1987). From this general principle, the Republic asks this Court to conclude that \"[t]o re-examine how and why the waiver was improvidently done involves an inquiry into [ ] the politics and policies of the former government that appointed previous counsel and the present appointment of new counsel under a new government.\" (Republic MTD 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   This, the Court cannot do. Contrary to the Republic's suggestion, in upholding the validity of the PCGG's waiver, the Court is not inquiring into the policies of the Philippines' former or current government. It is not second-guessing the acts or conduct of the officials of a foreign state. It is merely ascribing due weight to the government's actions: its waiver of sovereign immunity, its decision to submit an answer and cross-claims, and its decision to prosecute this case-and vigorously assert its right to the Interpleader Property-over the course of several years. That does not contravene or even implicate the act of state doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Curiously, the Republic fails to explain why the act of state doctrine, to the extent it applies at all, militates in favor of dismissal. Presumably, the doctrine would apply equally to the Republic's initial waiver of immunity as to the Republic's more recent decision to seek to withdraw that waiver. After all, the decision to waive sovereign immunity is at least as much an \"act of state\" as the subsequent decision to seek withdrawal. Striking though it may be, the Republic has not offered any theory under which the act of state doctrine would require this Court to defer to the later act (withdrawal) but not the earlier act (waiver). The Court therefore rejects the Republic's claim that the act of state doctrine mandates dismissal of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Neither International Comity Nor the U.N. Convention Against Corruption Requires This Court to Dismiss or Stay This Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   The Republic's remaining arguments fare no better. The Republic claims that dismissal is required under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (\"UNCAC\"), which the U.S. Congress ratified on October 30, 2006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Exec. Rept., No. 109-18, at 3 (2006). (Republic MTD 17). In particular, it points to Article 55 of the UNCAC, which states that a \"[s]tate [p]arty that has received a request from another [s]tate [p]arty having jurisdiction over an offence established in accordance with this Convention for confiscation of proceeds of crime\" must submit the request to its competent authorities in order to obtain an order of confiscation, or submit to its authorities an order of confiscation issued by the requesting state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UNCAC art. 55, Oct. 31, 2003, S. Exec. Rept., No. 109-18, UN Doc. A/55/383.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   The Republic has failed to explain why Article 55 might apply to the present action. As an initial matter, the Republic does not allege that this Court or any other \"state party\" has \"received a request from [the Republic] ... for confiscation of proceeds of crime[.]\" UNCAC art. 55, Oct. 31, 2003, S. Exec. Rept., No. 109-18, UN Doc. A/55/383. More importantly, by its very terms, Article 55 appears to apply only to instances where one sovereign seeks another's cooperation in tracing, seizing, and confiscating proceeds of criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1763387\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/830/449/#p452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Following a request made by another State Party having jurisdiction over an offence ..., the requested [s]tate [p]arty shall take measures to identify, trace and freeze or seize proceeds of crime ... for the purpose of eventual confiscation[.]\"). The Court finds no basis to conclude that Article 55 applies in instances, like the one at bar, where the property\n   has already been confiscated and where legal proceedings are already underway to determine ownership over said property. In light of the Republic's failure adequately to address why UNCAC Article 55 might apply to the present action, the Court denies its claim that dismissal is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   The Republic next argues that international comity requires dismissal. The U.S. Supreme Court has described international comity as \"the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens, or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Hilton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Guyot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5699846\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/113/#p164\">\n    159 U.S. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5699846\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/113/#p164\">\n    16 S.Ct. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5699846\" index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/113/#p164\">\n    40 L.Ed. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1895). The doctrine is \"concerned with maintaining amicable working relationships between nations, a shorthand for good neighbourliness, common courtesy and mutual respect[.]\"\n   <em>\n    JP Morgan Chase Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Altos Hornos de Mex., S.A. de C.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969032,8964958\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/418/\">\n    412 F.3d 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). It is \"not an imperative obligation of courts but rather is a discretionary rule of 'practice, convenience, and expediency.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969032,8964958\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/418/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pravin Banker Assocs., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Banco Popular Del Peru\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834080\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/850/#p854\">\n    109 F.3d 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 854 (2d Cir. 1997) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   The fact that the Republic appeared in this case, and for years prosecuted the case without objecting to it on international comity grounds, undercuts the Republic's present appeal for dismissal. So too does the fact that the Republic began the parallel action in the Philippine Sandiganbayan court\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   it waived its limited sovereign immunity in order to appear in the instant interpleader. And, in its March 31, 2016 letter to the Court explaining its decision to pursue parallel litigation in the Philippines, the Republic made no mention of any intention to move to dismiss on comity grounds. (Dkt. # 178). Instead, it stated that it was asserting claims in the Philippines \"[o]ut of an abundance of caution\" and in response to Class Plaintiffs' \"repeated reference to the Republic's failure to utilize its own courts to pursue these claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3). Having appeared in the instant action, waived its sovereign immunity, litigated the case for several years, obtained a stay of a related state action, and subsequently commenced parallel litigation in the Philippines, the Republic's late appeal to comity falls flat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Were the Court to grant the Republic's request, it could set a troubling precedent. Sovereign states could waive sovereign immunity and participate in litigation merely to test the waters of American jurisprudence, with the knowledge that they could, on a whim and at almost any point in the litigation, dismiss the case on comity grounds. That cannot be-and is not-what the doctrine of international comity requires. And the Republic has not cited any cases that suggest otherwise. Dismissing the case at this late stage would cause undue prejudice to the other claimants that have diligently pursued their claims since 2014. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Republic's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The Court similarly rejects the Republic's request, in the alternative, to stay the case. This Court has already granted one such stay, in effect from February 23, 2017, until May 24, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 323). It did so \"solely in recognition of the evolving political and administrative changes in the Republic of the Philippines ... that were discussed during the [February 22, 2017] conference[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At the time, the Court stated that the stay \"will not be extended.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Though the Republic here is not requesting an extension of that earlier stay, the Court sees no reason to grant another stay in this case, which has been\n   pending since 2014. Because any such stay would prejudice the other parties to this litigation, and because the Republic has failed to identify compelling reasons for the stay, the Court denies the Republic's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <strong>\n    6. S&amp;P's Motion for Attorneys' Liens Is Granted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Lastly, the Court addresses a motion by S&amp;P, the Republic's former counsel, for attorneys' retaining and charging liens against the case file and any potential proceeds from the interpleader action. Though the motion is unopposed, the Court addresses its merits below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Image Innovations Holdings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 06 Civ. 3707 (JGK),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201505174\">\n    2009 WL 1505174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3 (S.D.N.Y. May 27, 2009) (analyzing the merits of an unopposed motion for retaining lien).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   In November 2013, the Republic retained S&amp;P to represent it in this action. (S&amp;P Br. Republic 2). It signed a retainer three months later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). S&amp;P filed responsive pleadings on May 13, 2014, February 19, 2016, and March 21, 2016 (Dkt. # 28, 150, 161); attended court conferences (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. # 44); defended against a motion to dismiss (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 89); and represented the Republic in the pending cross-motions for summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. # 219). Throughout, S&amp;P represented the Republic capably. And for more than three years, the Republic paid S&amp;P's invoices. (S&amp;P Br. Republic 2). However, beginning in November 2016, the Republic stopped paying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As a result, on February 8, 2017, S&amp;P moved to withdraw as counsel. (Dkt. # 319). By Order dated May 25, 2017, the Court granted S&amp;P's motion effective June 9, 2017.
