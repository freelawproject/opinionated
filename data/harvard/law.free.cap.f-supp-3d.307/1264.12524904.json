Specifically before the court is Defendant, Chickasaw City Board of Education's (the \"Board\"), Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 40) and brief in support thereof (Doc. 41), Plaintiffs' Response in opposition (Doc. 44) with materials in support (Doc. 43), and Defendant's Reply (Doc. 45). For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that Defendant's motion for summary judgment should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, Ronald Cottrell (\"Cottrell\"), James Rigdon (\"J. Rigdon\"), and Stacey Rigdon (\"S. Rigdon\") were each employees of the Chickasaw City School System for the 2014-15 school year. (Doc. 1 at 2). Cottrell and J. Rigdon were both employed as teachers and coaches while S. Rigdon was employed as a paraprofessional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) J. Rigdon and S. Rigdon are also husband and wife and their son, Chandler Rigdon was a senior student at Chickasaw City School during the 2014-15 school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On September 21, 2014\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , Chandler Rigdon was involved in an incident (the \"incident\") wherein the principal of Chickasaw City High School, Brent Ward, struck him on the head/neck between one and three times in front of three other teachers, Stephanie Serra (\"Serra\"), Ricky Ruffin (\"Ruffin\"), and Ronald Cottrell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Brent Ward ultimately resigned from his position based on another incident unrelated to this lawsuit. However, the facts surrounding the investigation of Mr. Ward's behavior are disputed by the parties and are pertinent to this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that following the incident with Chandler Rigdon and Principal Ward, Ruffin took Chandler outside of the school building and instructed him not to tell his father, J. Rigdon, what had occurred. Ruffin then approached J. Rigdon in his classroom and informed him of the incident and told him that he, Ruffin, had taken care of it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). At the end of the school day Serra informed the Rigdons of the incident and apologized that it had occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cottrell was approached by the assistant principal, Willie Lewis \"(Lewis\") after the school day ended and told that he needed to calm J. Rigdon down and that the Rigdons did not need to press charges. Cottrell replied that Ward should not have hit a student. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The same afternoon, after football practice, Lewis approached J. Rigdon and stated \"Word for the wise, if you want to stay, you need to let it go.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The day after the incident, Cottrell met with Ward and suggested that Ward apologize for the incident, to which he refused. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Days after the incident occurred, J. Rigdon requested video surveillance of the incident and that video was provided to him in Ward's office where J. Rigdon, Ruffin, and Ward watched the video. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the incident, Cottrell and J. Rigdon reported the incident to Robert McFall (\"McFall\"), president of the Chickasaw School Board of Education and Kyle Kallhoff (\"Kallhoff\"), the superintendent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kallhoff instructed J. Rigdon to report the incident to Ward in accordance with the school's chain of command.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kallhoff also called Cottrell to determine the veracity of the incident and Cottrell confirmed that he witnessed the incident occur. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kallhoff responded that he was not going to investigate because Ward was doing a good job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) S. Rigdon then reported the incident to the Superintendent of the Alabama State Department of Education and a week later, Kallhoff requested a meeting with Mr. and Mrs. Rigdon which occurred in the presence of the attorneys for the Board and the school system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs contend that following the meeting, no investigation was initiated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The remaining events relevant to this action are listed below in chronological order:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 25, 2014, Lewis sent J. Rigdon an email regarding problems observed in his classroom and J. Rigdon responded the same day. (Doc. 41-17 at 12-13). J. Rigdon's response brings up the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 8, 2014, a co-employee sent an email to Lewis and Ward regarding J. Rigdon's behavior relating to his son receiving a uniform violation. J. Rigdon responded to that email and brought up the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 27, 2014, Cottrell completed a witness statement relating to the incident.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 10, 2015, Cottrell was given a letter from Lewis explaining items that needed Cottrell's attention (relating to sports). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 18, Cottrell was reprimanded for making purchases without following proper accounting procedures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 18, 2015, S. Rigdon sent an email to Lewis that mentions the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On April 21, 2015, Cottrell was given Letter of Reprimand for unprofessional conduct and insubordination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 6, 2015, S. Rigdon sent an email to Lewis that again demanded that Lewis stop harassing her and her family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On May 6, 2015, James and Stacey Rigdon were placed on administrative leave.

The content of the written statement offers some insight as to its purpose because it describes Cottrell's observation of a specific incident and does not mention any other opinions or concerns. It was also given to Kallhoff privately and Cottrell made no attempt to bring it to the attention of the public. The date of the written statement also offers some insight as it was provided approximately two months after the incident occurred, an amount of time that does not support a desire to bring the event to the attention of the general public out of concern for Ward's misconduct. Lastly, it is undisputed that Cottrell provided the written statement to Kallhoff, his superior,\n   <em>\n    upon his request\n   </em>\n   and it was not written by Cottrell on his own initiative. (Doc. 43-12). Considering the content, form, and context of the written statement it is clear that the same was made as part of Cottrell's official duties as part of an investigation of a private matter by the school's administration that Cottrell's statement was not made as a citizen on a matter of public concern. As such Cottrell's written statement is not protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With regard to his verbal reporting of the incident to Kallhoff, McFall, and Ham, Cottrell has not provided any facts to establish that the speech was by a citizen on a matter of public concern. The only facts provided by Cottrell relate to his meeting with McFall. In that regard, the record indicates that Cottrell drove to McFall's house at some point after the incident occurred and only after Cottrell was unable to speak with Kallhoff and that Cottrell spoke with McFall about the incident in McFall's kitchen. (Doc. 43-1 at 46-49). While at McFall's house, Cottrell \"told him what happened.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48). The only stated reason for Cottrell's conversation with McFall was because he had previously been unable to talk with Kallhoff, he didn't want to talk to Ward since the incident involved him, and because Cottrell respected McFall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-49). As such, the record reflects that Cottrell sought to have a private conversation with the single member of the Board whom he most respected about the subject incident that he witnessed. Cottrell has not presented any facts that his conversation with McFall was initiated in his capacity as a private citizen in an attempt to discuss a matter of public concern versus in his capacity as a teacher to a person up the hierarchal chain of command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The timing, circumstance, content, or arena in which the statements with Kallhoff and Ham were made is not a part of the record. As such, it cannot be determined whether Cottrell was speaking as either an employee or a citizen. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have not established that Cottrell was acting in accordance with his official duties because they have not provided any job description showing his job duties; however, such a standard is not required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   at 425,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he listing of a given task in an employee's written job description is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting the task is within the scope of the employee's professional duties for First Amendment purposes.\"). Rather, the initial burden is upon\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   to establish that he engaged in protected speech and for purposes of summary judgment, Defendant need only establish that Plaintiffs have not met that burden or that the facts taken in a light\n   most favorable to Cottrell could in no way result in a jury finding that Cottrell was speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844575\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/520/#p524\">\n    32 F.3d at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Once the movant satisfies his initial burden under Rule 56(c), the non-moving party \"must make a sufficient showing to establish the existence of each essential element to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In effort to establish that he engaged in protected speech, Cottrell, in response to the subject motion for summary judgment, submitted an affidavit which stated, \"I reported Brent Ward hitting Chandler Rigdon because, I like any other member of the community, know that it is wrong for an adult to hit a student.\" (Doc. 43-12 at 3). Even assuming his statements were made as a citizen, however, Plaintiff must still present facts that the statements were on a matter of public concern. Plaintiffs make the blanket assertion that \"the subject matter-physical abuse of a student by a public school principal-is a matter of public concern. (Doc. 44 at 20). In support of this position, Cottrell points to several non-binding cases from outside of the Eleventh Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, after reviewing each of the cases cited to by Plaintiffs, this Court reaches two conclusions (1) none of the cases are factually similar to the case at hand and (2) the conclusions implying that physical abuse of student is a matter of public concern were reached not solely by the subject matter alone, but by the proper analysis of the content, form, and context of the fact specific circumstances in those cases. As a result, this Court does not find Plaintiffs' argument compelling. While the subject matter of the speech in this action may be a matter of public concern the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   test requires an analysis of the true purpose of the speech. In the instant action, even assuming Cottrell was speaking as a citizen, there are no facts to suggest that Cottrell's purpose in making these reports was to raise an issue of public concern as the reports were made verbally to single individuals (superiors) with no obvious expectation of bringing the matter to public light. Accordingly, considering the record as a whole in a practical way, Cottrell's pre-testimony statements, verbal or written, were not made by a citizen on a matter of public concern and, therefore, not protected. Cottrell's court testimony will be further analyzed herein below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    2) James and Stacey Rigdon\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The record reflects that J. Rigdon reported the incident between Ward and Chandler to Superintendent Kallhoff, Board Members McFall and Ham, and Office Administrator Jodie McPherson (Doc. 1 at 4; Doc 43-1; Doc. 43-11 at 4). The record does not contain the details of these reportings. It is also evident that J. Rigdon brought up the incident to Lewis on September 25, 2014 following Lewis's reprimanding J. Rigdon for the state of his classroom. (Doc. 41-17 at 12-13) (\"I understand you [W]ard work off intimidation and my son has [a]lready been slapped and since then you 2 have came by my room so much students have asked why you guys drop by so much but let me make it clear you guys do not intimidate me and never will.\") J. Rigdon additionally brought up the incident in an email with another teacher, Grace Whit, (with Lewis and Ward copied) on October 8, 2015 in response to that teacher's email to Lewis regarding a uniform violation given to Chandler Rigdon. (Doc. 41-17 at 15)(\"Let\n   me also add for the record that YOU were the main person telling me that I should go to the cops on Brett [sic] [W]ard for what happened with chandler. Your exact words were if you don't he will go after you and chandler, funny how I did not listen and you are the one who are trying to do what you can do to go after chandler and I.\") The evidence before this Court indicates that Stacey Rigdon reported the incident to the Alabama State Department of Education. (Doc. 1 at 4). No details relating to that reporting are a part of the record. A week after she reported the incident to the Department of Education, Ms. Rigdon also participated in a meeting with J. Rigdon, Kallhoff, and the attorneys for the School Board. (Doc. 1 at 4). The record does not contain the details of that meeting. Subsequently, S. Rigdon also brought up the incident in emails to Lewis on December 23, 2014, wherein the main topic was her son's suspension by Lewis (\"I understand you are upset because Chandler took out a police report on your friend Brent Ward but I'm gonna ask you to stop bullying and harassing my child and family.\"), and on March 18, 2015, wherein the main topic was Lewis's refusal to allow the Rigdons to sell pizza from their pizza business on school grounds (\"yet you promote you[r] friend Brent Ward's family business. Your excuse to my husband is 'he doesn't work at Chickasaw,' Are you serious, We know he does not work in Chickasaw because he couldn't keep his hands off of children and keep from harassing a teacher, but you already know this. So you hurt my family while you promote Brent Ward's family's business. This is ABSOLUTELY astonishing, yet at the same time after you hid the fact that you knew Chandler was slapped by Mr. Ward it should not be too surprising.\"), and on May 6, 2015 where the main topic was a threatening letter written by a student (\"Please STOP HARRASSING ME and MY FAMILY!!!!!!\") (Doc. 1 at 6; Doc. 41-17 at 26, 28-29, 31). There is also mention on the record of the possibility that one or both of the Rigdons may have discussed the incident with a local newspaper, Call News, although the details of those discussions or the time period in which they were made are not stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs unequivocally state that \"the Rigdon's regularly discussed their son being hit by Brent Ward and supported their son filing his police report\" and that \"their speech was on a matter of public concern\" because physical abuse of a student by a public school principal is a matter of public concern. (Doc. 44 at 20, 22). Like Cottrell, the Rigdons do not address in detail whether or not they were speaking as citizens, but cite several non-binding cases which tend to support their contention that the subject of the statements were a matter of public concern.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   To support that their speech was not privately motivated, J. Rigdon and S. Rigdon have also each submitted an affidavit that states that they were not speaking out about the incident to improve their own self-interest. (Doc. 43-10, Affidavit of S. Rigdon: \"... I did not instruct him [Chandler] to file it to gain any leverage related to my employment\"; Doc. 43-11, Aff. of J. Rigdon: same.) Defendant asserts summary judgment is due to be granted because the Rigdons' speech did not address a matter of public concern and it is therefore, not protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Again, in order to determine whether the Rigdons' speech was protected, this Court must discern the purpose of the speech-that is, whether [they] spoke on behalf of the public as a citizen, or whether the employee spoke for [his/her]self as an employee.\n   <em>\n    Connick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/#p146\">\n    461 U.S. at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/#p146\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, it must be determined whether the purpose of the speech was to raise issues of public concern, on the one hand, or to further private interest, on the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deremo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527605\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/939/908/#p910\">\n    939 F.2d at 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument that \"Plaintiffs exercised their right to free speech by talking publicly about the assault on their child\" (Doc. 44 at 22) tends to suggest that any speech made by a citizen related to any matter that may potentially be a concern of the public is protected. Such a contention is misguided and the correct analysis requires a review of the purpose for which the speech was made. As to the verbal statements made by S. Rigdon, i.e. reporting the incident to the Alabama Department of Education, discussing the incident during a meeting, and generally discussing the incident with unidentified people, there are no facts from which it could be determined that her speech was protected because there are no facts in the record providing details as to the content or context of these statements. At best, the known facts suggest that S. Rigdon\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have been acting as a citizen, but even so, there is no indication that these statements were made in a public forum, for non-personal reasons, or with the intent to raise public awareness. As discussed herein above, once Defendants have shown a lack of material fact, it is Plaintiff's burden to establish that she engaged in protected speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844575\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/520/#p524\">\n    32 F.3d at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that regard, S. Rigdon has urged that the subject matter of her son's incident-physical abuse of a student by a teacher-is carte blanche a matter of public concern and has filed an affidavit which indicates her motive was not to further her own interest. (Doc. 43-10). Such a blanket denial without supporting evidence does not overcome the lack of factual support that her speech was protected based on its content, form, and context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   With regard to the statements made by S. Rigdon in her emails to Lewis, the content, form, and context of those statements do not support that they were made by a citizen on a matter of public concern. Rather, the emails are clearly written to one individual, her superior, in a private manner and in response to other work-related incidents involving her or her husband. (Doc. 41-17 at 26-27,28-29, 31). The comments were also made after Ward was placed on administrative leave and had resigned and, therefore, when Ward was no longer on campus or having any contact with students. Further, while personal motive may not be wholly dispositive of determining the purpose of speech, a plain reading of the emails show that S. Rigdon was motivated, at least in part, because the child involved was\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   son. Lastly, the emails address multiple school-related issues for which S. Rigdon would not be involved or have knowledge of but for her position as an employee and only mention the incident as an aside to other matters. For all off these reasons, taken as a whole the facts taken in a light most favorable to her, do not show that S. Rigdon's speech was protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   J. Rigdon's speech suffers the same shortcomings as S. Rigdon's speech. Again, in response to Defendant's assertion that there is no dispute of material fact that J. Rigdon's speech was protected, J. Rigdon has failed to provide any facts which would establish otherwise. Like, S. Rigdon's verbal statements, the content and context of J. Rigdon's verbal statements are wholly unknown. The record provides no details as to on what dates the statements were made or the content of the statements from which the proper analysis would result in a conclusion that those statements, together or separate, are protected as a matter of law. Further, those statements which have been memorialized in emails between J. Rigdon and Lewis/Kallhoff show that the incident was brought up not as a topic issue, but as an aside to other matters being discussed based on J. Rigdon's role as a teacher, specifically in response to his being reprimanded by an administrator or having a conflict with another co-worker. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 41-17 at 12, 15, and 16). Those statements were also made to only one individual, a superior, in private emails and some after Ward had been placed on administrative leave and was no longer on the school's premises. As such, the statements are not indicative of those made by a citizen, rather than a public employee, or for the purpose of raising public awareness, rather than to express a personal grievance. For these reasons, the record as a whole does not support that J. Rigdon's speech was protected as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Second\n    <em>\n     Pickering\n    </em>\n    Factor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   There being no dispute that Cottrell's court testimony was protected and even assuming arguendo that the Rigdons' speech was protected, the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   balance requires determining whether the public employee's interest in exercising a constitutional right outweighs the employer's interest in efficiency and the effective functioning of the office.\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767525\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/563/#p568\">\n    391 U.S. at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767525\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/563/#p568\">\n    88 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1734-35 ;\n   <em>\n    Rankin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    483 U.S. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 107 S.Ct. at 2899. The Supreme Court has identified a number of factors for courts to consider when performing the balance: (1) whether the employee's exercising rights \"impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among co-workers\"; (2) whether the employee's exercising rights \"has a detrimental impact on close working relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary\"; and (3) whether the employee's exercising rights \"impedes the performance of the [employee's] duties or interferes with the regular operation of the enterprise.\"\n   <em>\n    Rankin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    483 U.S. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 107 S.Ct. at 2899 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant contends that both Cottrell's and the Rigdons' speech was disruptive to the efficient functioning of the school and therefore, even if it was protected, their claims should fail as a matter of law because the Board's interest in operating the school efficiently outweighs Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. (Doc. 41 at 24-28). In support of its position, Defendant cites numerous occasions in which Cottrell, J. Rigdon, and S. Rigdon, individually interrupted the efficient functioning of the school by their rhetoric or behavior.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Plaintiffs argue that the Board has intertwined the third and fourth factors of the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   analysis with the second factor. (Doc. 44 at 22). In that regard, Plaintiffs point out that \"[t]he Board is not actually claiming that there is something sufficiently disruptive about the\n   <em>\n    actual speech in question\n   </em>\n   such that the\n   Board would be justified in firing Plaintiffs for it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For the most part, this Court agrees with Plaintiffs. Of the numerous instances brought forth by the Board showing the disruptive nature of the Rigdon's behavior, the only instances wherein Plaintiffs potentially engaged in protected speech are those occasions where the incident was mentioned in email correspondences (discussed previously herein). Thus, those are the only instances in which the second\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   analysis should be applied. While the other examples of the Rigdons' behavior may be indicative of the Board's reason for non-renewing Plaintiffs, they offer no insight as to whether the Board's interest in maintaining an efficient workplace outweigh Plaintiffs' interest in the\n   <em>\n    protected speech.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   With regard to Cottrell, none of the disruptive instances referred to by Defendant relate to the incident or the protected court testimony, a point Defendant acknowledges. (Doc. 45 at 11). Accordingly, the interests of the Board in regulating Cottrell's speech does not outweigh Cottrell's First Amendment Rights. With regard to the conduct wherein the Rigdons' discussed the incident, they assert that \"with the facts taken in a light most favorable to them, the worst that could be said is that they were frustrated both by the initial incident and by their supervisors' seeming desire to pretend that it never happened. Whether their frustration in that regard was expressed in ways that were actually disruptive justifying termination is, at most a question requiring resolution of disputed facts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 44 at 23). Plaintiffs' argument is not compelling. The second\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   analysis is a question of law to be decided by this Court and of the instances involving the allegedly protected speech by Plaintiffs, Defendant has sufficiently established that the Rigdons' speech was disruptive to the efficient functioning of the school. Specifically, the email correspondences wherein J. Rigdon mentions the incident (discussed herein above) show a pattern of hostility, insubordination, and lack of professionalism all of which would have affected his ability to perform his duties as an employee. The same is apparent from the email correspondences from S. Rigdon (discussed herein above) wherein her rhetoric was accusatory and insubordinate with her superior. The emails additionally raised conflict with other staff members. (Doc. 41-17 at 14-15). Notably, the Rigdons have not responded or addressed in any manner the Board's position as to the second\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   factor as it relates to the speech which the Rigdons allege was protected. Nevertheless, the record is clear that the Rigdons' speech relating to the incident was, in fact, disruptive to the functioning of the school because it interfered with the relationships with their co-workers and superiors and hindered the administration's ability to trust them as employees. As a result, this Court finds that even if the Rigdons' speech was protected-which it is not-their interest in said speech is outweighed by the Board's interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein above, Defendant's motion for Summary Judgment as to James and Stacey Rigdons' freedom of speech claim is granted. The analysis will continue with regard to Cottrell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Third\n    <em>\n     Pickering\n    </em>\n    Factor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As for Cottrell's protected speech, his trial testimony, the third\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   factor requires this Court to determine whether Cottrell has presented evidence of a material\n   dispute of fact that the protected speech was a motivating factor in Cottrell's non-renewal such that summary judgement would not be appropriate. The Eleventh Circuit has stated that \"[i]t is neither possible nor desirable to fashion a single standard for determining when an employee has met her initial burden of demonstrating that a retaliatory intent was a 'substantial' or 'motivating factor' behind a government employment decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Beckwith v.

The Eleventh Circuit, however, has also \"identified several factors that are relevant in determining whether protected speech was a \"substantial\" motivating factor in an adverse employment decision: (1) whether temporal proximity exists between the employment action and the protected activity; (2) whether any reasons for the employment action are pretextual; (3) whether any comments made, or actions taken, by the employer indicate that the employment action was related to the protected speech; (4) whether the asserted reasons for the action vary; and (5) any circumstantial evidence of causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Potter v.

In support of his position, Cottrell points out that (1) the majority of the Board was aware of the incident because they had heard of it either from the press, the community, or directly from Kallhoff, (2) the incident was widely talked about, (3) Kallhoff did not want bad \"PR\" for the school system and wanted to control any mention of the school system in the press because bad press reflected badly on him and the Board, and (4) Kallhoff and other administrators worked to minimize any negative impact the incident had on the school system and acted to keep Cottrell from testifying as a witness and that once charges were filed and Ward resigned, Kallhoff, Ruffin, and Lewis continued to harass Plaintiffs making it clear they wanted them \"gone from Chickasaw\" until their eventual recommendations for termination from Kallhoff to the Board. (Doc. 44 at 23) (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Despite Plaintiff's burden being low at this stage, Cottrell has not presented any evidence that would create an issue of material fact that his protected speech was a substantial factor in his ultimate termination. Even considering the speech which this Court has previously found to be unprotected, i.e. the verbal and written statement prior to Cottrell's testimony, Plaintiff has not presented facts that the speech and the non-renewal are causally linked. Specifically, Cottrell has not pointed to any comments made by the Board or Kallhoff that suggest his speech was a factor, much less a substantial one, in his termination. There is no evidence that the reasons for his non-renewal varied. Moreover, it is undisputed that the protected trial testimony had not yet occurred when Cottrell was non-renewed by the Board and the record is devoid of any comments suggesting Cottrell should not testify or may be looked on with disfavor if he testified in the future. Further, during his deposition testimony in this action, Cottrell indicated that (1) he did not know of any instance when a Board member influenced the alleged harassment or disparate treatment, (2) he had no knowledge of a Board member ever telling an employee to discriminate or harass him for any reason, and (3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   he had no knowledge of a Board member ever saying that he would be fired for testifying in the Brent Ward case. (Doc. 41-10 at 6). Cottrell has identified a number of encounters with Kallhoff and/or Lewis which he believes were pretextual in nature (Doc. 44 at 24). Namely, in an effort to create a question of fact, Cottrell disputes a number of allegedly unprofessional instances that were on a list drafted by Kallhoff entitled \"Unprofessional Behavior\". (Doc. 41-17 at 10). However, while Cottrell disputes whether the actions listed were unprofessional, he does not provide any facts that they did not occur. For example, Cottrell states one listed item was an unsanctioned football practice witnessed but not stopped by Lewis and Athletic Director Ruffin. (Doc. 44 at 24). While Cottrell disputes whether the incident was worthy of reprimand, he does not dispute that there was, in fact, an unsanctioned football practice. Another noted incident involved Cottrell having helmets reconditioned and Cottrell disputes it was unprofessional because he is required as a coach to have the helmets reconditioned. (Doc. 44 at 17-18). However, he does not dispute that he had to follow proper accounting procedures to have them reconditioned, the reason that he was reprimanded on that occasion. (Doc. 41-17 at 5). While Cottrell states that \"all of the allegations in Kallhoff's document are disputed\" he has not shown that they were pretextual based on his protected court testimony which had not yet occurred. As a result, Cottrell has not presented evidence of a disputed material fact to show that his protected speech was a substantial motivating factor in his non-renewal and summary judgement is due to be granted\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

In the instant action, there is no dispute that James and Stacey Rigdon are the parents of Chandler Rigdon or that a parent-child relationship is intimate association. There is also no dispute that Chandler Rigdon filed a police report against Ward and that the Rigdons were both ultimately non-renewed by the Board. There is no argument that the state's interest in maintaining an efficient workplace outweighs the constitutional right of a parent to associate with their child.

There is, likewise, no evidence that the Board, itself, acted with retaliatory motivation. In fact, all three board members who voted in favor of non-renewal have been deposed and testified as to their reasons for voting the way they did after the Rigdons were recommended for non-renewal by Kallhoff, none of those\n   reasons included retaliatory motivation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 41-6 at 51-58; Doc. 41-7 at 52-54; Doc. 41-8 at 45, 47-48, 51-52). Lastly, the Rigdons' discovery responses do not offer any evidence that the Board acted with retaliatory motivation. (Doc. 41-12 at 4-8; Doc. 41-13 at 3-7). Nevertheless, Plaintiffs argue that it is not necessary for the Board or its members to exercise retaliatory motivation because \"the Superintendent is enough to create liability on the facts of this case\". (Doc. 44 at 18).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically, Plaintiffs assert that entity liability can arise from those who have the authority to make final policy on behalf of the entity. (Doc. 44 at 24). In that regard, Plaintiffs posit that the superintendent and the Board are \"co-equal\" in terms of authority because the Board cannot act without the recommendation of the superintendent and therefore, \"neither can create a policy without the other's approval.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs further argue that \"entity liability can arise, as well, from even a single action by an officer with final policy making authority over the type of decision in question.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id. citing to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pembaur v.

In support of their position, the Rigdons point to the deposition testimony of Broadhead, Grizzle, and McFall, the three board members who voted in support of non-renewal, to show that they did not question Kallhoff's motive for his recommendation in any way because they believed it was the job of the superintendent to run the school, not the Board.

Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=269%20Fed.%20Appx.%20941\">\n    269 Fed.Appx. 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2008), which Plaintiffs parenthetically\n   describe as \"discussing the possibility of establishing entity liability under \u00a7 1983 by proving that governing body merely rubber-stamps the employment decisions of another official\". (Doc. 44 at 25). Relying on\n   <em>\n    Maschmeier\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs assert that \"[a] finder of fact could therefore conclude that a majority of this Board, as a matter of philosophy, custom, and practice, engaged in no meaningful review [... and] [a] finder of fact could readily find that this amount[s] to a delegation of final authority, to a lack of meaningful review, and to a rubber-stamping process that yields entity liability based on the acts and motivation of the Superintendent.\" (Doc. 44 at 26).

Plaintiffs have not shown that the superintendent was the final policymaker in the instant action because it is undisputed that the recommendation of the superintendent must be approved via a majority vote of the Board before becoming final. Moreover, there are no facts to suggest that the Board terminated Plaintiffs without review or that the review was somehow deficient or only a matter or \"rubber-stamping\" by the Board. Rather, the record reflects that the recommendations of Kallhoff with regard to Plaintiffs were narrowly approved by the Board in a three to two vote. As such, Plaintiffs' argument that there was no meaningful review is not compelling. While Plaintiffs argue that every single one of the board members did not review Kallhoff's recommendation in this case, it is clear that they had an opportunity to review the recommendations and, in fact, two of the members both reviewed and rejected Kallhoff's recommendation. As a result, in this action, Plaintiffs have not shown that Kallhoff was a final policy maker by way of the Board simply rubber-stamping his recommendations, such that liability exists without evidence of retaliatory\n   motivation caused by an \"official policy\" or \"custom\" of the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Because Plaintiffs' effort to impose liability on the Board by way of Kallhoff's actions is not compelling, there remains no evidence from which it could be determined that Plaintiffs' speech or association was a substantial factor in their being non-renewed. Accordingly, the Rigdons' freedom of association claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Further because this Court has determined that all of Plaintiffs' claims fail based on the analysis set forth herein above, it is unnecessary for the Court to determine whether a question of material fact exists on Defendant's position that it would have terminated Plaintiffs despite their allegedly protected behavior, step four of the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of February 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Defendant disputes the date Plaintiffs contend this incident occurred and assert the correct date is between August 18 and 22, 2014.
