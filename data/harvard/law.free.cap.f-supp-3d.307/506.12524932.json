As the Fourth Circuit has summarized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The procedure for obtaining a certificate from FERC is set forth in the NGA, and its implementing regulations. The process\n   begins with an application from the gas company that includes, among other information, (1) a description of the proposed pipeline project, (2) a statement of the facts showing why the project is required, and (3) the estimated beginning and completion date for the project. Notice of the application is filed in the Federal Register, public comment and protest is allowed, and FERC conducts a public hearing on the application. As part of its evaluation, FERC must also investigate the environmental consequences of the proposed project and issue an environmental impact statement. At the end of the process FERC issues a certificate if it finds that the proposed project \"is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.\" In its order issuing a certificate, FERC specifies a date for the completion of construction and the start of service. The certificate may include any terms and conditions that FERC deems \"required by the public convenience and necessity.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    E. Tenn. Nat. Gas Co. v.

BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 13, 2017, FERC granted a Certificate to MVP authorizing construction of a 303.5-mile-long, 42-inch-diameter natural-gas pipeline from Wetzel County, West Virginia, to Pittsylvania County, Virginia (\"MVP Project\" or \"the Project\") (Dkt. No. 1-2 at 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Project also includes three compressor stations in West Virginia and four interconnections along the pipeline's route.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.

On December 8, 2017, MVP sought to exercise that authority over certain property located in the Northern District of West Virginia, which it could not acquire by agreement, by filing a complaint pursuant to the NGA and Fed. R. Civ. P. 71.1 (Dkt. No. 1). As required by Rule 71.1(c)(2), it included descriptions of the property, as well as the interests to be taken (Dkt. Nos. 1 at 5-7; 1-1; 1-3). On December 13, 2017, MVP filed the following motions: Motion for Partial Summary Judgement and Immediate Access to Survey Parcel ID Nos. 02-4L-19, 02-4L-12 Owned by Arthur C. And Judy Roberts (\"Survey Motion\") (Dkt. No. 3); Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Immediate Access to and Possession of the Easements Condemned for Construction of MVP Project (\"Possession Motion\") (Dkt. No. 5); and Motion for Expedited Hearing on Motions for Partial Summary Judgment and Immediate Access to and Possession of the Easements Condemned (Dkt. No. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following a status conference on December 21, 2017, the Court set a schedule for discovery and briefing on the Survey Motion and Possession Motion (Dkt. No. 33). The next day, several defendants filed a motion to stay proceedings on MVP's motion for immediate possession, which remains pending (Dkt. No. 31). On December 29, 2017, the Court denied the Survey Motion as moot after being advised by the parties that the motion was no longer in controversy (Dkt. No. 42). The Court subsequently granted MVP's motion for an expedited hearing, and amended the schedule to include a hearing on the Possession Motion (Dkt. No. 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

On January 23, 2018, the Court conducted an evidentiary hearing on MVP's Possession Motion (Dkt. No. 103). Thereafter, the parties filed post-hearing briefs regarding MVP's Possession Motion (Dkt. Nos. 112; 113; 114). The pending motions are now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. MOTION TO STAY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 22, 2017, defendants Charles F. Chong and Rebecca Ann Eneix-Chong (\"the Chongs\") moved to stay proceedings on MVP's motion for immediate possession (Dkt. No. 31), contending that, because there is a pending application for rehearing before FERC, this Court should delay consideration of equitable relief for MVP. According to the Chongs, the regulatory process before FERC has subjected them to \"administrative purgatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. At the evidentiary hearing on January 23, 2018, however, MVP and the Chongs advised that they had reached an agreement in principle regarding just compensation that would render moot the Chongs' motion to stay. Because that agreement is not final, however, the Court has considered the motion and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   it for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When FERC issues a Certificate, aggrieved parties may petition for rehearing within 30 days. Unless FERC \"acts upon the application for rehearing within thirty days,\" the application is deemed denied. Following further review by FERC, parties may seek judicial review, which is exclusively \"in the court of appeals of the United States for any circuit wherein the natural-gas company to which the order relates is located or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(a). Aggrieved parties are given \"60 days after the order of [FERC] upon the application of rehearing\" to seek judicial review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717r(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   FERC Certificates are effective on the date that they are issued.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20285.2007\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 285.2007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (2017). Filing an application for rehearing or seeking judicial review does not \"operate as a stay of [FERC's] order\" unless otherwise ordered by FERC or the applicable court of appeals. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(c). Only FERC and the courts of appeals have jurisdiction to stay the effect of a Certificate, and pending applications for rehearing-or even\n   <em>\n    granted\n   </em>\n   applications for rehearing-do not nullify the Certificate's effect in an eminent domain proceeding before the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC v. 7.72 Acres in Lee Cty., Ala.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-173,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208900100\">\n    2016 WL 8900100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (M.D. Ala.

Pa. Sept. 19, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In this case, FERC issued MVP's Certificate on October 13, 2017. On November 13, 2017, the Chongs and a number of other interested parties timely moved for rehearing before FERC. They argue that MVP's Project is not necessary under the NGA, and that the FERC Certificate rests on a deficient final environmental impact statement, in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (Dkt. No. 31-2 at 2, 6-7). FERC responded with a \"tolling order\" on December 13, 2017, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In order to afford additional time for consideration of the matters raised or to be raised, rehearing of the Commission's order is hereby granted for the limited purpose of further consideration, and timely-filed rehearing requests will not be deemed denied by operation of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Dkt. No. 31-1). According to FERC, such tolling orders do not constitute an \"act[ ] upon\" motions for rehearing, and associated Certificates are not final agency actions subject to judicial review (Dkt. No. 31-3 at 5). Neither FERC nor a court of appeals has enjoined enforcement of MVP's Certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While acknowledging that this Court does not have jurisdiction to stay the Certificate itself, the Chongs argue that this Court should exercise its equitable power to stay consideration of MVP's request for a preliminary injunction. They contend that FERC's tolling order \"gores [them] on the horns of a dilemma\": MVP will contend that the Chongs may only challenge the FERC Certificate before FERC and the court of appeals, while the tolling order indefinitely delays such administrative and judicial review (Dkt. No. 31 at 4). According to the Chongs, they may be deprived of their property in this proceeding before the validity of the FERC Certificate is fully resolved, resulting in a \"a clear case of hardship\" and a \"scandal to the administration of justice\" that warrants the imposition of a stay (Dkt. No. 59 at 2, 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In support of their request, the Chongs rely solely on\n   <em>\n    Landis v. North American Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/\">\n    299 U.S. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/\">\n    57 S.Ct. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/\">\n    81 L.Ed. 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1936), which discusses the Court's inherent equitable authority. In\n   <em>\n    Landis\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that \"the power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/\">\n    at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/\">\n    57 S.Ct. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]he suppliant for a stay must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to someone else.\" Foreclosing the district courts' power to issue such stays might result in \"scandal[s] to the administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/\">\n    at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/\">\n    57 S.Ct. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court acknowledges that it possesses inherent authority to stay consideration of MVP's request for a preliminary injunction, but concludes that several factors weigh against such an exercise of discretion in this case. First, the Chongs seek unusual relief. They do not ask the Court to stay this condemnation action in its entirety, but instead request equitable relief from the possibility that MVP will receive equitable relief. Yet the Court's analysis of whether MVP is entitled to a preliminary injunction necessarily will take into account whether \"the balance of equities tips in [MVP's] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    555 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Chongs' motion therefore is a mere redundancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, the Chongs' argument would warrant similar stays in a broad category of eminent domain cases under the NGA. A review of the cases cited within this Memorandum Opinion and Order establishes\n   that a significant number of eminent domain proceedings commence before administrative and judicial review are complete.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sabal Trail\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-173,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208900100\">\n    2016 WL 8900100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (collecting cases). In essence, the Chongs disagree with the structure of the NGA, which allows natural-gas companies to exercise the power of eminent domain upon receipt of a Certificate rather than after the Certificate has been subject to judicial review. The NGA also provides a remedy, however, by providing that FERC or the court of appeals may stay a Certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Indeed, the Chongs' attorneys have unsuccessfully requested such a stay from both FERC and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, both of which are fully aware that district courts hold the authority to grant preliminary injunctions in eminent domain cases (Dkt. Nos. 31-2; 47 at 6-7). That the Chongs have been unable to obtain the relief they seek in two other forums does not warrant an exercise of this Court's equitable power. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Chongs' Motion for Stay of Equitable Proceedings on Plaintiff's Motion for Immediate Possession (Dkt. No. 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     IV. MOTION TO DISMISS AND MOTION TO STRIKE\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On December 21, 2017, several defendants moved to dismiss MVP's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (Dkt.

Various defendants argue, however, that the FERC Certificate's conditions render it ineffective to grant the power of eminent domain under the NGA, thus divesting the Court of jurisdiction (Dkt.

They argue that FERC exceeded its authority by imposing conditions that must be satisfied prior to construction, such as acquiring necessary permits. They ask the Court to find that MVP does not truly hold a FERC Certificate (Dkt. No. 70 at 3-5). The Court rejects these arguments for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, analyzing the propriety and validity of a FERC Certificate is not the Court's role in the statutory scheme. As summarized by the District of Maryland:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A district court's role in proceedings involving FERC certificates is circumscribed by statute. The district court's role is simply to evaluate the scope of the certificate and to order condemnation of property as authorized in the certificate.

Therefore, the defendants' suggestion that this Court declare the FERC Certificate invalid is completely improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, even if the Court had jurisdiction to consider the validity of MVP's Certificate, the substance of the defendants' argument is of dubious merit. The NGA simply does not contain a provision limiting the exercise of eminent domain when conditions have not been met, and \"[c]ourts have repeatedly rejected similar arguments that a pipeline company cannot exercise eminent domain because a FERC Order is conditioned.\"\n   <em>\n    Transcon.

They contend that whether MVP is able to pay just compensation for their property was not determined by the FERC Certificate, that MVP is a private company at constant risk of insolvency, and that MVP is a new project without existing customers (Dkt.

Holmes (\"Holmes\"), a certified general appraiser, to establish the estimated diminution in property value that will result from MVP's takings (Dkt. No. 106 at 79-81). Following the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (\"USPAP\"), Holmes used a comparable sales approach that took into account the properties' highest and best use to arrive at a \"total cumulative value for the diminution in property value\" of $81,300.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82, 85, 95, 97.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In response to Holmes's testimony, the defendants offered the testimony of Russel Rice (\"Rice\"), a real estate appraiser (Dkt.

Although Rice had reviewed Holmes's appraisal report, he \"did not complete a thorough and entire review of it,\" nor did he prepare a written review of the report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.

These criticisms may be well-taken, but they are insufficient to undermine Holmes's opinion for the purpose of fixing a discretionary bond in the event that a preliminary injunction issues. The bond is meant to \"cover[ ] the potential incidental and consequential costs as well as either the losses the unjustly enjoined or restrained party will suffer ... or the complainant's unjust enrichment caused by his adversary being improperly enjoined or restrained.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoechst Diafoil Co. v.

The MVP Project has a total budget of $3.7 billion, which includes a contingency of $180 million, and FERC has concluded that MVP is \"prepared to financially support the project\" (Dkt.

R. Civ. P. 71.1(j)(2) (Dkt. No. 115 at 8-9). That rule states that \"[t]he plaintiff must deposit with the court any money required by law as a condition to the exercise of eminent domain.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), on the other hand, requires as follows: \"The court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\" Unlike the exercise of the United States's \"quick-take\" powers, which requires a deposit under Rule 71.1, those with eminent domain authority under the NGA must simply post a bond when granted relief under Rule 65.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    UGI Sunbury LLC v.

Separation of Powers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Some defendants argue that granting a preliminary injunction violates the separation-of-powers doctrine. More specifically, because Congress could have granted \"quick-take\" authority under the NGA but chose not to, the defendants contend that the Court should not consider granting equivalent relief in the form of an injunction (Dkt. Nos. 69 at 10-13; 70 at 7). Although the defendants' argument finds support in other jurisdictions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.

Western Pocahontas Properties LP\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Western Pocahontas raises several arguments that merit separate attention, and to which the provision of Fed. R. Civ. P. 71.1(c)(3) is particularly relevant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   When the action commences, the plaintiff need join as defendants only those persons who have or claim an interest in the property and whose names are then known. But before any hearing on compensation, the plaintiff must add as defendants all those persons who have or claim an interest and whose names have become known or can be found by a reasonably diligent search of the records, considering both the property's character and value and the interests to be acquired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As Western Pocahontas concedes (Dkt. No. 107 at 67), MVP seeks to condemn only surface easements, and has repeatedly represented that it is not condemning the mineral estate (Dkt. No. 1 at 4-6). To that end, the complaint names Western Pocahontas with regard to only one surface parcel in the Northern District of West Virginia, identified as Tax Assessor Number 6-5F-1 (Dkt. No. 104-11). Western Pocahontas objects to MVP's proposed taking of its interest in this surface estate-the temporary use of an existing access road-and demands just compensation (Dkt. No. 107 at 64, 76-77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Notably, although Western Pocahontas does not own an interest in any other surface estate that is the subject of this condemnation action, it argues that it owns an interest in the coal beneath the Project, including those surface parcels identified in this case and owned by defendant Kincheloe Mitigation Holdings LLC (\"Kincheloe\"). According to Western Pocahontas, \"construction of the MVP pipeline will require trenching through near-surface coal owned by [Western Pocahontas], rendering mineable and merchantable coal unmineable\" (Dkt. No. 71 at 10). As Western Pocahontas has outlined, it provided detailed information to MVP regarding the \"location, ownership, and evaluations of coal affected by the pipeline.\" Representatives from Western Pocahontas and MVP conducted meetings at which they discussed the Project's effect on Western Pocahontas's coal. Western Pocahontas contends that, although MVP made offers regarding easements over its property, it never made an offer that \"include[d] any compensation for the coal or other mineral interests\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (Dkt. No. 71-4 at 4-5). It estimates that the MVP Project will dig, damage, or render unmineable $8,630,847 in coal royalty in the Northern District (Dkt. No. 71-4 at 3-6). Although the Court is troubled by Western Pocahontas's representations, two considerations convince it that these matters do not preclude the entry of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   First, the entirety of Western Pocahontas's mineral interests are not at issue in this action. It is clear that Western Pocahontas's claimed damages include coal it believes will be affected by the entire Project in the Northern District of West Virginia. To the extent that Western Pocahontas argues MVP will affect its interests related to properties not at issue in this case, its arguments are irrelevant. Neither this Court nor Western Pocahontas may dictate the property over which MVP exercises the power of eminent domain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 71.1 (providing procedures for property that the plaintiff wishes to procure). If work on the Project results in a compensable trespass on or taking of property not joined in this case, Western Pocahontas may avail itself of legal remedies as it sees fit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Second, Western Pocahontas will have the opportunity to assert its claims regarding the Kincheloe tracts during the just compensation phase of this proceeding. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h), MVP may only exercise the power of eminent domain if it \"cannot acquire by contract, or is unable to agree with the owner of property to the compensation to be paid for\" the easements. It is evident that the parties have significant disagreements concerning not only the amount of compensation due to Western Pocahontas, but also whether it is due any compensation at all with regard to the Kincheloe tracts.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC v.

Ohio 2010) (denying summary judgment where it was unclear that the parties had negotiated regarding leaseholds sought to be condemned).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Given that Western Pocahontas claims an interest in the easement sought over the Kincheloe property, it should be named as a defendant with regard to those tracts in advance of the hearing on compensation.

At that time, Western Pocahontas will have the opportunity to assert its interest and establish just compensation, and the Court will take its contentions into account with regard to setting an appropriate bond in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In a related argument, Western Pocahontas contends that MVP \"may not have joined\" all necessary property and owners because other mineral interests along the Project may also be affected (Dkt. No. 71 at 12-16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Western Pocahontas, however, has failed to identify a single party that should be joined in this action. The Court finds no support for the assertion that it can deny summary judgment based solely on speculation regarding parties that should be joined under Rule 71.1(c)(2)(E) and (c)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sabal Trail\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-173,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208900100\">\n    2016 WL 8900100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.

But the binding guidance in\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   is clear. The Fourth Circuit there dealt not only with missing the relevant FERC deadline (Dkt.

No. 1-2 at 108), but MVP plans to begin construction in February 2018 and place the pipeline in service by December 2018 (Dkt. No. 70-4 at 11). At the evidentiary hearing, MVP presented the testimony of Robert Joseph Cooper (\"Cooper\"), its Senior Vice President of Engineering and Construction, to establish irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Cooper testified that, during the course of MVP's multi-year effort to obtain FERC's permission to construct its pipeline, MVP entered into precedent agreements with shippers \"to show evidence of the demand for the service the pipeline would provide\" (Dkt. No. 105 at 87). FERC issued the final environmental impact statement (\"EIS\") regarding the Project on June 23, 2017 (Dkt. No. 1-2 at 52), after which MVP entered into its first master construction services agreement (\"MSA\") on July 6, 2017 (Dkt. No. 104-6 at 1). On October 10, 2017, prior to FERC's issuance of the Certificate, MVP made purchase orders under the MSA that encompassed several hundred miles of the Project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-132. FERC issued the Certificate on October 13, 2017, and on November 13 and November 22, 2017, MVP entered two additional MSAs and quickly made purchase orders covering the remaining 70 miles of the Project (Dkt. Nos. 1-2; 104-7; 104-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   When MVP commences construction, the Project will proceed in 11 distinct segments along the pipeline's length; three of those segments are located in the Northern District. After felling trees on properties used for service facilities and access roads, as well as those with endangered species, MVP's contractors will work in a \"linear\" fashion to excavate and install pipeline along each of the 11 segments (Dkt. Nos. 5-1 at 4-5; 105 at 100-01). If MVP is forced to break from this method of construction, it will face financial penalties from its contractors (Dkt. No. 105 at 101). MVP's construction schedule hinges on the fact that certain tree clearing must be complete by March 31, 2018, to comply with regulations of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service that protect the habitat of bats and migratory birds (Dkt. No. 5-1 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   If MVP does not complete the necessary tree clearing by that time, it will be unable to do so until November 15, 2018. MVP claims that delaying the entire Project until November 2018 will result in the loss of $40 to $50 million in revenue each month that the Project is not in service, up to $200 million in delay and cancellation fees, and $40 to $45 million in otherwise unnecessary administrative and carrying costs (Dtk. Nos. 70 at 11; 105 at 117-18). In addition, being forced to construct the pipeline during the winter months would increase costs and require additional environmental measures (Dkt. No. 105 at 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Even assuming that these economic harms can be characterized as irreparable, the defendants contend that they are not likely to occur (Dkt. No. 70 at 14). They argue, among other things, that 1) MVP's claim for lost revenue is actually only delayed revenue because its 20-year transportation agreement does not commence until service begins; 2) most revenue will come from affiliate companies, so there is no actual loss; 3) MVP can mitigate contractor penalties by directing work on other portions of the pipeline or invoking force majeure clauses; and 4) administrative carrying costs result from MVP's schedule or would be incurred to remain in business (Dkt. No. 70 at 14-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   These arguments relate only to the degree of irreparable economic harm; that MVP might be capable of mitigating its\n   unrecoverable losses does not render them irrelevant. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   , the pipeline company estimated that it would lose only \"$5 million if construction delay caused it to breach its contractual obligations to supply gas.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p818\">\n    361 F.3d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit found this harm to be irreparable when coupled with the reality that delayed construction would mean the pipeline's \"inability to satisfy [its] commitments\" and lead to \"negative impacts on ... customers and the consumers they serve.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p818\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, even a drastically lower amount of loss than estimated by MVP is irreparable in light of the effect that delayed construction would have on end users.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sabal Trail\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-173,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208900100\">\n    2016 WL 8900100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (finding $1,048,000 loss to be significant despite being \"such a small percentage of the overall project cost\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, the defendants argue that the Court should discount the urgency of MVP's request because it could still meet FERC's deadline if it commenced construction in November 2018 (Dkt. No. 117 at 2). In other words, the Court should narrowly analyze whether MVP needs access to their properties now or whether it still can meet FERC's deadline if granted access later. This argument fails to account for the fact that MVP will breach its contractual obligations if it does not commence construction in February 2018, and that MVP's decision to set such a schedule was entirely reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Of course, an injunction is usually inappropriate where the movant fails to show \"that [it] availed [itself] of opportunities to avoid the injuries of which [it] now complain[s],\"\n   <em>\n    Di Biase\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264221\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/224/#p230\">\n    872 F.3d at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and courts have declined to consider harms that are self-inflicted by the moving party.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake Tribune Publ'g Co., LLC v.

The process by which natural-gas companies obtain approval and construct under the NGA necessitates forethought and a degree of speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   For instance, MVP entered shipping contracts to demonstrate to FERC that there was a market demand for its Project (Dkt. No. 105 at 87), and it made the business decision to secure its primary contractor for the Project in advance of receiving FERC approval (Dkt. No. 104-6). It did so to ensure that necessary skilled workers and general contractors would be available to work on the Project, considering \"it likely that it would be difficult or perhaps impossible to get the workers\" if it delayed (Dkt. No. 105 at 110-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In fact, throughout the bidding process, MVP faced a smaller and more expensive pool of contractors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111-12. Undoubtedly, MVP decided to accept the risk that FERC would not approve its Project, but FERC did approve the Project, and MVP is appropriately prepared for construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In addition, other practical considerations underscore the wisdom of MVP's decision to issue purchase orders and prepare for construction. Especially given the likelihood of trials on just compensation, this litigation may not be complete well enough in advance of the FERC deadline. Testimony at the evidentiary hearing established that MVP can construct the Project in approximately 12 months. Given that the FERC Certificate requires MVP to complete the Project by October 2020 (Dkt. No. 1-2 at 108), and assuming there are no other delays, MVP must commence construction no later than the time the tree-clearing window opens in November 2019.

The fact that an injunction will deprive the defendants of their land now rather than later is not \"a type of an inherent harm that is irreparable,\" but rather is an ordinary burden of citizenship.\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p818\">\n    361 F.3d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At bottom, it is the NGA and the FERC Certificate that are responsible for the defendants' injuries, and delaying access until just compensation is paid will do nothing to alleviate those burdens.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p818\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"This is simply a timing argument ....\");\n   <em>\n    Columbia Gas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265451\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/300/#p316\">\n    768 F.3d at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Landowners have not stated any concrete injury other than the loss of the easements over their land, which will definitely occur, whether or not we grant Columbia immediate possession of the easements.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Nonetheless, in light of pending challenges to the Project, the defendants argue that the Court should not accelerate the harm that MVP will cause to their property. They point to the fact that the FERC Certificate was a 2-1 decision, which issued over the dissenting commissioner's opinion that the Project may not be in the public interest (Dkt. No. 1-2 at 137). Moreover, they represent that requests for rehearing and a stay are pending before FERC, which will remain subject to appeal by the adversely affected party (Dkt. No. 69 at 7-8). The defendants contend that, depending on the outcome of these proceedings, the Project may yet be delayed, modified, or nullified in its entirety. Given the remaining permits and approvals that MVP must obtain (Dkt. No. 1-2 at app. C), they speculate that the Project possibly may never commence or be completed (Dkt. No. 70 at 31-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The defendants advance these arguments, hoping to distinguish the instant case from the circumstances of\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   , where there was no indication that the Certificate at issue remained subject to challenge before FERC or a court of appeals.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p818\">\n    361 F.3d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even taking notice of this distinction, the Court is not persuaded by the defendants' arguments. As discussed, FERC did not condition MVP's exercise of eminent domain under the Certificate on its fulfillment of any environmental requirement, and it has not stayed the Certificate in light of pending requests for rehearing. Although the defendants contend that FERC's tolling orders are improper (Dkt. No. 70 at 38-40), they may not challenge those procedures in this Court, but must appeal to the circuit court. Both FERC and the court of appeals are fully aware that, so long as the Certificate remains in effect, MVP may seek equitable relief in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   With regard to the public interest, the defendants raise various concerns about the importance of their Fifth Amendment rights, environmental permits that have yet to be obtained, and the Project's effect on cultural interests (Dkt. No. 70 at 35-38). For the most part, these are matters upon which FERC has already passed judgement or that should be raised\n   before FERC, and the Court affords them little weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Western Pocahontas also argues that it and other parties, including the public at large, will be harmed by an injunction because MVP intends to trespass on mineral interests that it has not condemned (Dkt. No. 115 at 17-18, 23-24). Indeed, the Court is troubled by the suggestion that MVP's Project will affect such mineral interests. It would be impractical, however, to litigate mineral ownership issues along the entire Project to determine whether immediate access is in the public interest. Moreover, even if Western Pocahontas had presented evidence of other mineral owners, the balance of equities tips in MVP's favor here too: unlike the irreparable harm caused by delay, parties injured by trespass may pursue legal action against MVP.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Di Biase\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264221\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/224/#p230\">\n    872 F.3d at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasoning that economic harms are not irreparable if they can be recovered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   There simply is no reason to depart from the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Congress passed the Natural Gas Act and gave gas companies condemnation power to insure that consumers would have access to an adequate supply of natural gas at reasonable prices. As the district court observed, FERC conducted a careful analysis of the ... [p]roject and determined that the project will promote these congressional goals and serve the public interest. The project serves the public interest because, among other things, it will bring natural gas to portions of southwest Virginia for the first time. This will make gas available to consumers, and it will help in the efforts of local communities to attract much-needed new business. On a larger scale, the pipeline will make gas available for electric power generation plants. A delay in construction would postpone these benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p818\">\n    361 F.3d at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Here, FERC concluded that \"the public at large will benefit from increased reliability of natural gas supplies. Furthermore, upstream natural gas producers will benefit from the project by being able to access additional markets for their product\" (Dkt. No. 1-2 at 28). The Court will not second-guess FERC's determination that MVP's project will benefit the public need for natural gas as the defendants request (Dkt. No. 70 at 34-35); FERC possesses the expertise necessary to make that determination. There can be no dispute that delaying MVP's completion of the project will delay the introduction of the benefits identified by FERC. Moreover, expediting construction will also hasten the creation of approximately 6,000 temporary jobs and millions of dollars in yearly property taxes (Dkt. Nos. 105 at 110; 106 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In summary, the Court has carefully considered each of the four factors articulated in\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   , and has given them heightened scrutiny in light of MVP's request for a mandatory preliminary injunction. MVP has carried its burden to clearly establish that it will be irreparably harmed in the absence of a preliminary injunction, that this harm is not outweighed by those concerns identified by the defendants, and that granting immediate access is in the public interest. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   MVP's motion for immediate access\n   and possession of the easements at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     VII. CASH DEPOSIT AND BOND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Having determined that granting immediate access is appropriate in this case, the Court must determine the conditions under which such access should be granted, bearing in mind the necessity of giving adequate provision to the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Kincheloe Properties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   With regard to the Kincheloe properties, the Court will require MVP and Western Pocahontas to submit further information prior to permitting physical possession. As discussed, although not named as a defendant with regard to the Kincheloe properties, Western Pocahontas claims an interest in the easements and will be entitled to present evidence regarding just compensation. Western Pocahontas claims that the Project generally will deprive it of $8,630,847 in coal royalty in the Northern District, which apparently encompasses far more property than is at issue in this case, while MVP claims only that it is not condemning the rights to the coal estate. Neither of these arguments is sufficient to allow the Court to determine an appropriate security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Therefore, MVP and Western Pocahontas are each\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   to file supplemental briefs no later than 14 days following entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order. These briefs shall be limited to ten pages in length, and shall set forth the party's position regarding the value of the interest that Western Pocahontas claims in the easements over the Kincheloe properties at issue. The parties are expected to support their assignment of value with appropriate exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Remaining Properties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   As to the remaining properties, MVP may immediately access and possess the relevant easements after the following conditions have been satisfied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    1)\n   </strong>\n   Not later than seven (7) days after entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order, MVP shall submit a separate proposed order for each of the properties, granting MVP the immediate right of entry as to the easements in the complaint and the FERC Certificate and also containing any requirements set forth in the FERC Certificate that are unique to that parcel of land. The proposed orders need not contain general requirements applicable to all parcels. MVP shall serve a copy of each proposed order on counsel for the affected landowner(s) or on any affected\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the landowner objects to the order's form or content, the objection must be filed in writing with the Court not later than seven (7) days after service of the proposed order. If no objection is filed within that time, and the order is sufficient and proper, the Court may enter the order granting immediate possession without further notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    2)\n   </strong>\n   Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 65(c), 67, and 71.1(j)(l), the right to immediate possession of the easements on these properties is contingent upon MVP satisfying two requirements as to security. First, although the Court has concluded that a cash deposit is not required, abiding by the provisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 71.1(j) will assist in rendering adequate\n   provision to the defendants in this case. Therefore, MVP must deposit with the Clerk of Court (\"Clerk\") a certified check in an amount of three times the appraised amount for each of the easements sought.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    3)\n   </strong>\n   Second, MVP shall obtain and post a surety bond in the total amount of two times the appraised amount for the easements sought. The bond shall be conditioned on MVP's payment of any and all final compensation damages awarded in excess of the deposited amount, and if such payments are made, then the bond shall be null and void upon full payment having been made as to all of the properties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    4)\n   </strong>\n   Both the multiplier for the deposit and the bond take into account Rice's criticism of Holmes's appraisal report, particularly the fact that he found it unreliable and that the ultimate Yellow Book appraisal in this case will be more thorough. The total value is designed to serve as sufficient security to protect the interests of the landowners in the event any just compensation awarded for one or more of the easements exceeds the appraised amount for such property or properties. The multiplied value, the bond amount, or the two combined, shall not be construed as any indication of the floor or ceiling of the ultimate amount of just compensation, if any, to which any interest-holder is entitled. Instead, the eventual compensation award by this Court, a jury, or a compensation commission may be lower, higher, or the same as the amount MVP is required to provide as security.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    5)\n   </strong>\n   MVP shall remit the deposit amounts to the Clerk for deposit into the registry of this Court. The Clerk shall deposit the amounts received into the registry of this Court and then, as soon as the business of the Clerk's office allows, the Clerk shall deposit these funds into the interest-bearing Court Registry Investment System administered by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts as Custodian, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 67.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    6)\n   </strong>\n   MVP shall also file, at the time it remits any deposit or deposit(s), a chart broken down by easement that identifies: (i) each appraised property for which funds are being deposited; (ii) the corresponding MVP parcel numbers; (iii) the corresponding paragraph numbers in the amended complaint; (iv) the amount of the deposit for that specific property (which will be three times the appraised amount); (vi) the amount of the bond that relates to that specific property (which will be two times the appraised amount); and (vii) all persons or entities who own an interest in the property and the percentage of each person's interest. The information shall also be emailed to the Court in an Excel spreadsheet format. If any party disputes the accuracy of any information in the chart, he shall file an objection not later than seven days after service of the chart. Additionally, all parties-including MVP and any defendants who have an interest\n   in any of the deposited funds-have a continuing duty, until the conclusion of all proceedings, to advise the Court if the information in any filed chart changes. This includes, in particular, a duty to advise the Court if there is any change for any parcel in the number of owners or the percentages of their ownership interests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    7)\n   </strong>\n   Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 71.1(j)(2), the deposit of any funds for an identified defendant's property shall constitute MVP's agreement that the interest-holder can access up to the base amount of the appraisal or one-third of the deposited amount, whichever is greater. Such withdrawal is at the landowner's peril, and all defendants are advised that, if the ultimate compensation award is less than the amount withdrawn, the interest-holder will be liable for the return of the excess with appropriate interest. If multiple defendants claim an interest in any of the easements, each defendant claiming an interest can withdraw only its proportionate share of the funds identified for that easement and attributable to its claimed interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    8)\n   </strong>\n   Each of the defendants shall be entitled to draw from one-third of the funds deposited by MVP with the Clerk its ownership share of the amount of estimated just compensation deposited by MVP for the easement which burdens lands in which such defendant owns or claims an interest, subject to the warnings above, and provided that each such defendant satisfies all conditions of this Memorandum Opinion and Order and any other direction of the Court. Furthermore, such defendants shall be entitled to interest calculated pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   from and after the date of entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order on the difference between the principal amount deposited with the Court by MVP and the amount of just compensation determined by the Court, if any, if such determination of just compensation to be paid exceeds the amount deposited by MVP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    9)\n   </strong>\n   A defendant who wishes to draw on the deposited funds shall file a motion for disbursement of funds with the Court and shall include a certificate of service evidencing service of the motion on all other persons with a property interest in the same parcel or easement, if any. Any person objecting to the disbursement shall have fourteen days to file a written objection with the court. The Court will then resolve any objections and issue an order on the withdrawal request. If there are no other persons with an interest in the property, disbursement will be permitted only by a separate order of the Court, but the period for objections will not apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     VII.

Nos. 23-1 at 18; 50 at 8; 51 at 8; 52 at 8; 53 at 8). Despite the opportunity to do so at the evidentiary hearing, the defendants have not presented any evidence in support of these broad allegations of MVP's bad-faith negotiations. In any event, the Court notes that disagreement concerning the value of an easement does not amount to bad faith. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h) (granting right of eminent domain if Certificate holder \"is unable to agree with the owner of property to the compensation\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Holmes acknowledged that he used the USPAP to arrive at an estimated value for the simple purpose of setting a bond.

This decision likely resulted from their position that setting an appropriate bond is a component of MVP's burden regarding adequate provision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v.
