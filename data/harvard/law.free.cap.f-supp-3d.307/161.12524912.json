For the foregoing reasons, Defendant O'Reilly's Motion to Seal is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 21, 2017, Plaintiffs Rachel Witlieb Bernstein, Andrea Mackris, and Rebecca Gomez Diamond filed an Amended Complaint against Defendants Bill O'Reilly and Fox News Network LLC, alleging claims for defamation, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and tortious interference. (Am. Compl, dkt. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The day before a responsive pleading was due, Defendant O'Reilly informed the Court that he would move to dismiss the Complaint and/or Compel Arbitration the following day. He also sought an Order from this Court directing certain Settlement, Mutual Release, and Arbitration Agreements (\"Agreements\") made between him and Diamond and Mackris to be filed in redacted form and under seal. (Def. O'Reilly's Letter of March 19, 2018, dkt. 35). Plaintiffs opposed on March 20, 2018. (Dkt. 39). Defendant Fox News indicated it took no position on the sealing on March 22, 2018. (Dkt. 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 20, 2018, Defendant O'Reilly filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint and/or Compel Arbitration. (O'Reilly Mot. Dismiss, dkt. 43). Mr. O'Reilly invoked the Agreements in his Motion, and attached only selected portions of the Agreements on the public docket. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibits to Bourne Decl. in support of Mot. Dismiss, dkt. 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 22, 2018, Plaintiffs indicated they too would \"quote from various portions of the Settlement Agreements\" in opposing the Motion to Dismiss and/or Compel Arbitration, and sought guidance from the Court because they intended submit the entire, unredacted Agreements in connection with their Opposition. (Pls.' letter of March 22, 2018, dkt. 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 26, 2018, the Court ordered Defendant O'Reilly to produce the entire, unreacted Agreements to the Court for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review in order to determine the propriety of sealing the documents. (Order of March 26, 2018, dkt. 49).

A Common Law presumption of access applies to the agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   B. First Amendment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because the Court has held that Defendant O'Reilly is not entitled to seal the Agreements under the less stringent Common Law standard, it need not also determine whether the Agreements are subject to a First Amendment presumption, which the Second Circuit has characterized as \"more stringent.\"\n   <em>\n    Lugosch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936330\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/110/#p119\">\n    435 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   124 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lytle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177515\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/810/616/#p620\">\n    810 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   621 n.5 (\"Because I conclude that the common law right of access mandates disclosure, ... I need not determine whether they are also subject to a First Amendment presumption of access, which the Second Circuit has characterized as 'more stringent' than the common law.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court notes briefly that a First Amendment right of access would attach to the Agreements in question as well. Just as with the Common Law right, the First Amendment protects access to judicial documents if the documents \"are necessary to understand the merits\" of the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Newsday LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703058\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/156/#p163\">\n    730 F.3d at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As articulated,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that a complete reading of the Agreements is necessary for the very adjudication O'Reilly seeks: compelling arbitration and/or dismissing the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, the First Amendment presumption may be overcome only if the moving Party makes \"specific, on the record findings ... demonstrating that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Lugosch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936330\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/110/#p119\">\n    435 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   120 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Press-Enter.

O'Reilly only refers to generalized \"privacy interests,\" \"embarrassing conduct\" and the overarching policy goals of maintaining confidentiality in private agreements. (Def. O'Reilly's Letter of March 27, 2018 at 2). He does not articulate what privacy interests he holds, or how redactions or sealing would be narrowly tailored to achieve those interests. Thus, in addition to a Common Law presumption, the Agreements are also entitled to a First Amendment presumption of access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   C. Partial Redaction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court also declines Defendant O'Reilly's request for partial redactions (and partial disclosure) of the Agreements. Partial redaction is not a \"viable remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Amodeo II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415715\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/1044/#p1048\">\n    71 F.3d at 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Agreements each have multiple, interlocking and cross-referencing sections. They also contain integration clauses which explicitly state that the Agreement \"constitutes and contains the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties concerning the subject matters addressed herein.\" (Diamond Agreement \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mackris Agreement \u00b6 10). Defendant O'Reilly may not now seek to extricate certain portions of an agreement that is fully integrated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, O'Reilly makes arguments in his Motion to Dismiss that require a full consideration of the entire agreement. For example, he argues in his Motion to Dismiss: \"Plaintiffs now shamelessly disclaim their express agreements to arbitrate, as well as their express promises of confidentiality, while keeping the money they received in consideration.\" (O'Reilly Mot. to Dismiss at 1). In order to evaluate that claim, the Court would need to review and analyze the Agreement as a whole and the interlocking portions to which O'Reilly refers; thereafter, the public should be able to see what the Court relied on in issuing its Opinion. The public would have no way to make sense of the Court's analysis testing this claim with only partial or limited access to the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendant O'Reilly's Motion to Seal the Mackris and Diamond Settlement and Arbitration Agreements filed in connection with his Motion to Compel Arbitration and/or Dismiss the Complaint is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    As to the weight of the presumption given to such summary judgment filings, the Circuit has emphasized \"that the presumption is of the highest: 'documents used by parties moving for, or opposing, summary judgment should not remain under seal absent the most compelling reasons.' \"\n    <em>\n     Lugosch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936330\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/110/#p119\">\n     435 F.3d at 123\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Joy v.
