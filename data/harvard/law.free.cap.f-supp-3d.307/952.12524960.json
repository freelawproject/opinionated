TUNHEIM, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This sprawling case is about defamation: a test prep company has sued a nursing discussion forum and five of its users for their mildly disparaging remarks about the company's offerings. Plaintiffs are East Coast Test Prep LLC, doing business as Achieve Test Prep, and its president Mark Olynyk (collectively, \"ATP\"). Defendants are Allnurses.com and David Smits (administrator of the estate of company founder Brian Short) (collectively, \"Allnurses\") and users Lisa Dukes and Uhura Russ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   ATP claims that \"Allnurses secretly schemed to have false statements posted about ATP, using ATP's trademark, thereby attracting potential ATP customers to the site, only to be scared away from using ATP, and being driven to ATP's competitors.\" (Mem. Opp. Renewed Mot. J. Pleadings\n   (\"Opp. J. Pleadings\") at 2, July 24, 2017, Docket No. 387.) ATP alleges few specific facts in support of these allegations, and despite two years of trying it has discovered virtually no evidence that they are true. As such, its case quickly deflates into a routine defamation action-one in which most of the statements at issue are not defamatory, and in which the website enjoys immunity against defamation claims related to third-party content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Two motions are now before the Court. The first is a motion to dismiss brought by one of the users, Lisa Dukes. (Dukes Mot. to Dismiss, June 28, 2017, Docket No. 357.) The second is a renewed motion for judgment on the pleadings brought by Allnurses. (Renewed Mot. J. Pleadings, June 28, 2017, Docket No. 363.) Because the majority of ATP's claims against Dukes and Allnurses are not plausibly alleged and there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to the others, the Court will grant both motions, converting them to motions for summary judgment as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff East Coast Test Prep LLC is a New Jersey corporation doing business as Achieve Test Prep. (Third Am. Compl. (\"Compl.\") at 1, Jan. 24, 2017, Docket No. 268.) Plaintiff Mark Olynyk owns East Coast Test Prep and lives in New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Allnurses.com, Inc., is a Minnesota corporation operating the website http://www.allnurses.com, which describes itself as \"the collective voice of the nursing community.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 39.) Brian Short was the founder, administrator, and president of Allnurses until his death on September 10, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-7.) Defendant David R. Smits is the administrator of Brian Short's estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Lisa Dukes was a \"Senior Moderator\" of the Allnurses.com forums during the time period at issue and remains an active user under the name Pixie.RN. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 112.) She has posted an average of 111 times per month during her nearly ten years on the forum and authored 32 articles on the Allnurses site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 157-60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Allnurses operates discussion forums where registered users can post comments and \"Like\" other users' comments. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-45, 152.) The registration page states that signing up \"implies full acceptance with our Terms of Service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88). The site's terms of service (\"TOS\") state, among other things, that Allnurses will \"promote the idea of lively debate,\" but that users \"are not allowed to post libelous information,\" that \"[n]o potentially libelous information about specific schools, instructors, or health care facilities/entities should be posted in these forums,\" and that \"[a]ny post which is violative of any law ... will be taken down immediately.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88, 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At issue is a discussion thread in the \"Excelsior College Online Nursing\" forum, titled \"Achieve Test prep.... anyone?\" (\"the Thread\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.) The Thread, which contains an extended discussion about the merits of ATP's services for Excelsior College students, was created in February 2013; by March 2015 it had 33,875 views and 88 comments, and by October 2016 it had 81,964 views. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Comments\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by users Pixie.RN, JustBeachyNurse, monkeyhq, duskyjewel, and\n   LadyFree28 are the primary subject of this case. These comments fall into three categories: first, that Excelsior College \"warns\" students about third-party test prep companies; second, that third-party test prep services, including ATP's, are or will be \"redundant\" or \"obsolete\"; and third, that ATP was or is under federal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ATP alleges that all five users were compensated by Allnurses for their participation on the forum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59, 254-55.) It alleges that Dukes, as Senior Moderator Pixie.RN, was \"in charge\" of the Thread. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114-15.) The only specific fact it alleges as to the other four users is their high posting frequency. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 237-46, 251-53). ATP does point to a TOS provision stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Allnurses] may, from time to time, request that you and others submit articles or other Content for publication ... as part of contests or other requests that provide payment to you or give you the chance to be paid, give you recognition or allow you to receive other benefits of publicity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 99, Ex. A at 47, Docket No. 268-2.) But the remainder of the provision is focused on ensuring that Allnurses, not the user, retains rights in such content. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, ATP alleges that duskyjewel and monkeyhq were \"insiders\" that had a \"special relationship\" with Allnurses. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 249-50.) It offers no specific facts in support of this allegation other than that two users quit posting after ATP sent Allnurses a demand letter describing their posts as defamatory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 245-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Warns\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Thread was started on February 12, 2013, by a user soliciting opinions about ATP. (Compl. \u00b6 65, Ex. G at 1.) JustBeachyNurse was the first to reply, comparing ATP favorably to competitors but warning of its high cost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On the same day the Thread was posted, Dukes (as Pixie.RN) posted: \"EC\n   <strong>\n    warns\n   </strong>\n   students about third-party publishers and test prep companies-they are not affiliated with EC, nor does EC endorse their use (http://www.excelsior.edu/about-test-...ationservices).\" (Compl. \u00b6 183 (emphasis added).)

It was five months until the next post, and more than two months until the next post after that. (Compl. \u00b6 65, Ex. G at 4-5.) The latter was favorable to ATP, sparking a week-long discussion about the merits and costs of test prep companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7.) After another lull, conversation resumed in a similar vein the following February. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After the February exchange, there were no posts in the Thread until August 22, 2014, when user hardworkingrn2 revived it to extoll the virtues of ATP:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ATP's classes provide the structure and visual learning that so many people need to be successful.

User monkeyhq \"Liked\" this comment and referenced it in a follow-up, writing that \"Test Prep companies for Excelsior Exams will be\n   <strong>\n    obsolete\n   </strong>\n   by July 1, 2015 ... it is a total waste of your investment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 132, 135-36 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Dukes, as Pixie.RN, \"Liked\" monkeyhq's comment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132.) ATP alleges that a \"Like\" by Senior Moderator Pixie.RN \"is tantamount to an endorsement or certification ... on behalf of Allnurses (which holds itself out as fair and impartial), that what is stated in the post is factually correct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167.) As such, ATP alleges, \"Liking\" monkeyhq's post \"in effect ratified, restated and republished the statements\" therein, and the action \"would be interpreted by a reasonable person with ordinary intelligence as Pixie.RN and Allnurses endorsing, approving, and vouching for the truthfulness of the statements contained in the post.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 169, 174.) ATP concedes that \"only one word was posted\" but alleges that it represents \"her unqualified agreement and approval\" of the monkeyhqpost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 173.) It even alleges that the \"Like\" also represents \"implied endorsement and approval\" of the JustBeachyNurse post referenced in the monkeyhq post. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 175-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The next post was made on September 4, 2014, by user GRN77, who stated that \"Test prep will no longer be available for Nursing classes but will continue to still be available for all Gen eds.\" (Compl. \u00b6 65, Ex. G at 13.) GRN77 was an ATP employee. (Compl. \u00b6 95.) Other posts show that ATP was ending enrollment in nursing classes for new students in response to a change in Excelsior College policy. (Compl. \u00b6 65, Ex. G at 14-18.) ATP levies no allegations as to those statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C. \"Investigation\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On September 11, one week after GRN77's post, she\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   reached out to Allnurses to inquire as to whether she could participate in the Thread. (Compl. \u00b6 265.) An administrator replied the next day, informing her that participation was \"perfectly acceptable ... as long as it stays within Terms of Service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 266.) ATP president and owner Mark Olynyk had also registered an Allnurses account, using the username learning-is-good. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). His first post in the Thread was on September 11, and it sparked a two-day debate that comprises more than half of the Thread's discussion. (Compl. \u00b6 65, Ex. G at 19-40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As part of that back-and-forth debate, LadyFree28 responded to a series of posts about a competing test prep company that was under federal investigation, quoting a post by learning-is-good and responding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   But the discussion is about THIS particular test-prep program that IS being investigated by the federal government and is under a current lawsuit; there are too many forums that have stated the Achieve \"deceived\" them with their practices, that is the MAIN focus of this discussion, NOT \"other test prep companies.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 187.) The next post was by duskyjewel, quoting a post by learning-is-good and responding: \"Sounds like you should be scared. TCN + Achieve equals more than one [company under federal investigation].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 198.) No defendants dispute that the statements about ATP being under federal investigation were incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On September 16, the Thread was closed to new comments. (Compl. \u00b6 270.) An administrator told learning-is-good in a private message that it had been closed because \"There was a lot of misleading information and instead of trying to clarify, it was just a circular discussion. The thread had multiple reports by members including reports of personal confrontation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 274.) Another ATP employee (under the username onesmallchange) attempted to post comments about ATP on another thread, which were deleted, and the user was eventually banned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 276-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Other Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ATP alleges \"upon information and belief\" but without factual support that users were paid to post by Allnurses, its management, and/or the ABC Company defendants-impliedly Allnurses advertisers, including Excelsior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 237-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, ATP alleges that an \"Open Letter\" Allnurses published to its website on September 12, 2016, is defamatory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 351, 391.) The Open Letter called this action \"meritless litigation\" and stated that ATP \"has demanded that Allnurses turn over any personally identifying information in its possession regarding the users named in the Complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 354, 357.) ATP alleges that the letter did not \"fully, fairly and accurately\" describe the case, argues that its litigation is not meritless, and insists that it sought only particular, not \"any,\" identifying information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 356, 359, 363-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   ATP filed this action in New Jersey state court in November 2014, alleging defamation, false light, and tortious interference with prospective economic relations under New Jersey state law, and soon thereafter added libel, breach of contract, consumer fraud, and trademark claims. (Notice of Removal \u00b6\u00b6 1-4, May 7, 2015, Docket No. 1.) Allnurses removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey based on the Lanham Act trademark claim, and filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 1; Allnurses' Mot. to Dismiss at 1-2, June 4, 2015, Docket No. 18.) The New Jersey District Court agreed that it lacked jurisdiction, but transferred the case instead of dismissing it. (Order at 4, 6-9, Aug. 28, 2015, Docket No. 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   ATP commenced discovery upon arrival in Minnesota. (Mot. to Compel, Oct. 23, 2015, Docket No. 56.) Soon thereafter, Allnurses filed a second motion to dismiss, this time asserting that ATP failed to state a claim. (Allnurses' 2d Mot. to Dismiss at 2, Jan. 25, 2016, Docket No. 98.) Because that motion to dismiss was Allnurses' second, and successive Rule 12(b) motions to dismiss are not permitted except to raise a subject matter jurisdiction defense, the Court denied it.\n   <em>\n    E. Coast Test Prep LLC v. Allnurses.com, Inc.(Sept. 2016 Order)\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-3705,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205109137\">\n    2016 WL 5109137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D. Minn. Sept. 19, 2016). Noting that strict adherence to the rule \"may appear to be nothing more than annoyance\" but was nonetheless mandatory, the Court welcomed Allnurses to file a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings when the pleadings closed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2, *4. With discovery well underway and the matter robustly briefed, the Court anticipated that \"no additional briefing [would be] necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The next month, Allnurses filed its Answer and Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. (Ans., Oct. 3, 2016, Docket No. 185; Mot. J. Pleadings, Oct. 4, 2016, Docket No. 186.) The motion was denied because ATP had not yet served the Doe Defendants, nor had they filed answers; as such, the pleadings (though running concurrently with discovery) were not closed.\n   <em>\n    E. Coast Test Prep LLC v. Allnurses.com, Inc.(Dec. 2016 Order)\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-3705,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207383309\">\n    2016 WL 7383309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Minn. Dec. 20, 2016). On January 24, ATP filed the Third Amended Complaint. (Compl.) ATP also filed a series of motions to compel discovery related to the John Doe users, and litigation over those motions ran into 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Compel, Sept. 8, 2016, Docket No. 167; Mot. to Compel, Sept. 12, 2016, Docket No. 172; Mot. to Compel, Feb. 16, 2017, Docket No. 295.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In July 2017, the Magistrate Judge determined that a renewed motion for judgment on the pleadings was timely because no other defendants would be identified or served. (Order Setting Deadlines at 2, July 7, 2017, Docket No. 347.) Jennifer Moeller (duskyjewel), Lisa Dukes (Pixie.RN), and Uhura Russ (LadyFree28) filed motions to dismiss, and Allnurses filed a renewed motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Moeller Mot. to Dismiss, June 26, 2017, Docket No. 350; Dukes Mot. to Dismiss, June 28, 2017, Docket No. 357; Russ Mot. to Dismiss, July 2, 2017, Docket No. 369; Renewed Mot. J. Pleadings, June 28, 2017, Docket No. 363.) The Court granted Moeller's motion, finding that it lacks personal jurisdiction over her. (Order, Sept. 15, 2017, Docket No. 414.) The Magistrate Judge issued, and the Court adopted, a\n   Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\") that Russ's motion be denied. (R&amp;R at 5, 8, Nov. 27, 2017, Docket No. 418; Order, Dec. 18, 2017, Docket No. 420.) Dukes's and Allnurses' motions are now before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   ATP's allegations may be broken down into five categories: defamation, contract, fraud, trademark, and nonactionable claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, there are the core Defamation claims (Count 1 against the Doe users and Count 2 against Dukes and Allnurses). The Trade Libel claim (Count 3) relies on these defamation claims. The Court will grant Dukes's motion as to these claims, converting it to one for summary judgment as necessary, because her \"warns\" statement and \"Like\" were nondefamatory.

ATP does not provide any context, such as how frequently the average Allnurses user posts or whether other websites compensate megaposters. Nor does ATP allege that Allnurses solicited or published articles from the users or that it compensated them for such articles. These allegations stand in contrast to those against Dukes, a Senior Moderator who wrote 32 articles published on the main website. \"Where a complaint pleads facts that are 'merely consistent with' a defendant's liability, it 'stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility.' \"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , 550 U.S. at 557,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

The Complaint makes the conclusory assertion that the statement is false but gives no supporting facts. (Compl. \u00b6 184.)

ATP complains that the letter did not \"fully, fairly and accurately\" describe the lawsuit or ATP's positions in it, argues that its litigation is not meritless, and says that it sought only particular, not \"any,\" personally identifying information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   First, ATP's bare allegation that the letter did not \"fully, fairly and accurately\" describe the lawsuit does not state a claim; it is based solely on the fact that the letter said that the case was about \"certain comments\" that were \"defamatory\" even though ATP brought additional claims. The Court also describes this case as a \"defamation action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    May 2017 Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202242851\">\n    2017 WL 2242851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 ;\n   <em>\n    Dec. 2016 Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207383309\">\n    2016 WL 7383309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.

This allegation does not even cross the line from risible to possible, let alone plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Second, ATP's allegation about the \"meritless litigation\" statement does not state a claim; it is based solely on ATP's\n   opinion that its lawsuit has merit. In allowing ATP to amend its Complaint the Court noted that \"ATP provides no caselaw allowing a defamation claim based on a statement as to the quality of a legal case.\"\n   <em>\n    May 2017 Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202242851\">\n    2017 WL 2242851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.

Allnurses points to two ATP discovery requests to support the truth of its statement. In a December 2015 request for production, ATP sought \"\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   and all documents that contain\n   <strong>\n    identification information\n   </strong>\n   of\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   and all of the Posters, including information as to true name, location (including\n   <strong>\n    without limitation\n   </strong>\n   , residence, work or employer, contact information (including\n   <strong>\n    without limitation\n   </strong>\n   , address, phone, fax, e-mail).\" (Decl. of Richard L. Ravin (\"Ravin Decl.\") \u00b6 6, Ex. C-1 at 6 \u00b6 3, Sept. 2, 2016, Docket No. 161 (emphases added).) Second, in an April 2016 interrogatory, ATP asked Allnurses to identify and attach \"\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   documents [sic] that\n   <strong>\n    identifies\n   </strong>\n   said person or\n   <strong>\n    contains identification information\n   </strong>\n   pertaining to said person.\" (Ravin Decl. \u00b6 2, Ex. A-1 at 9 \u00b6 1 (emphases added).) These court documents are necessarily embraced by the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    Levy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778721\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/477/988/#p991\">\n    477 F.3d at 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The only factual allegation that ATP makes in support of its claim that it did not seek \"any\" information is that it \"did not make discovery demands for Social Security Numbers, Driver's License numbers, credit card and bank account numbers\" or the like. (Compl. \u00b6 366.) This phrasing echoes ATP's previous objections to use of the phrase \"personally identifying information\" in a legal notice to Allnurses users, which ATP said was \"misleadingly similar to a common phrase 'personally identifiable information' ... which has the meaning of sensitive personal information such as Social Security Numbers, credit card accounts, bank accounts, financial information, etc.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter to Magistrate Judge at 2, June 6, 2016, Docket No. 146 (\"At this stage, Plaintiffs are not seeking sensitive PII.\").) Despite this superficial similarity, the Open Letter stressed \"the ability of our members to post anonymously\" and \"engage in protected anonymous speech.\" (Compl., Ex. H at 1.) This focus on protecting anonymous speech is reflected in the fact that Allnurses does not require users to register using their real names. (Compl. \u00b6 87) Given that ATP has never alleged that Allnurses collected or possessed information of this nature, it is implausible to claim that a reasonable user would believe that ATP was seeking such data, or even that their privacy would be imperiled if it did. ATP's attempt to redefine \"personally identifiable information\" to refer to financial data is even more unavailing in light of the fact that the Court earlier found that \"an IP address alone is personally identifiable information\" because it, a physical address, and a phone number are \"all modern day hallmarks of how a person may be identified.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <em>\n    E.

It alleges the bald legal conclusion that the TOS is a binding agreement between Allnurses and its members, but offers no factual allegations of offer, acceptance, or consideration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 86-91.) What few facts it does allege cut in the opposite direction. For instance, it alleges that \"Allnurses does not require that registrants use his, her or its real or legal name.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87) And, while it alleges that registration requires users to \"check a box that states 'I'm not a robot,' \" it does not allege, and the record does not show, that users must check a box accepting the statement \"Your participation implies full acceptance with our Terms of Service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86, 88). As such, ATP's allegation that the TOS is \"a binding agreement\" is implausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   ATP also alleges that it is an intended beneficiary of the TOS because the TOS states that users are not to post libelous information and it is a party that has been libeled, further submitting that \"ATP is an entity intended to benefit under the TOS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 431, 435.) But by this logic, the entire world is an intended beneficiary of the TOS. That cannot be right.

It further alleges that, were it not for these assurances, learning-is-good and GRN77 would not have posted in the thread. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 343.) However, the only communication ATP alleges between Olynyk and Allnurses is about why the thread was closed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 271-74.) ATP does allege that an Allnurses administrator told an ATP employee (GRN77) that it \"is perfectly acceptable\" to \"offer[ ] clarification\" and \"try[ ] to get the correct information posted as long as it stays within Terms of Service.\" (Compl. \u00b6 265-66.) But even if that statement is incorporated into the promissory estoppel claim, it adds nothing beyond the alleged promises in the TOS. And most notably, both Olynyk (as learning-is-good) and his employee (as GRN77) posted in the thread before the administrator's message. (Compl. \u00b6 65, Ex. G at 13, 19.) ATP's claim that the two users only posted in the Thread in reliance on those statements (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 343, 459, 462) is thus facially false-and borderline sanctionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3), 11(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Because the assurances to Olynyk's employee are not incorporated in its promissory estoppel claim, the only relevant statements are those contained in the TOS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   ATP's assertion that Allnurses \"made a clear and definite promises [sic] in the TOS\" is a legal conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 455.) Its factual allegations are incorporated by reference: ATP points to statements in the TOS that Allnurses will \"promote the idea of lively debate,\" that users \"will enjoy a great deal of freedom here ... as long as you remain civil and polite to each other,\" and that \"[a]ny post which is violative of any law or is invasive of a person's privacy will be taken down immediately.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.)

Others restate the contract claims with regard to statements in the TOS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But the majority regard supposed material omissions by Dukes and Allnurses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 470-72.) One allegation is that Allnurses had a duty to disclose, and failed to disclose \"any relationship or connections between Excelsior College and other colleges,\n   on the one side, and Pixie.RN or other persons working for Allnurses, or Allnurses itself, on the other side.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 473.) Another is that the Doe defendants were compensated by Allnurses or its sponsors, had a duty to disclose that relationship, and failed to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 476, 480-81.) The consumer fraud counts specifically allege that Allnurses used the discussion boards \"to advance the interests of its paying advertisers and sponsors\" over those of ATP without disclosing those relationships, thereby misleading consumers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 501, 518.) Taken at face value, these allegations would be troubling.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-64, 536, 543-44.) It further alleges that the Thread's \"metadata\" included the phrase \"achieve-test-prep,\" generating consumer confusion by helping the thread appear higher in the results of a user search for \"Achieve Test Prep.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 538-40.) Finally, it alleges unfair competition and false advertising because of the underlying allegedly defamatory statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 541-42, 552-56, 561-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   ATP's trademark claims all rely on two legal conclusions: first, that \"ATP has a valid and legally protectable trademark in 'Achieve Test Prep',\" and second, that \"ATP is the owner of the mark 'Achieve Test Prep' for use in commerce in connection with providing test preparation services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 531-32.) ATP does not allege that \"Achieve Test Prep\" is a registered trademark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does it allege that the mark is inherently distinctive or that it has acquired secondary meaning in the marketplace, as required for descriptive marks to acquire distinctiveness.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Co-Rect Prods., Inc. v.

NONACTIONABLE CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The parties agree that the claim for non-applicability of the Communications Decency Act (Count 4) is not an affirmative claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. J. Pleadings at 50 n.17.) As such, the Court will dismiss it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The parties dispute three counts that are more properly styled as alternative theories of liability: vicarious liability against Allnurses (Count 15), and contributory, vicarious, or inducement liability (Count 16) and acting in concert liability (Count 17) against Allnurses, Dukes, and the ABC Company Defendants. Because these claims are not independently actionable and the Court will dismiss all other claims against these defendants, the Court will dismiss these claims as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Finally, ATP brings a claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage (Count 14) against Allnurses and Dukes. That claim requires underlying wrongdoing in both Minnesota and New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gieseke ex rel. Diversified Water Diversion, Inc. v.

Because the Court will dismiss all other claims against these defendants, the Court will dismiss this claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   With regard to Dukes, the Court finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact that her \"warns\" statement was not defamatory because it was true, that the allegations about her \"Like\" of nondefamatory material do not make out a plausible claim of defamation, that the trade libel claim against her must fail in the absence of a false statement, and that the fraud and misrepresentation claims against her are supported neither by specific factual allegations nor evidence in the record. As such, the Court will grant her Motion to Dismiss with regard to all claims against her, converting it a Motion for Summary Judgment as necessary to dismiss all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   With regard to Allnurses, the Court finds that the Communications Decency Act renders it immune from claims against it for content produced by third parties. It further finds that ATP has failed to allege sufficient facts to support plausible claims with regard to the Open Letter, the contract claims, the fraud and misrepresentation claims, and the trademark claims. And it finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact supporting the fraud and misrepresentation claims or the claim that the Open Letter is defamatory. As such, the Court grants its Renewed Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings with regard to all claims against it, converting it to a Motion for Summary Judgment as necessary to dismiss all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Court will further dismiss\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   the nonactionable claims against all defendants and all claims against the John Doe and ABC Company defendants. The Court notes that the only claims that will remain are Counts 1, 3, and 14 against Defendant Uhura Russ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   1.
