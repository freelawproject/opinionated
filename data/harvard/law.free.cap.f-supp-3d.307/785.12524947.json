She can stand and walk a combined total of four hours during an eight-hour workday. Postural activities (i.e., climbing stairs and ramps, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, crawling) can be done no more than occasionally. The claimant cannot climb ladders, ropes or scaffolds. She should not be exposed to hazards (e.g., unprotected heights or moving machinery). The claimant is limited to performing simple repetitive tasks; low stress work (i.e., no fixed production quotas or fast pace and only routine work with few changes in work setting).

In fact, Plaintiff's treatment records reflect that, upon examination, she consistently appeared tired, depressed, anxious, and sometimes dysthymic, worried and withdrawn.

Insofar as the ALJ may be referencing Plaintiff's daily activities as described by Drs.

PageID 998. In weighing Dr. Thompson's opinion, ALJ Motta found that such opinion could not \"be given controlling or deferential weight.\" PageID 1041. In that regard, the ALJ found Dr. Thompson's \"conclusions are\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   unsupported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and have \"\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   logical medically determinable basis in the medical record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551461\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/365/#p377\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Contrary to the ALJ's conclusion, however, there are numerous clinical and imaging findings of record that lend support to Dr. Thompson's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PageID 457, 479, 493, 516, 613, 618, 628, 642 (noting \"[m]arked tenderness in the right lumbar parapinal area, moderate tenderness in the lumbar facet joints, moderate tenderness in the right S1 joint ...

Thus, the ALJ's conclusion-that Dr. Thompson's opinion is \"\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   \" unsupported by clinical and objective findings, and has \"\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   logical medically determinable basis in the medical record\"-is unsupported by substantial evidence. PageID 1041 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court also notes that, in rejecting Dr. Thompson's opinion, the ALJ instead gave \"significant weight\" to the opinions of four non-examining, record-reviewing physicians: (1) Eli Perencevich, D.O., who offered an assessment on August 21, 2007; (2) Gerald Klyop, M.D., who offered an assessment on August 11, 2009; (3) Diane Manos, M.D., who offered an opinion on June 2, 2010; and (4) Leon Hughes, M.D., who offered an assessment on October 28, 2010. PageID 409-16, 447-54, 805-12, 888, 1040. In giving these opinions \"substantial weight,\" the ALJ found that these opinions are \"not inconsistent with any compelling evidence in the case record and are found to represent a credible estimation of the claimant's actual basic functional capabilities.\" PageID 1042. Unfortunately, this conclusory assessment of the record-reviewers' opinions is not significantly different than the previous ALJ's analysis-a deficient analysis that the Court found amounted to reversible error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207176476\">\n    2014 WL 7176476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the undersigned concludes that the ALJ's analysis of the weight accorded the opinions of Drs.
