Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant Ronald Barranco (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Barranco\") was represented by Mark Poe, Esq., and Patrick Shea, Esq. Defendants/Counterclaimants 3D Systems Corporation and 3D Systems, Inc. (\"Defendants\" or \"3D Systems\"), were represented by Thomas Benedict, Esq., Dawn T.

The Court also found the issues related to the Non-Compete Counterclaim were \"complex enough to merit an equitable accounting,\" and an equitable accounting to determine recovery, rather than a jury finding to determine damages, was appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury made no finding as to which particular conduct or incidents breached the Non-Compete Provision. At the November 20, 2017, non-jury trial, Defendants argued the jury's finding of liability on the Non-Compete Counterclaim was based on \"the website that [Barranco] developed for [Christopher] Breault\"; \"the divulgement of the Quickparts technology\"; and \"the online quoting engine that Mr. Barranco developed.\" [Trans. of Non-Jury Trial (\"11/20/17 Trans.\"), filed 12/5/17 (dkt. no. 386), at 131.] In closing arguments at the jury trial, Defendants identified the same three bases for finding liability on their Non-Compete Counterclaim. [Trial-Day 5 Trans. (\"Day 5 Trans.\"), filed 10/13/17 (dkt. no. 340), at 77.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on the jury's finding of a breach of the Non-Compete Provision and pursuant to the PSA, Defendants are entitled to \"an equitable accounting of earnings, profits and other benefits arising from such violation.\" [PSA at \u00a7 6(f).] The sole issue remaining for adjudication is the recovery due Defendants because of Plaintiff's violation of the Non-Compete Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the non-jury trial, in lieu of direct testimony, Defendants presented the declarations of Michael White; Anand Parikh; Ronald Hollis, Ph.D.; and Andrew Johnson. [Dkt. nos. 373-76.] In lieu of direct testimony, Plaintiff presented his declaration and the declaration of James Ketner. [Dkt. nos. 369-70.] Plaintiff sought to present the declaration Tory Sirkin, but that declaration was stricken. [Minutes, filed 11/20/17 (dkt. no. 383).] The Court also heard live testimony from Plaintiff, Dr. Hollis, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Ketner. Mr. White, Mr. Parikh, and Mr. Sirkin did not provide live testimony. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] All exhibits indicated by stipulation, were admitted as evidence. [Dkt. no. 380.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff argued Defendants' recovery should be zero because some of the conduct at issue did not violate the Non-Compete Provision, and because none of the conduct caused him to receive any earnings, profits, or other benefits. Defendants sought to recover $5,000,000 as the inherent value of the technology Plaintiff accessed, as well as disgorgement of the entirety of Plaintiff's salary and all consideration paid to Plaintiff pursuant to the PSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Testimony and Exhibits\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1. 3D printing is a process whereby three-dimensional solid objects are created through a process called additive manufacturing. Both stereolithography and laser sintering are additive manufacturing processes used in three-dimensional printing. [Direct Testimony of Ron Barranco (\"Barranco Decl.\"), filed 11/17/17 (dkt. no. 369), at \u00b6 7.] 3D printing contrasts with traditional \"subtractive\" manufacturing processes, in which a final part is formed by subtracting from a solid block of material, through cutting, grinding, or other subtractive processes. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   2. In 1998, Barranco launched the website domain name stereolithography.com\n   (\"SLAC\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.] In 2009, Barranco launched the website domain name lasersintering.com (\"LSCOM\" or \"LS.com\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.] The purpose of SLAC and LSCOM (collectively \"Primary Domains\") was to allow consumers to have a 3D object created through additive manufacturing processes. Through the Primary Domains, a consumer with a design for an object can obtain a quote for the manufacturing of the item and have the object made using 3D printing techniques. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Evolution of 3D Systems' Parts Business\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   3. In December 2007, 3D Systems hired Michael White to create a website that would allow for the instant online quotation (\"IOQ\") and ordering of 3D printed parts. [Decl. of Michael White (\"White Decl.\"), filed 11/17/17 (dkt. no. 376), at \u00b6 19.] At the time, less than five (5) sites in the world were able to accomplish that task. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   4. From December 2007 to mid-2008, Mr. White worked to build and improve the website. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.] 3D Systems launched the new internal quoting tool in June/July 2008. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.] In October 2009, 3D Systems' parts service was rebranded as 3dproparts.com. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   5. In April 2010, 3D Systems acquired a company called DPT-Fast, which was one of the first companies to quote, and take orders for, rapid prototyping parts online. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Quickparts Technology\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   6. In 1999, Dr. Hollis founded Quickparts and served as its president and chief executive officer (\"CEO\"). Quickparts was the industry standard and market leader for the acquisition of custom manufactured parts in the 3D printing market. [Decl. of Ronald L. Hollis (\"Hollis Decl.\"), filed 11/17/17 (dkt. no. 373), at \u00b6 6.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   7. In 2008, Dr. Hollis was awarded a United States patent for the invention of Instantaneous Quotation System for Custom-Manufactured Parts,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C305%2C367%2C\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,305,367,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   known as \"QuickQuote.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.] With the QuickQuote technology, Quickparts was able to provide product designers with an instant online quote for the manufacturing of the designers' custom parts from prototype to production. By having an internet interface, Quickparts expanded the market for 3D printer users by making it easy for everyone to experience the power of additive manufacturing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   8. In February 2011, 3D Systems acquired Quickparts, purchasing all of Quickparts' outstanding shares in a cash transaction, paying $15.9 million, net of cash acquired, at closing, and a deferred payment of $7.2 million. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1; Johnson Decl. at \u00b6 16; Decl. of Anand Parikh (\"Parikh Decl.\"), filed 11/17/17 (dkt. no. 375), at \u00b6 20.] The annual revenue of Quickparts at the time of the acquisition was $24 million. [Johnson Decl. at \u00b6 18.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   9. Quickparts is an additive manufacturing e-commerce system. The Quickparts website used patented technology to generate instant online price quotes for custom manufactured parts based on volume and geometry (\"QP Technology\"). 3D Systems acquired Quickparts to improve the instant online quoting process it had been developing since 2007. [White Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 19-28.] The QP Technology was superior to the quoting technology 3D Systems had developed internally through 3dproparts.com and had acquired through the acquisition of DPT-Fast in 2010. [Johnson Decl. at \u00b6 19; White Decl. at \u00b6 28.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   10. At the time of acquisition, Quickparts was the most valuable intellectual capital 3D Systems had for its online parts business, due to the QP Technology. [White Decl. at \u00b6 30; Parikh Decl. at \u00b6 24.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The PSA and Non-Compete Provision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   11. On April 18, 2011, Barranco and 3D Systems executed the PSA, which was effective on April 19, 2011, for the purchase of the Primary Domains by 3D Systems. [PSA at \u00a7 1; Johnson Decl. at \u00b6 28.] In consideration for the PSA, Barranco granted 3D Systems entitlement to: title and possession of the Primary Domains; the instant online quoting system used by the Primary Domains; customers and customer lists; and existing license and royalty agreements. [PSA at \u00a7 1.] 3D Systems also received Barranco's promises under the Non-Compete Provision. [PSA at \u00a7 6.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   12. In consideration for the PSA, 3D Systems promised Barranco: an immediate cash payment of $250,000.00 (\"Up Front Payment\"); [PSA at \u00a7 1; Johnson Decl. at \u00b6 30;] royalty payments based on sales generated by the Primary Domains (\"Royalty Payments\"); [PSA at \u00a7 3;] and a right to exercise a buyout, which would terminate the right to Royalty Payments and grant entitlement to a lump sum payment (\"Buyout\"), [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   13. The Royalty Payments were calculated as fifty percent of revenue not generated by 3D Systems and received through the Primary Domains, and five percent of revenue generated by 3D Systems and received through the Primary Domains. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 3.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   14. Mr. Sirkin testified he leased LSCOM from Barranco in 2009. [Trial-Day 2 Trans. (\"Day 2 Trans.\"), filed 10/13/17 (dkt. no. 337), at 110.] Because Barranco had generated the sales from LSCOM, 3D Systems paid him fifty percent of the LSCOM royalties. 3D Systems generated the sales from SLAC, and paid Barranco five percent of the gross SLAC sales. [Stipulation Regarding Royalty Payments, filed 5/26/16 (dkt. no. 275).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   15. The Royalty Payments totaled $210,996.02. [Johnson Decl. at \u00b6 44.] Of this total, from April 2011 to February 2016, $177.799.29 were from LSCOM, and $28,893.21 were from SLAC. An additional, combined total of $3,403.52 was paid for the period March 2016 to August 2016. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   16. The PSA provided the amount owed under the Buyout would be calculated as the net present value of the next five years of royalty payments, assuming the royalty payments remained at the average level of the previous two years. [PSA at \u00a7 4.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   17. On August 10, 2016, Barranco exercised the Buyout. [Johnson Decl. at \u00b6 34.] 3D Systems issued Barranco a check in the amount of $120,818.00 (\"Buyout Payment\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Buyout Payment was calculated based on royalty payments during the period from August 2014 to July 2016. In that period, the average annual royalties were $4,666.00 from SLAC and $20,729.00 from LSCOM. The total Buyout Payment consisted of $22,597.00 attributable to SLAC, and $98,221.00 attributable to LSCOM. [Johnson Decl., Exh. 5 at 4 (spreadsheet calculating Buyout Payment).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   18. Barranco did not cash the check tendering the Buyout Payment. However, the amount of the Buyout Payment is still owed pursuant to the PSA. [11/20/17 Trans. at 92-93.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   19. The PSA contains the Non-Compete Provision which prohibited Barranco from 1) engaging in any competition; or 2) becoming an employee, agent or consultant of, or acquiring or having any proprietary\n   or other equity interest in, or otherwise participating or assisting in, the business of any person, firm or business that engaged in competition for five years from the effective date of the PSA. [PSA at \u00a7 6.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   20. Under the Non-Compete Provision, \" 'Competition' means the development, design, offering, marketing, sale or provision of services and products that have been developed, designed, offered, marketed, sold or otherwise provided by the [purchased web] Domains prior to the Effective Date.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   21. The Non-Compete Provision prohibited more than just monetization of a competing product; among other things, it prohibited the development and design of competing products and services. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 11/20/17 Trans. at 92.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   22. The Non-Compete Provision specifically contemplated Barranco's employment and incorporated by reference his separate employment agreement: \"provided that Mr. Barranco may provide services under his respective employment agreement with 3D Systems without violating this covenant.\" [PSA at \u00a7 6(b).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   23. The confidentiality portion of the Non-Compete Provision governed Barranco's disclosure of \"any secret or confidential information ... of or belonging to the Acquired Assets.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6(e).] The Acquired Assets were the LSCOM and SLAC web domains. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. A (listing Acquired Assets).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   24. Before agreeing to the Non-Compete Provision, the parties considered factors including the consideration exchanged for the Acquired Assets, Barranco's access to confidential information relating to the Acquired Assets, and 3D Systems' interest in protecting the value of the Acquired Assets. [PSA at \u00a7 6(c).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   25. In the Non-Compete Provision, Barranco promised 3D Systems he would not compete directly or indirectly, such as by participating or assisting in the business of any person or entity engaged in competition with 3D Systems. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6(b).] Barranco was aware when he executed the PSA that he had an affirmative obligation not to compete with 3D Systems and could not develop products that could compete with 3D Systems for a period of time. [Trial-Day 1 Trans. (\"Day 1 Trans.\"), filed 10/13/17 (dkt. no. 336), at 162.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   26. Violation of the Non-Compete Provision entitles 3D Systems \"to preliminary and injunctive relief as well as to an equitable accounting of earnings, profits and other benefits arising from such violation.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6(f).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   27.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.] Barranco's tax returns were received in evidence, and corroborate that testimony.

Under the PSA, Barranco received: an Up Front Payment of $250,000.00; total Royalty Payments of $210,996.02; and a Buyout Payment of $120,818.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Value of the QP Technology\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   88. The Houlihan Lokey methodology credibly estimates the value of the QP Technology to 3D Systems at the time of the Valuation Date. Specifically, the Court finds 3D Systems could expect a flow of future cost savings as a result of using the QP Technology, rather than sixteen salaried employees, to manage its quoting activities. The Court therefore finds, as of February 22, 2011, the net present value of the future benefits 3D Systems expected from the QP Technology was $4.73 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   89. The Court makes no finding as to the value of the QP Technology today. The February 2011 estimate of saving the salaries of sixteen employees is stale. No evidence shows what benefits the QP Technology causes today, whether it is still in use, or whether similar or superior quoting engines are now available. No evidence shows how the February 2011 or February 2012 version of the QP Technology compares to the current version.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   90. The Houlihan Lokey report shows users of the QP Technology experience benefits to the extent the QP Technology causes labor savings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Violations of the Non-Compete Provision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Barranco's Use of Private Email\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   91. The 8/3/11 E-Mail is part of conduct violating the Non-Compete Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Breault's Pro SLA website\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   92. Barranco and Mr. Breault credibly testified that Barranco provided Mr. Breault $5,200.00 to help Mr. Breault obtain a new website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   93. The record does not indicate precisely when Barranco helped Mr. Breault obtain a new website, but it is clear this occurred soon after the Effective Date of the PSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   94. Mr. Breault's website was named Pro SLA. This name refers to stereolithography. The SLAC web domain name, one of the Primary Domains, also refers to stereolithography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   95. Barranco's involvement with the Pro SLA website assisted Mr. Breault with the development of a product or service competing with SLAC, and therefore violated the Non-Compete Provision (\"Pro SLA Violation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   96. There is no evidence Barranco received any earnings, profits, or other benefits arising from the Pro SLA Violation. No evidence shows Barranco's involvement with the Pro SLA website caused him to receive: salary or wages; royalties or sales commissions; any property interest in anything related to the Pro SLA website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The QP Emails\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   97. The QP Emails show, at least from February 19 to 21, 2012, Barranco worked with Mr. Pham and R.J. Barranco to develop or design instant online quoting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   98. The QP Emails show at least a portion of Barranco's development effort was undertaken independently, and not as part of his employment with 3D Systems. Therefore, the development effort is not covered by the exception allowing Barranco to \"provide services under his [ ] employment agreement with 3D Systems.\" [PSA at \u00a7 6(f).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   99. The parties intended the confidentiality portion of the PSA to govern only disclosures of confidential information that is of, or belonging to, the Primary Domains. The QP Technology was not of, or belonging to, the Primary Domains. The QP Emails therefore did not violate the confidentiality portion of the Non-Compete Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   100. The Primary Domains offered instant online quoting before Barranco conveyed them to 3D Systems under the PSA. Therefore, Barranco's development effort violated the Non-Compete Provision of the PSA (\"QP Emails Violation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   101. No evidence shows Barranco received any earnings, profits, or benefits arising from the QP Emails Violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   102. Mr. Johnson credibly testified that, after learning of the QP Emails, 3D Systems conducted an investigation because it was concerned that it had lost the ability to control the use and further dissemination of the QP Technology. Mr. Johnson also credibly testified that he was not aware of any evidence of use or further dissemination of the QP Technology because of Barranco. This testimony occurred five years and nine months after Barranco sent the QP Emails. No evidence shows any further use or dissemination of any portion of the QP Technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   103. Barranco gained access to the QP Technology in his capacity as an employee of 3D Systems. Barranco's access to the source code attached to the QP Emails occurred prior to, and not because of, the QP Emails Violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   104. Dr. Hollis credibly authenticated the source code attached to the QP Emails as being some portion of the QP Technology source code. However, on cross-examination, Dr. Hollis could not say what the function of that code was, or whether it was a significant part of the QP Technology. This Court therefore makes no findings as to the relationship between the source code attached to the QP Emails and the QP Technology. Specifically, this Court can make no inference, based on the QP Technology, as to: the inherent value of the source code attached to the QP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Emails; the benefits of possessing or using the attached source code; or the harm disclosing that source code might cause 3D Systems, either in February 2012 or now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     New Quoting Engine Development\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   105. Barranco's efforts to develop a new quoting engine were efforts to develop or design a product or service that would compete with the quoting engine Barranco sold to 3D Systems under the PSA, and were therefore prohibited under the Non-Compete Provision (\"Quoting Engine Development Violation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   106. The Quoting Engine Development Violation occurred at least beginning on March 19, 2013, and persisted at least until September 25, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   107. No evidence shows the Quoting Engine Development Violation resulted in any product or service that was ever commercialized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   108. No evidence shows the Quoting Engine Development Violation caused Barranco to receive: salary or wages; royalties or sales commissions related to the use of a new quoting engine; any money from selling or licensing a new quoting engine; or ownership of any intellectual property rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Galenfeha Transaction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   109. There is no evidence Barranco brought any technology to Galenfeha that he designed or developed in violation of the Non-Compete Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   110. Mr. Ketner and Barranco credibly testified that the Galenfeha Transaction fell through, and Barranco received no earnings, profits, or other benefits because of his involvement with Galenfeha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   111. Barranco credibly testified that he lost money on Galenfeha stock, is no longer Galenfeha's CTO, and was not paid during his tenure as CTO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Effects Caused by the Violations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   112. In light of evidence showing Barranco's income in 2014, 2015, and 2016 consisted only of payments made pursuant to the PSA, there is no evidence that Barranco obtained earnings, profits, or other benefits that could be attributed to any enhanced stature because of any of the 8/3/11 Email, Pro SLA Violation, QP Emails Violation, or Quoting Engine Development Violation (collectively, \"Violations\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   113. There is no evidence the Violations diminished the cost savings the QP Technology caused 3D Systems or otherwise harmed 3D Systems' use and enjoyment of the QP Technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   114. No evidence shows Barranco caused 3D Systems to lose sales, to lower its prices, or to suffer reduced profit margins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   115. Mr. Johnson credibly testified 3D Systems would have fired Barranco for cause if it had learned of the QP Emails while Barranco was still an employee. There is evidence that shows the QP Emails Violation would have caused Barranco not to receive some of the payments he did receive from 3D Systems. Specifically, if 3D Systems had discovered the QP Emails Violation, Barranco would have been fired for cause and would not have received his full salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Barranco's Salary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   116. Of the four Violations, the 8/3/11 Email, the Pro SLA Violation, and the QP Emails Violation occurred while Barranco was employed by 3D Systems, and the Quoting Engine Development Violation occurred afterward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   117. Mr. Johnson credibly testified 3D Systems would have fired Barranco for cause if it had learned of the QP Emails while Barranco was still an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   118. The Non-Compete Provision specifically contemplated Barranco's employment with 3D Systems and incorporated by specific reference his employment agreement, and thus the PSA incorporated Barranco's employment agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   119. Barranco's salary was consideration for his employment agreement as well as the Non-Compete Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   120. Of the $280,033.00 in salary Barranco received for work from April 2011 to February 2013, because the 8/3/11 Email was the first violation of the Non-Compete Provision and the February 2012 QP Emails were grounds for termination with cause, $229,117.91 represents the amount of Barranco's unjust enrichment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n    <em>\n     Consideration Attributable to the Non-Compete Provision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   121. Barranco possessed confidential information about the Primary Domains sold under the PSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   122. Mr. Johnson credibly testified that, if Barranco were to compete against the assets conveyed under the PSA, this would undermine the value of the assets 3D Systems had purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   123. Mr. Johnson credibly testified that, without the Non-Compete Provision, 3D Systems would not entered into the PSA to acquire the Primary Domains from Barranco or have offered him the consideration that it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   124. Mr. Johnson credibly testified that, over the course of negotiating the PSA, Barranco could have objected to the Non-Compete Provision, but he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   125. 3D Systems valued both the covenant not to sell competing products or services for five years (\"No-Sales Covenant\") and the covenant not to develop or design competing products or services for five years (\"No-Development Covenant\") contained within the Non-Compete Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   126. The No-Sales Covenant primarily benefits 3D Systems during the first five years after the Effective date of the PSA, before the Non-Compete Provision has expired. During that time, the No-Sales Covenant prohibits Barranco from selling in competition with the Acquired Assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   127. The No-Development Covenant primarily benefits 3D Systems after the first five years, when the Non-Compete Provision is recently expired. The No-Development Covenant prevents Barranco from immediately entering the market and selling in competition with 3D Systems by delaying Barranco's entry until he can first develop and design a competing product. It thereby further extends the period during which the Acquired Assets are protected from Barranco selling a competing product or service. This extra benefit is of limited duration: after Barranco takes the time necessary to develop or design a competing product, he can enter the market and sell in competition with the Primary Domains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   128. The No-Development Covenant also protects 3D Systems against risks that arise from the difficulty of detecting and proving violations and of detecting and proving the earnings that arise from such violations. The No-Development Covenant deters the undertaking independent development efforts, which if successful, might cause temptation to disregard the Non-Compete Provision and to sell in competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   129. The No-Development Covenant is a detrimental promise made by Barranco. Some portion of the consideration Barranco\n   received under the PSA compensates Barranco for the No-Development Covenant. If the PSA had omitted the No-Development Covenant, Barranco would have received a lesser consideration in exchange from 3D Systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   130. Because the Buyout right benefits Barranco in proportion to expected later-year sales, the Buyout Payment is the part of the consideration most related to the No-Development Covenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   131. The Royalty Payments, which are proportional to actual sales in the inner years of the agreement, are the part of the consideration most related to the No-Sales Covenant, which only protects sales during the first five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   132. At least some part of the consideration exchanged under the PSA supports Barranco's No-Development Covenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   133. Not all of the consideration is for the breached No-Development Covenant. The consideration Barranco received also supports his conveyance of the Acquired Assets to 3D Systems and his agreement to split the revenues generated by the Acquired Assets. The August 10, 2016 Buyout Payment is also consideration for the termination of Barranco's right to receive any royalties based on the revenues from the Acquired Assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   134. Of Barranco's $120,818.00 Buyout Payment, $22,597.00 is attributable to Barranco's right to a 5% royalty on the SLAC web domain, and $98,221.00 is attributable to Barranco's right to 50% of royalties from the LSCOM web domain. Because 3D Systems retains title and possession of the Primary Domains, it would effect an unfair penalty for Barranco to forfeit all of the consideration he received for conveying the Primary Domains to 3D Systems. Further, 3D Systems received its 95% and 50% share of the revenues generated by the Primary Domains before Barranco exercised the Buyout on August 10, 2016, and 100% of the revenues generated after exercise of the Buyout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   135. The jury found 3D Systems did not promise to invest substantial resources into the Primary Domains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   136. Evidence of the Violations shows Barranco breached the No-Development Covenant starting from at least August 3, 2011, four months after the Non-Compete Provision was effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   137. Barranco would be unjustly enriched if he retained the portion of the consideration attributable to the No-Development Covenant when he subsequently breached that promise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   138. Of the $120,818.00 Buyout Payment, some part is consideration for the expected earnings the Primary Domains will generate. Some part is consideration for the protection of those earnings attributable to the No-Sales Covenant and the No-Development Covenant contained in the Non-Compete Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   139. Given that Barranco violated the No-Development starting from at least August 3, 2011, four months after the Non-Compete Provision was effective, it would be unjust for Barranco to retain the entire $120,818.00 Buyout Payment. The portion of the Buyout Payment representing Barranco's unjust enrichment is $60,409.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   140. Of the $250,000.00 Up Front Payment, some part is consideration for: 1) the Primary Domains' expected earnings during the first five years after the Effective Date; 2) the protection of those earnings by the No-Sales Covenant; 3) the Primary Domains' expected earnings soon after the expiration of the Non-Compete Provision; 4) the protection of those earnings by the No-Development Covenant; and 5) the Primary Domains' expected earnings long after the expiration of the Non-Compete\n   Provision, for which the No-Development Covenant affords no extra protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   141. Because Barranco breached the No-Development Covenant starting from at least August 3, 2011, four months after the Non-Compete Provision was effective, it would be unjust for Barranco to retain the entire $250,000.00 Up Front Payment. The portion of the Up Front Payment representing Barranco's unjust enrichment is $233,333.33, or $4,166.66 per month for each of the 56 months following the initial breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   142. Barranco received Royalty Payments, based on the revenues generated by the Acquired Assets at rates set in the PSA. Of the $210,996.02 in Royalty Payments, no part represents the consideration for the No-Development Promise, and therefore Barranco is not unjustly enriched by its retention.2332233\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   143. The total amount of Barranco's unjust enrichment related to the Violations is $522,860.24.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Findings of Fact \u00b6\u00b6 120, 138-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction and Venue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   1.
