CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court is Defendants' \"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Marshall County Board of Education and Summary Judgment as to Jackie Abernathy\" (Doc. No. 38), to which Sherry Monce has responded in opposition (Doc. No. 45), and Defendants have replied (Doc. No. 51). For the reasons set forth below, the Motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties have filed their own statements of undisputed facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Collectively, those statements, and the record before the Court, suggest the following to be the relevant facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Monce has been a teacher for more than two decades. For the last sixteen years, she has taught at Forrest School in Marshall County, Tennessee. Abernathy served as the Marshall County Director of Schools during the period relevant to this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2012, Monce was diagnosed with breast cancer, and underwent a double mastectomy in March of 2013. That summer, she underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatment. In October 2013, Monce had a hysterectomy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants claim that Monce was not in her designated area for Fun Day activities on May 21, 2014, and was on her computer instead of supervising students. That same evening, Monce climbed on top of the press box at the Middle Tennessee Christian School to watch a Forrest School baseball game. Monce claims that she had not been instructed where she needed to be for the \"Fun Day\" activities and that, once she arrived at the school, she supervised students, and assisted one student with an online computer program. Monce concedes that she climbed on top of the press box while off-duty, but claims she did so because she was \"suffering from a migraine,\" and decided to watch her son play baseball from that vantage point. (DSOF \u00b6 7). Regardless, Monce received an \"Oral Reprimand\" (memorialized in writing on May 23, 2014) that stated both incidents were unprofessional and reflected poorly on the school. (Pf. Exh. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 22, 2014, Monce underwent breast reconstruction surgery. After surgery, she was out of school for the next four weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In late November 2014, Monce was accidentally shot in the head by her husband while the two were bird hunting. On February 4, 2015 she asked the school trainer to use an X-acto knife Monce had in her possession to cut into her scalp to see if it was infected. When the trainer refused, a student, who was sitting nearby, volunteered. Monce allowed the student to make the incision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a result, Monce received a \"Letter of Reprimand - Unprofessional Conduct\" dated February 20, 2015 from John McClaran, the school principal, that recounted the X-acto knife incident and expressed concerns that Monce had behaved unprofessionally in the past. This included leaving the school without permission for two hours on April 2, 2014, climbing on top of the press box on May 21, 2014, and allowing her 14-year old son to drive her home after the ball game, even though she was \"heavily medicated.\" (Pf. Exh. 11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter was intended \"to underscore the importance of complying with Marshall County School's policies, rules and regulations,\" and \"to serve as a written reprimand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additionally, Monce was suspended without pay so that the school could investigate her \"unprofessional conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 24, 2015, Monce met with Principal McClaran and Robby Reasonover, another administrator. This meeting resulted in a Corrective Plan for Plaintiff to follow. Among other things, the Plan expected Monce to (1) be present to instruct and supervise students; (2) not be on her computer, except at lunch or for planning purposes; (3) notify the office when she left the premises and (4) dress and act professionally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants claim that Plaintiff left her class unsupervised on April 21, 2015, during which time a student videotaped another student climbing on top of a basketball goal. Monce claims that, at the time the incident occurred, she was in the equipment room getting supplies for class. (DSOF \u00b6 16). Regardless, Monce received another reprimand because she had not followed the Corrective Action Plan, and was not present and supervising students during an assigned class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During an April 22, 2015 meeting regarding the climbing incident, Abernathy claims that she smelled alcohol on Monce and suggested she take a drug test. Monce claims she does not drink during the day, Abernathy never made any such allegations, and the accusation is not documented in any school record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20). Monce also claims Abernathy demanded that she take a drug test, or face a 5-day suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Marshall County Board of Education has a Policy intended to maintain a drug-free workplace. It prohibits the possession or use of alcohol or narcotic drugs on any school premises of vehicle, or at school sponsored activities or functions. (Pf. Exh. 14). The Board also has a policy that requires \"trained supervisors\" to observe and document \"reasonable suspicion\" that an employee is using drugs, is in an \"[a]pparent physical state of impairment of motor functions,\" or exhibits \"[m]arked changes in personal behavior not attributed to other factors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under the policy, if any of those things are observed, an \"employee may be required to submit to substance screening[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Monce submitted to a drug test after consultation with a union representative. The result showed the presence of alcohol metabolites. Monce does not deny that those were the results, but claims that the test used-Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) testing, commonly known as the \"80 hour\" test, detects EtG metabolites in urine up to 3 to 4 days after alcohol consumption, and therefore \"has no value in ascertaining whether an individual is actually under the influence of alcohol at the time of testing or whether an employee used alcohol while on duty.\" (DSOF \u00b6 26). Furthermore, the drug tests also showed the presence of prescription drugs that had been prescribed to Monce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After receipt of the results, Abernathy notified Monce, by letter dated April 30, 2015, that she was suspended without pay for the remainder of the school year \"due to violation of school board policies.\" (Pf. Exh. 15). The letter also attached Monce's lab report and stated that before returning for the next school year, \"you must have a 10-panel clean drug screen conducted no more than five days prior to the start of school, and submit a note from your physician stating you are not impaired.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 29, 2015, a lawyer for the Tennessee Education Association (\"TEA\") sent a letter to Abernathy on behalf of Monce stating that the suspension letter did not comply with the requirements of Tennessee's Tenure Teachers Act (\"TTA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-5-501\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-5-501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , because it did not (1) specify one of the enumerated bases for suspension under the Act; (2) set forth the factual allegations supporting the suspension, or (3) provide Monce with notice of her legal rights. (Pf. Exh. 19). The letter requested proper due\n   process notice in accordance with the Act, or, alternatively, that Monce be provided a hearing before an impartial hearing officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Abernathy did not respond to that letter. That same lawyer sent a letter dated August 21, 2015, stating his \"understanding that if Ms. Monce passes her latest drug test, then 'all is forgiven,' \" to which there was no response from Abernathy. (Pf. Exh. 20). Monce disputes that any such agreement was reached. In fact, the failure to reach an agreement resulted in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Abernathy added additional conditions in August 2015, specially that Monce receive a note from her physician stating that she could \"supervise her kids on her medicine.\" (PSOF \u00b6 14). Monce also claims Abernathy required that Monce bring all of her prescriptions medications to the school for inspection, a charge which Defendants dispute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-13). When Monce brought her medications to the school, McClaran took photographs of the bottles and shared them with Abernathy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based upon the foregoing events, Monce filed suit in this Court alleging federal statutory and constitutional claims, and a state law claim. In the controlling First Amended Complaint, Monce alleges that her suspension violated the Americans With Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   She also alleges that the circumstances surrounding her two compelled drug tests, as well as the Defendants' requirement that she disclose all of her medications, violated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. Monce further contends that, by summarily suspending her for the balance of the 2014-15 school year, Defendants deprived her of her property interest in continued employment without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, Monce alleges that Abernathy's imposition of a suspension for the remainder of the school year violated the Tenured Teacher Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-5-512\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-5-512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Defendants move for summary judgment on all claims, except for the Fourth Amendment compelled drug test claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The standards governing summary judgment have been restated on countless occasions and, from the filings that have been submitted, are obviously understood by the parties. It suffices to note: (1) summary judgment is only appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, Fed. R. Civ.

The Defendants knew that Monce had undergone prolonged treatments for cancer. The Defendants had before them in April 2015, when they suspended Monce, the results of Monce's first drug test. The Defendants have tried to justify that test on an unrecorded recollection by Director Abernathy over a year later that she smelled alcohol on Monce. But the test was a ten-panel drug screen. The results showed that Monce was taking valid prescription drugs. With those results in hand, the Defendants insisted not only that Monce would have to undergo another drug test in August in order to return to work, but that she also would have to provide a physician's note or letter attesting that she was able to work.

On February 4, 2015, Plaintiff gave a student an x-acto knife to cut into her scalp and check for infection of a recent head injury ; the student used the knife to make an incision into Plaintiff's scalp. On February 10, 2015, Plaintiff received a Formal Letter of Reprimand for her actions on February 4, 2015, and on February 12, 2015, Plaintiff received a three-day suspension for her actions on February 4, 2015. On February 24, 2015, a meeting between Plaintiff and Administrators Robby Reasonover and Davy McClaran took place to discuss expectations and consequences for Plaintiff, as well as the requirement of her position; this meeting resulted in a Corrective Plan for Plaintiff to follow. On April 21, 2015, Plaintiff left her class unsupervised, and during this time, a student videoed another student climbing on the basketball goals ten feet off the ground. The next day, April 22, 2015, Jackie Abernathy smelled alcohol on the Plaintiff while at work during a meeting to discuss her actions the previous day. The use of alcohol in the workplace is a violation of Board Policy 1.804, thus, Ms. Abernathy\n   suggested the Plaintiff submit to a drug test or be suspended without pay to due violation of this policy. The Plaintiff submitted to a drug test, which was positive for alcohol metabolites. Thus, Plaintiff was suspended due to a violation of board policies, and she was not allowed to return to the 2016-17 school year without a 10-panel clean drug screen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (Doc.

Yet twice in the paragraph quoted above, Defendants identify the only policy violated to be that of use of alcohol in the workplace. Perhaps the X-acto knife incident and being absent from the classroom when a student climbed the backboard were alcohol related, but there is no evidence of that before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Instead, Defendants rely on Abernathy's assertion that Monce smelled of alcohol during the April 22, 2015 meeting, and that the \"Forrest School administration\" became aware of her being \"highly-medicated\" at a ballgame more than a year earlier. However, Monce denies that she drank alcohol on the day of the meeting and claims this was \"a story Director Abernathy did not tell until more than a year later.\" (Doc. No. 45 at 13). She claims that Jacob Sorrells, who was then-Assistant Director of Schools and attended the April 22, 2015, is \"a habitual taker of daily notes regarding all matters of significance, yet his note from that meeting mentions nothing about alcohol.\" (Doc. No. 45 at 15 n. 13). If Monce's assertions are true, this raises the specter that Aberntathy's stated reason for the suspension had no basis in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To the extent that Monce appeared to be \"highly medicated\" at the ballgame and Abernathy relied upon it for the suspension, this raises the specter that the stated reason for the suspension (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   use of alcohol in the workplace) was not the true reason for the dismissal. After allegedly smelling alcohol, Abernathy did not simply order a blood alcohol test: she required Monce to undergo a ten-panel drug test that showed the existence not only of alcohol, but also prescription medication. A\n   reasonable jury could conclude that improper alcohol use does not explain the need for a full panel drug test, nor does it explain why Abernathy insisted on (1) another ten-panel drug test in August 2015; (2) a letter from Monce's physician attesting that she was capable of performing her job; and (3) production of Monce's medicine bottles. Instead, a jury could conclude that what does explain those requests is that Abernathy viewed Monce as being disabled and as substantially impaired in her work because she took medication as a part of her treatment for cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Lest there be any misunderstanding, the Court emphasizes that the question of the legitimacy of Defendants' proffered explanation and pretext presents a very close call. On the one hand, Monce exhibited behavior that, at least on one occasion, bordered on the bizarre. \"Employers need to be able to use reasonable means to ascertain the cause of troubling behavior without exposing themselves to ADA claims[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633544\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/197/804/#p810\">\n    197 F.3d at 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cody v.

However, the Sixth Circuit's concern in\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   was with whether a federal court is the \"appropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel decision that are made on a daily basis,\" and plaintiff's attempt \"to make a federal case out of\" the fact that she was transferred to another school. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1020847\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/544/279/#p284\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).

Code Ann. \u00a7 49-5-511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). However, there was no \"action of the board\" after Abernathy allegedly ignored the TEA lawyer's letter requesting a hearing, and, according to Monce, no \"action of the director\" that complied with Section 512(d)(4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

They assert that Monce waived her TTA claim by failing to avail herself of its available remedies. For those rights to attach, however, a teacher need only request a hearing, and it then fall upon the director of schools to get the ball rolling by naming an impartial hearing officer. Tenn. Code Ann. 49-6-512(a)(1), (2). The hearing provision aside, Monce claims Abernathy had no authority under the TTA to suspend her for more than three days, which is itself a violation of the TTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Third, Defendants' argue that the TTA claim against Abernathy must be dismissed because the statute provides that \"[t]he director or schools or other school official shall not be held liable, personally or officially, when performing their duties in prosecuting charges against any teacher or teachers under this part.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-5-512\">\n    Tenn.

While Monce contends\n   this provision is inapplicable because \"Abernathy was acting completely outside the bounds of her authority in imposing a long-term disciplinary suspension,\" (Doc. No. 45 at 27), the fact remains that, through this claim, Monce is seeking to hold Abernathy liable under the TTA, something the Act expressly prohibits.
