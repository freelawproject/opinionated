Judge Pitman did not find Defendants' conduct to be as egregious as Plaintiffs contended and denied Plaintiff's requested relief.

Tex. 2010) (rejecting equitable tolling of FLSA claims when the motion for conditional certification was pending for six months).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs' filed their Motion for Conditional Certification on May 8, 2017, ECF No. 13, and on March 20, 2018, Judge Pitman adopted the undersigned's report and recommendation granting conditional certification. ECF No. 129. As the parties waited ten and a half months, the Court finds that it is equitable to toll the statute of limitations up to the Court's granting of the Motion for Conditional Certification on March 20, 2018, but, as previously discussed, Plaintiffs have not carried their burden to justify tolling through the expiration of the class notice period. Accordingly, the undersigned\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' request that limitations be tolled up to and including March 20, 2018, the date the Court granted the Motion for Conditional Certification, but\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' request that limitations be tolled until the expiration of the class notice period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
