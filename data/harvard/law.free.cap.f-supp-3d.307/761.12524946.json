ROSE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   From approximately 1992 until July 2016 (shortly after this lawsuit was filed), a municipal ordinance in the City of Oakwood, Ohio made it unlawful to transfer ownership of any real estate, or change a tenant, without having obtained a \"pre-sale inspection\" of the property under the municipal code. (Doc. 28-9, Oakwood Codified Ordinances, \u00a7 17, at PageID # 3112-3152.) The pre-sale inspection program required the property owner to complete an application, schedule and appear for an inspection of the property with the code official, pay a $60 fee, correct or otherwise address identified violations of the city's fire, zoning, building, and property maintenance codes, and pay all outstanding water and sewer bills for the property in full, in order to obtain a \"certificate of occupancy\" authorizing the property's sale. Violation of the pre-sale inspection requirement was punishable as a misdemeanor. (Doc. 28-9 at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs own and have sold residential homes in Oakwood. They brought this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Oakwood and Ethan Kroger, one of its code enforcement officers, for allegedly infringing their constitutional rights by requiring them to submit to warrantless searches or risk criminal punishment before permitting them to sell their homes. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of similarly situated individuals who sold real estate in Oakwood and were \"coerced into paying pre-sale inspection fees.\" (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is before the Court on Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (Doc. 18) and Amended Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 52) and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 50). Typically, the Court would decide a motion for class certification before a dispositive motion, but, in this case, the resolution of the parties' motions for summary judgment simplifies the issues relevant to whether a class should be certified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Cty. of Medina, Oh.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840523\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/238/#p241\">\n    29 F.3d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 241 (6th Cir. 1994) (court has discretion to decide motion for summary judgment before motion to certify class). In this Order, the Court therefore rules on the parties' motions for summary judgment before turning to the question of whether class certification is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Oakwood is a residential suburb just south of Dayton, Ohio. Due to the age of Oakwood's housing stock, some of which dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, Oakwood actively encourages residents to maintain their homes, including through the pre-sale inspection program at issue in this lawsuit. (Doc. 26-1 at PAGEID # 312; Doc. 25-2, PAGEID # 217-218; Doc. 25-3, PAGEID# 280-281; Doc. 25-4, PAGEID # 292.) Oakwood credits its rising home values and the \"scant number of fire and structural events occurring annually\" within the city at least in part to its pre-sale\n   inspection program. (Doc. 26-1 at PAGEID # 312; Doc. 28-8 at PAGEID # 3011-311; Doc. 26-1, PAGEID # 312; Doc. 28-8 at PAGEID # 2947-3010; Doc. 25-2 at PAGEID # 218; Doc. 25-3, PAGEID # 281; Doc. 25-4, PAGEID # 292.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From 1968 until 1992, Oakwood's pre-sale inspection ordinance included a provision that required the city's building commissioner to obtain a search warrant if the owner or occupant of the premises objected to the inspection. (Doc. 28-9 at PAGEID # 3166); (Doc. 28-9 at PAGEID # 3167.) In 1992, the City hired an outside agency to revise its entire Codified Ordinances, including the Property Maintenance Code that contains the pre-sale inspection program. (Doc. 28-9 at PAGEID # 3168-3170.) The revised pre-sale inspection program omitted the warrant provision present in the former version. Oakwood claims that the omission was inadvertent and it had no intention of discontinuing its earlier compliance with\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. City of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1797764\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/46/138/\">\n    46 Ohio St. 2d 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=346%20N.E.2d%20666\">\n    346 N.E.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 8.) In\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Ohio held that \"where a municipal ordinance requires the owner of real property to tender a certificate of housing inspection to a prospective buyer, and such certificate may be obtained only by allowing a warrantless inspection of the property, the imposition of a criminal penalty upon the owner's failure to tender the certificate violates the owner's rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=346%20N.E.2d%20666\">\n    346 N.E.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs challenge the pre-sale inspection program effective after the 1992 revision to Oakwood's Codified Ordinances. The program at issue provided, under Oakwood Codified Ordinance \u00a7 17-107.5, that \"it shall be unlawful for the owner of any real estate premises to transfer legal or equitable ownership of that premises, or change tenant, without having obtained a pre-sale inspection of it under this code.\" (Doc. 28-9 at PAGEID# 3120-3121.) Upon completion of the inspection and other requirements, a real estate owner could obtain a \"certificate of occupancy\" from Oakwood. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Issuance of the certificate of occupancy was important because, under \u00a7 17-107.8, it was unlawful for a new owner or tenant to occupy or use any premises \"without having obtained from the code official or the previous owner a valid certificate of occupancy for that premises.\" In addition, under \u00a7 17-106.4, an owner who failed to comply with the pre-sale inspection requirement or occupied a premises without having first obtained a certificate of occupancy was guilty of a minor misdemeanor-a criminal offense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PAGEID# 3117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on May 4, 2016. About two months later, on July 5, 2016, Oakwood passed an Emergency Ordinance that repealed the pre-sale inspection program enacted in 1992 and replaced it with a new program. The new program retains many of the same procedures, but adds an administrative warrant procedure for residential and business inspections and clarifies that assertion of one's rights under the Fourth Amendment is not grounds for criminal prosecution. (Doc. # 23-1 at PAGEID # 190-193.) Plaintiffs do not challenge the constitutionality of the amended ordinance. (Doc. 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs are Jason Thompson (\"Thompson\") and 2408 Hillview LLC (\"the LLC\"). The LLC was formed by Thompson and his partner Timothy Gwin (\"Gwin\") for the purpose of buying and selling houses. (Doc. 45 at PAGEID # 3326-27; Doc. 46, PAGEID # 3672.) As alleged in the Amended Complaint, the LLC owned two homes in Oakwood, one at 421 Hadley Avenue and the other at 2408 Hillview Avenue. (Doc. # 46, PAGEID # 3673.) The LLC sold the property at 421 Hadley Avenue\n   on April 25, 2016, but continues to own the property at 2408 Hillview Avenue-or at least owned it as of the briefing on the motions before the Court. Consequently, only the property at 421 Hadley Avenue is at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The LLC, through Gwin, engaged Jill Aldineh of Re/Max (\"Aldineh\") to act as the seller's agent in the sale of the 421 Hadley Avenue property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Gwin signed an agency agreement with Aldineh, which required the property owner to make application for any required housing inspection and to furnish Aldineh with a copy of the resulting certificate of occupancy. (Doc. 25-2 at PAGEID # 216, 229.) Aldineh paid the $60 application fee and scheduled an inspection of the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PAGEID # 216.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 12, 2016, Defendant Ethan Kroger (\"Kroger\"), an Oakwood code enforcement officer, conducted the inspection of the 421 Hadley Avenue property. (Doc. 25-2 at \u00b6 7.) Another agent from Re/Max attended the inspection on the LLC's behalf. (Doc. 50-2 at \u00b6 6.) Gwin testified he was unaware that Aldineh had paid the $60 fee or had the inspection done. (Doc. 45 at PAGEID # 3350.) Thompson, after learning the pre-sale inspection occurred, demanded that Oakwood refund Aldineh the $60 fee so that he could pay it instead-which he did. (Doc. 46 at PAGEID # 3685.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The April 12, 2016 inspection revealed some issues that needed to be addressed to comply with Oakwood's Building Code. (Doc. 25-2 at PAGEID # 217.) They were quickly resolved and a final inspection for 421 Hadley Avenue was scheduled for April 14, 2016. (Doc. 45 at PAGEID # 3344.) Gwin attended the final inspection, which Kroger again conducted. Kroger asked Gwin for permission to inspect the garage, which was accessible during the first inspection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PAGEID # 3338-3339.) Gwin declined. Kroger therefore did not inspect the garage, but nevertheless processed the LLC's application for approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PAGEID# 3339-3340.) The LLC then completed the sale of 421 Hadley Avenue. (Doc. 45 at PAGEID # 3345.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Oakwood's Property Maintenance Code contains an administrative appeal procedure for property owners to challenge any decision or order of a code official. (Doc. 26-1 at PAGEID # 314; Doc. 28-9 at PAGEID # 3112-3152.) No Oakwood property owner, including Plaintiffs, has filed an administrative appeal challenging any decision or order of an Oakwood code official in the enforcement of the pre-sale inspection ordinance at issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 26-1 at PAGEID # 312-313.) The City has never denied a property owner an occupancy permit. (Doc 26-1 at PAGEID # 314.) Its practice and policy is to work with sellers and buyers as they work to maintain the aging housing stock. (Doc. 26-1 at PAGEID # 307-314; Doc. 28-9 at PAGEID # 3119-3121; Doc. 25-2, PAGEID # 217; Doc. 25-3 at PAGEID # 280-281; Doc. 25-4 at PAGEID # 292.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Since the program's inception in 1968, Oakwood has never cited a property owner for failure to comply with the pre-sale inspection requirement. (Doc 26-1 at PAGEID # 308.) Oakwood has, however, informed at least two property owners-specifically Thompson and Gwin-that failure to have a pre-sale inspection was a misdemeanor. (Doc. 1-5 at PAGEID # 34; Doc. 65-1 at PAGEID # 4271.) Aside from Plaintiffs, Oakwood is not aware of any property owner objecting to the pre-sale inspection program. (Doc. 26-1 at PAGEID # 309.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 4, 2016, Plaintiffs brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that Oakwood's pre-sale inspection requirement was unconstitutional on its face, an injunction\n   against enforcement of the ordinance containing that requirement, and restitution of the $60 fee that Plaintiffs paid pursuant to the ordinance. (Doc. 1.) On the next day, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (\"TRO\") and Preliminary Injunction. (Doc. 2.) At the hearing on the TRO, the parties agreed on the terms of a preliminary injunction that would require Oakwood to suspend enforcement of certain provisions of its pre-sale inspection ordinance. On May 24, 2016, the Court entered the parties' stipulated preliminary injunction. (Doc. 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 12, 2016, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, which added class allegations. (Doc. 12.) Plaintiffs assert two claims against Oakwood and Kroger under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for alleged violations of their rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 71-98.) As to each \u00a7 1983 claim, Plaintiffs allege that Oakwood's ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and as applied. Plaintiffs also bring a claim against Oakwood for unjust enrichment and restitution of the $60 paid pursuant to the pre-sale inspection program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 99-110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Oakwood's amendment of its Oakwood's Codified Ordinances effectively moots Plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction. Plaintiffs also seek a declaratory judgment that Oakwood's prior pre-sale inspection program (effective 1992-2016) was unconstitutional on its face, actual and nominal damages, and restitution of the $60 fee paid for pre-sale inspections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs have moved for certification of the following class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   All individuals and businesses that have (1) sold houses within the City of Oakwood since May 25, 2010; and (2) paid pre-sale inspection fees to the City of Oakwood in conjunction with the sale of their houses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 15; Doc. 18 at 1.) Defendants oppose class certification on a number of grounds, which are discussed below. The most significant issues raised by Defendants in opposition to class certification are resolved by the Court's ruling on the parties' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     THE PARTIES' MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment \"shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

(Defendants indicate that they might file a dispositive motion directed to the class claims if a class is certified.) Defendants first argue that Kroger is immune from civil liability on Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claims under the doctrine of qualified immunity. They argue that Oakwood is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims because its amended ordinance moots Plaintiffs' claim and it did not commit any constitutional violation.

Under Portsmouth's Rental Dwelling Code, plaintiffs were required to apply to the Portsmouth Board of Health for a rental dwelling permit in order to rent their property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.

Plaintiffs alleged that Portsmouth's code violated their Fourth Amendment rights by mandating warrantless inspections of their properties without probable cause and violated their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine) because it required them to forfeit their Fourth Amendment rights in order to rent out their properties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After surveying the relevant caselaw, Judge Dlott concluded that \"unless a recognized exception to the warrant requirement applies, the Code's failure to include a warrant provision violates the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Judge Dlott reviewed many of the same cases cited by the parties in this case, including\n   <em>\n    Sokolov v.

Rather than repeat the same exercise here, the Court agrees with Judge Dlott's analysis and reaches the same conclusion as to Oakwood's pre-sale inspection ordinance. Namely, the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Camara\n   </em>\n   and its progeny establish that a municipality violates the Fourth Amendment when it requires a property owner to consent to a warrantless inspection of their property or face a criminal penalty, unless a valid exception to the warrant requirement exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Oakwood makes four arguments against the entry of summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor on the Fourth Amendment claim. First, Oakwood argues that Plaintiffs' claims were mooted when Oakwood amended its ordinance. (Doc. 56 at 4-5.) Second, it argues that it did not commit any constitutional violation because Plaintiffs consented, through their real estate agent, to the pre-sale inspection of their property. Third, Oakwood argues that Plaintiffs rely on inadmissible evidence and fail to address the history of the pre-sale inspection ordinance. (Doc. 56 at 3-4.) Fourth, Oakwood claims that Kroger, its code enforcement officer, did not commit any constitutional violation and, even if he did, he is entitled to qualified immunity. The Court considers each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The fact that Oakwood amended its ordinance-and that Plaintiffs do not challenge\n   the amended ordinance-does not moot Plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs originally sought injunctive relief and damages. Oakwood's amended ordinance provided Plaintiffs the injunctive relief they sought; as a result, that portion of Plaintiffs' claims is indeed moot. Their claims for actual and nominal damages relating to the prior ordinance, however, are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mootness is \"the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\"\n   <em>\n    Arizonans for Official English v.

The Sixth Circuit interpreted this standard to mean that a plaintiff must have a \"\n   <em>\n    viable\n   </em>\n   claim for damages\" to proceed with a \u00a7 1983 case, where the defendant has mooted a claim for injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490177\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/1/#p9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Oakwood argues that a claim for nominal damages alone cannot overcome the mootness doctrine. Plaintiffs counter that a claim for nominal damages is sufficient, but, in any event, they also allege actual damages. The Court agrees that Plaintiffs allege both nominal and actual damages, therefore it need not resolve whether a claim for nominal damages alone saves this case from the mootness doctrine. Plaintiffs claim to have suffered actual damages when they were allegedly coerced into consenting to a warrantless inspection and paying a $60 fee for that service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Oakwood appears to rely on the Sixth Circuit's statement in\n   <em>\n    Gottfried\n   </em>\n   that a remaining claim for damages does not overcome the mootness doctrine if it is \"so insubstantial or so clearly foreclosed by prior decisions that th[e] case may not proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    Gottfried\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395011\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/684/#p691\">\n    280 F.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' payment of the $60 fee is a concrete and substantial harm. The Sixth Circuit's use of the term \"insubstantial\" in\n   <em>\n    Gottfried\n   </em>\n   does not suggest otherwise. In\n   <em>\n    Gottfried\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit stated that the \"key question\" in applying this standard was whether the plaintiff had a viable claim for damages.\n   <em>\n    Gottfried\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395011\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/684/#p691\">\n    280 F.3d at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Viability and substantiality are two different things. It may be that a claim for actual damages can be so small or insubstantial that the Sixth Circuit would disregard it for standing purposes, but that question was not addressed in\n   <em>\n    Gottfried\n   </em>\n   . Nor does Oakwood cite any other authority compelling the conclusion that the $60 fee should be disregarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Oakwood's second argument is that no constitutional violation occurred because Plaintiffs consented to the inspection of their property. This argument touches on another issue raised by Oakwood, which is whether the Court should consider Plaintiffs' as-applied challenge before their facial challenge. Courts typically address an as-applied challenge first because it is a narrower claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ohio Citizen Action v. City of Englewood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873975\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/564/#p571\">\n    671 F.3d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571 (6th Cir. 2012) (\"The usual judicial practice is to address an as-applied challenge before a facial challenge ... this sequencing decreases the odds that facial attacks will be addressed unnecessarily.\"). If the as-applied challenge fails, then there is no need to consider the facial challenge, which tests whether the statute is unconstitutional in all instances. Here, however, both the as-applied claim and facial claim turn on the same question-whether or not a property owner could voluntarily consent to a pre-sale inspection where the governing ordinance makes it a criminal offense not to do so and refusing an inspection results in the denial of a certificate of occupancy. The parties dispute many factual issues relating to the nature of Plaintiffs' consent, none of which would be material if the Court determines that any consent under Oakwood's ordinance was not valid under the Fourth Amendment.

The caselaw cited by Plaintiffs is persuasive. The Court agrees that an Oakwood property owner could not have provided voluntary consent under the prior ordinance because failure to do so could result in denial of a certificate of occupancy and a criminal penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Oakwood argues that the ordinance's criminal penalty was not coercive because Oakwood never enforced it against any property owner. (Doc. # 50-1, PAGEID # 4044.) Oakwood further asserts that \"if Oakwood homeowners had objected to the inspection, the inspection would not occur, and any potential defects would simply transfer to the buyer.\" (Doc. # 50-2, PAGEID # 4046-4047.) Even if these facts are undisputed, they do not remove the coerciveness of Oakwood's ordinance. When evaluating the validity of an individual's consent under the Fourth Amendment, the Sixth Circuit has stated that \"not any type of consent will suffice, but instead, only consent that is 'unequivocally, specifically, and intelligently given, uncontaminated by any duress and coercion.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Worley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11562595\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/380/#p386\">\n    193 F.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386 (6th Cir. 1999) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tillman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11296348\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/137/#p143\">\n    963 F.2d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 143 (6th Cir. 1992) ). A person cannot provide such uncontaminated consent when refusal to do so empowers the municipal authority to deny him the right to sell his property (or make it very difficult for him to find a willing buyer and title insurance company) and prosecute him for a criminal misdemeanor. Here, even if Oakwood has never denied a certificate of occupancy or enforced the criminal provisions of its ordinance, all that it would take is a change in policy for that to occur. In such circumstances, the mere possibility of such action is enough to render any consent involuntary as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Oakwood's third argument is that Plaintiffs rely on inadmissible evidence and fail to address the history of the pre-sale inspection ordinance. The Court struck three unsigned declarations submitted by Plaintiffs, who then corrected that error with the Court's leave. The Court also granted Defendants leave to depose Gayle Hites, the author of one of the declarations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Ms. Hites' deposition, Defendants filed a Supplemental Memorandum (Doc. 73) containing evidentiary objections to several assertions in her declaration. The Court has not relied on the challenged assertions, however, in determining that Oakwood's prior ordinance violated the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the Court sets those objections aside. Oakwood's arguments regarding the authority of Plaintiffs' real estate agent to consent on Plaintiffs' behalf are also immaterial in light of the Court's determination that any consent under the prior ordinance was not valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Oakwood further asserts that, from 1968 to 1992, its pre-sale inspection program contained a warrant provision and that its omission in 1992 was unintentional. Subsequent email correspondence between Plaintiffs and Kroger, however, show that\n   Oakwood relied on the mandatory nature of the inspection, and the possibility of criminal prosecution for non-compliance, when working with sellers. (Doc. 1-5 at PAGEID # 34.) Regardless of these disputes of fact, Oakwood has not shown the legal significance of its intent to the disposition of Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, Oakwood claims that Kroger, its code enforcement officer, is entitled to qualified immunity. Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, \"government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n   <em>\n    Harlow v.

A reasonable person may have concluded, as this Court has, that a property owner could not voluntarily consent to an inspection under Oakwood's prior ordinance. Yet, because the binding precedent did not specifically\n   address the effect of a property owner's consent in such circumstances, a reasonable person also may have concluded that he could avoid the ordinance's constitutional issues by obtaining consent to an inspection. Thus, in light of these possible outcomes, it cannot be said that \"a reasonable person would have known\" that conducting an inspection, even with the property owner's consent, constituted a violation of Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    Harlow v.

(Doc. 12 at \u00b6 79.) In response, Oakwood asserts that it never, in fact, denied a certificate of occupancy to any property owner for failure to consent to an inspection. (Doc. 52 at 16.) If a seller did not comply with the pre-sale inspection requirement, then the obligation to submit to an inspection passed to the buyer.

The violation occurred when Oakwood presented Plaintiffs the choice between agreeing to an inspection and being denied a certificate of occupancy. If Oakwood had denied a certificate of occupancy, then that fact would be a consideration in arguing damages.

(Doc. 12 at \u00b6 99-110.) Oakwood argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on this claim because the doctrine of unjust enrichment does not apply to a political subdivision under Ohio law.

To be a member of Plaintiffs' proposed class, an individual or business must have (1) sold a house within the City of Oakwood since May 25, 2010; and (2) paid pre-sale inspection fees to the City of Oakwood in conjunction with the sale of the house.

Oakwood contends that the proposed class does not meet this prerequisite because (1) two-thirds of its members will be eliminated with the failure of the unjust enrichment claim; (2) realtors, not homeowners, often paid the $60 fee for the pre-sale inspection; and (3) many proposed class members consented to the pre-sale inspection.

Defendants argue that there are fewer class members than suggested by the above chart, however, because realtors paid the pre-sale inspection fee for some applications.

Even if half of the class were eliminated, it would still include hundreds of individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Lastly, Defendants assert that, with the exception of Plaintiffs, all of the class members consented to the pre-sale inspections and therefore do not have valid claims.

In addition, at least some putative class members have sold their homes and moved from Oakwood. Plaintiffs submitted the affidavit of one such individual, who now resides in Colorado. (Doc. 65-1 at PAGEID # 4273.) It is unlikely that such class members would be motivated to return to Ohio to litigate this case, especially in light of the small sums at issue. The small amount of any likely recovery when compared to the burden and cost of the litigation further supports the finding that\n   joinder is impracticable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Putnam v.

Newberg &amp; Alba Conte,\n   <em>\n    Newberg on Class Actions\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 3.10, at 3-50 (3d ed. 1992) ). Therefore, the existence of common issues, or just a single issue, is sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   This requirement is easily met in this case. The Court has determined that the pre-sale inspection ordinance was unconstitutional on its face, an issue identical as to all class members regardless of their particular circumstances. All class members would also be subject to Oakwood's assertion of sovereign immunity against the unjust enrichment claim. These common questions satisfy Rule 23(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Typicality of Claims or Defenses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In order to satisfy Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3), the claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of the claims or defenses of the class. The Sixth Circuit has held that \"a plaintiff's claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members, and if his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Am. Med.

Plaintiffs' claims meet this requirement for the same reasons that they meet the commonality requirement discussed above. Their facial challenge to the ordinance and restitution claim are identical to those asserted by every class member. The typicality requirement is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Named Plaintiffs' Protection of the Interests of the Class\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Rule 23(a)(4) allows certification only if the class representatives also \"will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). This requirement has two criteria: \"1) the representative must have common interests with unnamed members of the class, and 2) it must appear that the representatives will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Senter v. General Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10590762\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/532/511/\">\n    532 F.2d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (6th Cir. 1976). Here, Plaintiffs' interests are aligned with those of the unnamed class members. Both Plaintiffs and the unnamed class members sold real estate in Oakwood during the period when its ordinance did not have an administrative warrant procedure and carried a criminal penalty for non-compliance. Plaintiffs and the class members (or their agents) paid the $60 fee for the pre-sale inspection, had the pre-sale inspection completed, and sold their properties. Plaintiffs and the class members thus have the same interest in pursuing Oakwood for violation of their constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   As to the second criterion, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel. They engaged counsel experienced with these types of matters and participated in the discovery process. Their counsel, the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, is a public interest law firm organized under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code whose mission is the protection of Ohioans' constitutional rights. Thus far, Plaintiffs' counsel have demonstrated their familiarity with the issues raised and ability to prosecute the claims of the class in a diligent manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class under Rule 23(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Rule 23(b) Requirements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that class certification is proper under Rule 23(b)(1), (2), and (3). The amendment of Oakwood's ordinance mooted Plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief, however, making certification under Rule 23(b)(1) or (2) less likely to be appropriate. Regardless, certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate because, in light of the Court's ruling on the motions for summary judgment, common questions predominate over any questions affecting only individual members and a class action is the superior method for adjudication of Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Court's determination that Oakwood's ordinance was unconstitutional on its face removes the individual questions-for example, concerning the voluntariness of consent-that might have precluded certification under Rule 23(b)(3). The most salient individual issue remaining is the question of whether the class members or their respective real estate agents paid the $60 fee. Plaintiffs claim that this question may be resolved, as a factual matter, by reviewing Oakwood's records. Without prejudging the issue, it might be appropriate for Plaintiffs to later move to certify subclasses-one containing those individuals who paid the fee themselves, and another containing those individuals whose agents paid the fee. The parties also may litigate how the identity of the payer affects damages, but this potential split in the class is manageable and does not preclude certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Other considerations include the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A). As previously mentioned, the low stakes of this litigation, at least for each individual class member, make it highly unlikely that any of them would be interested in pursuing a separate action. The Court is not aware of any other litigation concerning Oakwood's prior ordinance. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(B). In addition, concentrating the litigation of Plaintiffs' claims in this forum is desirable. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(4)(C). While class members may be located across Ohio or the United States, Oakwood is within this District and only a few minutes from the federal courthouse where this action will be tried. Lastly, this class action should not be difficult to manage. The biggest burden appears to be the identification of the class members and the identity of who paid the inspection fees from Oakwood's records. Plaintiffs' counsel should be able to handle that burden and effectively manage any other minor issues that might arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Oakwood also argues that the proposed class is overly broad because it includes all persons who sold houses within six years of the filing of this action. This argument is based on the difference between the two-year statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 actions in Ohio and the six-year statute of limitations for unjust enrichment claims.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banks v.

P. 23(b)(3) :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   All individuals and businesses that have (1) sold houses within the City of Oakwood since May 25, 2010; and (2) paid pre-sale inspection fees to the City of Oakwood in conjunction with the sale of their houses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In the next few days, the Courtroom Deputy will contact the parties' counsel to schedule a conference call regarding the next steps in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in Dayton, Ohio, this Thursday, February 8, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    The facts in this section are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    Plaintiffs also request a declaratory judgment that certain fees and \"monetary assessments\" relating to the pre-sale inspection program should be refunded and an order directing Oakwood to return the pre-sale inspection fees paid by Plaintiffs. The Court bifurcated this case, however, between issues relating to liability and those relating to damages. (Doc. 20.) Plaintiffs' requests relating to damages are not before the Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Neither Oakwood nor Plaintiffs expressly define what constitutes \"nominal\" damages, but it is worth reviewing. Nominal damages are \"[a] trifling sum awarded when a legal injury is suffered but there is no substantial loss or injury to be compensated.\"\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    473 (10th ed. 2014). In contrast, actual damages are \"[a]n amount awarded to a complainant to compensate for a proven injury or loss; damages that repay actual losses.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 471. The legal definition of \"nominal\" should also be contrasted with how that term is used in everyday speech. Specifically, \"the word [nominal] has taken on the sense of 'very little.' \" Bryan A. Garner,\n    <em>\n     Garner's Modern American Usage\n    </em>\n    551 (Oxford Univ. Press 2003). Thus, \"what is\n    <em>\n     nominal\n    </em>\n    may be real but not significant.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Thus, in everyday speech, someone might refer to a small amount of actual damages as \"nominal,\" but such usage would be incorrect in the legal sense. Nominal damages are not a kind of actual damages; nominal damages are awarded when actual damages are not available or cannot be proven. Here, Plaintiffs seek actual damages, i.e., compensation for injuries they actually incurred. They seek nominal damages if they are unable to prove actual damages.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    The Court was delayed in its consideration of the parties' motions for summary judgment in large part due to the belated disclosure of Ms. Hites as a witness, which caused Defendants to request leave to take her deposition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Plaintiffs do not dispute that their agent consented on their behalf; they deny only that such consent was voluntary under the Fourth Amendment. (Doc. 54 at 9.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    Plaintiffs did not assert the claim for unjust enrichment/restitution against Kroger.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
