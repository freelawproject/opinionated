The Consolidated Complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Defendants CannaVest, Michael Mona, Jr., Bart P. Mackay, Theodore R. Sobieski, and Edward A. Wilson (the \"CannaVest Defendants\") have moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (Dkt. No. 81) Defendant Stuart Titus has likewise moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). (Dkt. No. 108)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CannaVest Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not pled facts establishing (1) loss causation; (2) a strong inference of scienter; or (3) a claim for control person liability against the individual Defendants. (Def. Br. (Dkt. No. 81) ) Titus contends that he cannot be held responsible for any misstatements made by CannaVest, and that Plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to establish (1) scienter; (2) a market manipulation claim; or (3) a control person liability claim, (Titus Br. (Dkt. No. 109) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately\n   alleged material misstatements and omissions. The misstatements and omissions claim against Mackay, Sobieski, and Titus will be dismissed, however, because Plaintiffs have not alleged-under the \"group pleading doctrine\"-that these Defendants were actively involved in the day-to-day management of CannaVest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As to Plaintiffs' market manipulation claim, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not alleged market activity. Accordingly, Plaintiffs market manipulation claim will be dismissed as to all Defendants,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Finally, as to control person liability, Plaintiffs have not pled facts demonstrating that Sobieski controlled CannaVest, and have likewise not pled facts demonstrating that Titus was a \"culpable participant.\" Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Section 20(a) claim against Sobieski and Titus will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants' motions to dismiss will otherwise be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In reviewing the price that the Company's common stock was trading at during the year, subsequent to March 31, 2013, management determined that using a per share price to value the Transaction may not represent a hue measure of the fair market value of the Transaction and that obtaining a valuation of the assets purchased from PhytoSPHERE would be required in order to determine the fair market value of the business acquired.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Similarly, as to the Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2013, CannaVest filed an amended Form 10-Q disclosing that it had overstated intangible assets in connection with the PhytoSphere transaction by $1,837,387. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100) And in its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2013, CannaVest had reported $4,466,666 in intangible assets and an impairment to goodwill of $26,998,125. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103) On April 24 2014, CannaVest amended this 10-Q to disclose that it had overstated the $4,466,666 of intangible assets acquired in connection with the PhytoSphere transaction by $904,666, and that it had understated goodwill in connection with the PhytoSphere transaction by $1,855,512.

Plaintiffs contend that Defendants never believed that the PhytoSphere transaction had a fair market value of $35 million. (Consol. Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 61) \u00b6 31, at 16-17 (quoting press article stating that the parties to the transaction set \"an arbitrary price of $35 million, and said it was all going to be paid in [CannaVest] stock and not cash.

This Court finds that there is a \"substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact\"-that the announced $35 million price was never the true value of the PhytoSphere transaction and that Defendants never believed that the transaction had a value of $35 million-\"would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the 'total mix' of information made available.' \"\n   <em>\n    Basic Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101), and its restatement as to the third quarter of 2013, CannaVest reported that 100% of its revenue of $163,662 was from affiliates of Medical Marijuana, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107) The fact that 100% of CannaVest's revenue for a nine-month period in 2013 came from CannaVest shareholders, rather than outside buyers, satisfies the materiality prong for pleading purposes,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs have alleged that CannaVest represented that its financial statements complied with GAAP when they did not.

Specifically, immediately upon viewing the most recent quarterly statement (2013 Q1), CW 1 noticed that CannaVest was improperly amortizing goodwill from the PhytoSphere acquisition, which CW 1 recognized as improper accounting. However, CW 1 said, the specific\n   restatement could not be known until a full audit had been conducted. \"I knew we were going to have to get a re-evaluation on the assets, but I didn't want to restate with incomplete information,\" CW 1 said.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   According to the Consolidated Complaint,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   CW 1 said the discussion about the need to restate began after CW 1 's arrival in May 2013 and that it took place between CW 1 and Defendant CEO Mona, Jr, and the members of the Company's Board of Directors....

Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 61) \u00b6 27), approximately two months before CW-1 started her work at the Company, As a member of the Board, it is a reasonable inference from the Consolidated Complaint that he would have been made aware in May 2013, by CW-1, of the need for CannaVest to restate its financials, It is also a fair inference that Wilson, as a Board member, would have been made aware of the May 14, 2013 letter from the\n   outgoing auditor concerning the deficiencies in the Company's internal financial controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The scienter evidence against Wilson involves more than his position on CannaVest's board, however. Wilson is a certified public accountant (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16), and is the president of his own accounting firm, Wilson &amp; Company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84) The Consolidated Complaint alleges-based on information supplied by CW-1-that Wilson &amp; Company oversaw the initial transaction with PhytoSphere and the valuation of goodwill, and improperly amortized the goodwill. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85) Accordingly, Wilson was in a position to directly influence the accounting treatment of the PhytoSphere transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The alleged egregious accounting treatment and lack of internal controls support a strong inference of scienter against Wilson, given that he was a certified public accountant with his own accounting firm, and played a direct role in CannaVest's accounting, particularly as to the PhytoSphere transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to establish scienter as to both Mona and Wilson.

On April 3, 2014, CannaVest filed a Form 8-K announcing that it had misreported its financial condition in Form 10-Qs for the first, second, and third quarters of 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116) That same day, the Company's shares fell $7.30, or more than 20%, to close at $25.30 per share. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117) On April 14, 2014, CannaVest filed an amended Form 8-K, providing more detail concerning its restatements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119) That day, CannaVest's stock fell $4.49 per share, or 19.5%, to close at $18.51 per share. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Defendants argue that the alleged misstatements regarding the value of the PhytoSphere transaction cannot support loss causation, because CannaVest had already written down the value of the goodwill associated with that transaction to zero. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. (Dkt. No. 81) at 17-18) As discussed earlier, however, there is a difference between a legitimate-but mistaken-valuation of a transaction at $35 million, and a fraudulent over-valuation of that same transaction at the outset. A reasonable investor may view these two scenarios quite differently, because only one scenario involves fraud. The Court concludes that the impairment to goodwill announced by CannaVest does not undermine Plaintiffs' loss causation arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Defendants also contend that the price of CannaVest stock was volatile during the period of the corrective disclosures, and that accordingly the price declines are attributable to broader market forces and\n   not to the corrective disclosures. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. (Dkt. No. 81) at 19-20) In\n   <em>\n    Acticon AG v.

The [district] court reasoned that determining why a stock's price rebounded after an initial drop requires the court to consider \"a competing theory of causation and raises factual questions not suitable for resolution on a motion to dismiss.\" We agree with the [district] court's analysis on this point. The defendants here argue that the rebound in share price demonstrates that the market was unfazed by the alleged corrective disclosures, so the disclosures were unrelated to Acticon's ultimate loss. At this stage in the litigation, we do not resolve why the NEP's share price rose after its initial fall and instead, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Acticon, assume that the price rose for reasons unrelated to its initial drop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704059\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/503/611/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 39-40 (citing\n   <em>\n    Malin v.

CannaVest also issued 900,000 of its shares to PhytoSphere as part of that\n   deal. The whole transaction was somewhat like the episode of Beavis and Butthead in which the two teenagers sell all their chocolate bars to each other for the same pair of dollars.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   In a glowing press release dated March 1, 2013, Medical Marijuana Inc. announced that it was selling its subsidiary PhytoSphere (which processed the hemp paste from abroad) to CannaVest for $35 million in \"CANV\" shares.

In any event, Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to make out such a claim here. Plaintiffs do not allege that the manner in which CannaVest issued the 900,000 shares it used to consummate the PhytoSphere transaction with Medical Marijuana, Inc. was manipulative or deceptive. As the Consolidated Complaint makes clear, Plaintiff's objection to this transaction is that its value was overstated, not that the trading of CannaVest shares in connection the transaction was somehow manipulative, (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consol. Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 61) \u00b6\u00b6 3-4) Misstatements and omissions affect how market participants value a security's stock, of course, but if this effect were alone sufficient to plead a market manipulation claim, virtually all misstatement or omissions claims could be pled as market manipulation claims. The courts' insistence on proof of market activity prevents these two theories of liability from becoming duplicative. Because Plaintiffs have not pled facts demonstrating misconduct beyond misstatements and omissions, under\n   <em>\n    ATSI Communications\n   </em>\n   they have not pled a market manipulation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   This analysis has been applied by other courts in this District.

Mar, 7, 2008), TPG and Apax bought TIM Hellas, a subsidiary of Telecom Italia. A minority shareholder, TCS Capital, was squeezed out by this merger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-9. TCS sued under both a misstatements and omissions theory and a market manipulation theory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Plaintiff allege[d] that defendants Apax and TPG intended to buy out TCS at an artificially low price. To accomplish their goal, they allegedly (1) negotiated and executed a \"secret deal\" with Telecom Italia to buy the majority of TIM Hellas stock at a price that did not fairly reflect what [TPG and Apax] knew was the true value of the company, and (2) implemented\n   a series of \"deceptive practices\" to conceal their fraud and ensure the success of their scheme.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In dismissing TCS's market manipulation claim, the court concluded that it was nothing more than a gussied up misstatements and omissions claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   The Telecom Italia deal was not a wash sale or a matched order. Rather, the \"deception\" lies in the alleged failure to disclose the \"real terms\" of the deal-terms that presumably put more money per share in Telecom Italia's pocket than the \u20ac16.4 that Buyers paid to acquire the stock from Telecom Italia [based on an undisclosed royalty agreement].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   As should be apparent, this so-called \"deception\" is nothing more than a reiteration of the misrepresentations and omissions that underlie plaintiff's disclosure claim. Plaintiff merely re-labels the alleged misstatements and omissions as \"manipulative and deceptive conduct.\" This sleight of hand does not magically transform its disclosure claim into a market manipulation claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704059\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/503/611/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Here, the claimed deception is CannaVest's alleged fraudulent valuation of the PhytoSphere transaction at $35 million.

Similarly here, it would make little sense to hold that Plaintiffs have pled a primary violation against a defendant but have not adequately pled \"culpable participation\" by that same defendant in the same course of conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   As to Mackay, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled his \"culpable participation.\" As a member of the Board, it is a reasonable inference from the Consolidated Complaint that he would have been made aware in May 2013, by CW-1, of the need for CannaVest to restate its financials. It is also a fair inference that Mackay, as a Board member, would have been made aware of the May 14, 2013 letter from the outgoing auditor concerning the deficiencies in the Company's internal financial controls. These allegations are sufficient to plead \"culpable participation\" as against Mackay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The Consolidated Complaint does not, however, adequately allege \"culpable participation\" as against Titus. Although Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a number of material misstatements and omissions based on CannaVest's financial reporting, Plaintiffs have not pled facts demonstrating that Titus was a participant in those misstatements or omissions. Plaintiffs contend that Titus was a paid consultant and advisor to CannaVest (Pltf. Opp. (Dkt. No. 111) at 25 (citing Consol. Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 61) \u00b6 17) ); that he owned 7.1% of CannaVest's shares (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Consol. Cmplt. \u00b6 17) ); that a subsidiary of Medical Marijuana, Inc. was the exclusive master distributor and marketing company for CannaVest (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Consol Cmplt. \u00b6\u00b6 40, 110) ); and that Medical Marijuana, Inc. and its affiliates were CannaVest's sole customers during the class period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Consol. Cmplt. \u00b6\u00b6 95, 101, 107) Plaintiffs further contend that Medical Marijuana, Inc. issued numerous press statements \"touting CannaVest and its recently acquired assets of PhytoSphere.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Consol. Cmplt. \u00b6\u00b6 33-42) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that \"viewed in their totality,\" these facts make it plausible that Titus was engaged in deliberate or reckless illegal behavior, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26) According to Plaintiffs, \"Titus was in a position to know the true facts regarding the exorbitant valuation of PhytoSphere, yet repeatedly issued statements touting the benefits and value of the PhytoSphere deal.\" (Pltf. Opp. (Dkt. No. 111) at 26) But Titus's control over the statements of Medical Marijuana, Inc. does not demonstrate his involvement in CannaVest's material misstatements and omissions, and Plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to demonstrate that Titus was involved in CannaVest's misstatements and omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Nor do Titus's stock sales demonstrate his \"culpable participation.\" As discussed above, \"unusual or suspicious\" trading activity\n   may support an inference of scienter, Here, however, Plaintiffs have shown only that Titus sold 10% of his CannaVest shares between January 2013 and March 2013.

Mar. 27, 2013), a case premised on a \"fraudulent and deceptive scheme\" theory of liability. The court found that, \"[t]o state a claim that a defendant has engaged in a fraudulent or deceptive scheme in violation of Rule 10b-5(a) and (c), a plaintiff must allege a defendant (1) committed a deceptive or manipulative act, (2) with the requisite scienter, (3) that the act affected the market for securities or was otherwise in connection with their purchase or sale, and that (4) defendant's actions caused the plaintiffs injuries.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *11. Nothing in that recitation undermines the proposition that there must be conduct separate from the conduct that underlies a material misstatements and omissions claim to support a claim under Rule 10b-5(a) or (c). Moreover, the conduct alleged in that case-that defendants originated or acquired residential mortgages, repackaged them into mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, and sold the products with knowledge that they carried more risk than they told the market,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at * 1 -likely constitutes \"market activity.\" The court summarized plaintiffs' claims as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n    Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud investors by increasing short term revenues and inflating Deutsche Bank's stock price by taking mortgages of substandard quality and pooling them into [residential backed mortgage securities (RMBS) ] and [collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) ]. Those RMBS and CDOs were then sold to investors-generating short term profits, which, in turn, made the stock more attractive. Plaintiffs allege that defendants had specific knowledge of the poor quality of the mortgages underlying the RMBS and CDOs-and that they demonstrated this knowledge by authorizing [Deutsche Bank's top global RMBS trader] to take and expand a multi-billion dollar short position on RMBS and CDOs (some number of which were structured and sold by Deutsche Bank). This short position only made sense-and only made money-as the value of the RMBS and CDOs declined. According to plaintiffs, defendants asked [the trader] to provide specific information supporting this short position (that is, why he expected CDOs to decline in value), and such information was provided. In addition, plaintiffs allege that despite knowing that [a Deutsche Bank subsidiary] was engaged in poor lending practices (which were packaged into RMBS and CDOs) they nonetheless repeatedly reassured investors that their credit and lending practices were conservative and being adhered to.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    Finally, Plaintiffs rely on two out-of-circuit cases-\n    <em>\n     In re Galena Biopharma, Inc.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358307\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/117/1145/\">\n     117 F.Supp.3d 1145\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.
