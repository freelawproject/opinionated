MOON, SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This diversity case is before the Court on the question of personal jurisdiction over Defendant Beverly Hills Porsche (Beverly Hills).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff Eugene Reed alleges claims of breach of contract, violation of Virginia's Consumer Protection Act, and fraud stemming from his purchase of a Porsche from Beverly Hills. Plaintiff initially contacted Beverly Hills through its website, kicking off remote negotiations by phone, email, and text message. Beverly Hills sent an agreement to Plaintiff in Virginia, which he signed. The contract calls for the application of California law, and Plaintiff's agent picked up the car directly from the dealership in California. Beverly Hills only rarely sells cars to Virginia residents, it has no physical presence in the Commonwealth, it does not advertise specifically there, and both its dealership agreement and website indicate that California is its primary area of responsibility. Based on these and other facts, personal jurisdiction is lacking, so the Beverly Hills' motion to dismiss will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The standard of review for personal jurisdiction issues \"varies according to\n   the posture of the case and the evidence that has been presented to the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Grayson v.

They then filed supplemental briefs in which they presented their arguments and evidence to the Court. Lastly, the Court afforded the parties an opportunity to be heard at oral argument. Given this procedural history, the\n   <em>\n    Grayson\n   </em>\n   preponderance of the evidence standard applies. Moreover, neither party suggests that there are any material jurisdictional facts both in dispute and intertwined with the merits, so the Court itself sits as finder of the jurisdictional facts. The Court thus finds the following jurisdictional facts by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff began searching for a car in the fall of 2016; he sought a used car with a certified pre-owned warranty. (Dkt. 15-1 \u00b6 3). He had purchased Porsche vehicles previously, and from his experience was aware of the \"Porsche Approved Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle warranty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). He accessed the website of Defendant Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (PCNA) and entered specifications for the kind of car he desired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). Over time, PCNA would then generate emails to Plaintiff informing him of Porsche dealerships possessing vehicles that met his specifications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). PCNA's emails invited Plaintiff to contact the relevant dealership(s) and provided contact information for them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It was through this process Plaintiff learned of the car owned by Defendant\n   Beverly Hills, a PCNA dealership. When Beverly Hills has a car, it uploads the car's specifications into PCNA's database, which then \"populates\" the information on both PCNA's and Beverly Hills' websites, both of which are designed by PCNA. (Dkt. 41 at 23-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beverly Hills does not have offices, agents, or employees in Virginia, has never owned or leased property in Virginia, and does not advertise specifically within Virginia. (Dkt. 8-1 \u00b6 4). Relatedly, the standard provisions of PCNA's dealership agreement provide that a dealership has a \"Primary Area of Responsibility,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a geographical area determined solely by PCNA. (Dkt. 41 at 48-49; dkt. 42 at ECF 37). A dealership, though, \"may\" sell products outside of that area provided that (1) it satisfies other best-practice-type requirements and (2) \"such sales are within the 50 United States.\" (Dkt. 42 at ECF 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Beverly Hills' primary area of responsibility is the greater Los Angeles area. (Dkt. 81; dkt. 42-1 at 2). This affects, among other things, where Beverly Hills is permitted to advertise. For instance, the \"2017 Porsche Dealer Marketing Covenant &amp; PDMS Guidelines,\" which are issued by PCNA and applicable to Beverly Hills, provide that \"[d]ealers are to place their marketing, irrespective of the message, only within their Primary Area of Responsibility.\" (Dkt. 43-1 at ECF 9). The Guidelines state that \"[a]dvertising language promoting nationwide delivery ... is not permitted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 8). Furthermore, the Guidelines apply to Internet advertising, \"including [the observance of] rules of Geographic Market Areas and Primary Areas of Representation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Through one of PCNA's emails, Plaintiff learned that Beverly Hills had a car fitting his desired specifications. (Dkt. 15-1 \u00b6 4). PCNA's email directed Plaintiff to contact Beverly Hills if he was interested in the car, which he did by filling out a form on the dealership's website. (Dkt. 8-1 \u00b6 8; dkt. 41 at 39). Beverly Hills' website is www.beverlyhillsporsche.com. The website contains information about cars and can be used to initiate contact with Beverly Hills, but it cannot be used to transact business. (Dkt. 8-1 \u00b6 7). On the whole, the website conveys an emphasis on serving the greater Los Angeles area. The bottom left-hand side of the webpage states that Beverly Hills is a \"local source\" for Porsche products and is \"centrally located\" to Los Angeles. The parties have not directed the Court to any portion of the website that refers to Virginia or any other state besides California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A mainstay tab in the upper right-hand corner has an \"email\" link, which then generates fields for entry. Plaintiff used this form, providing his name, email address, and phone number, and indicating he was \"interested in further details\" about the car in question. (8-1 \u00b6 8.). Submission of the online form generated a notification to Beverly Hills, who then assigned a salesman to Plaintiff's inquiry. (dkt. 8-1 \u00b6 8; dkt. 8-2 \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The salesman responded to Plaintiff email on May 1, 2017, thanking Plaintiff for his interest. (Dkt. 8-2 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; dkt. 15-1 at ECF 8-9). The two men then began negotiating-exchanging phone calls, text messages, and approximately 20 emails-but they never met in person. (Dkt. 8-2 \u00b6 3; dkt. 15-1 at ECF 8-19). Indeed, Plaintiff informed the salesman early in their negotiations that he could not visit the dealership because he lived in central Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 2, 2017, the salesman had Beverly Hills prepare the sales contract and overnight it to Plaintiff in Virginia. (Dkt 8-2 \u00b6 4). Plaintiff signed the contract in Virginia and sent it back, at which point Beverly Hills signed it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The contract\n   states that \"[f]ederal law and California law apply to this contract.\" (Dkt. 8-2 at ECF 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The salesman, at Plaintiff's request, provided Plaintiff with instructions on how to wire funds to Beverly Hills' bank. (Dkt. 8-2 \u00b6 5). Despite being told that Beverly Hills could deliver across the country, (dkt. 15-1 \u00b6 4), Plaintiff made independent arrangements with a local California towing company to transport the car; the company picked up the vehicle from Beverly Hills and delivered it to Plaintiff in Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6; dkt. 8-1 \u00b6 9). After the salesman and Plaintiff had reached an understanding regarding the purchase, Plaintiff wrote to request a \"Beverly Hills Porsche lic[ense] plate frame\" and \"a mug or cup\" because the car was \"gonna b[e] a big deal in Forest[,] VA.\" (Dkt. 15-1 at ECF 18). When the car arrived in Virginia, it allegedly did not meet the promised specifications, so Plaintiff's wife contacted Beverly Hills and PCNA to demand a refund, to no avail. (Dkt. 15-1. \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260068,4176590\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/262/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ECF 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although the \"vast majority\" of Beverly Hills' sales are to local California residents, when the opportunity arises the dealership is \"not reluctant to sell a vehicle in California to someone who lives in Virginia.\" (Dkt. 42-1 at 4; dkt. 41 at 27, 36;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39). Between 2013 and 2017, Beverly Hills sold five cars to Virginia customers, with none in 2014 and 2016. (Dkt. 42-1. at 5). The total amount of these five sales was approximately $440,000, equating to roughly 0.1% of combined sales for the 2013, 2015, and 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). From January 2000 to July 2017, Beverly Hills sold over 22,000 cars, only nine of which (0.0402%) were sold to Virginia buyers. (Dkt. 8-1 \u00b6 5). It has never leased cars to any Virginia resident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The personal jurisdiction inquiry consists of, first, determining whether that state's long-arm statute reaches the defendant and, second, whether that reach is consistent with the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    Base Metal Trading, Ltd. v.

Beverly Hills' position is that the complaint \"does not allege breach of warranty\" but of contract, and thus subsection (A)(5) \"on its face is inapplicable.\" (Dkt. 18 at ECF 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   dkt. 43 at 2, 15 (\"Plaintiff has not even alleged a cause of action for breach of warranty.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The issue is whether-for purposes of the long-arm statute-the breach of contract claim in Count 1 can be characterized as a \"breach of warranty expressly or impliedly made.\" Virginia's long-arm statute does not define a \"warranty,\" and there is a paucity of Virginia law on the precise difference between a breach of contract and breach of warranty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few Virginia\n   trial courts observe in passing that breach of warranty and breach of contract are separate claims.\n   <em>\n    Newman v.

That is the situation here. While labeled \"Breach of Contract,\" the substantive allegations in the complaint (as well as the details of Plaintiff affidavit) contemplate a warranty, specifically failure to comply with the \" 'Porsche Approved Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle' Warranty\" and \"110-point checklist.\" Moreover, the contract seemingly envisions the incorporation of at least some warranties. Although it disclaims all warranties not in writing, it observes that if, as was the case here, \"the Seller has sold you a certified used vehicle, the warranty of merchantability is not disclaimed.\" (Dkt. 8-2 at ECF 7, \u00a7 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although the question is a close one, the Court believes that Plaintiff's claim, based on both how it is pled and the facts presented in Plaintiff's affidavit, is sufficient to fall within the term \"warranty\" in subsection (A)(5).

Dkt. 8-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (3).\n   <em>\n    Initiation of dealings.\n   </em>\n   The Court finds that Plaintiff initiated the business dealings with Beverly Hills by messaging it through its website. (Dkt. 8-2 \u00b6 2; dkt. 15-1 \u00b6 4). He contacted Beverly Hills specifically because it had the type of car he wanted. The record also supports the inference that he reached out to Beverly Hills for its brand recognition. (Dkt. 15-1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 &amp; ECF 18).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Beverly Hills actually initiated the dealings by reaching out,\n   <em>\n    through its association with PCNA\n   </em>\n   , into Virginia to solicit business. Specifically, Beverly Hills uploaded information about the car into PCNA's database, and PCNA then generated the email to Plaintiff directing him to contact the dealership directly if he was interested in its inventory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But this argument is too thin. The fact of the matter is that all Beverly Hills did was supply its inventory data to PCNA. What PCNA did with that information was its business. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 41 at 32-33). Moreover, PCNA and Beverly Hills have a basic franchisor-franchisee relationship, in which PCNA, to some extent, controls the actions of Beverly Hills, not the other way around. (Dkt. 42 at at ECF 9-12, 17-18). All in all, the initiation of the business transaction between Beverly Hills and Plaintiff occurred when Plaintiff emailed Beverly Hills specifically about the car, not when PCNA emailed Plaintiff merely mentioning it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, this factor favors Beverly Hills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (4).\n   <em>\n    Significant/long-term activities\n   </em>\n   . Beverly Hills' historical business activity in Virginia is modest, and Plaintiff has put forward no evidence suggesting Beverly Hills has ongoing business concerns in the Commonwealth. In the 17 years prior to this lawsuit, Beverly Hills sold only 9 cars (or 0.04% of its total sales) to Virginia buyers and has never leased a car to a Virginian. (Dkt. 8-1 \u00b6 5). Five of those sales occurred between 2013 and 2017. (Dkt. 42-1 at 5). Beverly Hills also furnished evidence that it sent 9 emails over the five-year period to potential customers in Virginia who did not purchase cars. (Dkt. 52-1 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Beverly Hills is willing to sell to Virginia customers, but its primary area of responsibility as assigned by PCNA is greater Los Angeles. (Dkt. 41 at 48-49; dkt. 42 at ECF 12, 37; dkt. 42-1 at 2, 4). According to its Director of Operations, the \"vast majority\" of Beverly Hills' sales are to California residents. (Dkt. 41 at 27, 36). And as observed above, its website emphasizes its local focus. Further, according to advertising guidelines from PCNA, Beverly Hills may not advertise that it will deliver cars nationwide, and the various advertising restrictions imposed-including geographic restrictions-apply to Beverly Hills' online advertising. (Dkt. 43-1 at ECF 8, 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   All told, Beverly Hills' business activities in Virginia are sporadic and largely incidental. Nonetheless, Beverly Hills is willing to entertain business when an opportunity arises, which is roughly once or twice a year on average over the last 17 years. And each sale can generate a steep price, up to six figures. Overall, this factor provides support to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   (5).\n   <em>\n    Choice of law.\n   </em>\n   The parties' contract provided that California law applies and makes other specific references to California law. Accordingly, this factor cuts against Plaintiff and for Beverly Hills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (6).\n   <em>\n    In-person contact.\n   </em>\n   No one from Beverly Hills came to Virginia or otherwise visited Plaintiff in-person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (7).\n   <em>\n    Nature, quality, and extent of communications.\n   </em>\n   The extent of communications here was modest. Plaintiff and a Beverly Hills employee conducted negotiations by email, text message, and phone over a multi-day period. (Dkt. 8-2 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; dkt. 15-1 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). The quality of electronic communications was brisk: The 19 emails from May 1 through May 6 between Plaintiff and Beverly Hills were mainly three or four staccato sentences or sentence-fragments, essentially the bare-minimum needed to convey the requisite information. The Court does not have before it testimony detailing the quality of phone conversations between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Overall, this factor favors Plaintiff, albeit only slightly so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (8).\n   <em>\n    Location of contractual performance.\n   </em>\n   The parties agreed that Plaintiff was responsible for picking up the car from Beverly Hills, which Plaintiff effectuated by hiring a California towing company. Accordingly, the place of performance-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , transfer to Plaintiff (or his agent) of the purchased item-was California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   To summarize, six of the eight factors (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8) strongly cut against finding personal jurisdiction. Only two factors (4 and 7) support finding it, and they do not weigh overwhelmingly in Plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Consulting Engineers Corp. v.

Viewed in isolation,\n   <em>\n    ALS Scan\n   </em>\n   's reference to \"electronic activity\" could be read to trigger its test whenever a fact-pattern in some respect implicates a website or email. But just because a case in some respect involves a website does not automatically place it within the scope of\n   <em>\n    ALS Scan.\n   </em>\n   As the Fourth Circuit later observed, \"the mere fact that emails, telephone calls, and faxes were employed does not, of itself, alter the minimum contacts analysis\" or implicate \"the issue of the role of technology in personal jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Consulting Engineers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479972\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/273/#p277\">\n    561 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   279 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   That conclusion also seems apt given that the claims here are not derivative of or dependent upon Beverly Hills' website. This is not, for instance, a false advertising or trademark infringement case based on the website's content. Rather, the claims are grounded in Beverly Hills' later conduct during negotiations and its substantive performance of the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ALS Scan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9417223\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/293/707/#p712\">\n    293 F.3d at 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that defendant's direct contact with forum was \"the general publication of its website on the Internet,\" but \"that website is unrelated to\" plaintiff's claim because the website did involve the allegedly infringing photographs). Subsequent Fourth Circuit cases applying\n   <em>\n    ALS Scan\n   </em>\n   have reserved it for instances where the sued-over conduct was part and parcel of the Internet activity itself.\n   <em>\n    Carefirst of Maryland, Inc. v.

So for instance, the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   whether the newspapers manifested an intent to direct their website content-which included [allegedly defamatory] articles discussing conditions in a Virginia prison-to a Virginia audience. As we recognized in\n   <em>\n    ALS Scan\n   </em>\n   , a person's act of placing information on the Internet is not sufficient by itself to subject that person to personal jurisdiction in each State in which the information is accessed.... Thus, the fact that the newspapers' websites could be accessed anywhere, including Virginia, does not by itself demonstrate that the newspapers were\n   <em>\n    intentionally directing their website content to a Virginia audience.\n   </em>\n   Something more than posting and accessibility is needed.... The newspapers must, through the Internet postings, manifest an intent\n   <em>\n    to target and focus on Virginia readers.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374626\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/256/#p258\">\n    315 F.3d at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Nothing about Beverly Hills' website evinces such targeting. As explained in the findings of fact,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the website instead touts Beverly Hills' connection to the \"local\" Los Angeles area, which comports with its designated Primary Area of Responsibility and the advertising guidelines imposed by PCNA. This \"decidedly\" and \"strongly local character\" of the website thus cuts against finding personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374626\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/256/#p258\">\n    315 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   263 ;\n   <em>\n    Carefirst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530070\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/390/#p393\">\n    334 F.3d at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Having found that the purposeful availment aspect of specific jurisdiction is lacking, the Court need not address the latter two prongs. Exercising jurisdiction in Virginia over Beverly Hills in this case would offend the Due Process Clause. Accordingly, Beverly Hills' motion to dismiss will be granted, and it will be dismissed from this action without prejudice. An appropriate order will issue.
