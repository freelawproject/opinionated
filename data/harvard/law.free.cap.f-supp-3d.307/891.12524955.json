Velleff argues that his five-year sentence under \u00a7 924(c) cannot be sustained because\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   renders that statute's similar residual clause unconstitutionally vague. The government disputes this assertion and further argues that Velleff's\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim is untimely and has been procedurally defaulted for failure to raise it on direct appeal as well as that Hobbs Act conspiracy is a crime of violence under 924(c)'s force clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that ACCA's residual clause,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2), is unconstitutionally vague.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the government argues strenuously against that holding, the court must follow Seventh Circuit precedent, which unequivocally states that \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Velleff's Motion Is Not Untimely\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Generally, the statute of limitations for filing a successive motion is one year from the date the petitioner's conviction becomes final.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1). A motion,\n   however, may also be filed within one year after a right is newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3).\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was decided on June 26, 2105. The government argues that Velleff did not file his petition with the court until January 20, 2017, more than one year after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and therefore he has not complied with \u00a7 2255(f)(3). The court acknowledges that certain docket entries could be seen as supportive of this interpretation. But Velleff sought leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 petition on May 31, 2016, and the Seventh Circuit, in granting that request, specifically stated \"The clerk of court will transfer the papers to district court for filing as a \u00a7 2255 action.\" (Dkt. 2 at 3.) Therefore, Velleff's motion was filed June 17, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 1.) Because that date is within one year of the decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Velleff's motion is not untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Velleff's Motion Is Not Procedurally Defaulted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The government argues that Velleff has procedurally defaulted his claim by not raising it on appeal. Generally, a defendant is barred from raising an argument on collateral review that was not raised on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Llamas\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500432\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/331/#p350\">\n    548 U.S. 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350-51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500432\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/331/#p350\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2682,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500432\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/331/#p350\">\n    165 L.Ed. 2d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). The court may, however, excuse procedural default if the defendant can demonstrate either \"(1) both good cause failure to raise the claims on direct appeal and actual prejudice from the failure to raise those claims; or (ii) that the district court's refusal to consider the claims would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    McCleese\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/1174/#p1177\">\n    75 F.3d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1177-78 (7th Cir. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Velleff argues that he had good cause for not making his argument on direct appeal because a claim based on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was non-existent until 2015. In\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336769\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1/\">\n    468 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336769\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336769\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1/\">\n    82 L.Ed. 2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), the Supreme Court held that when \"a constitutional claim is so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel,\" good cause is demonstrated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336769\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336769\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1/\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336769\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the Court explained that when it explicitly overrules one of its precedents and applies that decision retroactively, \"there will almost certainly have been no reasonable basis upon which an attorney previously could have urged\" for the newly adopted position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336769\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336769\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1/\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336769\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   acknowledged the Court's history of rejecting vagueness challenges to the ACCA's residual clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2562-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, as the Seventh Circuit made clear in\n   <em>\n    Cardena\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause was not declared unconstitutional until\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   invalidated the substantially similar residual clause in \u00a7 924(e).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138157\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/959/#p996\">\n    842 F.3d at 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Velleff has established good cause. The court finds that five unwarranted years of incarceration qualifies as actual prejudice. Accordingly, Velleff's procedural default is excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Hobbs Act Conspiracy Is Not a Crime of Violence Under \u00a7 924(c)'s Force Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause is unconstitutional, for Velleff's conviction\n   to stand, it must rest on \u00a7 924(c)'s force clause. Velleff argues that Hobbs Act conspiracy does not qualify as a crime of violence under the force clause because its elements do not satisfy the clause's requirement of the \"use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical forces against the person or property of another.\" (Dkt. 29 at 11.) \"In determining whether a predicate offense qualifies as a 'crime of violence' under \u00a7 924(c), courts use a categorical approach looking only to the statutory elements of the offense and not to the particular facts underlying the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   , No. 14CR 664,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201435696\">\n    2016 WL 1435696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D.
