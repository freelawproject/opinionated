Without this showing, Plaintiffs argue that Jani-King has unlawfully categorized them as independent contractors and illegally made deductions from Plaintiffs' wages and unjustly enriched itself. Jani-King argues that the Connecticut Franchise Act (the \"Franchise Act\") provides its own protections to franchisees and that agreements entered into under the authority of the Franchise Act are fundamentally at odds with Plaintiffs' contention that Jani-King is an employer under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031-222\">\n    Conn.

While the issue of whether the franchisees can be considered employees cannot be resolved at this stage, the Court nevertheless determines that Jani-King's deductions, with the exception of the down payment, do not constitute wages within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031\">\n    Conn.

Jani-King allegedly requires Plaintiffs both to pay fees on an ongoing basis, and to pay an initial and non-refundable, franchise-fee down payment as a condition for Jani-King providing them with the opportunity to perform cleaning services under cleaning contracts between Jani-King and their customers. Plaintiffs, at least some of them, also argue that the down payments due on the Agreement was or has been deducted from their wages. Pls.' Opp. Br. at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am.

These payments allegedly violate \u00a7 31-73(b) and provide a basis for an unjust enrichment claim. Jani-King argues that \u00a7 31-73(b) does not provide for a private right of action and Plaintiffs' \u00a7 31-73(b) claim therefore should be dismissed. Defs.' Br. at 14.
