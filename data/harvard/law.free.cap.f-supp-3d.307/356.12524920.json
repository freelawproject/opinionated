I conclude that claim 1 of the '021 patent, claim 1 of the '061 patent, and claim 1 of the '718 patent are each directed to the abstract idea of transmitting electronic data to a user in response to a spoken request from the user.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   According to Defendants, claim 1 of the '021 patent, claim 1 of the '061 patent, and claim 1 of the '718 patent are each abstract because they \"claim mere results with no specific technical solutions for achieving them.\" (D.I. 13, p. 11). In other words, the claims recite \"nothing but the idea for the interaction\" between a natural language input and an electronic database output. (D.I. 25 at 63:13-14). Plaintiff counters that the asserted patents are directed to a \"specific solution\" to a problem rooted in technology. (D.I. 15, p. 13). As support, Plaintiff advances several arguments, including arguments based on the specification and arguments by analogy to previous cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    First,\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff asserts that the claims \"do not simply describe a function or outcome,\" because they \"disclose specific and narrow methods and systems which require specific computer hardware and software.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 15). Defendants submit that the claims here merely \"describe a desired\n   function or outcome, without providing any limiting detail that confine[s] the claim to a particular solution to an identified problem.\" (D.I. 13, p. 13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Affinity Labs of Texas, LLC v. Amazon.com Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174984\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/1266/#p1272\">\n    838 F.3d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1272 (Fed. Cir. 2016) )). I agree with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The asserted patents fail to provide technological solutions to the problems they identify. On a broad level, the specification identifies the complex format of electronic databases as a problem for users. ( '021 patent at 1:20-36 (navigation of electronic databases is \"too complex for user-friendly selection by means of a traditional remote-control clicker.\") ). The specification then identifies the goal of the invention: \"Allowing spoken natural language requests as the input modality for rapidly searching and accessing desired content.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:37-41). Rather than claiming a technological solution to the problem, however, the asserted claims are directed to the objective of the invention itself. They are drafted so broadly as to cover any method that can achieve navigating electronic databases by spoken natural language input-they recite, at a very high level of generality, the basic steps that would be required. Any database search that begins with a request in a format not accepted by the database will require receipt, interpretation, and translation of the request to a format compatible with the database. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:17-21).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Searching the database and transmitting the results to the user are required to retrieve any results from a database, even when searches are conducted entirely in a format compatible with the database. Additionally, though the specification recites faster user access to data as a benefit of the invention, it lacks any technical explanation for this benefit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '021 patent at 2:13-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff submits that the \"electronic data source\" and \"network servers\" recited in the claims tie the claims to a technological solution or improvement. (D.I. 15, pp. 13-14 (\"the '021 patent discloses specific and narrow methods and systems for speech-based navigation of an\n   <em>\n    electronic data source\n   </em>\n   located on one or more\n   <em>\n    network servers\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis in original) ). I find these and other elements insufficient to tie the claims to a specific improvement in technology or a technological solution to an identified problem. The asserted patents do not suggest that there is anything limiting about an \"electronic data source\" or \"network servers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The specification treats \"database\" and \"data source\" as generic terms, noting that the invention uses a navigation query \"to access desired information directly from a\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   database or data source of interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '021 patent 8:58-62 (emphasis added) ). It also discloses embodiments for accessing disparate types of data, such as films and stock charts, subsequently stating that these disclosures do \"not limit the scope of the invention in any respect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:16-38). The asserted patents caution that these disclosures of data types are non-limiting. This, and the requirement of selecting a particular \"database\" or \"data source\" to view data suggests that, in the absence of a modifier, \"database\" and \"data source\" are generic terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \"Network servers\" are not explicitly implicated by the specification in any problem. The specification's \"network\" disclosures make clear that \"network\" is a generic term. A \"network\" may be embodied in any type of hardwired or wireless connection, and may be part of the Internet, \"or may be embodied in a proprietary network, or in any other electronic communications network infrastructure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:38-52). Therefore, I find that the asserted patents treat \"electronic data source\" and \"network servers\" as generic terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff also appears to argue that the claimed \"navigation query\" necessarily roots the claims in technology. (D.I. 15, p. 13 (\"The claim sets forth a particular solution involving the use of structured navigation queries ...[making the claim] necessarily rooted in computer technology.\") ). The specification defines \"navigation query\" as \"an electronic query, form, series of menu selections, or the like; being structured appropriately so as to navigate a particular data source of interest in search of desired information.\" ( '021 patent at 8:55-58). The \"navigation query\" thus provides no link to any particular technology. I conclude that the claimed \"navigation query\" fails to tie the claims to specific hardware or software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The \"network servers,\" \"electronic data source\" and \"navigation query\" recited in the claims may limit the claims to a generally technological environment, but their presence does not require specific hardware or software sufficient to tie the claims to a technological solution to a particular problem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2354\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the prohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of [the idea] to a particular technological environment\") (alteration in original);\n   <em>\n    In re TLI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p611\">\n    823 F.3d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that specification supported finding that \"telephone unit\" and \"server\" were \"physical components merely provid[ing] a generic environment in which to carry out the abstract idea\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In responding to the Sony Defendants' motion, Plaintiff also appears to argue that the \"facilitator\" and \"agents\" of claim 1 of the '061 patent\"are specific software modules configured to communicate with each other and perform specific functions\" that render the claim patentable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (C.A. No. 17-055, D.I. 16, pp. 4-5). During oral argument, Plaintiff invoked as an improvement the \"distributed architecture\" required by the \"facilitator\" and \"agent,\" \"because it allows the routing of the query to the appropriate agent, the appropriate database based on the interpretation.\" (D.I. 25, 50:21-51:13). Plaintiff further characterized this as \"a specific solution to a specific technical problem,\" but did not specify what problem the \"facilitators\" and \"agents\" solve, or even what improvement they provide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Like the other limitations Plaintiff proffers, I conclude that the presence of a \"facilitator\" and \"agents\" in claim 1 of the '061 patent does not render the claim patentable. The inclusion of a \"facilitator\" and an \"agent\" does not change overall character of claim 1 of the '061 patent - the claim still requires transmitting electronic data to a user in response to a spoken request from the user. The first three steps of the method recited in claim 1 of the '061 patent are nearly identical to those recited in the method of claim 1 of the '021 patent. The last two steps of the method of the '061 patent achieve the same result (selecting a portion of the electronic data source and sending the selected portion\n   to the user) as the methods recited in claim 1 of the '021 patent and claim 1 of the '718 patent. Claim 1 of the '061 patent merely recites the \"agent\" as an intermediary using broad functional language, providing no detail regarding how an \"agent\" is implemented in the claimed method. Plaintiff has not identified a specific technological improvement or solution to a technological problem provided by the \"agent\" or \"facilitator.\" Accordingly, I conclude that the recitation of an \"agent\" and a \"facilitator\" does not change the overall idea to which claim 1 of the '061 patent is directed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff further argues that claim 27 of the '021 patent is not directed to an abstract idea because it \"requires at least a portable microphone,\" \"language processing logic,\" \"query construction logic,\" \"user interaction logic,\" \"query refining logic,\" \"navigation logic,\" and \"electronic communications infrastructure.\" (D.I. 15, p. 14). Defendants conducted their step one analysis in the context of claim 1 of each of the asserted patents. (D.I. 13, pp. 4-7). None of claim 1 of the '021 patent, claim 1 of the '061 patent, or claim 1 of the '718 patent contain the limitations from claim 27 of the '021 patent that Plaintiff asserts render the claims non-abstract. I thus find unconvincing Plaintiff's reliance on claim 27 of the '021 patent to respond to Defendants' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    Second,\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff asserts that the claims here are distinguishable from those held ineligible in\n   <em>\n    Affinity Labs\n   </em>\n   . (D.I. 15, p. 15). Whereas the\n   <em>\n    Affinity Labs\n   </em>\n   claims claimed the abstract idea of \"the general concept of out-of-region delivery of broadcast content,\" Plaintiff argues that the claims here \"are directed to improvements in navigating data sources via spoken input, and for resolving errors and ambiguities in that spoken input by engaging the user in a multi-modal dialogue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   I disagree. Plaintiff's argument fails to consider the claims as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec. Power Grp. v.

Like claim 1 of the '061 patent and claim 1 of the '718 patent, claim 1 of the '021 patent is directed to transmitting electronic data to a user in response to a spoken request from the user.

Instead, Plaintiff vaguely asserts that claim 1 of the '021 patent\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"specifically recites a series of steps for how to resolve ambiguities created by trying to merely 'respond to a spoken request.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appears to correspond with the specification's disclosure of one problem with prior art systems-the lack of error correction in translating from natural language input to constructing navigation queries. ( '021 patent at 2:44-58). According to Plaintiff, Claim 1 of the '021 patent addresses this problem by its recitation of \"soliciting additional input\" and \"refining the navigation query based upon the additional input.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 15, p. 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff ignores the high level of generality at which these claims and claim elements are drafted. The claims' \"soliciting\" and \"refining\" steps require performance of the basic building blocks of error correction in any context: evaluating performance, gathering additional data, and using that data to update performance. Though performance here corresponds to the navigation query, I have found the navigation query insufficient to tie the claim language to a technological solution or improvement. Like the other claim elements, the \"soliciting\" and \"refining\" steps contain no explanation as to how they are accomplished, and nothing ties them specifically to addressing the problem disclosed by the patent-error correction in translating natural language input. Further, claim 1 of the '021 patent is not directed as a whole to resolving errors in navigation query construction. Accordingly, the \"soliciting\" and \"refining\" steps do not save claim 1 of the '021 patent from being directed to an abstract idea. Like claim 1 of the '061 patent and claim 1 of the '718 patent, claim 1 of the '021 patent is directed to the broad concept of transmitting electronic data to a user in response to a spoken request from the user.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    Fourth,\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff argues that the claims at issue here are \"more detailed and specific\" than the claim held patent-eligible in\n   <em>\n    InfoGation Corp. v.

As the specification explained, the proprietary data format of prior art mobile navigation systems presented interoperability and efficiency problems. Prior art systems prevented the proprietary server from being \"used with navigation systems and mapping databases from other manufacturers, and the transmitted data required high bandwidth communication channels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.

The court concluded that the claim was not directed to an abstract idea, because it was confined to \"a specific means, here route data formatted using a non-proprietary, natural language description generated at the server, for improving an existing technological process, here how an online server communicates in real-time with a local mapping database in a mobile navigation system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that \"[t]he same analysis applies here,\" because \"the claimed inventions are directed to specific improvements in ... navigating network-based electronic data sources.\" (D.I. 15, p. 13). According to Plaintiff, claim 1 of the '021 patent serves as an example, \"specifically recitf[ing] a series of steps for how to resolve ambiguities created by trying to merely 'respond to spoken requests' \"-it \"sets forth a particular solution involving the use of structured navigation queries and the solicitation of additional input in a different form in order to refine the query.

The court noted, \"Because [the asserted claim] is not directed to communicating with an end user using natural language, the present case is distinguishable\" from the patent-ineligible claims in the cases cited by defendants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201135638\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The claims at issue in those cases were directed to an improved method/system for providing certain data/information to end users of the network/system, not between technical components within the network/system.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Considering the asserted claims as a whole, I find them directed to the abstract idea of retrieving electronic data in response to a spoken request and transmitting the retrieved data to a user. At a more granular level, claim 1 of the '021 patent is essentially directed to (1) receiving\n   data (in the format of a spoken request); (2) interpreting the received data; (3) translating the data (from natural language format to navigation query format); (4) soliciting additional data (in a different format) from a user; (5) updating the translation with the additional data solicited from the user; (6) using the resulting translation to search a source of electronic data; and (7) transmitting the search results to the user.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Steps (1)-(5) gather and interpret different types of data (natural language and data from another modality, such as a button press), and translate the data to a single format (navigation query). The claims are thus drafted at a level that requires translating data, using the translation to search an electronic database, and transmitting the results of the search to a user. Though the specification discloses various components that can be used to implement the method, nothing in the claims discloses how these components achieve the goal of the method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yodlee, Inc. v.

Plaintiff submits that several elements of the claims, including the \"navigation query\" and \"multi-modal feedback,\" provide an inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   I agree with Defendants. I find that the specification's statement that the claims are directed to solving a technological problem cannot overcome the specification's recitation of conventional technology to implement the invention, combined with broad, functional claim language that merely describes an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The specification is replete with references to implementing the claims using conventional technology. For example, the specification describes navigation queries (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   '021 patent at 8:55-9:14), networks (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:38-59), mobile information appliances\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:46-60, 5:56-64), and \"agents\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:1-14:14), as conventional components. It also discloses that speech recognition (i.e., rendering an interpretation of the spoken request) can be achieved by \"[a] variety of commercial quality speech recognition engines, [which] are readily available on the market, as practitioners will know.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:19-31). The specification then recites examples of commercially-available products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Further, as the Federal Circuit has recognized, \"That a computer receives and sends the information over a network-with no further specification-is not even arguably inventive.\"\n   <em>\n    buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186028\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/1350/#p1355\">\n    765 F.3d 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In arguing an inventive concept, Plaintiff points to the individual limitations of a \"navigation query\" and process of refining a navigation query through \"a novel multi-modal feedback approach to resolving errors and ambiguities in interpreting the original spoken command.\" (D.I. 15, pp. 18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   I conclude that the recited \"navigation query\" does not provide an inventive concept.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues that this term, as defined in the specification, \"places meaningful limits on the claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   pp. 7-8). According to the specification, a \"navigation query\" is \"an electronic query, form, series of menu selections, or the like; being structured appropriately so as to navigate a particular data source of interest in search of desired information.\" (D.I. 15, p. 7 (citing '021 patent at 8:55-58) ). This definition sweeps broadly to cover any query that would work to return desired results from a database. The specification further describes the navigation query as \"includ[ing] whatever content and structure is required in order to access desired information electronically from a particular database or data source of interest.\" ( '021 patent at 8:59-62). It does not provide any information regarding how to create a navigation query, or what structure is required. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:40-10:38). The lack of any teaching in the specification about how to construct a navigation query suggests that processes for constructing navigation\n   queries were known in the art.\n   <em>\n    Hybritech Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1625273\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/802/1367/#p1384\">\n    802 F.2d 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1384 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (\"a patent need not teach, and preferably omits, what is well known in the art\"). The specification confirms this, stating, \"Practitioners of ordinary skill in the art will be thoroughly familiar with the notion of database navigation through structured query, and will be readily able to appreciate and utilize the existing data structures and navigational mechanisms for a given database, or to create such structures and mechanisms where required.\" ( '021 patent at 9:9-14);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Move, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=721%20Fed.%20Appx.%20950\">\n    721 Fed.Appx. 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20656377\">\n    2018 WL 656377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (finding no inventive concept conferred by zoom feature, given the \"the specification's teaching that the invention can be performed using a generic IBM or compatible personal computer system, and the failure to provide any implementation details for the zoom feature\"). Accordingly, I conclude that the \"navigation query\" imparts no inventive concept to the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Similarly, I find that the \"multimodal feedback approach\" fails to provide an inventive concept for claim 1 of the '021 patent. The Federal Circuit has held that claim language that \"does not provide any specific showing of what is inventive about the [the claim limitation at issue] or about the technology used to generate and process it\" does not provide an inventive concept.\n   <em>\n    Secured Mail Sols. LLC v.

Cir. 2017). As Plaintiff points out, the claims do not describe how to interpret the spoken request or determine what feedback to seek, or how to \"generat[e] a menu list from the user's initial query.\" (D.I. 17, p. 6). At the level the claims are drafted, the multi-modal feedback essentially requires gathering additional data in a non-spoken modality and using the data to modify the initial navigation query, without further limitation as to how this is accomplished in the context of generating a navigation query from a spoken request. Refining search terms in a database query does not qualify as inventive, even if for the purpose of error correction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, neither the claims nor the specification provide any information to support an inference that this element is unconventional. Examples provided in the specification support the opposite conclusion-a user can press \"buttons on the remote control, to select the desired title from the menu.\" ( '021 patent, 11:59-67; 12:25-30 (\"The user can then simply press an 'OK' button-or perhaps mix modalities by saying 'yes, exactly'-to choose that selection.) ). The specification does not provide any information that describes how this conventional \"button press\" is linked to refining the navigation query that would allow me to conclude that the multi-modal feedback process is unconventional. Therefore, I conclude that the multimodal feedback approach does not provide an inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiff also complains that Defendants have failed to address the claims as a whole, but does not specify or explain how the claims as a whole provide an inventive concept. (D.I. 15, p. 18). In conclusory fashion, Plaintiff argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [T]he elements of claim 1 of the '021 patent, when properly considered individually\n   and as an ordered combination, describe a specific method for speech-based navigation of an electronic data source, the electronic data source being located at one or more network servers located remotely from a user.

The specification discloses that in one embodiment, a client device may be a \"television monitor or other similar audiovisual entertainment device\" ( '021 patent at 5:33-35); in another embodiment, the function of the client device may be performed by a \"cellular telephone or wireless personal digital assistant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:54-64). The specification thus indicates that the \"client device\" is not as specific as Plaintiff makes it out to be. Having already found the asserted claims directed to an abstract idea, and that an \"electronic data source\" and a \"network server\" are generic terms in the context of the asserted patents, I must reject Plaintiff's argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 363-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Considering the claim elements as an ordered combination also fails to impart an inventive concept. Though none of the steps individually provide an inventive concept or require specific hardware or software, the asserted method claims could still provide an inventive concept if their steps were arranged in an unconventional manner. This, however, is not the case. The claims do not limit the recited functions to particular pieces of hardware or software, and the specification expressly allows the functional components of request processing to be allocated between the client and the server. ( '021 patent at 6:41-43). Additionally, the method steps in each claim are arranged sequentially, and any changes to their ordering would render the claims useless for accomplishing their goal. For example, it is impossible to interpret a spoken request without receiving one, and impossible to refine a query that has not yet been constructed. Therefore, I find that the ordered combination of claim elements does not impart an inventive concept to the asserted claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiff urges that since claim construction is necessary to at least step two of the \u00a7 101 analysis, I should deny Defendants' motion. (D.I. 15, pp. 7-8). According to Plaintiff, Defendants' arguments that the patent fails to describe with any specificity the \"soliciting\" step, the \"refining\" step, and the \"client device\" necessarily require construction of these terms because Defendants' arguments \"implicate the meaning and scope\" of these terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 7). I do not find claim construction of these terms a necessary predicate to deciding this motion. Plaintiff does not propose any interpretation of these terms, let alone one that it argues would render the claims patentable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   pp. 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiff further argues that \"multiple factual issues preclude dismissal,\" including, for example,\" whether claim elements were conventional and whether the claims are directed to a technological improvement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 8). The patents indicate that the claim elements were conventional. Plaintiff does not point to a different source of factual information that contradicts this indication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   I thus conclude that Plaintiff has not raised an issue of fact that would preclude dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues that due to the \"specific hardware and/or software\" required by the claim limitations, the claims do not preempt the entire field. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 20). Even if the claims are directed to an\n   abstract idea, Plaintiff maintains that there is no preemption concern because the claims do not preempt \"all ways of responding to spoken requests.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A claim does not contain an inventive concept simply because it does not preempt the field. Having determined that the asserted claims \"disclose patent ineligible subject matter under the\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   framework ... preemption concerns are fully addressed and made moot.\"\n   <em>\n    Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v.

(\"Sony\"). (C.A. No. 17-055-RGA, D.I. 1). Plaintiff subsequently stipulated to dismiss Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation of America, Sony Mobile Communications AB, and Sony Mobile Communications, Inc. (C.A. No. 17-055, D.I. 11). The remaining Sony Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, joining the Amazon Defendants' motion to dismiss and providing additional briefing. (C.A. No. 17-055. D.I. 12, 13, 16, 17). Oral argument included presentations from both the Amazon defendants and the Sony defendants. All docket item references in this opinion refer to C.A. No. 16-1266 unless otherwise specified.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    In related cases, Plaintiff has asserted the same patents against several other defendants. The following defendants have joined the Amazon and/or Sony Defendants' motions to dismiss: Dish Network Corp. and Dish Network L.L.C. (C.A. No. 16-1170, D.I. 13); TCL Communication Technology Holdings, Ltd., TCT Mobile Limited, and TCT Mobile (US), Inc. (C.A. No. 16-1236, D.I. 12 &amp; 19); LG Electronics Inc., LG Electronics U.S.A., Inc., and LG Electronics Mobilecomm U.S.A., Inc. (C.A.

Though perhaps not required for all database searches, this idea of refining search terms will be implicated whenever the initial search terms (resulting from the initial translation) prove deficient.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    at 371 n.11.

None of claim 1 of the '021 patent, claim 1 of the '061 patent, or claim 1 of the '718 patent recite a limitation directed to selecting a data source. I find that Plaintiff's argument does not provide an adequate basis for me to decide whether claim 25 of the '021 patent is directed to patent-eligible subject matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Neither claim 1 of the '061 patent nor claim 1 of the '718 patent requires steps (4) and (5).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    This includes the \"set-top box,\" \"portable remote control device,\" and \"television\" recited in claim 1 of the '718 patent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Plaintiff concedes that neither \"agents\" nor \"facilitators\" provide an inventive concept. (C.A.

(D.I. 15, p 7). Plaintiff proposes construing \"navigation query\" as it is defined in the specification. I agree. But this definition, considered in light of the specification, indicates that the \"navigation query\" fails to provide an inventive concept.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Humans have used search terms to run database searches for decades. When the initial search terms do not produce the desired result, humans have utilized additional information to modify their terms and refine their database searches. Examples include legal database searches and searching for a library book using the library's card catalog. In a legal database search, for example, a lawyer searching for a particular case in a legal database may enter the name of one of the parties as a search term. If that search yields an unmanageable number of results, the lawyer may refine the search to add information about, for example, the deciding court and year of decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Nor does the complaint, a source properly considered at the motion to dismiss stage, contain any assertion that the claim elements were unconventional.
