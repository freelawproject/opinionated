R. 133, Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48-52.

With the claims laid out, the Court analyzes each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Conspiracy and Failure to Intervene\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Before digging into the Kohs' substantive claims, their derivative claims for conspiracy and failure to intervene merit a brief discussion. The Northbrook Defendants assert that the Kohs have not established sufficient facts to demonstrate that individual defendants should be liable for conspiracy or failure to intervene. Northbrook Defs.' Br. at 37-38. In its prior opinion on the Defendants' motion to dismiss, the Court noted the complaint's\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   lack of clarity on which Defendants supposedly committed which violations, but held that this group pleading was appropriate at the pleading stage. R. 82, Opinion on Mot. Dismiss at 9. At the same time, the Court noted that the Kohs would eventually bear the burden of tying particular Defendants to particular injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Northbrook now argues that the Kohs have not met that burden, and that summary judgment is therefore warranted on the conspiracy and failure to intervene claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There is a problem with this argument: the Northbrook Defendants do not explain which Defendants are entitled to summary judgment, on what claims, or (if it matters) at what point in time during the course of events particular Defendants ceased being even potentially liable. This is a fatal oversight. On summary judgment, the moving party carries the burden of demonstrating that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In this case, Northbrook's motion is so vague on the group-allegations argument that the Court is left to guess which Defendants Northbrook believes are entitled to summary judgment on which theories of liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 279, Northbrook Defs.' Br. at 37-38; R. 329, Northbrook Defs.' Reply Br. at 36-37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Northbrook's vague arguments are especially troubling in this case, because there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer\n   that at least some of the Defendants conspired to deprive the Kohs of their constitutional rights, and that some Defendants failed to intervene to prevent the violations. So, contrary to Northbrook's argument, it is not enough to simply point out to an absence of evidence to support the Kohs' claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Northbrook Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To be sure, the Kohs do have the ultimate burden of proving conspiracy and failure to intervene, and it is very unlikely that they will be able to do so for all Defendants when it comes to the trial. It seems clear, for example, that liability for the on-scene arresting officers-Meents, Johnson, Eisen, and Celia-must cut off at some point in time after the Kohs arrived at the police station and the interrogations began. Unsupported allegations of a conspiracy of which there is no evidence will not be enough at trial (and indeed would not have been enough to withstand a properly detailed motion for summary judgment). Unfortunately, Northbrook has not made these arguments in enough detail to give the Kohs or the Court fair notice of the grounds for summary judgment. Northbrook's motion for summary judgment on the conspiracy and failure to intervene claims is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. False Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moving on to the substantive claims, the Kohs allege the Defendants arrested them without probable cause (or, in Officer Kim's case, extended Mr. Koh's unlawful detention) in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   To evaluate this claim, the Court must answer two key questions.

The officers' first action upon arriving at the scene was to yell at Mrs. Koh to leave the house and sit down on the grass outside. NDSOF \u00b6 8; Exh. 12, Mar. 22, 2010 Pretrial Hr'g.

When Mr. Koh looked like he might be trying to leave the scene-he went to the driveway to try to start his car to take Paul to the hospital-Officer Meents told Mr. Koh that he had to go back to the front lawn. Exh. 5, July 15, 2010 Pretrial Hr'g Tr. 12:6-13:17.

Based on the officers' actions at the scene-shoving the Kohs around, standing guard over them for an extended period of time, ordering them to sit on the ground, screaming at them, and refusing their requests to leave the lawn-a jury could reasonably find that the Kohs were not free to leave when the officers stood over them on the lawn in front of their house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Even if the Kohs were not arrested on the lawn, a reasonable jury could find that they were under arrest by the time they were taken to the police station in Johnson's squad car.

In this case, the shocked and grieving Kohs-who, according to their testimony, had already been yelled at, shoved, and loomed over by multiple uniformed police officers-were \"escorted\" to\n   Johnson's squad car by two officers, who never asked whether the Kohs\n   <em>\n    wanted\n   </em>\n   to go to the police station.

In the car, the Kohs even made explicit requests\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to be taken to the police station (they asked again to go to the hospital) and were ignored.

If anything, the Kohs' inability to leave was reinforced during their time in the police station conference room. According to Mrs. Koh, the door of the conference room where the Kohs were held was kept closed while they were inside. Exh. 12, Mar. 22, 2010 Pretrial Hr'g Tr. 102:16-23. Johnson or other officers watched over the Kohs the entire time. NDSOF \u00b6 44; Exh. 9, Johnson Dep. Tr. 220:2-13. The officers also denied the Kohs' requests to make phone calls-indeed, Deputy Chief Ross explicitly instructed Johnson not to allow the Kohs to make calls until a police translator could listen in. PSOF \u00b6 11, Exh. 134, Transcript of NPD Audio Recordings at 11-12; Exh. 103, Ross Dep. Tr. 82:17-84:6 (Ross ordered Johnson to wait for a translator \"[s]o the officers would be able to know what was said.\"). The Kohs' inability make calls effectively left them stranded at the police station. The Kohs were brought to the station in Johnson's police vehicle; when they arrived it was around 4:00 a.m. on a cold April morning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   If they could not call for a ride, the Kohs had no reasonable way to leave the station (short of asking the officers who arrested them for a lift). In view of these facts, a jury could easily find that the Kohs remained under arrest from the time the officers arrived at the house through the entirety of their time at the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   All of these facts also prevent the Court from finding that the arresting officers are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. To avoid judgment on qualified immunity grounds, the Fourth Amendment right that the Defendants allegedly violated must have been \"clearly established\" as of the time of the alleged arrest.\n   <em>\n    Roe v.

Ultimately, the question for qualified immunity \"is whether the state of the law at the time that [the Defendants] acted gave [them] reasonable notice that [their] actions violated the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086580\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/843/#p858\">\n    631 F.3d at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A reasonable officer would have known that pushing on the Kohs' shoulders and directing them to sit quietly on the ground outside of their house before taking them to a police car and driving them to a police station constituted an arrest under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300234\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/811/#p816\">\n    470 U.S. at 815-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300234\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/811/#p816\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Sornberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"932089\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/1006/#p1018\">\n    434 F.3d at 1017-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the officers' actions read like a checklist of the factors that the courts have set out for evaluating whether a suspect is under arrest. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Scheets\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Seventh Circuit noted that factors to be considered in the arrest analysis include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [W]hether the encounter occurred in a public or private place; whether the suspect was informed that he was not under arrest and free to leave; whether the suspect consented or refused to talk to the investigating officers; whether the investigating officers removed the suspect to another area; whether there was physical touching, display of weapons, or other threatening conduct; and whether the suspect eventually departed the area without hindrance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Scheets\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11576281\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/188/829/#p836\">\n    188 F.3d at 836-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Running through the list, the Northbrook officers ordered the Kohs to leave their home; never suggested that the Kohs were free to leave; ignored the Kohs' requests to go to the hospital; removed the Kohs from their home to the police station; pushed and shoved the Kohs; yelled at Mr. Koh to \"shut up\"; and kept the Kohs under police supervision at the station instead of releasing them. On these facts, a reasonable officer would have known that the Kohs were under arrest even on their front lawn (by that time, the officers had verbally and physically intimidated the Kohs, restricted their freedom of movement using physical force, and denied their requests to move). And a reasonable officer certainly would have known that the Kohs were under arrest by the time they were taken to the police station and held there. So qualified immunity cannot shield the Defendants on this element of the false arrest analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Probable Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Fourth Amendment inquiry does not end with the conclusion that the Kohs were arrested. The Kohs' false arrest claim fails if the arresting officers had probable cause to detain them. Police officers have probable cause to arrest someone if \"the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that the [suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Beck v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728831\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/89/#p91\">\n    379 U.S. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 91,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728831\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/89/#p91\">\n    85 S.Ct. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728831\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/89/#p91\">\n    13 L.Ed.2d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964). The \"totality of the circumstances\" must establish a reasonable belief that criminal activity occurred.\n   <em>\n    Gibbs v. Lomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064158\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/529/#p537\">\n    755 F.3d 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537 (7th Cir. 2014). Whether or not probable cause exists then \"is often a matter of degree, varying with both the need for prompt action and the quality of information available.\"\n   <em>\n    Maxwell v.

Generally, the question of probable cause is a question for the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511542\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/998/431/#p434\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (probable cause \"is a proper issue for the jury if there is room for a difference of opinion concerning the facts or the reasonable inferences to be drawn from them\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Even where officers make an arrest without probable cause, qualified immunity may kick in to defeat a false-arrest claim. The doctrine of qualified immunity will protect the Defendants if they decided, \"in an objectively reasonable fashion,\" that\n   they had probable cause to arrest the Kohs.\n   <em>\n    Sornberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"932089\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/1006/#p1018\">\n    434 F.3d at 1014-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Br. at 5-11. In fact, the Northbrook Defendants explicitly concede that there was no probable cause to arrest Mrs. Koh until, at the earliest, the end of Mr. Koh's second interview.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. So, the question is when (if ever) in the course of the ongoing investigation the officers developed sufficient information to justify the continued detention of Mr. and Mrs. Koh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Mr. Koh\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For Mr. Koh, the NORTAF/NPD debriefing sessions held between Mr. Koh's two interviews mark a turning point in the probable cause analysis. In the time between Mr. Koh's first and second interviews, Officers Graf and Ustich met with NORTAF and NPD supervisors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSOF \u00b6 26; Exh. 36, Graf Dep. Tr. 91:15-93:5. During these meetings, Graf and Ustich shared their impressions of the first interview. Exh. 36, Graf Dep. Tr. 93:21-94:11; Exh. 40, Ustich Dep. Tr. 85:15-86:15. Ustich noted that Mr. Koh did not vehemently deny involvement in Paul's death, and that the manner of his denial seemed oddly casual. Ustich also thought that Mr. Koh's answers were evasive or not forthcoming. Exh. 40, Ustich Dep. Tr. 85:21-86:4; 95:1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The officers also discussed physical evidence from the house, which arguably suggested that Paul's death was a homicide. First, Graf and Ustich learned that investigators had found blood in Mr. and Mrs. Koh's master bathroom. Exh. 40, Ustich Dep. Tr. 95:13-14; Exh. 36, Graf Dep. Tr. 99:19-100:16. To Graf, this suggested that the Kohs had cleaned up the crime scene. Exh. 36, Graf Dep. Tr. 100:10-16. Second, there was a small metal cross and a broken necklace chain covered in blood and lying on the floor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 40, Ustich Dep. Tr. 95:19-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   NDSOF \u00b6 30; Exh. 28, Wasowicz Dep. Tr. 34:14-36:9; Exh. 29, Wasowicz Aff. \u00b6 14; Exh. 29A, Wasowicz Aff. Exh. A at NB 369.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The broken necklace suggested that Paul had been attacked and that a struggle had ensued. Third, Graf and Ustich learned that the NORTAF forensic team, who by that time had been able to inspect the house, believed that Paul's death was a homicide, because, in their opinion, Paul would not have been able to inflict the injuries on himself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   NB SOF Exh. 46, May 16, 2011 Pretrial Hr'g Tr. 100:13-14, 102:1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   There also was some motive evidence that Graf and Ustich learned about during the debriefing sessions. Specifically, Paul and his father had an unusually confrontational relationship. NDSOF \u00b6 68; Exh. 46, May 16, 2001 Pretrial Tr. 39:24-41:15; R. 339, Wasowicz Field Notes, NB 171-747 at\n   NB 746. This information primarily came from Paul's youth pastor, who had told investigators earlier that morning about a written \"Family Agreement\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   and about a recent altercation between Paul and his father.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NDSOF \u00b6 68; Exh. 46, May 16, 2011 Pretrial Hr'g Tr. 40:23-41:15, 104:24-105:11; R. 286-1, Exh. 49, Koh Family Agreement; R. 285-6, Exh. 47, Garner Aff.; R. 285-7, Exh. 47A, Garner Aff.

Exh. 45, May 16, 2001 Pretrial Hr'g Tr. 100-101; Exh. 36, Graf Dep. Tr. 88:6:-89:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, Graf and Ustich learned about some apparent inconsistencies in the Kohs' stories. Graf found the evidence of cleanup in the master bathroom suspicious, because it contradicted Mrs. Koh's version of events-during her interview, she stated that neither she nor her husband washed up in the bathroom after finding Paul's body.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 121, Eunsook Koh Interview Tr. at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exh. 36, Graf Dep. Tr. 99:15-101:2. The detectives also learned that Mrs. Koh had maintained in her interview that she had not moved Paul's body, which was inconsistent with Mr. Koh's statement that they had turned the body over. Exh. 36, Graf Dep. Tr. 41:16-42:7; Exh. 44, Hyung Seok Koh Interview Tr. 23-24. Finally, Graf and Ustich learned that a neighbor had heard a scream from the Kohs' house. Exh. 46, May 16, 2011 Pretrial Hr'g Tr. 42:15-19. Mr. Koh had told Graf that he was a light sleeper, so Graf was skeptical that Mr. Koh could have slept through Paul's death.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exh. 44, Hyung Seok Koh Interview Tr. 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Taking all of this evidence into account, a jury\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   conclude that there was probable cause to arrest Mr. Koh after the debriefing sessions. To be sure, this is a very close call, particularly when viewed through the lens of summary judgment.

Though Kim provided Graf a literal translation of the phrase-literally, \"let's die together\"-Kim did not explain that the phrase was in fact an idiom, not to be taken literally (like the English phrase \"you're killing me\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 117-118.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Exh. 44, Hyung Seok Koh Interview Tr. at 62-63; R. 276-3, Exh. 106, Yoon Dep.

For example, during a key exchange, Graf tried to get Mr. Koh to admit that he had stabbed Paul in self-defense.

At the crucial moment, Graf and Kim asked overlapping questions: Graf asked in English whether Mr. Koh was angry, and before Mr. Koh could answer, Kim asked in Korean whether Mr. Koh acted in self-defense. Exh. 180, Yoon Report at 5. Mr. Koh said \"I think so,\" leading Kim proclaim that \"He said it was in defense\"-even though Kim had not actually translated Graf's question about whether Mr. Koh was angry, so it was not clear which question Mr. Koh was answering.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5; Exh. 44, Hyung Seok Koh Interview Tr. 136; Exh. 180, Yoon Report at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PSOF \u00b6 119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In addition to considering Mr. Koh's characteristics and the conditions of the interrogation, the\n   interrogators' conduct is also relevant to the voluntariness inquiry. As soon as the second interview began, Graf continually accused Mr. Koh of lying and directed Mr. Koh to be \"totally honest\" in order \"to get closure for [Paul].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NDSOF \u00b6 81; Pls.'

(It is also worth noting that Officer Kim's gun was visible throughout the entirety Mr. Koh's interviews. NDSOF \u00b6 97; WDSOF \u00b6 9.) Detective Graf implicitly threatened that the interview would not end until Mr. Koh confessed, telling him that they could be there \"for days and days and days\" in order to get \"the whole truth.\" Exh. 44, Hyung Seok Koh Interview Tr. 117;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PSOF \u00b6 37; Northbrook Defs.'

The combined effect of Mr. Koh's vulnerabilities, the language barrier, the coercive atmosphere in the interrogation room, Detective Graf's interrogation tactics, and Officer Kim's deficient performance as translator is enough for a jury to find that Mr. Koh's confession was involuntary.

Similarly, Graf told Koh (who by that point was visibly distressed and confused) that if he did not tell \"the truth,\" his\n   interrogation could continue for \"days and days and days.\" Exh. 44, Hyung Seok Koh Interview Tr. at 117. Given Graf's refusal to take \"I don't know\" for an answer up to that point, Mr. Koh would have understood \"the truth\" to mean \"what Graf wanted to hear.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hurt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265916\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/831/#p841\">\n    880 F.3d 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[The interrogator] made it clear to [the suspect] that he and [his partner] were the ones who would decide if [the suspect] told the 'right' story.\").

Finally, a jury might even find Graf's repeated physical touches and his close proximity to Mr. Koh to be an implied threat of physical violence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 44, Hyung Seok Koh Interview Tr. 103; Exh. 55, Video of Hyung Seok Koh Interview 2 00:55:20-01:09:53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   But even assuming that Mr. Koh was not threatened with physical violence, the facts of this case are arguably\n   <em>\n    worse\n   </em>\n   than the facts of\n   <em>\n    Hurt\n   </em>\n   . Unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Hurt\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Koh had obvious difficulties understanding English-a vulnerability that, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the Kohs, Graf and Kim exploited. A reasonable jury could conclude that Graf\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that he was pressuring Mr. Koh to agree with statements that he did not fully understand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   A reasonable jury could likewise conclude that Graf knowingly exploited Mr. Koh's mental and physical vulnerabilities. Mr. Koh had not taken his daily medications, and the Kohs' expert testified that the absence of these medications could cause confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 290-2, Exh. 94, Galatzer-Levy July 27, 2011 Pretrial Testimony at 36:22-38:6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exh. 17, Hyung Seok Koh Dep. Tr. 359:3-9 (Mr. Koh's testimony that without his medications, he experiences fatigue, shakiness, and confusion). According to Mr. Koh, as Graf was escorting Mr. Koh to a court hearing, Graf again threatened to extend the coercive interrogation if Mr. Koh did not play along: \"If you say in the presence of the judge that you are either sick or dizzy, then we will take a week or even two to [ ] investigate you, so don't do that.\" Exh. 17, Hyung Seok Koh Dep. Tr. 425:13-17. It would be reasonable to infer from this comment that Graf knew that Mr. Koh was mentally and physically vulnerable at the time of the interrogation and that he exploited those vulnerabilities with aggressive tactics. In sum, there is evidence that Mr. Koh was even more vulnerable to coercion than even the young plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Hurt\n   </em>\n   , and that Graf's coercive tactics were correspondingly less reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Mr. Koh has three different evidence fabrication theories. First, he argues that Graf and Kim prepared false police reports, which were then used as a basis for charging and detaining Mr. Koh. Pls.' Resp. Br. at 51-52. Second, he asserts that Graf invented incriminating statements and falsely attributed them to Paul Koh's youth pastor, Joon Hwang.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52. Third, he alleges that Graf induced Paul's friend Neil Schnitzler to give false testimony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Mr. Koh's first theory falls short. The Seventh Circuit has drawn a distinction between coerced testimony\n   (which might be true, even if coerced) and false or fabricated testimony, \"which is known to be untrue by the witness and whoever cajoled or coerced the witness to give it.\"\n   <em>\n    Fields v. Wharrie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826229\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/1107/#p1110\">\n    740 F.3d 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1110 (7th Cir. 2014). In this case, there is ample evidence that Graf and Kim\n   <em>\n    coerced\n   </em>\n   Mr. Koh's confession, but there is not enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that Graf and Kim\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that the coerced confession was false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Koh argues that Graf and Kim lied in their police reports recounting Mr. Koh's interrogation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. Br. at 51-52. But this is not the case; the things Graf and Kim related in their reports were true, as a literal matter. Mr. Koh\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   eventually adopt the details proposed by Graf and recounted in the police reports, and he\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   make a hand gesture demonstrating cutting someone's throat in response to Graf's questions about how he killed Paul.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Video of Hyung Seok Koh Interview 3 18:40-20:09. Similarly, Kim did give Mr. Koh Miranda warnings (though with some translation errors), and Mr. Koh did say \"kachi jookja,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   which literally translates to \"Let's die together.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 106, Yoon Dep. 56:11-57:8; 57:13-58:16. It is true that these reports could have been more detailed, and that if they had been more detailed they would have presented a fairer picture of the interrogation. But the Constitution does not guarantee perfectly fair police reports (or perfectly accurate translations). To be sure, there must be some point where omissions become egregious enough to render a police report effectively false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   But in this case, the omissions in Graf's and Kim's police reports were not so misleading as to give rise to an inference that Graf and Kim were deliberately falsifying evidence in order to mislead the prosecutors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed,\n   Graf's report explicitly states that its account of Koh's statements is \"summary, not verbatim,\" and notes that the interrogation could be viewed in full on videotape. R. 308-46, Exh. 153, Graf Post-Interrogation Police Report. At the very least, qualified immunity would protect Graf and Kim on this facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Mr. Koh's next argument is that Graf fabricated a statement from Paul Koh's youth pastor, Joon Hwang.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. Br. at 51-52. Hwang was interviewed by two non-defendant police officers on the morning of April 16, 2009. Exh. 47, Garner Aff. \u00b6 5. According to the officers' report of the interview, Hwang stated that Mrs. Koh told him that \"maybe Paul was afraid that his father would not respect his privacy,\n   <em>\n    or perhaps feared his father.\n   </em>\n   \" Exh. 47, NORTAF Interview Report at 2 (emphasis added). Graf then told ASA Albanese, who was conducting the felony review of the case, that Hwang said that Paul Koh feared his father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSOF \u00b6 67;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exh. 157, Felony Review Folder (reporting that Paul \"made an outcry to a youth minister [ ] that he was scared of his father\"). Hwang now denies that he ever told police that Paul was afraid of Mr. Koh,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exh. 48, Hwang Dep. Tr. 173:5-74:23 (sealed). But even assuming (as the Court must) that Hwang is telling the truth, Mr. Koh's claim fails. The two officers who interviewed Hwang are not defendants in this case, and there is no evidence at all that Graf or any other defendant knew that the interviewing officers' account of Hwang's interview was false. So none of the Defendants is on the hook for the alleged falsehoods about Hwang's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Mr. Koh's last theory is that Graf fabricated testimony by encouraging Paul Koh's friend Neil Schnitzler to make false statements that incriminated Mr. Koh.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. Br. at 52-53. In the course of the investigation into Paul's death, Schnitzler gave three different statements to the police, each with slightly different details.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   See PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 68-69. Most importantly, in Schnitzler's third statement, Schnitzler told Graf that he had accidentally called the Kohs' home on the night of Paul's death (intending to call Paul's cell), and told whoever picked up the phone \"I got the stuff, meet back at my house.\" R. 287-17, Exh. 75, Schnitzler Dep. Tr. 219:13-20. This testimony was important because it supported the police officers' theory that Paul had been out doing drugs on the night of his death, and that Mr. Koh knew about it and became angry at Paul.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSOF \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Unfortunately for the Kohs, there is no evidence at all that Graf or any other officer falsified Schnitzler's testimony. Schnitzler affirms that he made this statement,\n   and his story is backed up by the Kohs' home phone records, which showed a call from Schnitzler's number on the night in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 75, Schnitzler Dep. Tr. 219:13; 218:8-9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PSOF \u00b6 69. The Kohs assert that Graf got Schnitzler to lie in exchange for lenience in Schnitzler's criminal drug case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 69-70; Pls.' Resp. Br. at 52-53. But there is no actual\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   to back up this assertion, only unsupported innuendo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delapaz v.

Malicious Prosecution and Pretrial Detention\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Kohs believe that the Defendants maliciously prosecuted Mr. Koh, and that Mr. Koh was detained without probable cause in the time leading up to his criminal trial in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment claim stems from the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Manuel v. City of Joliet\n   </em>\n   , which held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits detention without probable cause even after a defendant has received legal process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The malicious prosecution claim is based on Illinois tort law. To prevail on a malicious prosecution claim under Illinois law, a plaintiff must establish: \"(1) the commencement or continuation of an original criminal or civil judicial proceeding by the defendant; (2) the termination of the proceeding in favor of the plaintiff; (3) the absence of probable cause of such proceeding; (4) malice; and (5) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Sang Ken Kim v.

As discussed above, a reasonable factfinder would\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   to find that there was probable cause to detain Mr. Koh before the start of his second police interview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.2.a,\n   <em>\n    above.\n   </em>\n   No information later emerged to destroy probable cause. Indeed, some later-revealed facts actually\n   <em>\n    reinforced\n   </em>\n   the theory that Mr. Koh killed Paul. Interviews with Paul's friends, for example, confirmed that Paul and Mr. Koh fought frequently, and that Paul seemed to be afraid of Mr. Koh.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 308-13, Exh. 120.

Emerging physical evidence also suggested that Mr. Koh might be guilty.

The same friends who told police about Paul's conflict with his father also noted that Paul seemed sad, depressed, and anxious. Exh. 120, Mazurkiewicz\n   Dep. Tr. 35:17-36:14, 64:13-14.

On the undisputed facts, a reasonable jury would have to find that probable cause existed to believe that Mr. Koh killed Paul from the time of Mr. Koh's second interview all the way through his acquittal.

Section 15.14 orders officers to \"[s]ecure,\" \"[s]eparate,\" \"arrange [for] transport[ ],\" and hold all witnesses at the police station \"until they have been interviewed.\" Exh. 102, NPD General Order 15.14. Tellingly, there is no prefatory language in Section 15.14 that tempers its application. It would be one thing if Section 15.14 contained a qualifier requiring officers to obtain the witnesses' consent, for example. But there is no language to this effect. That Section 15.14 on its face gives officers seemingly boundless authority to seize, transport, and detain a witness without their consent-and without stopping to consider the existence of reasonable suspicion or probable cause-is evidence that the order explicitly violates the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   And there is enough evidence that the officers acted pursuant to Section 15.14 when they secured and separated the Kohs at their house before driving them to the station and holding them there for hours on end.

The first argument fails. It is unclear whether the state court judge considered the same evidence at the suppression hearing that is currently before this Court on the Kohs' involuntary confession claim. And even if the state court judge had considered the same evidence, the evidentiary picture would have been different due to the procedural posture of this case. On a motion for summary judgment, the Court is\n    <em>\n     required\n    </em>\n    to credit the non-moving party's evidence and make all reasonable inferences in their favor. The state court judge, on the other hand, was free to make credibility judgments, weigh the evidence, and find facts, and did so.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , R. 291-2, Exh. 97, J.
