Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case involves a dispute over real property located at 2117 Summer Lily Avenue, North Las Vegas, Nevada (the \"property\"). On November 24, 2008, Magdelyn Vasquez-Castro obtained a loan in the amount of $212,199 from non-party Universal American Mortgage Company, LLC, (\"UAMC\") to purchase the property. (ECF No. 1). The loan was secured by a deed of trust recorded on November 26, 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 22, 2010, the deed of trust was assigned to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, via an assignment of deed of trust (recorded on April 2, 2010).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; (ECF No. 30-3).

However, as the discussed in the previous section, the amount due was set forth in the notice of default. Rather than tendering the noticed amount under protest so as to preserve its\n   interest and then later seeking a refund of the difference in dispute, BOA chose to request a statement of account based on the belief that it could tender a lesser amount to avoid foreclosure.
