Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This Memorandum and Opinion addresses the defendants' second motion to dismiss this securities-fraud amended complaint. The complaint arises from a highly publicized oil spill in an environmentally sensitive area on the California coast. The defendants responded, according to the plaintiffs, with a series of misrepresentations about the extent of the spill and the financial impact on Plains, the oil and gas pipeline owner and operator. The plaintiffs contend that Plains falsely claimed to have a comprehensive, effective environmental and regulatory compliance program to prevent oil spills and, if they occurred, to quickly remediate the effects. When the facts emerged, the stock price dropped. A putative class of stockholders sued the company, its officers and directors, and the banks that underwrote some of its securities offerings, seeking compensation for their stock-price losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On March 29, 2017, the court issued a lengthy Memorandum and Opinion addressing the defendants' first motions to dismiss. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims, without prejudice and with leave to amend. (Docket Entry No. 136).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The specific rulings were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \u2022 The Exchange Act claims were dismissed, without prejudice and with leave to amend, because: (1) the majority of the statements, as pleaded, were not actionably misleading, and (2) the plaintiffs did not allege facts that gave rise to a strong inference of scienter for any defendant for any statement. Op. at 32-33;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022 Some of the Exchange Act claims were found potentially actionable, but not as pleaded, including two legal-compliance statements in Plains's agreements with the Underwriter defendants:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) \"None of the Issuers, the GP Entities or the Material Subsidiaries is in violation of any law, statute, ordinance, administrative or governmental rule or regulation applicable to it or of any decree of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over it....\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) \"Environmental Compliance. Except as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, none of the Plains Entities, directly or indirectly, has violated any environmental, safety, health or similar law or regulation applicable to its business relating to the protection of human health and safety, the environment or hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants (\"Environmental Laws\"), or lacks any permits, licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to own, lease or operate their properties and conduct their business as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the\n   Prospectus or is violating any terms and conditions of any such permit, license or approval, which in each case would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.\" Op. at 61.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 A statement about corrosion control on the Plains website and three post-spill statements by Plains's safety and security director, Patrick Hodgins, were actionably misleading, as pleaded, including:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) a statement on Plains's website that it \"perform[s] scheduled maintenance on all of our pipeline systems and make[s] repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate,\" Op. at 41;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) Hodgins's statement that \"[t]he first time I heard anything about the corrosion is what I read in the newspapers.... We had no indication at all to assume there was an issue,\" Op. at 74-75;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (3) Hodgins's statement, when asked whether the 2007 or 2012 in-line inspection runs had uncovered any sections of line 901 with metal loss greater than 50 percent, that Plains \"had not had any indication at that time,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (4) Hodgins's failure to correct a spill-estimate figure, when asked about a 105,000 gallon spill volume, despite Plains's alleged knowledge that the spill volume could be much larger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 The four statements that were actionably misleading as pleaded-Hodgins's three statements and the statement about corrosion control on Plains's website-were not set out with an alleged basis for a strong inference of scienter. Op. at 76-77.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 The plaintiffs' \"general\" allegations of scienter as to the statements held to be false or misleading were insufficient. Op. at 77-88.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 The defendants' loss-causation arguments were not a sufficient basis to dismiss the case. Op. at 89.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 The court rejected the plaintiffs' \"class standing\" argument; held that the plaintiffs who did not purchase notes in or traceable to the August 2013, September 2014, or the two December 2014 notes offerings did not have standing; and dismissed the plaintiffs' claims under \u00a7 11 and \u00a7 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act for those offerings, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Op. at 97.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court dismissed the plaintiffs' Exchange Act and Securities Act claims, without prejudice and with leave to amend. Op. at 98. The plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Consolidated Complaint. (Docket Entry No. 137). The Plains defendants and the Underwriter defendants have moved to dismiss this amended pleading. (Docket Entries No. 140, 141). The plaintiffs responded, and both groups of defendants separately replied. (Docket Entry Nos. 142, 143, 144). The court held a hearing at which it heard arguments on the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The primary new factual allegations in the Second Amended Complaint are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 some of Plains's statements apply \"specifically-and exclusively\" to its pipelines in high-consequence areas;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Plains had notice of regulatory violations because of warning letters from the PHMSA from 2009 and 2013 about Lines 901 and 903;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Plains was indicted in Santa Barbara Superior Court in May 2016 on felony charges for its conduct related to the spill;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 the conclusions in the PHMSA's May 19, 2016 Failure Investigation Report were derived from Plains's own data;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Plains had received several other warning letters and notices of violations from the PHMSA in 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2016, about regulatory violations on its pipelines in other parts of the country;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 conclusions from the May 19, 2016 Failure Investigation Report detailing regulatory violations on Line 901;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Plains did not perform adequate inspections or maintenance on its pipelines, had ineffective corrosion protection, did not have adequate leak-detection systems or monitoring, and did not adequately respond to the Line 901 spill, in violation of federal regulations;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Plains's legal and regulatory compliance failures and pipeline-integrity deficiencies were allegedly reported to the individual defendants because of representations in Plains's Form 8-K underwriting agreements and Forms 10-K and 10-Q that Plains maintained disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information was \"recorded, processed, summarized, and communicated\" to Plains's officers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 by virtue of Plains's audit committee's charter, the committee received notice of all potential or actual regulatory non-compliance that could \"result in material non-compliance\"; the committee in turn reported to the Board;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 two of the named defendants signed Sarbanes-Oxley Act certifications in Plains's Forms 10-K and 10-Q that \"material information...[was] made known to [them]....\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 reports required by the Pipeline Inspection, Enforcement, and Safety (\"PIPES\") Act \"could not be compiled or verified without the underlying data Plains obtained through its ILIs and excavations of Lines 901 and 903 throughout the class period\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 statements in Plains's Code of Business Conduct emphasized a commitment to compliance with applicable laws and a requirement that material deviations from pipeline-safety and environmental-protection measures must be approved by two of four senior executive officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The facts set out here are taken primarily from the Second Amended Consolidated Complaint, (Docket Entry No. 137).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The factual background pleaded in the earlier complaints, much of which is repeated in the Second Amended Complaint, is also set out in detail in the March 2017 Memorandum and Opinion. Op. at 3-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the Second Amended Complaint alleges more specific facts about Plains's pre-spill regulatory violations, the Second Amended Complaint still does not allege a strong inference of scienter. The new scienter allegations are, again, based on the defendants' positions within the company and certifications they signed affirming that senior executives had reviewed reports containing material information. These allegations are not enough to establish a cogent and compelling inference of scienter. The motions to dismiss, (Docket Entries No. 140, 141), are granted. This third effort to replead does not cure the deficiencies. The claims are dismissed with prejudice and without leave to amend, because further amendment would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The reasons for these rulings are explained in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The court's earlier Memorandum and Opinion dismissed the claims related to the August 2013 senior-notes offering, the September 2014 senior-notes offering, and the two December 2014 senior-notes offerings because the plaintiffs did not have standing. Op. at 97. The Second Amended Complaint includes allegations about these offerings only \"to preserve all rights related to claims arising out of those offerings.\" 2d Compl. \u00b6 2, n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Second Amended Consolidated Complaint's Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For purposes of this motion to dismiss, the allegations in the Second Amended Consolidated are taken as true except to the extent that they are contradicted by the narrow category of documents the court may consider on a motion to dismiss without converting it into one for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Allegations as to Plains's Operations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plains All American Pipeline is a publicly traded MLP. Its business is interstate and intrastate crude-oil pipeline transportation and storage. Before and during the class period, Plains was one of North America's largest energy pipeline operators. It grew primarily by acquiring significant pipeline and terminal networks. 2d Compl. \u00b6 87. The assets acquired included Lines 901 and 903, built in 1987 and acquired by Plains in 1998. Line 901 extends approximately 10 miles along the California coast, where it connects to Line 903, which continues 128 miles through Santa Barbara County and into Kern County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plains conducted periodic inspections of the pipeline with internal inspection devices called pipeline-inspection gauges, or \"smart pigs.\" Smart pigs are run inside a pipeline to detect anomalies caused by corrosion, cracks, laminations, dents, or other defects. These runs are called in-line inspections. Plains's third-party in-line-inspection vendor, Rosen, conducted in-line inspections on Line 901 in June 2007, July 2012, and May 5, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plains's pipeline operations are controlled remotely from a center in Midland, Texas that is operated and staffed at all times. The center \"continuously monitors all of Plains's liquid product movements\" and \"maintains system integrity through leak detection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. The center monitors and operates over 850 remote sites.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   During the class period, most of the Plains pipelines, including Lines 901 and 903, were under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials\n   Safety Administration. The PHMSA enforces regulations under the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. Federal regulations enacted under the Act, referred to in this opinion as the \"Pipeline Safety Act,\" required Plains to \"adopt measures designed to reduce the environmental impact of oil discharges from onshore pipelines, including the maintenance of comprehensive spill response plans and the performance of extensive spill response training for pipeline personnel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2002 and 2006 amendments to the Pipeline Safety Act required Plains to \"implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in 'high consequence areas,' such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and commercially navigable waterways.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92. PHMSA regulations also required Plains to implement enhanced measures in high-consequence areas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Lines 901 and 903 were in a high-consequence area because they were close to the environmentally sensitive Santa Barbara coastline, rivers, state parks, and national forests. The plaintiffs allege that, during the class period, Lines 901 and 903 comprised 9 to 10 percent of Plains's interstate crude-oil pipelines in high-consequence areas, and 15 to 18 percent of Plains's pipelines affecting commercially navigable waters and sensitive ecological resources.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plains had to comply with the PHMSA's enhanced high-consequence-area requirements for Lines 901 and 903.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plains was also generally, and specifically for Lines 901 and 903, subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, referred to as the \"Clean Water Act,\" as amended. That Act imposes restrictions on the discharge of pollutants, like crude oil, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as into state waters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plains publicly stated throughout the class period that it was in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations. Plains also stated that it had implemented pipeline maintenance and integrity measures \"beyond regulatory mandate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. The plaintiffs allege that Plains knew that both statements were false when they were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plains's Pre-Class Period Actions and the EPA Consent Decree\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plains and its related companies reported 229 safety and maintenance \"incidents\" on pipelines to federal regulators, more than all but three other reporting companies. These incidents resulted in more than $141 million in property damage and the release of more than 800,000 gallons of hazardous liquids.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The EPA sued Plains in 2010 and obtained a consent decree requiring Plains to pay significant fines for regulatory violations, and to adopt new safety measures to prevent spills and reduce the impact when they did occur.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. The consent decree required Plains to take steps that included the following: to spend $41 million to upgrade more than 10,000 miles of pipeline; to conduct weekly aerial patrols of certain pipelines to check for leaks; to spend millions to mitigate leak threats from corrosion; to install computational pipeline-monitoring capabilities; and to conduct ongoing monitoring of its pipeline system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98. None of the $41 million was spent on upgrading or repairing Lines 901 or 903.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs repeatedly allege that the consent decree specifically required Plains to repair, upgrade, monitor, and take other similar actions on Lines 901 and 903. The consent decree is a public document central to the plaintiffs' complaint, so the court may consider it on this motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The defendants insist that the consent decree does not support the plaintiffs' characterization. The consent decree is discussed in detail later in this opinion. For now, it suffices to note that while the decree did include Lines 901 and 903 on a lengthy list of lines subject to certain requirements, it did not require Plains to make specific expenditures or take specific steps on Lines 901 or 903. And, as the defendants emphasize, the United States and Plains jointly terminated the consent decree in 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 20,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Plains All American Pipeline, LP\n   </em>\n   , 4:10-cv-2833 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 26, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plains's Statements About Its Pipeline Integrity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In the wake of the consent decree, Plains executives issued statements telling investors that it had adopted enhanced measures to ensure pipeline integrity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99. The Plains 2012 Form 10-K, filed the first day of the class period, reassured investors that \"pipeline integrity management\" was Plains's \"primary operational emphasis,\" and that Plains had \"implemented programs intended to maintain the integrity of our assets, with a focus on risk reduction through testing, enhanced corrosion control, leak detection, and damage prevention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Form 10-K stated that the Plains \"pipelines are in substantial compliance with [applicable regulations]\" and that Plains's \"integrity management program\" included measures that went beyond legal requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   At a 2014 investor day conference, Plains CEO Greg Armstrong stated that \"[s]afety is a core value\" and that Plains \"foster[s] a culture that emphasizes operational excellence, asset integrity, &amp; safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100. The top three items in Armstrong's presentation were \"Safety,\" \"Pipeline Integrity Management,\" and \"Incident Response Preparation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Armstrong assured investors that \"[w]e are committed to operational excellence in safety, pipeline integrity management, and responding to incidents in the unfortunate development that they do occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Armstrong also stated that \"we do a lot and I mean a tremendous amount that will never be appreciated by the public\" on safety and spill prevention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Armstrong acknowledged that safety and environmental compliance may \"in the short-term hurt our performance in terms of relative to EBITDA targets, etc.,\" but stated that notwithstanding this effect, \"in all cases we want to make sure we do the right thing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Officer defendants made several statements, which the plaintiffs say were false and misleading, about Plains's pipeline integrity-management program and Plains's investments in complying with regulations governing pipelines in high-consequence areas. These statements were:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (1) [t]he DOT regulations include requirements for the establishment of pipeline integrity management programs and for protections of 'high consequence areas' where a pipeline leak or rupture could produce significant adverse consequences. We have also developed and implemented certain pipeline integrity measures that go beyond regulatory mandate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (2) \"[i]n that regard, we have implemented programs intended to maintain the integrity of our assets, with a focus on risk reduction through testing, enhanced corrosion control, leak detection, and damage prevention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that Plains reassured investors of its commitment to regulatory compliance in high-consequence areas, stating in its class-period Form 10-Ks that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (1) Plains \"devote[d] substantial resources to comply with [government]-mandated pipeline integrity rules ... for\n   protection of 'high consequence areas' where a pipeline leak or rupture could produce significant adverse consequences\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (2) that Plains had complied with the Department of Transportation's requirements for high-consequence areas, including \"more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures, to ensure pipeline safety in 'high consequence areas,' such as ... commercially navigable waterways.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-102.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that these statements apply \"specifically-and exclusively\" to all of Plains's pipelines running through high-consequence areas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants, in contrast, argue that the statements describe Plains's company-wide integrity-management plan and are not limited to, or focused on, pipelines in high-consequence areas. (Docket Entry No. 143 at 2-3). This dispute is discussed further below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plains also represented that its officers were involved in the company's safety, pipeline-integrity, and incident-response work. 2d Compl. \u00b6 105. During the class period, Plains's website asserted that its Environmental, Health, and Safety Program was \"successful because it is developed, supported and carried out by our employees, from the senior management team down to the newest hire\"; that \"Plains All American is committed to public safety, protection of the environment and operation of our facilities in a prudent and safe manner\"; and that the Plains entities \"believe that all of our pipelines have been constructed and are maintained in all material respects in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, standards proscribed by the American Petroleum Institute and accepted industry practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that these statements would lead reasonable investors to believe that Plains's pipeline integrity-management program, specifically as applied to Lines 901 and 901, fully complied with all applicable regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107. The plaintiffs contend that reasonable investors would not expect that Plains instead: (1) ignored \"troubling warnings\" from the PHMSA and Plains's own field measurements showing that the in-line inspection tool was inaccurate; (2) instructed its in-line-inspection vendor to ignore anomalies; (3) ignored inaccuracies in its repair decisions; (4) failed to properly repair or replace pipelines; (5) disregarded regulatory requirements and PHMSA notices and warnings to conduct preventive and mitigative evaluations; (6) ignored warnings that its corrosion-control program was ineffective; (7) ignored warnings about control-room violations; and (8) disregarded industry practices by failing to install automatic shutoff valves on Lines 901 and 903.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   According to the Second Amended Complaint, Plains falsely assured investors that, when a leak was detected, the company would promptly respond, coordinate with public officials, and implement a comprehensive plan to prevent severe environmental impacts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109. The plaintiffs say that these promises of safe and effective pipeline operation were illusory. Instead, Plains had, and knew it had, disregarded its pipeline-integrity and maintenance obligations, with predictable results when a spill occurred in a high-consequence area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Spill\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   On May 19, 2015, Line 901 ruptured and spilled oil into the Pacific Ocean and environmentally sensitive coastal areas. The spill killed nearly 200 birds and more than 100 marine mammals, including dolphins and sea lions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110-112. At an investor day conference held shortly after the spill,\n   Armstrong conceded that \"[i]f you could pick any place in the world you would not want to have a release, [Santa Barbara] would probably qualify as the one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plains's response to the spill left much to be desired. State law required Plains to report the spill to the federal National Response Center within 30 minutes of detection. Instead, Plains did not report the spill to the National Response Center until hours after it was discovered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114. Plains's own response plans indicated that it should take no more than 15 minutes to discover a release and shut down the flow. Plains officials noticed anomalies in Line 901 by 10:30 a.m., but they did not shut the pipeline down until 11:30 a.m. Government officials first learned of the spill through a 911 call from beachgoers-not from Plains-at approximately 11:42 a.m. The local fire department notified the National Response Center of the spill at 12:43 p.m., over two hours before Plains itself notified the agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   According to the plaintiffs, Plains's \"spin operation\" was far more effective than its on-the-ground response. Plains officials stated that the company's \"worst case\" estimate showed that, at most, 21,100 gallons of oil had spread into the ocean, and as many as 105,000 gallons had been released.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115. On May 26, 2015, Plains filed a Form 8-K with the SEC. The Form 8-K described the spill and stated that Plains \"currently estimates that the amount of released crude oil could be as high as approximately 2,400 barrels,\" equivalent to 101,000 gallons of oil; this represented a 4,000 gallon reduction from the initial \"worst case\" estimate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plains allegedly waged a public-relations campaign to create the impression that it was working efficiently and effectively to remedy the spill, when it knew it had understated the extent of the spill and that it lacked the capability to respond effectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 116-117.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Plains Reveals the Severity of the Spill\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   On August 5, 2015, Plains disclosed in an investor presentation that as much as 143,000 gallons of oil might have leaked, an amount 42 percent larger than previously reported.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118. Plains also disclosed that both the U.S. Department of Justice and the California Attorney General were investigating the spill; Plains could be liable for criminal violations of the Clean Water Act; and Lines 901 and 903 were subject to multiple PHMSA corrective actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For the first time, according to the plaintiffs, Plains disclosed that the spill would cost the company $257 million-not including lost revenue associated with shutting down Lines 901 and 903-and that Plains's insurance did not cover all the costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   During May and June, the defendants communicated regularly with investors and the public. The communications included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   \u2022 On June 4, 2015, defendants hosted an investor day, at which Armstrong discussed the Santa Barbara oil spill and encouraged investors to visit the Plains website for \"daily updates\" on the spill.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 365.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   \u2022 On the www.plainsline901response.com website, in the \"daily updates\" section, Plains posted: (1) incident updates on June 29, 2015, July 6, 2013, and July 13, 2015; (2) \"Recovery Q&amp;As\" on June 17, 2015; (3) the investor day presentation on June 4, 2015; and (4) Armstrong's letters to members of Congress on June 24, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   \u2022 The defendants and other Plains representatives had numerous conversations with the press about the spill\n   between May 28, 2015 and August 5, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 372.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The PHMSA had required Plains to have a spill-response plan for Lines 901 and 903. That plan, in place before the spill occurred, estimated the worst-case scenario for a spill from Line 901 at 148,092 gallons, closer to the actual damage than to Plains's initially released estimates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 368. The spill-response plan's risk analysis assumed \"10 minutes total time to detect the rupture and 5 minutes to shutdown pipeline.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But on the day of the spill, Plains employees did not shut down the rupture for more than two hours after it began.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs point to this delay as evidence of Plains's misrepresentations about its pipeline safety and spill-response capabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

The ownership structure and internal incentive schemes of the various Plains partnerships and companies rewarded each group of defendants for distributing cash to Plains All American's unit-holders. The Officer defendants' bonuses, some potentially over one million dollars, depended on their generating cash, reducing the incentive to spend money repairing decaying pipelines.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2060109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2060109\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 175-186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that the defendants knew before the spill that Line 901 had reached or exceeded its useful life. Lines 901 and 903 were constructed in 1987 and were operational in 1990. In May 2015, Line 901 had been operating for 25 years. Plains's SEC filings stated that the lines had an estimated maximum useful life of 30 years, based on the \"condition, manufacturing specifications, technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2060109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2060109\">\n    \u00b6 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs allege that the defendants knew that Line 901 was located in a sandy, coastal environment that could create corrosion problems, which, combined with the fact that the lines were located in a high-consequence area, made the 30-year estimate unrealistically high. The plaintiffs contend that had the defendants had properly monitored and evaluated Line 901, they would have known that it had exceeded its useful life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs allege that decreasing production volumes on Lines 901 and 903 motivated the defendants to look the other way. In 1995, Plains reported that it shipped an average of 152,000 net barrels of oil per day from the outer continental shelf fields, which included Lines 901 and 903. By 2014, the production volumes from these fields had dropped to an average of 37,000 net barrels per day. In its 2013, 2014, and 2015 filings with the\n   SEC, Plains reported the decline in volumes shipped from the outer continental shelf. The plaintiffs allege that this production decrease gave the defendants \"little incentive to undertake the massive repairs necessary to keep an almost thirty-year-old pipeline safe and compliant with regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2060109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2060109\">\n    \u00b6 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Repairing the pipeline would have required replacing large segments, at significant cost, and Plains's insurance would cover some clean-up costs from any spills.

The Exchange Act Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint alleges four categories of the defendants' alleged misrepresentations. The four are misrepresentations about: (1) integrity management, corrosion control, and leak detection; (2) spill-response capabilities; (3) the size and scope of the spill; and (4) legal compliance. The unattributed statements on Plains's website and the allegations added to the Second Amended Complaint about statements from Plains's Code of Business Conduct are separately discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Statements About Plains's Integrity-Management Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that the statements about Plains's integrity-management program, Statements 1 through 9, (2d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 192-195, 202, 204-208), were materially false and misleading. These statements are allegedly false because: (1) Plains's \"smart pig\" in-line inspections did not accurately identify the degree of corrosion on Lines 901 and 903, (\u00b6\u00b6 214-224); (2) Plains failed to evaluate the need for or implement mitigative measures for Lines 901 and 903, (\u00b6\u00b6 244-265); (3) Plains's cathodic-protection system was ineffective against the degree of external corrosion on Lines 901 and 903, (\u00b6\u00b6 283-295); and (4) Plains's leak-detection system was deficient and Plains failed to provide proper training on leak detection, (\u00b6\u00b6 312-321). The Second Amended Complaint alleges that Plains's officers made representations and signed certifications that Plains provided its senior executives with material information about pipeline integrity. As a result, reasonable investors would have expected that the statements about pipeline integrity would have \"fairly aligned with the material information in their possession.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 213). Reasonable investors also would have expected the defendants' statements to be supported by a \"meaningful inquiry\" into Plains's compliance record, integrity-management and corrosion-control policies, and practices in high-consequence areas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Statements 1 and 3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Statements 1 and 3 are from Plains's Form 10-Ks and Initial Public Offering materials.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-243\">\n   \u2022 Statement 1: \"The DOT regulations include requirements for the establishment of pipeline integrity management programs and for protection of 'high consequence areas' where a pipeline leak or rupture could produce significant adverse consequences. We have also developed and implemented certain pipeline integrity measures that go beyond regulatory mandate.... Accordingly, for 2013 and beyond, we will continue to focus on pipeline integrity management as a primary operational emphasis. In that regard, we have implemented programs intended to maintain the integrity of our assets, with a focus\n   on risk reduction through testing, enhanced corrosion control, leak detection and damage prevention.\" 2d Compl. \u00b6 192.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-244\">\n   \u2022 Statement 3: \"We have an internal review process in which we examine the condition and operating history of our pipelines and gathering assets to determine if any of our assets warrant additional investment or replacement.\" 2d Compl. \u00b6 194.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The March 2017 Memorandum and Opinion held that Statements 1 and 3 were nonactionable \"generalized, top-level-executive\" statements. Op. at 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that Statement 1 is actionable because a reasonable investor would have understood it as a factual representation that Plains had implemented and carried out enhanced integrity-management measures on all of its high-consequence-area pipelines, including Lines 901 and 903. (Docket Entry No. 142 at 16-18). The plaintiffs argue that the word \"any\" in Statement 3 amounts to a factual representation that Plains had reviewed all of its pipelines, when in reality it did not review Lines 901 and 903. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 19-20). The defendants respond that these are both generalized, top-level statements about Plains's overall safety measures on its pipeline system, and that the statements are not made false or misleading by problems on individual pipelines. (Docket Entry No. 140 at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   The dispute is about the level of generality. The plaintiffs say the statements are only about Plains's pipelines in high-consequence areas. The defendants say that the statements are summaries of Plains's safety measures generally used on its huge pipeline network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   The defendants have the better argument. The statements that Plains \"implemented certain pipeline integrity measures that go beyond regulatory mandate\"; had \"an internal review process... to determine if any of [its] assets warrant additional investment or replacement\"; and that pipeline integrity management is a \"primary operational emphasis\" all describe Plains's overall safety policies and programs. Statement 1 describes two requirements in the conjunctive. One requirement is for establishing pipeline integrity-management programs, and one is for protecting high-consequence areas. The first includes, but goes beyond, the second. The statements do not describe specific actions taken on any particular pipeline, or particularly on pipelines in high-consequence areas. Even if the statements are considered as focused on Plain's pipelines in high-consequence areas, as the plaintiffs argue, Plains owned and operated 2,429.7 miles of pipeline in high-consequence areas in 2015. (Docket Entry No. 140, Ex. 4). Line 901 was itself a 10-mile segment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   The plaintiffs do not allege that Plains lacked an internal-review process for its pipelines, or allege that pipeline integrity management was not Plains's primary operational emphasis. Allegations that Plains was ineffective in implementing its policies to have pipeline-integrity programs and measures and to make pipeline integrity a \"primary operational emphasis\" do not make the general statements describing Plains's policies and priorities actionably misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Anadarko Petrol.

The statements did not suggest, muss less affirmatively assert, that specific steps under particular programs applied to every, or any particular part, of the pipeline network, or every part or any particular part of its pipelines in high-consequence areas. The allegations in the Second Amended Complaint describe problems on Lines 901 and 903 and regulatory violations on Plains's other pipelines. Those allegations do not undermine the general proposition that Plains did in fact have an internal-review process in place, that pipeline integrity management was a \"primary operational emphasis,\" and that Plains had and implemented programs intended to maintain the integrity of its pipeline network. Because Statements 1 and 3 broadly and generally refer to Plains's policies and processes, not to specific actions taken on specific pipelines, and because the plaintiffs do not allege facts to contradict those statements, the statements are not actionably false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Statement 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Statement 4 is a statement repeated in Plains's Form 10-Ks filed during the class period and in its Initial Public Offering materials. The statement is set out in its full context, as it appeared in those materials, not as it is excerpted in the Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   \u2022 Statement 4: \"The HLPSA was amended by the Pipeline Improvement Act of 2002 and the Pipeline, Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006. These amendments have resulted in the adoption of rules by the Department of Transportation ('DOT') that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including\n   <strong>\n    more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in 'high consequence areas,'\n   </strong>\n   such as high population areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and\n   <strong>\n    commercially navigable waterways\n   </strong>\n   . In the United States, our costs associated with the inspection, testing and correction of identified anomalies were approximately $107 million in 2014, $57 million in 2013 and $39 million in 2012. Based on currently available information, our preliminary estimate for 2015 is that we will incur approximately $75 million in capital expenditures and approximately $27 million in operational expenditures associated with our required pipeline integrity management program. Significant additional expenses could be incurred if new or more stringently interpreted pipeline safety requirements are implemented. Currently, we believe our pipelines are in substantial compliance with HLPSA and the 2002 and 2006 amendments. In addition to required activities, our integrity management program includes several voluntary, multi-year initiatives designed to prevent incidents. Costs incurred for such activities were approximately $21 million in 2014, $22 million in 2013 and $24 million in 2012, and our preliminary estimate for 2015 is that we will incur approximately $31 million of such costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   We are subject to the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulations at certain facilities.

According to the plaintiffs, this statement was false because \"Plains did not in fact perform required inspections or maintenance on its pipelines, including aging pipelines running through HCAs\"; \"failed to conduct proper inspections\"; \"failed to conduct mitigative measures for Lines 901 and 903\"; \"employed ineffective cathodic protection systems that failed to protect against corrosion\"; and \"did not have appropriate leak detection systems or training.\" (Docket Entry No. 142 at 16 (citing 2d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 212, 214-224, 244-265, 283-295, 312-321) ). The plaintiffs also allege the PHMSA's conclusion that \"it does not appear that Plains has an effective corrosion control program,\" issued after the spill and the class period, makes Statement 4 false or misleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   The defendants respond that the plaintiffs fail to consider the context of the two statements. The Second Amended Complaint lists the two bolded sentences next to each other. The first bolded sentence is a description of the Department of Transportation's requirements. The second bolded sentence, which appears in a different paragraph on a different page of the Form 10-Ks and the IPO materials, does not refer to those requirements. (Docket Entry No. 140 at 7). The defendants also argue that the second bolded sentence states an opinion that Plains was operating in \"substantial compliance\" with its risk-management program, and that allegations of \"scattered regulatory issues are not adequate to render such a statement false or misleading.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   The first bolded sentence in Statement 4 is not actionable. It describes the Department of Transportation's requirements for pipeline operators' integrity-management programs, and makes no representation about Plains's actions. The bolded part outlines the actions the regulations require. The following sentences describe the amount of money Plains spent on its pipeline integrity-management program and on complying with those regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   The second bolded sentence refers to OSHA and EPA regulations, not to the Department of Transportation's requirements, as the plaintiffs claim, and it is not false or misleading as to Plains's compliance with those requirements. The sentence, which contains the \"substantial compliance\" qualifier, is a statement of opinion. The court's March 2017 Memorandum and Opinion dismissed the falsity allegations as to this statement because they did \"not mention Plains's risk-management system or detail substantial deviations from it.\" Op. at 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Although the Second Amended Complaint's allegations about Statement 4 list several regulations that Plains allegedly violated, the violations are not about Plains's failure to comply with the OSHA-mandated risk-management system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 244-265. As with the other legal-compliance statements discussed below, the \"we believe\" and \"substantial compliance\" language are additional and alternative reasons that Statement 4 is not actionably false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Statements 6, 7, and 8\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   Statements 6, 7, and 8 are about Plains's use of fix-up capital, \"smart pigs,\" and advanced inspection and data-interpretation tools.

Op. at 43. The claim as to Statement 7 was dismissed because the plaintiffs did not allege facts contradicting the statement and because it summarized Plains's safety and prevention efforts at a \"broad and general level.\" Op. at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that, contrary to what Plains represented in these statements, Plains \"did not in fact perform needed maintenance on its pipeline systems, including aging parts subject to corrosion that ran through sensitive high-consequence areas,\" and \"systematically failed to comply with the minimum standards for pipeline integrity management.\" (2d Compl. \u00b6 212). The plaintiffs allege that Plains used an ineffective cathodic-protection system and failed to conduct proper data integration, which led to inaccuracies in its in-line inspection tool. The plaintiffs argue that the statements are false because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   Plains did not perform appropriate inspections or maintenance on its pipelines, including aging pipelines running through HCAs (\u00b6\u00b6 214-224), failed to conduct mitigative measures for Lines 901 and 903 (\u00b6\u00b6 244-265), employed ineffective corrosion protection (\u00b6\u00b6 283-295), and did not have appropriate leak detection or training (\u00b6\u00b6 312-321). In short, \"Plains systematically failed to comply with the minimum standards for pipeline integrity management established in the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Regulations and the Liquid Integrity Management Rule, leading to deficiencies in testing, corrosion control, leak detection, and damage provision.\" \u00b6 212.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 142 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   The cited paragraphs from the Second Amended Complaint allege that a 2012 in-line inspection survey of Line 901 concluded that Plains's in-line inspection tool had an \"undercall\" bias, which would cause inaccuracies in the data on the extent of pipeline metal loss and the length and width of corrosion anomalies. (2d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 214-224). The paragraphs allege that\n   Plains did not share its field-measurement data with its third-party in-line-inspection vendor, Rosen, deviating from industry practice and violating regulatory requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The cited complaint paragraphs refer to the PHMSA's post-spill failure investigation report on the Line 901 spill and corrosion levels on Lines 901 and 903 that violated regulatory requirements. (\u00b6\u00b6 244-265).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   The paragraphs cited next discuss how Plains disconnected thousands of feet of Line 901 from its cathodic-protection system; refer to a 2006 National Association of Corrosion Engineers report setting out guidelines to mitigate the limits of cathodic-protection systems and warning against using certain corrosion-control measures; and refer to 2008 and 2009 letters from the PHMSA to Plains warning that its coating standards and corrosion-control measures were inadequate. (\u00b6\u00b6 283-295). These cited paragraphs allege that despite these warnings, Plains's corrosion-control measures on Lines 901 and 903 were ineffective and violated federal regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   The final cited paragraphs allege that Plains failed to upgrade its leak-monitoring system; did not properly manage its alarm settings; and failed to adequately train control-room personnel. (\u00b6\u00b6 313-321). The paragraphs also allege that Plains did not conduct preventive or mitigative evaluations in 2013 and 2014 for Lines 901 and 903, because Plains had characterized those lines as \"a low-to-medium priority\" compared to other parts of its pipeline network. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The cited paragraphs allege that the failure to upgrade the leak-monitoring system and to implement an automatic shut-off system violated pipeline-safety regulations and industry practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint does not allege facts that make Statements 6, 7, or 8 false or misleading. Statement 6 makes no allegations that Plains did not make fix-up-capital forecasts or that they were inaccurate as to the lines at issue. The Second Amended Complaint's allegations as to Statements 7 and 8 are that the in-line inspection tools were consistently inaccurate in measuring metal losses and corrosion on Lines 901 and 903. The falsity allegations are that the tools and technology were ineffective because of: the \"undercall bias\"; the failure to conduct preventive and mitigative measures on Lines 901 and 903; and ineffective corrosion protection and leak-detection systems and training. The plaintiffs do not allege that Plains failed to use available advanced tools or technologies. The falsity allegations are that the tools were ineffectively used, and that was confirmed by the Line 901 spill. The statements are about the tools and programs Plains had in place, not about how well the tools worked or that they were 100 percent effective. The plaintiffs have not alleged facts that would make the statements actionably misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Code-of-Conduct Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint challenges two statements that were not challenged in the earlier complaint. One is about Plains's integrity-management program, the second is about legal compliance. Both are taken from Plains's Code of Business Conduct, which was published on Plains's website and incorporated in its filings.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   \u2022 Statement 2: \"Plains All American supports its commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations through extensive and ongoing education and training, as well as investment in any necessary equipment, systems, processes, or other resources.\" 2d Compl. \u00b6 193.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-278\">\n   \u2022 Statement 14: \"Our commitment [to safe and environmentally responsible operations] also includes compliance with applicable environmental, health\n   and safety rules, laws, and regulations.\" 2d Compl. \u00b6 381.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   The defendants argue that statements in a corporate code of conduct are not actionable under the federal securities laws. (Docket Entry No. 140, at 4-5).

Despite the lack of attribution, the Seventh Circuit would have allowed a claim to go forward because the statement was the type of announcement that management would have had to approve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   The issue is whether the Second Amended Complaint has adequately tied Statements 5 and 17 to a specific corporate officer with scienter, or are so extraordinary and dramatic that approval by a knowledgeable officer would have been required. In addition to the \"general\" scienter allegations discussed more below, the plaintiffs contend that Statements 5 and 17 were \"authorized and endorsed by\" Armstrong, Swanson, and Pefanis because: (1) these officers signed the Form 10-Ks that referred investors to Plains's website for information about its \"policies, financial results, and operations\"; (2) Armstrong, Swanson, and Pefanis referred investors to Plains's website on earnings conference calls; and (3) Swanson was listed as the contact person in a Form 8-K that referred investors to the website \"where PAA routinely posts important information about the Partnership.\" (Docket Entry No. 142 at 48 (citing 2d Compl. \u00b6 203) ).

Nor do the statements create a strong inference of scienter as to Plains.

Op. at 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   Statement 17 is a relatively specific statement about legal compliance and is closer to the type of statement likely to require high-level corporate-officer approval.

The plaintiffs alleged that: (1) nearly a year before the June 2014 statement was made, Plains did not have adequate records on its review of the spill-response plans; (2) Plains did not have adequate leak-monitoring systems, and (3) Plains did not react properly when the spill occurred. Because these allegations that Plains's response to the Santa Barbara spill was not effective did not contradict the June 2014 representation that Plains had response plans for spills in critical areas, the plaintiffs did not adequately allege that the statement was false or misleading when made. Op. at 69. The allegations were compatible with the statement that Plains had specific response plans for critical areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   The falsity allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, (2d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 337-348), are that: (1) Plains's response to the Line 901 spill was ineffective; (2) the spill size would have been \"substantially contained\" if Plains had properly conducted preventive and mitigative evaluations in 2013 and 2014 and complied with PHMSA training requirements; (3) Plains's ineffective response to the spill hindered federal and state authorities in responding to the discharge; and (4) based on Plains's other statements about its ability for \"immediate response and deployment of resources,\" reasonable investors would have believed that Plains's response to a spill in a high-consequence area would be \"immediate and well-coordinated.\" The plaintiffs allege that Plains's response to the Santa Barbara spill violated federal pipeline-safety regulations in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20195.452\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 195.452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 194.3, and 194.117.

The plaintiffs argue that Plains's response on the day of the spill revealed that it had not implemented specific tactical plans and response strategies to be used in critical areas like the Santa Barbara coast. Plains's response systems were found to have violated pipeline safety regulations and left Plains unprepared to effectively respond to a spill. The plaintiffs argue that the statement must be considered in context: \"simply having\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   plan, no matter how defective or violative of applicable law,\" does not make Statement 10 true, because reasonable investors would have expected Plains to have effective plans, especially for such a sensitive area. (Docket Entry No. 142 at 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   The defendants argue that Statement 10 is not false, because Plains did have spill-response plans in place for critical areas, which the plaintiffs do not dispute. According to the defendants, the plaintiffs dispute the\n   <em>\n    effectiveness\n   </em>\n   of the plan and its execution. A claim primarily about the effectiveness of a corporate response, the defendants contend, is a claim of mismanagement\n   that is not actionable under the federal securities laws. The defendants argue that Statement 10 says nothing about Plains's evaluations, training, or compliance with legal requirements; it is instead a statement about the spill-response plans Plains had in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   The plaintiffs are correct that disclosures are measured \"not by literal truth, but by the ability of the statements to accurately inform rather than mislead.\"\n   <em>\n    Lormand v.

When the Deepwater Horizon spill occurred, and even 49 days after the spill, BP was recovering oil \"at a rate of only 15,000 barrels per day.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776071\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/843/712/#p746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   BP executives made post-spill statements that it did not have a proven response plan, that its contingency plans were inadequate, and that it was \"making it up day to day.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776071\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/843/712/#p746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These facts were enough to allege that BP had \"misrepresented the size of the spill it was prepared to respond to in the Gulf and misrepresented the Company's general spill response capabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776071\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/843/712/#p746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The statements expressly referred to the Gulf of Mexico and gave a specific number to measure BP's spill-response capabilities. The specificity of the representations and of the falsity allegations made the statements actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Here, by contrast, Plains represented that it had specific strategies and response plans for critical areas. The statement does not represent that Plains's response plan would meet a certain number. Nor does the statement refer to a particular \"critical area.\" The plaintiffs' falsity allegations are about: (1) Plains's general failure to conduct \"preventative and mitigative evaluations\"; (2) generally inadequate spill-response training; and (3) Plains's inadequate response to the Santa Barbara spill. Although the allegations provide additional details about Plains's training and spill-response implementation, they are consistent with Plains's statement that it had a spill-response plan in place. Unlike the falsity allegations in\n   <em>\n    BP I\n   </em>\n   of admissions from BP executives that the company had no spill-response plans, the allegations here are tied to whether the spill-response plan that was in place was properly implemented.

The Statement About the Spill Size\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Statement 11 is from a June 19, 2015 letter from Armstrong to members of the United States Congress.

Plains answered the letter, explaining what happened on the day of the spill. The defendants correctly describe Statement 11 as a \"historical snapshot\" of reports made on the day of the spill.

We have cathodic protection that also is used to combat external corrosion. Those all go into running a pipeline. And if there is a concern that comes up in that in-line inspection tool, such as metal loss greater than 50% or metal loss associated with a dent that could indicate maybe third-party encroachment, if there is corrosion of or along the longitudinal weld or any other metal loss that indicates that, in our opinion, the evaluator would need to investigate further.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 140, Ex. 5). The Second Amended Complaint alleges that when Hodgins was asked about a spill volume of 105,000 gallons, he omitted information about the actual size spill size. (2d Compl. \u00b6 362).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   The March 2017 Memorandum and Opinion found that Statement 9 was actionably misleading. Op. at 74 (\"The plaintiffs allege facts that specifically conflict with Hodgins's statements about what Plains knew about the corrosion issues on Line 901. The plaintiffs allege that the company was aware of a sharp increase in the number of corrosion problems between the 2007 and 2012 inspection runs...and of a number of areas where corrosion had eaten away more than 50% of the pipe wall.... As a result, Hodgins's two statements that the company was not aware of corrosion issues with the pipeline or of areas where corrosion had destroyed over 50% of the pipe wall are false.\"). The allegations as to Statement 9 are repeated in the Second Amended Complaint; Statement 9 remains actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   The March 2017 Memorandum and Opinion also held that Statement 12 was actionable. The additional context for Statement 12 changes the earlier analysis as to these allegations. Hodgins's actual testimony was not provided in the briefs on the first motions to dismiss. The allegation was simply that Hodgins omitted the true, much larger, spill size when he was asked about a spill volume of 105,000 gallons. In the briefs on the motions to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint, the defendants attached Hodgins's testimony at the legislative session. (Docket Entry No. 140, Ex. 5). Because this transcript is taken from a public proceeding that is publicly available, it is appropriately considered at the motion-to-dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   Statement 12 is Hodgins's response to a compound question: \"How are you combating this? How did you combat this corrosion on this particular pipeline that ended\n   up sending 105,000 gallons out of the pipeline? How did you do that?\" Although the interrogator, Senator Jackson, mentioned a spill size of 105,000 gallons, all three of the questions were about Plains's approach to combating corrosion. Senator Jackson did not ask Hodgins about the spill size. Hodgins answered the question he was asked. He was not asked whether the statement about the spill size was correct or not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129443\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/527/#p533\">\n    537 F.3d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[The plaintiffs'] claim of incomplete disclosure is actionably only if what they said is misleading. '[I]n other words it must affirmatively create an impression of a state of affairs that differs in a material way from the one that actually exists.' \" (citation omitted) ). If Hodgins had said that 105,000 gallons was Plains's spill-volume estimate, or if he had been asked what Plains estimated as the spill volume, and he had omitted correct or any other information about Plains's estimate, the analysis would be different. But the transcript shows that Hodgins was specifically asked and answered a question about Plains's response to corrosion problems, not spill size. Statement 12 is not actionably misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   The March 2017 Memorandum and Opinion held that the plaintiffs had not adequately alleged scienter as to Statements 9 and 12 because the complaint did not allege that Hodgins was aware of the results of the in-line inspection runs or of Plains's spill estimates when he spoke. Op. at 75-76. The Second Amended Complaint does not cure this deficiency. The only references to Hodgins in the Second Amended Complaint describe the statements he made, that he was Plains's director of security and safety, and that he was a member of the Spill Unified Command. (2d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 208, 214, 362, 364, 366). For example, paragraph 376 states that representatives from Plains, \"including Hodgins, were part of the Spill Unified Command, a committee meant to organize the response in the spill's aftermath.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 366). Hodgins's participation in the Spill Unified Command is not sufficient to infer scienter as to Plains as to Hodgins's statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abrams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9416158\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/424/#p430\">\n    292 F.3d at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plaintiffs point to no allegations that the defendants knew about the internal control problems, only that they should have known or that their lack of knowledge based on their corporate positions demonstrates recklessness. A pleading of scienter may not rest on the inference that defendants must have been aware of the misstatement based on their positions within the company.\"). The Second Amended Complaint contains no allegations about what Hodgins knew, or when. The complaint allegations do not support an inference that Hodgins was aware of the results of the in-line inspection runs at the time he made Statements 9 and 12.

The falsity allegations were \"not particularized or individualized.\" Op. at 59.

The plaintiffs must allege a factual basis to infer that the defendants knew of facts conflicting with the statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   The plaintiffs, citing paragraphs 92, 93, 220, 260, and 393 to 402 of the Second Amended Complaint, argue that Plains \"lacked any basis to make Statements 13 and 17.\" (Docket Entry No. 142 at 31). Paragraphs 92 and 93 set out federal statutory requirements for integrity-management programs and pollution control in high-consequence areas. These paragraphs allege that Lines 901 and 903 comprised 9 to 10 percent of Plains's pipelines in high-consequence areas and 15 to 18 percent of its pipelines affecting commercially navigable waters. Paragraph 220 sets out the federal regulations and the recommended industry standards from the National Association of Corrosion Engineers regarding corrosion-control processes and in-line inspection systems. Paragraph 260 alleges that Plains failed to conduct required preventive and mitigative evaluations on Line 901 and failed to maintain records justifying that failure, in violation of federal regulations requiring pipeline operators to implement and follow their integrity-management programs. Paragraphs 393 to 402 allege that Plains \"persistently and pervasively violated the minimum standards laid out in the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Regulations concerning operation and maintenance, emergency response, control room management, corrosion control, reporting, and recordkeeping, and failed to implement and follow the integrity management program pertaining to Lines 901 and 903 as required by the Liquid Integrity Management Rules.\" (2d Compl. \u00b6 395). Those paragraphs also allege that Armstrong, Pefanis, Swanson, and McGee had received several letters the PHMSA sent Plains about regulatory violations in Plains's corrosion-control system, in-line inspection tools, and cathodic-protection measures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 397(i)-(xvii) ), 398(i)-(v), 399(i)-(xii), 400(i)-(iii) ). The plaintiffs allege that these violations were pervasive and persisted throughout Plain's pipeline system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   The Plains defendants attached an appendix listing all of the alleged regulatory violations outside those on Lines 901 and 903, when Plains learned of them, and the fines associated with each. (Docket Entry No. 140, Appendix B). The PHMSA sent ten notices to Plains. Notices 8, 9, and 10 were issued after the class period ended. Notices 4, 6, and 7 were warning letters that resulted in no further action or monetary penalty. Notices 1 and 2 were issued in 2009, four years before the class period began. Notice 4 resulted in no monetary penalty. Notice 5 is the only PHMSA action that resulted in a monetary penalty-a $102,900 fine-within the class period. Many of the notices that involved larger fine amounts were issued in 2016, long after the challenged legal-compliance statements were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   Many of the falsity allegations are related to regulatory violations on Lines 901 and 903, many first identified in the post-spill Failure Investigation Report. Statements 13 and 17 represented the defendants' belief that Plains was in substantial compliance with applicable laws. These statements applied to all of Plains's pipeline operations, of which Lines 901 and 903 were a small part. The regulatory violations on pipelines other than Lines 901 and 903, and warning letters and notices from the PHMSA about Plains's other pipelines, do not make Plains's opinion statements about substantial compliance false or misleading. The fine amounts are relatively\n   low, and Plains learned about many of the violations after the statements were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   Additionally, allegations that Plains was operating in violation of regulations during the class period are different from allegations that the defendants\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that Plains was in violation when the statements were made. The plaintiffs allege that the Officer defendants received the PHMSA notices and letters, but that allegation is based only on those defendants' positions at Plains. Those defendants, and their direct reports, \"were required to provide reports to the audit committee,\" which reported to the board, on which Armstrong served as chairman during the class period. (2d Compl. \u00b6 8). Those defendants also signed Sarbanes-Oxley Act certifications, (\u00b6\u00b6 167, 379), Plains's Code of Business Conduct, (\u00b6 173), and representations in Plains's Forms 10-K and 10-Q that material information was \"recorded, processed, and summarized, and reported...and accumulated and communicated to management,\" (\u00b6 159). Although the plaintiffs allege that the defendants actually received the PHMSA notices and letters, that conclusion requires an added assumption, not alleged, that the reports were actually provided to the defendants before they made the challenged legal-compliance opinion statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   Reasonable investors understand information in required SEC filings in light of their \"surrounding text, including hedges, disclaimers, and apparently conflicting information.\" For that reason, \"an omission that renders misleading a statement of opinion when viewed in a vacuum may not do so once that statement is considered, as is appropriate, in a broader frame.\"\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587416\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1318/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1329-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   Evaluated in context, the statements here were not misleading. A reasonable investor would not understand Plains's high-level, general statements in the filings, that it was operating in substantial compliance with regulatory requirements, as implicitly assuring absolute compliance, even with the regulations that the violation notices addressed. A reasonable investor would understand the use of \"hedges and disclaimers,\" such as the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   compliance,\" and would not reasonably infer that Plains had fully complied with every regulation or requirement. Nor would a reasonable investor infer that Plains's regulators had or would have no objections to the company's compliance on any pipeline. Instead, reasonable investors would understand that, for a very large pipeline company, with a huge network of pipelines, in a heavily regulated industry, notices of regulatory violations are common.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tongue v.

That is especially true in light of the overall context in which these statements appeared. The SEC documents noted the possibility that regulators would penalize Plains for instances of noncompliance, and emphasized that it was not only possible but probable that there would be future oil spills.

Instead, the plaintiffs have alleged only \"a handful of regulatory violations that amounted to $102,900 in fines during the class period.\" Second, if the plaintiffs are able to \"bootstrap\" the spill and its consequences to \"material adverse effect\" allegations, the net cost of the spill after insurance proceeds was $83 million, plus lost profits from Lines 901 and 903, which is \"far short of a 'substantial' threat to the 'company's long-term earnings power.' \" Third, Statements 15 and 16 are promises of indemnification, not expressions of factual certainty, and reasonable investors understand that warranties in an underwriting agreement are not \"expressions of certainty.\" Finally, the statements were intended \"solely for the benefit\" of the underwriters, not for the public, and SEC-mandated disclosures should not make this type of statement actionable. (Docket Entry No. 140 at 15-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   The Underwriter defendants add the argument that the statements are not actionable against them because they were the\n   <em>\n    recipients\n   </em>\n   , not the makers, of the statements. The Underwriter defendants contend that allowing them to be held liable based on statements made by Plains would undermine the underwriting process, in which underwriters negotiate with issuers for more robust representations and warranties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   The plaintiffs respond that these statements are actionable because \"the locale of a false statement does not govern its actionability under the securities laws.\" (Docket Entry No. 142 at 26). The plaintiffs argue that, even though the intended audience was the Underwriter defendants, the underwriting contracts were filed with the SEC and available to prospective investors. If the statements are actionable, the plaintiffs cite the court's earlier conclusion that the Santa Barbara spill and its consequences, both financial and legal, \"are easily within the 'material adverse effect' that the statement[s] address[ ].\" Op. at 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   No case directly addresses whether representations in contracts between an issuer and an underwriter, required to be filed with the SEC, are actionable under the securities laws.

Rather, reasonable investors understand that similar statements are not affirmative disclosures by a company about its financial health. That is supported by the surrounding caution that the descriptions were made \"solely for the benefit\" of the Underwriters and that \"no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry No. 140, Ex. 7). The context of the statements indicates that they were made as contractual representations to a counterparty, not as statements of certainty made to the investing public. Because Statements 15 and 16 were made in the context of representations and warranties in underwriting agreements, they are not actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   <strong>\n    7.

We had no indication at all to assume there was an issue,\" and, when asked about the 2007 and 2012 in-line inspection results, Hodgins stated: \"We had not had any indication at that time...

(2d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 208, 214, 362, 364, 366). There are no specific allegations as to what he knew, when, or how.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   Statement 5, posted on Plains's website, represents that Plains \"perform[s] scheduled maintenance on all of our pipeline systems and make[s] repairs and replacements when necessary and appropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 202). The March 2017 Memorandum and Opinion held that this statement was not sufficiently linked to a corporate officer acting on Plains's behalf. Op. at 76-77.

The individualized and specific allegations must generate a cogent and compelling inference that the particular defendant intended to deceive or was severely reckless as to whether the statement was true. An inference of scienter is cogent and compelling only if it is at least as persuasive as any other inference about the defendant's state of mind that could be drawn from the alleged facts. It is not enough to plead facts that permit an inference of scienter.

For each statement that the plaintiffs identify as false or misleading, they must identify specific facts supporting an inference of scienter. The plaintiffs seek to avoid the prohibition on group pleading by alleging that the individual Officer defendants received specific internal reports based on their positions as \"senior executive officers,\" who were provided with \"all material information.\" Those defendants allegedly reviewed in-line-inspection and integrity-management reports and certified their accuracy. Although the plaintiffs have alleged specific reports and notices of regulatory violations, the allegations that the individual defendants received and reviewed these reports and notices are group allegations based on the defendants' positions as senior executive officers.

The Second Amended Complaint does not allege that Nerbonne provided pipeline-testing information to Pefanis or to other corporate officers. Instead, the complaint alleges generally that Nerbonne was \"a senior executive with direct and steady contact with senior management,\" and that Armstrong mentioned Nerbonne's efforts to develop new testing procedures at various presentations.

The Second Amended Complaint focuses on the statements' applicability to high-consequence areas.
