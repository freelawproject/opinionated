The task was not easy to achieve, and efforts have continued to identify and eliminate sources of unwarranted disparities in federal sentencing. I write here to join several colleagues in expressing my belief that the methamphetamine Guidelines contain one such unwarranted disparity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Due to increases in the average purity of methamphetamine sold today, purity is no longer an accurate indicator of a defendant's culpability or role in a drug enterprise, and the presumptive purity assigned to untested drugs does not reflect market realities. Moreover, whether a substance was lab tested for purity can have an arbitrary and unwarranted effect on the sentence imposed. The result is a scheme that undermines the sentencing goals laid out in 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The purpose of this memorandum is to provide a reasoned explanation for my policy disagreement with the Guidelines and to lay out my methodology for sentencing in methamphetamine cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Methamphetamine, unlike most controlled substances, is to be quantified based on purity, using either the weight of a mixture containing the drug or the weight of the pure drug itself contained within the mixture, whichever yields the greater offense level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, Notes to Drug Quantity Table (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In determining the Base Offense Level, there is a 10:1 ratio between pure or \"actual\" methamphetamine and an equivalent weight of methamphetamine mixture. For example, 15 grams of pure methamphetamine is treated the same as 150 grams of methamphetamine mixture. The 10:1 ratio was first introduced in the 1989 Sentencing Guidelines. I have tried to determine whether there is any empirical data from the Sentencing Commission or in the academic literature which would justify the ratio. I have found none. Rather, these distinctions seem to be tiered to a similar 10:1 ratio used in the mandatory minimum sentences imposed by Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(viii) &amp; \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(viii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That determination was, by its very nature, a product of political\n   calculation and compromise rather than empirical analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The practical effect of the ratio is to impose a presumed purity of 10% for untested methamphetamine mixtures. The ratio may therefore have been based on the assumption that most methamphetamine was produced in a home lab where purity levels of approximately 10% were typical, or where purer methamphetamine was \"stepped on\" by diluting it with other inert substances to increase profitability. From my experience, purity levels of seized drugs in the 10% range were common until approximately 20 years ago. Realities on the ground have since changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Today, methamphetamine is almost always imported from foreign drug labs and the purity levels are much higher. A recent 2015-16 survey of drug purity levels in the District of Idaho revealed an average purity level of 92.6% with a low of 88% and a high of 100%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A 1999 report of the U.S. Sentencing Commission indicates that average nationwide purity rates had already jumped to 50% at the turn of the century.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United States Sentencing Commission,\n   <em>\n    Methamphetamine: Final Report\n   </em>\n   , at 7 (Nov. 1999), http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research/working-group-reports/drugs/199911_Meth_Report.pdf;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ortega\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:09CR400,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201994870\">\n    2010 WL 1994870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D. Neb. May 17, 2010) (\"The government acknowledged at the sentencing hearing that the purity of most methamphetamine on the street now is 40%-50%[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Simply put, the presumed purity of 10% for untested methamphetamine is no longer valid. This, in turn, has led to substantial and unwarranted disparities in sentencing based solely on whether methamphetamine is lab tested. In many cases, the Guidelines range where testing has been performed is double that where a drug's purity is unknown. Take, for example, a case involving a methamphetamine mixture of 150 grams and 90% purity. Had purity testing been performed, the base offense level would be 30, while the base offense level for untested methamphetamine would be 24. Assuming no adjustments and a Criminal History Category of I, the Guidelines range without purity testing is 51-63 months. With purity testing, the Guidelines range balloons to 97-121 months-an increase in the Guidelines range of over 90% attributable to the fact of testing alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The reasons why testing is or is not performed in any case are completely arbitrary. In many cases, only some of the drugs were seized and available for testing. In others, the testing lab was too busy to complete testing before sentencing. In some, the wise defendant pled guilty early in the case so that sentencing would occur before testing could be completed. In many cases, the prosecution originated with a state agency where testing could not be completed in a timely manner. Regardless, none of these reasons relate to the defendant's culpability or the danger which he or she poses to society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Increases in methamphetamine purity also undermine its function as a proxy for\n   culpability, especially for low-level offenders. The Sentencing Commission considers drug purity relevant in part because \"possession of unusually pure narcotics may indicate a prominent role in the criminal enterprise and proximity to the source of the drugs.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Today, most methamphetamine seized at all distribution levels is remarkably pure, which means that higher purity is not a good indicator of a defendant's place in the chain of distribution. The importance assigned to purity is even less justified for a low-level offender who has no knowledge or control of the purity level.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4234989\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/948/1009/\">\n    948 F.Supp.2d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (observing that problems with outdated purity assumptions are \"heightened when the offender was merely a courier or mule who has no knowledge of the purity of the methamphetamine he or she is transporting\");\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ortega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201994870\">\n    2010 WL 1994870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Neb. May 17, 2010) (recognizing that purity-based penalties \"illogically skew[ ] sentences for 'average' defendants to the upper end of the sentencing spectrum, blurring the distinctions between high and low level distributors in a hierarchy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For these reasons, I am left with a very imperfect scenario and a situation which the Guidelines was intended to avoid-arbitrary and irrational distinctions between sentences imposed upon similarly situated defendants. On the one hand, it is clear that the 10:1 ratio is not empirically justified, and the arbitrariness of lab testing only compounds the issue. Purity is also a less meaningful proxy for culpability where nearly all methamphetamine sold is of 90 percent purity or greater. On the other hand, logic would suggest that individuals who deal in purer forms of any drug are sometimes more culpable and pose a greater danger to society. Thus, I am not willing to completely disregard the drug purity testing, when it has been performed. I would further note that if I ignore the enhancement completely, this may well cause the U.S. Attorney to file cases in such a way as to increase the likelihood that mandatory minimums will apply. That, in turn, may prove detrimental to other criminal defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this decidedly imperfect world, I am going to exercise my discretion to consider the drug quantity and purity issue as only loosely advisory. My approach to determining the appropriate sentence will be as follows. I will begin, as always, by determining the advisory Guidelines range and determining if the Guidelines permit a traditional departure. Then, I will consider the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a) to determine whether the circumstances justify a variance from the Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Among the \u00a7 3553(a) factors most relevant here are \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct\" and \"the need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (6). For the reasons stated above, I believe that the methamphetamine Guidelines produce advisory sentences that fail to achieve these \u00a7 3553(a) objectives. I will therefore routinely consider granting a variance in cases where drug purity testing has been completed, so as to ameliorate the unwarranted disparity between cases involving tested and untested substances, and to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offense. The process will involve calculating both guideline ranges and\n   then determining, based upon all of the circumstances, what constitutes a reasonable sentence under the facts of the case. Typically, this will result in a sentence much closer to the guideline range applicable if no testing had been completed. But, not always. There may be reasons why an individual defendant deserves a higher sentence, unrelated to drug purity. But that determination will be made, in every case, based upon an individualized assessment of all the facts presented, without undue regard for the increased guideline range generated when drug purity is considered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Judge Bataillon of the District of Nebraska has written thoughtfully and extensively of the flaws in the methamphetamine Guidelines.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.
