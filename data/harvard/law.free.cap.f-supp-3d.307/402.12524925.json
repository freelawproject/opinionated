Presently pending before this court is the motion for summary judgment filed by defendant Mildon Bus Lines, Inc. (\"defendant\" or \"Mildon\"). (ECF No. 93.) For the reasons fully explained in this opinion, Mildon's motion for summary judgment will be granted because Community Vocational Schools lacks standing and because there is insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Mildon violated the TCPA with respect to Community Vocational Schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Community Vocational Schools initiated this action on November 30, 2009, against Mildon advancing a claim under the TCPA for sending an unlawful facsimile advertisement. (ECF No. 1.) Mildon filed a motion to dismiss on February 3, 2010, (ECF No. 4), and in response, Community Vocational Schools filed its first amended class action complaint on February 11, 2010. (ECF No. 7.) Specifically, Community Vocational Schools alleges that Mildon on or about January 11, 2006, sent one unsolicited advertisement to it by telephone facsimile machine in violation of the TCPA. (ECF No. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12.) On February 16, 2010, Erie Insurance Exchange (\"Erie\") filed a claim against defendant, in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County at\n   <em>\n    Erie Ins. Exch. v. Mildon Bus Lines, Inc. &amp; Community Vocational Sch. of Pittsburgh\n   </em>\n   , Alleg. Cty. Ct. of Common Pleas, Civil Action No. GD-10-003030 (\"coverage action\"), concerning insurance coverage with respect to this action. Mildon filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint filed in this action on February 18, 2010. The motion to dismiss was denied without prejudice on August 6, 2010, just prior to Mildon filing for bankruptcy. (Status Conference 8/26/10; ECF Nos. 13, 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 27, 2010, Mildon filed for bankruptcy in\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mildon Bus Lines, Ins.\n   </em>\n   , Bankruptcy Action No. 10-25312, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the\n   Western District of Pennsylvania. A suggestion of bankruptcy was filed in the instant action on September 22, 2010. (ECF No. 26.) That same day, this court issued a stay pending resolution of Mildon's bankruptcy proceedings. (ECF Nos. 26, 27.) The bankruptcy court, in light of Mildon's possible insurance coverage, lifted the automatic stay to permit the coverage action to proceed to the extent of the coverage. (Bankruptcy Action No. 10-25312, ECF No. 79.) The bankruptcy case was terminated on October 23, 2012, with the defendant receiving a discharge. (ECF Bankruptcy No. 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the termination of the bankruptcy action, this court continued the stay of this matter pending the resolution of the summary judgment motions filed by Erie and Community Vocational Schools in the coverage action. (ECF No. 64 at 2.) On November 22, 2016, after being advised that summary judgment was denied in the coverage action, this court held a status conference, at which point, this court lifted the stay and reopened the case and ordered fact discovery to be completed on or before February 15, 2017. (ECF No. 49.) Due to the bankruptcy and ensuing coverage litigation, this case had been stayed for approximately six years and four months and this matter has been active in this court for only one and a half years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the stay was lifted, Mildon filed its answer and affirmative defenses on December 15, 2016. (ECF No. 50.) On December 20, 2016, with leave, Mildon filed a third-party complaint joining Caroline Abraham and Joel Abraham as third-party defendants. (ECF Nos. 52, 53.) On January 30, 2017, this court granted Community Vocational Schools' unopposed motion to extend fact discovery and ordered that discovery be completed on or before May 15, 2017. (ECF No. 62.) Erie filed a motion for leave to intervene pursuant to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 24 on February 1, 2017, (ECF No. 64), which was denied on March 27, 2017, with prejudice. (ECF No. 80.) On April 18, 2017, default was entered against the third-party defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 89-90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the close of discovery, on July 7, 2017, Mildon filed its motion for summary judgment, (ECF No. 93), brief in support thereof, (ECF No. 94), and concise statement of material facts. (ECF No. 95.) On August 7, 2017, Community Vocational Schools filed its response in opposition to Mildon's motion for summary judgment, (ECF No. 105), and to Mildon's concise statement of material facts. (ECF No. 106.) Mildon filed a reply brief on August 28, 2017, (ECF No. 107), along with a reply to Community Vocational Schools' concise statement of material facts. (ECF No. 108.) The parties filed their combined statement of material facts (\"CCSMF\") on September 7, 2017, as required by this court's Chamber Rule 3.F.c.ii. (ECF No. 110.) A hearing on the motion for summary judgment was held on September 19, 2017, and the parties were ordered to file supplemental briefs. (Minute Entry &amp; Order 9/20/2017.) Community Vocational Schools filed its supplemental brief on September 26, 2017. (ECF No. 112.) Mildon filed its response in opposition on October 3, 2017. (ECF No. 113.) This matter is now ripe for disposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January 2006, Caroline and Joel Abraham d/b/a as Business to Business Solutions (\"B2B\") contacted Mildon about hiring B2B to write, design, and transmit a facsimile advertisement on Mildon's behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CCSMF \u00b6 1.) On January 10, 2006, Mildon sent a check in the amount of $268.00 to B2B as consideration for 5,000 faxed advertisements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Mildon, however, never received any documentation from B2B that the fax campaign had occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As part of a separate litigation action in the United States District Court for the District of New York (\"New York action\"), to which Community Vocational Schools was not a party, present counsel for Community Vocational Schools obtained in discovery a DVD and a hard drive belonging to B2B. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7; ECF No. 98-3.) On the hard drive, Community Vocational Schools located what it believes to be a copy of a facsimile advertisement sent to it and which it attached as Exhibit A to its first amended complaint. (CCSMF \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-7.) Its counsel provided the DVD and the hard drive to Robert Biggerstaff (\"Biggerstaff\") for purposes of this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CCSMF \u00b6 8.) Community Vocational Schools filed this action though the counsel that obtained the DVD and hard drive in the New York action and is using the same expert, Biggerstaff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As part of this case, Biggerstaff was asked to review and analyze the DVD and hard drive with respect to records and any recorded fax transmissions related to Mildon. (\n   <em>\n    CCSMF\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 15.) In response, Biggerstaff located two archived directories on the DVD dated January 11, 2006, that contained an image file and xferfaxlogs from HylaFAX software. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Biggerstaff found no additional logs related to Mildon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Biggerstaff testified that the xferfaxlogs were created by the HylaFAX software used by B2B for facsimile advertising campaigns and reflect how many pages had been confirmed as faxed/sent/received by the positive confirmation process in the T.30 fax transmission standard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Biggerstaff describes the five-phase confirmation process as follows: (1) Call establishment; (2) Pre-message procedure; (3) In-message procedure and message transmission, (4) Post-message procedure, and (5) Call release. (ECF No. 98-4). He explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Because a record of a successful transmission by a computer based facsimile transmission system capable of sending standard T.30 fax transmissions, reflects the successful completion of all 5 phases of the T.30 fax transmission to a device with a fax-modem, and every device with a fax-modem capable of receiving a T.30\n   fax transmission has the capacity to print the contents of that transmission, a record of a successful transmission by computer based facsimile transmission is a record that such a transmission was sent to and received by \"equipment which has the capacity to transcribe text or images (or both) from an electronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto paper.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Biggerstaff admitted, however, that the logs by their nature do not show what was sent and, therefore, the logs do not show whether or not the alleged fax attached as Exhibit A to the Amended Complaint was sent or whether there was an image rendering issue. (ECF No. 96-3, 189.) The only way to determine what actually was sent, if anything, would be to review the Doc Q file, which was not found on Biggerstaff's review of the DVD and hard drive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 190.) According to Biggerstaff, Doc Q files are routinely erased because they take up an enormous amount of space on a computer's hard drive. (ECF No. 96-3, 190-91.) Plaintiff does not, however, provide any forensic evidence through Biggerstaff or otherwise that a Doc Q file has been erased or even existed on the DVD or hard drive with respect to Mildon. The fax logs indicate that Community Vocational Schools' phone line was occupied for one minute and sixteen seconds on January 11, 2006, by a facsimile transmission from B2B on behalf of Mildon. (ECF No. 98-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Notably, Community Vocational Schools does not have a copy of a facsimile log/report or transmission history from Community Vocational Schools' facsimile machine that identifies the date and time at which it allegedly received the facsimile transmission/advertisement from Mildon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Community Vocational Schools does not have the physical copy of the facsimile that it purportedly received, even though it was collecting faxes for the purpose of bringing an action, and did not keep its facsimile machine either. (CCSMF \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Richard Gans (\"Gans\"), Vice President of Community Vocational Schools and Community Vocational Schools' representative in this matter, testified at his deposition that Community Vocational Schools had a policy of collecting the junk faxes it received and forwarding them to its attorney. (ECF No. 97-1, at 19.) From 2005-2006, Community Vocational Schools collected all the junk faxes that it received each day and sent them along to the corporate office once a week, and the corporate office would forward them along to its attorney for the purpose of filing a lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.) Specifically, Gans testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q: Is that how you came to be aware of Mildon Bus Lines, from Attorney Max Margulis?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A: Well, I sent faxes to him that were received in all of our schools, approximately, at one point, 250 a week, and among the faxes that I provided him may have been a Mildon fax.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q: And you provided these faxes to Mr. Margulis when?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A: Weekly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q: In what year?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A: From 2001 to present. ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q: What direction, for instance, would you have given to John Casablancas Modeling &amp; Career Centers in Pittsburgh,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   regarding what they should do with faxes that came across their machine?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A: They should put them in a pile and send them to the corporate office once a week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q: Was John Casablancas Modeling &amp; Career Centers, in 2005, 2006, complying with your direction?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: Yes....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q: And you would take those faxes and turn them all over to Attorney Margulis?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.) Gans testified that he could not recall the fax claimed to be sent here or identify any employee or representative of Community Vocational Schools who would have knowledge about the actual receipt of the alleged fax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 94, Ex. E.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Biggerstaff was able to identify Exhibit A attached to Community Vocational Schools' first amended complaint as a portable document format (\"PDF\") image found on the B2B hard drive. (CCSMF \u00b6 9.) Biggerstaff testified that as part of the process of faxing an advertising campaign, any actually faxed document would have been converted to a bitmap file prior to sending. (ECF No. 96-3, 86.) Biggerstaff admitted that he has never seen a printout of any advertisement actually faxed as part of the Mildon campaign, and that an actual bitmap of the PDF file that would have been created by the conversion of a bitmap file for transmission was not found on the hard drive. (CCSMF \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Biggerstaff testified that the hard drive provided to him by Community Vocational Schools' counsel does not contain any files showing an image that was rendered by the faxing software, HylaFAX, for Mildon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Biggerstaff explained that files that would show an actually faxed document were typically erased and deleted as part of the ordinary conduct of business in the industry and by inference by B2B. (ECF No. 96-3, 189-90.) Caroline Abraham testified that the images found on the hard drive were not an actual image of any completed received fax because the receiving fax machines would have included date and time stamps as part of the fax number. (CCSMF \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Biggerstaff indicated that he \"believes\" that the fax advertisement was successfully transmitted based on the source code and logs contained on the hard drive that confirm through a positive-confirmation process that a one-page fax went through with no error detected or recorded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Biggerstaff testified that in order to limit the possibility that a wrong file would be sent to the wrong list, the files were named by B2B using the client or customer name. (ECF No. 96-3 at 144.) Mildon's campaign files and folders found on the disk were named \"Esther\" or \"Mildon Bus Lines.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144-45.) Biggerstaff infers that a TCPA violative fax was sent because the fax logs reflect an error-free fax transmission occurred and he found a pdf of an advertisement on the DVD. (ECF No. 96-3 at 64-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Caroline Abraham, who along with Joel Abraham did business as B2B, provided testimony at a deposition in a separate matter that the Mildon advertising campaign had rendering problems, (CCSMF \u00b6 22), meaning the faxes were going out blank \"or something\", and she did not know what was wrong, but during this time they were showing up like they had been delivered, (ECF No. 96-11, 153.). She testified that they had resent everything after the rendering problem was discovered, (ECF No. 96-11, 153.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Biggerstaff\n   testified that he could not find any reason why Caroline Abraham said there had been a rendering problem during the Mildon campaign, (ECF No. 96-3 at 179), but also admitted that he could not eliminate the possibility of rendering problems having occurred outside of the one he had identified with respect to the Veranda font. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 199.) Biggerstaff testified that the Veranda font was not used in the fax purported to be sent in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96-3 at 174.) After discovering the rendering problem with the Mildon fax campaign, B2B began regularly using verification faxes beginning January 12, 2006, the day after the purported fax was sent to Community Vocational Schools. (CCSMF \u00b6 32; ECF No. 96-3 at 171-72.) During the week of January 11, 2006, after the purported advertisement was already sent, B2B instead of using a PDF began using a tagged image file format (which itself was a bitmapped image). (CCSMF \u00b6 33; ECF No. 96-3 at 184, 191.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Mildon specifically asserts that 1) Community Vocational Schools lacks standing because Community Vocational Schools cannot prove that it sustained a concrete injury that falls within the zone of interest sought to be protected by the TCPA; and 2) it is entitled to summary judgment because there is insufficient evidence that Mildon sent a fax advertisement to Community Vocational Schools in violation of the TCPA. Mildon points out that Community Vocational Schools has no record of receiving the fax, businesses have no privacy interest in being left alone, and there is no concrete proof that the alleged fax interrupted Community Vocational Schools' business. Mildon argues that the lack of evidence to show a fax was received demonstrates Community Vocational Schools lacks standing, i.e., Community Vocational Schools failed to adduce sufficient evidence to find that it suffered an injury in fact. Mildon asserts that Community Vocational Schools did not suffer an injury in fact because: 1) Community Vocational Schools' representative, Gans, has no recollection of receiving the fax; and 2) Community Vocational Schools' expert, Biggerstaff, cannot demonstrate that an unsolicited advertisement was indeed transmitted to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Community Vocational Schools, citing\n   <em>\n    Palm Beach Golf Center-Boca, Inc. v.

Community Vocational Schools argues that since\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   , numerous courts have addressed standing under the TCPA and have been nearly uniform in finding that\n   <em>\n    a transmission that is a violation of the TCPA\n   </em>\n   confers standing because it illegally occupies the plaintiff's phone line. Community Vocational Schools argues that it has standing under\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   because the TCPA elevated the \"nuisance\" of having one's phone line occupied by\n   <em>\n    an unsolicited fax advertisement\n   </em>\n   to a \"legally cognizable injury\" and its fax line was occupied for one minute and sixteen seconds. Mildon responds that Community Vocational Schools failed to adduce sufficient evidence to show that the occupation of its fax machine was based on an \"unsolicited advertisement\" as defined under the TCPA, or that the fax provided as Exhibit A to the amended complaint was sent on behalf of Mildon. Mildon argues that Community Vocational Schools has no evidence that a fax was received or that Community Vocational Schools' fax machine was tied up by a fax advertisement within the meaning of the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Standards for Standing and Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Standard for Standing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"Article III of the Constitution limits the federal judiciary's authority to exercise its 'judicial Power' to 'Cases' and 'Controversies.' \"\n   <em>\n    Plains All Am.

Community Vocational Schools had a specific procedure set up to collect junk faxes that might give rise to a TCPA junk fax claim. Community Vocational Schools' representative could not recall receiving a Mildon advertisement fax and was not aware of anyone who would be able to recall receiving that kind of fax. Indeed, there is no evidence that Community Vocational Schools perceived that any injury may have occurred until after someone contacted it for purposes of this lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, there is no verification fax; there is no bitmap file, there is no fax with a fax header indicating whether the fax was sent or received; Community Vocational Schools does not have a copy of the facsimile log/report or transmission history from its fax machine, and it no longer has its fax machine. There is no Q file to explain exactly what was sent to Community Vocational Schools. To compound the issue, Caroline Abraham, who was responsible for sending the fax as part of a fax advertisement campaign, testified that a rendering problem occurred during the Mildon campaign.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Palm Beach Golf Center-Boca v. John G. Sarris, D.D.S.\n   </em>\n   due, among other things, to the rendering problem that occurred during the purported Mildon campaign. Caroline Abraham testified that there was a rendering problem during the Mildon campaign. Biggerstaff was not able to explain why that problem occurred, but asserts that Caroline Abraham's recollection must have been mistaken because the only rendering problem that he was able to identify was one relating to the Veranda font, which was not used in the Mildon advertisement. He admitted, however, that he cannot\n   eliminate the possibility that another rendering problem may have occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The only evidence Biggerstaff suggests that indicates that Mildon's advertisement was sent to Community Vocational Schools are the HylaFAX records demonstrating that B2B sent something to Community Vocational Schools. Intent to send a facsimile advertisement is not the same thing as actual sending an unsolicited advertisement a/k/a a violative fax. Biggerstaff identified a PDF file on the B2B hard drive that was created\n   <em>\n    for the purpose\n   </em>\n   of being converted into a file format that\n   <em>\n    would be sent\n   </em>\n   as part of the Mildon campaign, but there is no further evidence to show that the campaign successfully sent the faxed advertisement to Community Vocational Schools. Biggerstaff speculates that the Mildon campaign did occur because in other B2B cases he found \"additional records\" that demonstrated that the advertisement in those cases had actually been sent. (ECF No. 96-3, at p. 42-43.) For example, in other cases, Biggerstaff explains that the receiving party had the original fax, there was a verification fax, there were telephone-company records, or other things extrinsic to the records to show that an advertisement was sent. (ECF No. 96-3, at p. 42-43.) In this case, no extrinsic evidence was submitted; yet, Biggerstaff is still willing to conclude that Mildon's advertisement was sent. Mere speculation is not evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9324786\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/396/#p404\">\n    320 F.3d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (3d Cir. 2003) ; FED. R. EVID. 702. Said another way, there is insufficient evidence to determine that what was actually sent was a fax that violated the TCPA or that an unsolicited fax was received. Even considering the facts in the light most favorable to Community Vocational Schools, Community Vocational Schools failed to proffer sufficient evidence demonstrating that a Community Vocational Schools' telephone line was in fact occupied by an advertisement in violation of the TCPA. Accordingly, this court is constrained to conclude that Community Vocational Schools did not sustain a concrete injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Similarly, the issue whether the injury is particularized is somewhat intertwined with the cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barett Computer Servs., Inc. v. PDA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340853\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/214/#p219\">\n    884 F.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 (5th Cir. 1989). Community Vocational Schools' injury can be said to be particularized if Community Vocational Schools was affected in a personal and individual way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cottrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263736\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/154/#p162\">\n    874 F.3d at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the parties did not brief this issue, the court concludes that because Community Vocational Schools cannot show that it was sent or received a TCPA violative fax, Community Vocational Schools also cannot show that it sustained a particularized injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Insufficient Evidence to Establish a Junk Fax Act Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Even assuming for the sake of argument that Community Vocational Schools has standing, to survive a motion for summary judgment the plaintiff must point to specific evidence in the record sufficient to establish: \"(1) the defendant utilized a 'telephone facsimile machine' to send 'one or more faxes;' (2) that the transmission constituted 'advertisements'; and (3) that the defendant sent the transmissions without the recipient's consent, absent application of one of the statutory exceptions.\"\n   <em>\n    City Select Auto Sales, Inc. v. David/Randall Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338475\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/96/403/#p416\">\n    96 F.Supp.3d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416 (D. N.J. 2015). Here, Community Vocational Schools cannot establish that it was an unsolicited advertisement sent by B2B on behalf of Mildon that \"tied up\" Community Vocational Schools' telephone line. As previously stated with respect to standing, there is insufficient evidence to establish that what was sent was an unsolicited advertisement in violation of the TCPA. There is likewise insufficient evidence\n   for a reasonable jury to determine what was sent; especially considering Mildon's unresolved rendering problems, the volume of business B2B engaged in and Community Vocational Schools' policy of collecting TCPA violative faxes but not being able to produce a fax sent by B2B on behalf of Mildon. Under those circumstances, a reasonable jury could not render a verdict in favor of Community Vocational Schools. To find in plaintiff's favor, a jury would have to speculate that an unsolicited advertisement was sent or received by Community Vocational Schools. Speculation cannot create a material factual dispute.\n   <em>\n    Robertson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534635\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/914/360/\">\n    914 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   382 n.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   By way of example, one way to show that a violative fax was sent to Community Vocational Schools on behalf of Mildon would be to produce a document with a fax header either in the sender's documents or in the hands of the recipient. There is no such evidence here. Another way would be through testimony from the recipient that it received such a fax, but perhaps did not retain the fax. Here, Community Vocational Schools' representative testified that he did not know if the fax was received despite Community Vocational Schools having specific procedures to retain such faxes. Alternatively, the existence of a bitmap file or a Doc Q file might suffice. The court does not suggest that this is an exhaustive list of what would be required for plaintiff to make out its case, but provides it by way of example to show the kind of evidence that would be sufficient. The court must conclude that there is insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that B2B's facsimile machine was used on behalf of Mildon to send one or more faxes of an unsolicited advertisement to Community Vocational Schools' telephone fax machine or to find that a transmission constituting an unsolicited advertisement was received by Community Vocational Schools in violation of the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Even considering the facts in the light most favorable to Community Vocational Schools, Community Vocational Schools does not have standing and, even if it did, a reasonable jury could not render a verdict in favor of Community Vocational Schools.
