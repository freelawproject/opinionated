On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge erred in denying his motions to dismiss based on a seventeen-year preindictment delay. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We summarize the undisputed facts that are material to this appeal. In March, 1986, a woman reported to the Fitchburg police that the defendant, who had been living with her, had sexually assaulted her two daughters between 1983 and 1985, when both were under the age of fourteen. After obtaining statements from the children, the police interviewed the defendant on March 27, 1986. Upon being confronted with the allegations, the defendant denied them and stated that he had moved out of the woman's house around Christmas, 1985, after she had accused him of molesting her daughters. The police told the defendant that he would be contacted again after they reinterviewed the children. Later that same day, the police called the defendant and asked him to return to the station. When he failed to do so, the police applied for a warrant for his arrest, which was issued along with a criminal complaint on March 28, 1986.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Ten years later, on November 5, 1996, the defendant was arrested in Connecticut on the Fitchburg warrant. At that point, however, the victims could not be located; the defendant was released from custody. In September, 2001, the victims were located. The defendant was then again arrested in Connecticut on the warrant on January 29, 2003. Indictments were returned against the defendant on July 18, 2003. On October 8, 2003, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictments based on violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, which was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The defendant contends that the judge erred in concluding that his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and art. 11 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights was not violated. \"In reviewing a motion to dismiss because of a speedy trial violation, we give deference to the findings of the motion judge, but we may reach our own conclusions\" regarding the factors weighed.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361993\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/56/#p60\">\n    472 Mass. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60 (2015).

Additionally, the defendant was arrested as a fugitive from justice in 1996, at which time he was told that the arrest was based upon charges pending against him in Massachusetts.
