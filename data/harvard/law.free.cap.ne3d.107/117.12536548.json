The Joneses assign the following three errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   I. The trial court erred to the prejudice of [the Joneses] by granting [Deutsche Bank's] motion for summary judgment even though [Deutsche Bank] failed to prove that it satisfied all conditions precedent mandated by the National Housing Act of 1934 (912 U.S.C.1701 et seq.) and 42 U.S.C.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   II. Reviewing [Deutsche Bank's] motion for summary judgment de novo, the record is clear and convincing that the trial court erred to the prejudice of [the Joneses] by granting [Deutsche Bank's] motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   III. The trial court erred to the prejudice of [the Joneses] by granting [Deutsche Bank's] motion for summary judgment based upon the existence of genuine issues of material fact regarding [Deutsche Bank's] failure to provide sufficient evidence of entitlement to foreclosure and/or damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Having reviewed the record and relevant law, we affirm the trial court's decision. The apposite facts follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 23, 2006, the Joneses purchased a multifamily property located on Glenmont Road in Cleveland. Jones signed a note payable to First Magnus Financial Corporation (\"First Magnus\") for $150,000. The record indicates that an allonge payable to the order of Deutsche Bank as Trustee (\"Deutsche Bank Trustee\") for Residential Accredit Loans, Inc. (\"RALI\") was attached to the note. The Joneses also executed a mortgage in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\") acting solely as nominee for First Magnus. On August 29, 2012, the mortgage was assigned from First Magnus to Deutsche Bank Trust Co. (\"Deutsche Bank Trust\") as trustee for Residential Accredit Loans, Inc. (\"RALI\"), and duly recorded. Later, in April 2016, the mortgage was assigned from Deutsche Bank Trust to Deutsche Bank, and duly recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On July 11, 2016, Deutsche Bank filed a complaint for foreclosure and other equitable relief, alleging that due to nonpayment, the loan balance of $142,475 had accelerated. Deutsche Bank also alleged that all conditions precedent to seeking foreclosure were satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On January 30, 2017, Deutsche Bank filed a motion for summary judgment, supported by the copies of the mortgage, note endorsements and assignments, and an affidavit from Deutsche Bank Trust's loan service officer, Jesse Rosenthal (\"Rosenthal\"). Rosenthal averred that the last payment on the loan was received in 2012, and the balance of $142,475 was now due. In opposition, the Joneses argued that Deutsche Bank failed to comply with conditions precedent to seeking foreclosure under regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). The Joneses also alleged that Deutsche Bank lacked standing to enforce the note and mortgage, and that there was insufficient evidence demonstrating nonpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On March 23, 2017, the magistrate issued a decision granting Deutsche Bank summary judgment. No objections were filed, and on April 14, 2017, the trial court adopted the magistrate's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conditions Precedent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In the first assigned error, the Joneses argue that Deutsche Bank did not satisfy conditions precedent to filing its foreclosure action because it failed to conduct a face-to-face meeting with them as required under HUD regulations, set forth in 24 C.F.R. 203.604(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Loans governed by or incorporating HUD regulations must comply with 24 C.F.R. 203.604(b).\n   <em>\n    Fed.

In relevant part, these regulations state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The mortgagee must have a face-to-face interview with the mortgagor, or make a reasonable effort to arrange such a meeting, before three full monthly installments due on the mortgage are unpaid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   If default occurs in a repayment plan arranged other than during a personal interview, the mortgagee must have a face-to-face meeting with the mortgagor, or make a reasonable attempt to arrange such a meeting within 30 days after such default and at least 30 days before foreclosure is commenced[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The Joneses argue that because their mortgage document states, \"Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT WITH MERS,\" the HUD regulations were incorporated into the terms of the mortgage. However, the documents do not specifically incorporate the HUD regulations or otherwise reference any regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Moreover, the mortgage also contains designated \"NON-UNIFORM COVENANTS\" that advise the Borrower that in the event of a default, he shall have 30 days to cure the default, and the failure to cure within that time period may result in acceleration of all sums due and foreclosure. These non-uniform covenants do not require a face-to-face meeting or otherwise incorporate the requirements of the HUD regulations. Therefore, the record does not demonstrate that the loan was governed by HUD. As this court explained in\n   <em>\n    Herren\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Herrens' loan was not a loan governed by federal regulations promulgated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for Federal Housing Authority insured loans that the Herrens cite to in support. Further, an in-person interview is not required under the terms of the note. Therefore, any impact of the loan servicer or Fannie Mae's failure to live up to its own internal rules does not impact its right to foreclose. The relationship of the parties is governed by the note in this case, which does not require satisfaction of any of the provisions on which the Herrens rely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In short, the Joneses have not demonstrated that the HUD regulations have been incorporated into their note or mortgage.\n   <em>\n    BAC Home Loans Serv., LP v.

The Joneses complained that the officer was without personal knowledge and relied upon hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellate review of granting summary judgment is de novo. Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), the party seeking summary judgment must prove that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} To support summary judgment motions, \"sworn or certified\" documents may be submitted, accompanied by an affidavit, which \"shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit.\" Civ.R. 56(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Once the movant satisfies this burden, the opposing party \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the party's pleadings, but the party's response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts\n   showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20N.E.2d%201028\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment in a foreclosure action, the plaintiff must prove:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) that the plaintiff is the holder of the note and mortgage, or is a party entitled to enforce the instrument; (2) if the plaintiff is not the original mortgagee, the chain of assignments and transfers; (3) that the mortgagor is in default; (4) that all conditions precedent have been met; and (5) the amount of principal and interest due.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Natl.

Rosenthal averred that the Joneses were advised in August 2012 that the loan was in default, accelerating the unpaid balance of $142,475.

The Joneses also executed a mortgage in favor of MERS as nominee for First Magnus. The mortgage was assigned from First Magnus to Deutsche Bank Trust as trustee for RALI, and duly recorded. The mortgage was later assigned from Deutsche Bank Trust to Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank is also in possession of the mortgage and note.
