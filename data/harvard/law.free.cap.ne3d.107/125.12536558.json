For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This matter arises out of a dispute between Velio and Aleksandar G. Mitrevski (\"Mitrevski\"), joint owners of the business venture AM and JV, LLC (\"AM and JV\"). Prior to entering into business with Velio, Mitrevski operated a used car dealership at 1940 South High Street in Columbus (\"the property\"), a property which he owned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2008, Velio approached Mitrevski about becoming a partner in Mitrevski's dealership. Following negotiations, Mitrevski and Velio formed AM and JV as joint owners pursuant to an operating agreement that both signed. Velio agreed to provide Mitrevksi with $195,000 and to invest an additional $50,000 in the business. In exchange, Mitrevski transferred the title for the property to AM and JV and agreed to invest $50,000 in the business. Mitrevski was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the dealership and was to receive a salary. Profit from the business was to be split equally between Mitrevski and Velio. The operating agreement specifically provided that \"[t]he unanimous consent of the Members shall be required before the Company may * * * [a]quire, sell, lease or other transfer\n   or disposition of, or mortgage, pledge or the placing or suffering of any other encumbrance on or affecting all of the Company's property or any portion thereof.\" (Appellant's Sept. 14, 2015 Motion for New Trial, Ex. B, Operating Agreement at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} According to Mitrevski, in January 2010, Toty Auto Repair (\"Toty\") began renting part of the property for $2,000 per month, which he split with Velio. In June 2010, Mitrevski and Velio agreed to sell the property because the business was failing. While they waited for the property to sell, Mitrevski claimed that Velio agreed to take all the rent money, and Mitrevski would take any income from the used car dealership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Around October 2010, Mitrevski claimed that Velio ordered him to leave the property. As a result, Mitrevski took some of AM and JV's cars from the property to a new lot across the street at 1872 South Pearl Street and began operating a used car dealership as a separate, new business from AM and JV. According to Mitrevski, Velio agreed to split with Mitrevski the rent he received from the property because Mitrevski had moved. Thereafter, Mitrevski attempted to sell the property to Spartak Selimaj (\"Selimaj\"). Mitrevski stated that Selimaj paid both him and Velio earnest money as a down payment for the property, but canceled the deal after discovering the property had been transferred from AM and JV to MyFlori, a company owned by Velio. Mitrevski testified he was shocked to discover that the property had been transferred to MyFlori.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} According to Velio, in 2010, Toty began renting part of the property for $1,500 per month, and later began paying $2,000 per month. Velio claimed that, in June 2010, Mitrevski bought a car for himself and told Velio to take the rent for himself. In February 2011, Velio confronted Mitrevski because he believed he was stealing from the business. According to Velio, Mitrevski told him to \"[k]eep the property.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 279.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Velio stated that Toty, in March 2011, agreed to lease the property from Velio for a duration of three years for $2,500 per month, increasing 3 percent annually. Toty made payments under the lease directly to Velio. According to Velio, in March 2011, Mitrevski had \"remove[d] himself completely from the property\" and \"was in [a] different property and business.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 216-17.) Velio did not share any of the rent he received under the lease with Mitrevski. Velio stated that, in April 2012, after the deal with Selimaj failed, he transferred the property to his real estate holding company, MyFlori.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Selimaj testified that, in June 2011, Mitrevski approached him with an offer to sell the property. In January or February 2012, Selimaj paid earnest money as a down payment for the property, but stated the sale was delayed because there was a tenant occupying the property. In April 2012, Selimaj discovered the property had been transferred from AM and JV to another company and, as a result, demanded his earnest money back. Selimaj testified Mitrevski reacted with surprise when Selimaj informed him that the property had been transferred from AM and JV to another company. Selimaj ultimately received his earnest money back from both Mitrevski and Velio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On April 22, 2013, plaintiffs-appellees, Mitrevski and AM and JV (collectively \"appellees\"), filed a complaint in the trial court asserting the following three causes of action: quiet title against MyFlori, conversion against appellants, and conversion of rental income against appellants. On June 7, 2013, appellants filed an answer and counterclaim. Appellants made the following counterclaims: breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conve\n   rsion, negligent misrepresentation, and promissory estoppel. Appellants also sought punitive damages and a declaration that Velio was the sole member of AM and JV. On July 8, 2013, appellees filed an answer to appellants' counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On July 9, 2014, appellees filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On August 22, 2014, appellants filed a memorandum contra appellees' motion for partial summary judgment. On September 2, 2014, appellees filed a reply to appellants' memorandum contra appellees' motion for partial summary judgment. On September 5, 2014, the trial court issued an order referring the matter to a magistrate. On September 8, 2014, the magistrate filed a decision denying appellees' motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On September 19, 2014, appellees filed an objection to the magistrate's decision. On October 30, 2014, appellants filed a reply to appellees' objection. On February 2, 2015, the trial court denied appellees' objection to the magistrate's decision and adopted such decision as its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On February 9, 2015, the matter proceeded to a jury trial at which the magistrate presided. On February 17, 2015, the jury rendered the following verdict: (1) the property remained an asset of AM and JV, (2) rent in the amount of $110,727 which had been received by Velio should be returned to AM and JV, and (3) Velio was entitled to damages in the amount of $43,282.75 on the claims of conversion of property and breach of fiduciary duty with regard to Mitrevski's conversion of motor vehicles belonging to AM and JV. On February 18, 2015, the magistrate filed a decision following the jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On September 4, 2015, appellants filed a motion for new trial or, in the alternative, a motion for additur and remittitur. On the same date, appellants filed a separate motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a motion for new trial. On October 16, 2015, appellees filed responses to appellants' September 4, 2015 motions. On November 6, 2015, appellants filed replies to appellees' October 16, 2015 responses. On December 23, 2015, the magistrate filed a decision denying appellants' September 4, 2015 motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On March 1, 2016, appellants filed objections to the magistrate's February 18, 2015 decision following jury trial. On the same date, appellants separately filed objections to the magistrate's December 23, 2015 decision. On March 30, 2016, appellees filed responses to appellants' March 1, 2016 objections. On April 5, 2016, appellants filed replies to appellees' March 30, 2016 responses. On September 14, 2016, the trial court filed a decision and entry overruling appellants' objections to the magistrate's February 18, 2015 decision following jury trial and overruling appellants' objections to the magistrate's December 23, 2015 decision denying appellants' motions for new trial, motion for additur and remittitur, and motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellants appeal and assign the following two assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In their two assignments of error, appellants argue the trial court erred by overruling their objections to the magistrate's\n   decision denying their motion for new trial or, in the alternative, their motions for additur and remittitur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Specifically, appellants contend that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Because jury interrogatories Nos. 9-15 specifically found that Velio was deprived of his ownership interest in the vehicles, funds, and monies held by [AM and JV] after August or September of 2010, Velio should be entitled to one half of the $80,000 on [AM and JV's] 2010 [tax] return, which is a reflection of the assets of that business at the end of 2010. Thus, the jury should have awarded Velio one half of these assets i.e. $40,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Appellants' Brief at 20-21.) Consistent with appellants' contention, the jury awarded Velio $40,000 in damages for his counterclaim for conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Second, appellants argue that \"Velio is entitled to $78,004.60\" because \"[e]xhibits introduced at trial prove that between August of 2010 and March of 2011, Mitrevski sold $156,009.21 worth of vehicles back to auto auctioneers, under the dealer license used for [AM and JV], with the proceeds going directly to [Mitrevski's new dealership's bank] accounts, which Velio had no knowledge of.\" (Appellants' Brief at 24; 21.)

Velio testified he began paying property taxes on the property in question in the second half of 2011. Appellants submitted an exhibit showing property taxes paid from June 2011 through June 2014 in the amount of $16,872.73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Appellants contend the above establishes Velio paid the property taxes for the period in question, and that it was manifest error for the jury to have failed to reduce the award of damages for conversion of rental income by the amount of taxes paid. Although Mitrevski stated he did not pay the property taxes after he vacated the property, the jury need not have accepted Velio's testimony that he, in fact, paid the property taxes. At trial, and on appeal, appellees argued the testimony\n   and records were insufficient to establish that Velio paid the taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Furthermore, at trial, Velio stated that he attempted to evict Toty because it was \"behind on the rent, not paying property taxes.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 286.) This testimony raises the question as to whether Velio or Toty was responsible for paying the property taxes during the period in question. Although Velio points to auditor's records showing the property taxes were paid, he does not point to his own records showing payments matching the amounts in question. As a result, we find that the jury was not required to believe Velio's testimony that he paid property taxes in the claimed amount and, therefore, cannot find that the trial court erred in denying appellants' motion for remittitur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Accordingly, appellants' second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
