See\n   <em>\n    Canty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224642\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/535/#p545\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 541 n.5. Prior to providing his lay opinion, the trooper testified that he was certified to teach the subjects of OUI arrests and standardized field sobriety tests. The trooper also testified he has no less than four certifications as a teacher on the subject of OUIs, has taught on those subjects for eighteen years, and has taught at every municipal police academy in Massachusetts as well as various police academies in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Arizona. We recognize \"[t]he danger posed ... 'that the jury might forego independent analysis of the facts and bow too readily to the opinion of an expert or otherwise influential witness.' \"\n   <em>\n    Canty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 542-543, quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LaCorte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"324105\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/373/700/#p705\">\n    373 Mass. 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 705 (1977). However, the prosecution was careful to elicit from the trooper that his observations were \"not really expert knowledge\" and also that it was just \"[the trooper's] personal opinion.\" This limited direct examination combined with the judge's instruction that the jury may reject the officer's opinion about the defendant's sobriety sufficiently reduced the risk of prejudice considered in\n   <em>\n    Canty\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, we see no prejudicial error in the admission of the trooper's training and experience and his opinion regarding the defendant's level of intoxication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Other claims\n   </em>\n   . The defendant also argues that various preserved and unpreserved errors at trial resulted in the infringement of the defendant's right to a fair trial. See\n   <em>\n    Flebotte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482592\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/417/348/#p353\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482592\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/417/348/#p353\">\n    at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (preserved);\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freehold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304943\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/352/556/#p563\">\n    352 Mass. 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563-564 (1967) (unpreserved). We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, the defendant contends that the prosecutor's unanswered question to the trooper on direct examination resulted in the jury considering evidence that the defendant refused to attempt a field sobriety test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    AdonSoto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457221\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/497/#p500\">\n    475 Mass. 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500 (2016) (refusal evidence cannot be introduced by prosecution based on defendant's privilege against self-incrimination under art. 12 of Massachusetts Declaration of Rights). Here, we find no prejudice where the judge properly excluded the evidence before the witness was able to respond and also provided a correct jury instruction that questions are not evidence. Additionally, the record provides no basis for any claim that the prosecutor acted in bad faith by posing an objectionable question in an attempt to make the jury consider facts not placed in evidence or circumvent the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Granito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"508596\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/326/494/#p498\">\n    326 Mass. 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498-499 (1950).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, the defendant argues that the emotional response from the trooper on cross-examination created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The defendant claims now that the trooper's testimony referencing another trooper being killed when pulling a driver over was so prejudicial that a mistrial was required. Emotional outbursts are not uncommon in criminal trials, and we give substantial deference to the judge's effort to adequately remedy such error. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"734986\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/84/#p89\">\n    437 Mass. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89-90 (2002). Here, to prevent prejudicing the jury, the judge took a recess for the trooper to regain his composure. The judge also instructed the jury not to be swayed by sympathy. We presume the jury followed that instruction. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Helfant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"877723\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/398/214/#p228\">\n    398 Mass. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228-229 (1986). After considering the record as a whole, we are convinced that there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The defendant was also found responsible of two civil infractions which were placed on file.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The trooper's description of the defendant's \"cyclical mood swings\" as a sign and symptom was acceptable lay witness testimony.
