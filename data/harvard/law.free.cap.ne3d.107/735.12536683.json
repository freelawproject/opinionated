The trial court sentenced Mincey to the maximum term of eight years in prison. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    The State's Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Mincey's teenage daughters, Deajah and Shay, were embroiled in an on-going dispute with Robinson's sister, Tynia Jones, and others culminating in a large street fight. Roughly an hour before this melee, Deajah fought with one of Tynia's friends, Tonya Miller. Tynia witnessed the earlier fight, and cell phone video of the fight was admitted at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The street fight initially involved Robinson, Tynia, Deajah, Shay and a few other women and girls. Mincey, along with her sister Denna and their cousin, Latressa Conley, ran out of Mincey's home and joined in. Mincey carried a stun gun, Conley a spray bottle of isopropyl alcohol, and Denna a glass jar of a concentrated sulfuric acid solution. According to Robinson, in the midst of the fight, Mincey pointed at Robinson and said, \"It's that bitch right there,\" prompting Denna to throw acid onto Robinson's face. As Robinson tried to wipe the acid from her face, Denna threw the remainder of the jar's contents onto Robinson's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Tynia corroborated Robinson's testimony, and added that Denna's first throw\n   was underhanded, and the second, overhanded. Robinson testified that the acid made her feel like her body was \"on fire,\" and that her pain level on a scale of 1-to-10 was \"over 10.\" She was hospitalized for two-and-a-half weeks and still experiences pain daily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Officer Kurtz responded to the scene. Mincey gave him permission to search her house. Kurtz encountered Denna on the second floor as she exited from the bathroom, appearing to have just showered. The officer found a bottle of \"Liquid Fire\" drain cleaner in Mincey's home. It was later discovered that there were burns on Denna's hand and back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Dana Greely, a crime lab technician, tested the Liquid Fire and remnants of acid collected from the scene. Greely testified that Liquid Fire is a sulfuric acid solution, and that the liquid from the crime scene was also a sulfuric acid solution. She concluded that Denna's shirt and Robinson's clothing had been burned with sulfuric acid. Greely could not say whether the acid thrown on Robinson was the Liquid Fire found in Mincey's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Mincey's Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In her first trial, Mincey had expert witness Larry Dehus appointed at her request to test the evidence found at the scene and the Liquid Fire. Dehus's report contained conclusions very similar to Greely's. She did not call Dehus as a witness in either trial. Prior to her second trial, Mincey moved the trial court to appoint a second expert witness, who Mincey claimed would possibly be able to testify that the Liquid Fire from her home was not the acid thrown on Robinson. Her motion was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Mincey's defense centered on casting doubt on the identity of Denna as the acid-thrower, and Mincey as the one who told Denna to throw the acid on Robinson. The defense argued that Denna could not have carried a jar of acid to the fight because an eye-witness testified that Denna had been physically fighting before the acid was thrown. Denna admitted that there were burns on her hands and back, but explained that the burn on her hand was from an oven and that the burn on her back occurred when someone behind her at the fight threw the acid at Robinson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9}\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Admission of the cell phone video.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   In her first assignment of error, Mincey contends that the trial court erred when it admitted into evidence the cell phone video of the earlier fight between Mincey's daughters and Tonya Miller. Mincey raises three arguments: the video (1) was not properly authenticated; (2) was irrelevant and/or unduly prejudicial; and (3) constituted impermissible \"other acts\" evidence. None of these arguments is meritorious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} We review the trial court's admission of the video for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The question of whether evidence is relevant is \"one which the trial court can resolve based on common experience and logic.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the trial court stated that evidence of the earlier fight provided a possible motive for the later street fight. We find no error in this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Excluding this video was not required by Evid.R. 403(A). That rule provides, \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mincey claims that the video was unduly prejudicial because its only purpose was to show that Mincey must have been angry at the girls involved in the earlier fight against her daughters. We fail to see how the probative value of this evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Finally, Mincey contends that the video contained prohibited \"other acts\" evidence under Evid.R. 404(B). This objection was not raised in the trial court. Mincey has therefore forfeited all but plain error on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In Mincey's first trial, that ended in a mistrial, the court had appointed expert witness Dehus. Dehus tested the Liquid Fire found in Mincey's home, acid residue found at the scene, and Robinson's and Michelle Mincey's clothing. Dehus's report concluded that the Liquid Fire was a concentrated sulfuric acid solution, that the acid residue was sulfuric acid residue, and that the chemical damage to Robinson's and Denna Mincey's clothing was indicative of sulfuric acid. Dehus could not determine whether the acid found at the scene and on the tested clothing was from the Liquid Fire found in Mincey's home. Dehus did not testify at either trial. The\n   state's expert, Greely, who testified in Mincey's second trial, came to similar conclusions as Dehus after she tested the evidence from the scene. However, according to Mincey, Ridgway would be able to perform more sensitive testing than either Dehus or Greely that could possibly exclude the Liquid Fire as the agent that burned Robinson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} As a guarantee of due process, indigent defendants are entitled to receive the \"raw materials\" and the \"basic tools of an adequate defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Ake v.

Mincey wanted Ridgway to counter the coroner's analyst's results. Her first expert was unable to do so. Both Greely and Dehus came to the same conclusions after testing-i.e. that Liquid Fire contained a concentrated sulfuric acid solution and that the evidence collected from the scene was sulfuric acid. Greely's and Dehus's results were inconclusive as to whether the Liquid Fire was the acid used in the attack. Mincey did not show how more testing would have led to a different result. Her argument in support of a second expert was speculative, raising only the \"possibility,\" and not a \"reasonable probability\" that yet more testing would yield a result favorable to Mincey. Further, Mincey had an opportunity to adequately cross-examine the coroner's analyst about the lab results, and thereby cast doubt on the analysis or the lab results themselves. And there is no indication in the record that Mincey's first expert was unavailable, had she wished to call her own expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Additionally, while the presence of Liquid Fire in Mincey's home was significant, the heart of the state's case was other evidence-primarily eyewitness testimony-connecting Mincey to the crime. Mincey was convicted of complicity for directing her sister to throw the acid on Robinson. Where the acid came from was less important.

The trial court also instructed the jury that \"knowingly\" was the mens rea for felonious assault, and properly defined \"knowingly.\" The defense submitted proposed jury instructions on the complicity charge that inserted the mens rea of \"knowingly\" into the complicity instruction, itself.

In\n   <em>\n    Skatzes\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Ohio considered the following instruction given under the former complicity statute, R.C. 2923.04 : \" 'Before you can find the defendant guilty, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that * * * the defendant, acting with the required culpable mental state for the particular offense, * * * conspired with another to commit the offenses.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. The court concluded that the instruction was not erroneous because the language tracked the complicity statute and was not ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court also held that the \"jurors would have understood this instruction to mean that they should apply the culpable mental state for the offense that they found to be the object of the conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The same reasoning applies here. The trial court followed the language of the statute. The culpable mental state was referenced in connection with the felonious assault charge-which was given by the court immediately following the complicity instruction. The jurors would have understood that they should apply \"knowingly\" to the complicity charge. Thus, the court included all elements in its charge to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Second, the dissent's laser focus on the complicity instruction alone is too narrow. After completing the lengthy complicity instruction, the trial court next instructed the jury on felonious assault, including the mens rea. Viewing the instructions as a whole, as required, it is beyond dispute that the jury was instructed that the mens rea for Mincey's complicity charge was the same as the mens rea for felonious assault-\"knowingly\"-which was given.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mincey has not explained how these statements were improper, or deprived her of a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Mincey also claims that the assistant prosecuting attorney misstated the law. Even if this occurred, the trial court correctly informed the jury that \"[i]t's the duty of the court to instruct you on the law. That is, to instruct you on the\n   law which you must apply to the facts as you determine them to be in order to arrive at your verdict.\" Jurors are presumed to follow the court's instructions.\n   <em>\n    Pang v.

Thus, Mincey has failed to establish prejudice resulting in an unfair trial. We overrule her fifth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 38}\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Weight and Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   In her sixth assignment of error, Mincey argues that her conviction was against the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. It was not. Mincey was convicted of being complicit with her sister, Denna, in committing felonious assault. Mincey's argument on appeal centers on her perceived weaknesses in the state's case against Denna. Eyewitness testimony established that Denna came to the fight with a jar filled with liquid. In regard to Mincey, the state presented evidence that, upon seeing Robinson, Mincey said to Denna, \"That's the bitch right there,\" which prompted Denna to throw the contents of the jar on Robinson's face and body. Robinson testified that she was severely injured as a result of this attack. Later testing confirmed that there were sulfuric acid burns on Robinson's and Denna's clothing. Denna also had burns on her hands and back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we hold that a rational trier of fact could find that the state proved its case against Mincey beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

And although Mincey presented a version of events that, if believed, would have exonerated her, in weighing the evidence presented there is no indication that the jury lost its way in choosing to believe the state's evidence instead. While Denna denied that she threw the acid, and pointed to the fact that there were burns on her back, there was testimony that Denna had thrown the acid overhanded, thereby explaining how acid could have spilled out of the jar onto her back.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

She alleges that the trial court should have granted her motion because (1) the court erroneously instructed the jury on complicity, (2) the court erred in admitting evidence of the earlier altercation between Mincey's daughters and Tonya Miller, (3) the court erroneously denied Mincey's request for an expert witness, and (4) the state failed to present sufficient evidence to convict Mincey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 41} We have evaluated all of these arguments and determined that there was no prejudicial error.

She claims that the court did not properly consider the purposes and principles of sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 before imposing sentence, and that her sentence is therefore clearly and convincingly contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Finally, the court indicated that Mincey had shown no remorse, and was still acting in a threatening manner towards others. It is evident from these statements that the court considered R.C. 2929.11, and some of the factors in R.C. 2929.12. And we may presume from a silent record that the court considered the balance of the R.C. 2929.12 factors-unless Mincey can demonstrate otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

I would find that the trial court erred in admitting the cell phone video which showed a fight earlier in the day between Mincey's daughters and Tonya Miller. Mincey was not present during the fight, and there is no testimony that she ever saw the video prior to the altercation at issue here. Thus, what specifically happened at the fight is irrelevant. What is relevant is Mincey's knowledge that a fight occurred and any information that was conveyed to her about the fight. While I would find that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting this video, I would find that the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 48} I concur with the separate concurring opinion with respect to the admissibility of the cell phone video and the majority's resolution of the first, third, fifth, sixth, and eighth assignments of error. However, I respectfully dissent from its conclusions as to the fourth and seventh assignments of error regarding the erroneous jury instructions, and from the decision to affirm the trial court's judgment. Appellant argues that the complicity instructions omitted the mental capacity, an element of the crime, which affected her substantial rights. The majority determines that the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the proper mens rea for complicity did not omit an essential element of the offense. I respectfully disagree with this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Requested Jury Instruction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Mincey was charged with the principal offense of felonious assault, but the state's theory of the case was that Mincey aided and abetted her sister Denna by providing the acid, pointing to Robinson, and stating, \"It's that bitch right there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Both Mincey and the state filed several proposed jury instructions. Mincey filed written requested jury instructions with a complicity definition that included the mens rea of knowingly, and an instruction that explained to the jury that to find Mincey guilty, the state had to prove the mental state of knowingly beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held an off-the-record conference to discuss the instructions and objections. Afterwards, Mincey discussed her proposed instructions and objected to the court's instruction that criminal intent may be inferred from the defendant's presence. Mincey also objected to an instruction on attempting to commit an offense because it did not apply to the facts of Mincey's case. The court then stated on the record that the parties thoroughly reviewed all of the objections and instructions in conference, and the court determined the final jury instructions after the discussion.

The state does not dispute that the trial court failed to instruct that the mens rea for complicity to commit felonious assault was knowingly. Instead, the state merely argues on appeal that Mincey was not prejudiced by the omission because the instruction tracked the language of the complicity statute, R.C. 2923.03, and the court defined complicity as \"acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense * * *.\" However, the state did not demonstrate that the error did not contribute to the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 61} The state's sole theory and the evidence at trial was that Mincey was an accomplice rather than the principal offender. No testimony supported a theory that Mincey threw the acid. Rather, the evidence was that Mincey's sister threw the acid and that Mincey aided and abetted her. Therefore, I must conclude that the jury found Mincey guilty on an aiding-and-abetting theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 62} The model instructions required that the jurors be instructed that they must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mincey knowingly aided or abetted another, and immediately after that instruction, the court should have defined knowingly. Additionally, the definition of aid and abet should have made it clear that Mincey must have shared the criminal intent of her sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 63} In this case, the jury instructions on complicity did not affirmatively state the correct culpable mental state for complicity. The complicity instructions completely omitted the mens rea of knowingly. Although the court mentioned in its complicity definition that \"no person, acting with the culpability required for the commission of an offense shall do any of the following,\" the court failed to specify that the requisite culpability was knowingly, and did not instruct the jury that the underlying offense was felonious assault. This error was compounded by the fact that the court instructed the jurors that \"defendant's criminal intent may be inferred,\" without clarifying that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the principal offender. The concluding instruction did not include any culpable mental state. These jury instructions were flawed because they did not make it clear that Mincey could only be convicted as an aider and abettor if she knowingly acted to aid and abet in the felonious assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 64} When the court fails to instruct the jury as to all of the elements of an offense, the error is not harmless unless the \"omitted element is supported by uncontroverted evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Neder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p15\">\n    527 U.S. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p15\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p15\">\n    144 L.Ed.2d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the evidence against Mincey was not overwhelming and was contested. The only independent witness, Todd Martin, a construction worker, testified that he saw a woman walk up to a house and start yelling and screaming. Two teenaged girls, who looked like twins, came out of the house, and stood on the porch arguing with the woman on the sidewalk. After the woman left, the other two teenagers walked down the street. Later, he saw one of the teenaged girls again leave the same porch and walk down the street with a mason jar with a brownish-reddish liquid. Although he did not see the teen return to the home to retrieve the glass jar, he testified that the home in question was not the Mincey home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Robinson testified that she did not see Denna leave the house with a jar, but saw her running on the street with a jar without a lid that was completely full with a brown liquid. None of the liquid splashed or spilled while Denna was running. Denna approached Robinson with the jar and asked, \"Which one?\" Mincey responded, \"It's that bitch right there.\" Robinson also testified that she did not see Mincey or Denna fighting with anyone, and that she did not fight with Denna.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Tynia, Robinson's younger sister, testified that she saw the Minceys leave the house and hurry down the street. Denna did not have anything in her hands. Mincey and Denna began fighting. Denna fought, using both fists, with Keisanna, Tynia, Lakesha and Robinson. Tynia was fighting with Mincey when Mincey used a taser on her. During a pause in the fight, Mincey gave Denna a jar that was three quarters of the way full, pointed at Robinson, and said, \"Get that bitch right there.\" Denna threw the liquid on Robinson. Tynia initially told the police that Denna was wearing a white shirt. She also testified at the first trial that the person who threw the jar was wearing a tight white shirt. During the second trial, she testified that she could not remember if Denna was wearing a blue or white shirt. The evidence\n   was uncontroverted that Denna was wearing a blue shirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Both Mincey sisters testified that they did not have a jar of acid. Denna further testified that she did not throw the acid during the fight. Finally, Mincey denied pointing at Robinson and stating, \"It's that bitch right there.\" Because the evidence was contested, I cannot conclude that the failure to instruct on the mens rea did not contribute to the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 68} The majority concludes that the faulty instructions did not omit an element of the offense.

In\n   <em>\n    Langford\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was charged with aggravated murder and murder, both with gun specifications, for the death of a rival gang member in a shootout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 425. At trial, the state presented two theories of the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 425-426. The first was that Langford was the actual shooter, and the second was that he was an accomplice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 426. However, the evidence presented at trial was consistent with a theory of accomplice liability rather than principal offender liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 432.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 71} The trial court's concluding instruction stated: \"Before you can find the defendant guilty of a crime as a complicitor or aider and abettor, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that ... the defendant aided or abetted another in purposely committing the offenses....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 429. However, the court did not instruct the jury that complicity required a mens rea of purposely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 429. The jury convicted Langford of murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 426.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 72} The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision granting Langford's habeas petition because the failure to properly instruct on the mental culpability for a complicitor violated his jury-trial right.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 428.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Although the trial court included the mens rea of purposely in its definition in the instructions on aggravated murder, the Sixth Circuit found that the complicity instruction was erroneous because the instruction did not specifically include that the defendant purposely aided and abetted another.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 428-429. \"[T]he trial court improperly inserted the culpable mental state before the wrong verb.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 433. The court ultimately concluded that \"[t]he failure to instruct on the mens rea of complicity, therefore, had a substantial influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Langford\n   </em>\n   , the trial court failed to instruct on the mens rea of complicity. As the Sixth Circuit explained, \"although the instructions did not directly state that complicity is a strict-liability crime, they also did not affirmatively state the correct mens rea. Rather, the instructions omitted mention of the mens rea for complicity altogether.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 429. Every element of the offense must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and the failure to instruct a jury concerning an essential element effectively removes that element from the jury's deliberations. In this case, the failure to instruct on that element constitutes harmless error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1804294\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/62/151/#p157\">\n    62 Ohio St.2d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20N.E.2d%20144\">\n    404 N.E.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Therefore, I conclude that the trial court's failure to instruct on an essential element of the offense was error that contributed to the conviction. Accordingly, I would sustain the fourth and seventh assignments of error, reverse the judgment of the trial court, and remand the cause for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The trial court never put on an entry overruling the motion.
