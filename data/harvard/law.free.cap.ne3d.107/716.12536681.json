Appellants further challenge the trial court's dismissal of their cross-claim against defendant-appellee, Randy Hicks, a former East Cleveland Police Detective (\"Hicks\"). Appellants argue that the trial court violated Civ.R. 39(A) and Loc.R. 21 by conducting an ex parte jury trial, their constitutional due process rights were violated when the trial court failed to provide them notice of the trial date, and that the trial court issued orders and conducted a jury trial during the pendency of appeals that were inconsistent with this court's and the Ohio Supreme Court's exercise of jurisdiction. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court reverses and remands for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The instant matter arose from an incident that occurred on April 28, 2012, during which Black alleged that appellants arrested him without probable cause and used excessive force in doing so. On April 28, 2014, Black filed a complaint against Hicks and appellants in which he asserted claims for malicious prosecution, abuse of process, spoliation, battery, false imprisonment, supervisory liability, reckless/wanton/willful conduct pursuant to R.C. 2921.52, and civil conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 6, 2014, appellants filed an answer and a cross-claim against Hicks, alleging that Hicks was not acting as an agent of the East Cleveland Police Department on April 28, 2012. On December 15, 2014, Hicks, acting pro se, filed an answer to Black's complaint and appellants' cross-claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 1, 2015, the trial court set the matter for trial on April 11, 2016, at 9:00 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On March 24, 2016, Black filed (1) a motion for default judgment or, in the alternative, a motion to preclude appellants from presenting evidence and witnesses at trial that were not disclosed during the exchange of discovery; (2) a motion in limine to exclude character evidence; (3) a motion in limine to exclude evidence regarding defendants' inability to satisfy a judgment; and (4) a motion in limine to exclude evidence in support of affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On April 4, 2016, the trial court cancelled the trial set for April 11, 2016. Trial was rescheduled for May 23, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On April 19, 2016, the trial court issued an order requiring appellants to respond to Black's discovery requests on or before May 2, 2016. The trial court indicated that appellants' failure to respond to the discovery requests would result in sanctions, including the exclusion of the evidence and witnesses at trial that defendants failed to produce during discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On April 20, 2016, the trial court vacated its April 19, 2016 order and set a show cause hearing requiring appellants to show cause why they failed to respond to Black's discovery requests. The trial court's journal entry stated that appellants' failure to show cause would result in sanctions, including appellants being precluded\n   from offering evidence, witnesses, and arguments at trial that they failed to produce during discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On May 6, 2016, appellants filed an appeal challenging the trial court's April 20, 2016 order.\n   <em>\n    Black v. Hicks\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104453 (\"\n   <em>\n    Black I\n   </em>\n   \"). On May 10, 2016, this court dismissed the appeal for lack of a final appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On May 9, 2016, the trial court denied Black's motion for default judgment. The trial court granted, however, Black's motion to preclude appellants from offering evidence and witnesses at trial that were not disclosed during discovery. The trial court concluded that appellants failed to respond to Black's requests for discovery, failed to respond to Black's motion to exclude evidence, and failed to provide a reason or excuse for their failure to respond to discovery. On the same date, the trial court granted Black's motions in limine to exclude character evidence, evidence regarding appellants' inability to satisfy a judgment, and evidence in support of affirmative defenses; the trial court also granted Black's request to have admissions deemed admitted against Hicks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On May 10, 2016, appellants filed an appeal challenging the trial court's May 9, 2016 orders.\n   <em>\n    Black v. Hicks,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104461 (\"\n   <em>\n    Black II\n   </em>\n   \"). On May 24, 2016, this court dismissed the appeal for lack of a final appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On May 25, 2016, appellants filed an appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court challenging this court's dismissal in\n   <em>\n    Black II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Black v. Hicks,\n   </em>\n   Ohio Supreme Court Case No. 2016-0805,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=146%20Ohio%20St.%203d%201503\">\n    146 Ohio St.3d 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2016 -Ohio- 5792,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20N.E.3d%201174\">\n    58 N.E.3d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Black III\n   </em>\n   \"). Appellants assert that this appeal was perfected at approximately 9:36 a.m. The Ohio Supreme Court subsequently declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal and denied Black's motion for sanctions against appellants on September 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The case was set for trial on May 23 and May 24, 2016. On both dates, trial was continued. Despite the appeal pending in the Ohio Supreme Court, a jury trial commenced on May 25, 2016, at approximately 11:50 a.m. Neither appellants nor counsel appeared in court on May 23, 24, or 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The jury trial concluded on May 31, 2016. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Black, which the trial court journalized on June 3, 2016. The trial court's judgment entry provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Trial start date May 25, 2016, and end date May 31, 2016, before eight jurors and two alternate jurors. * * * The jury finds $10,000,000.00 (ten million dollars) in compensatory damages for [Black] against the following defendants arising out of the following claims: (1) for [Black] against defendant Detective Randy Hicks and defendant Officer Jonathan O'Leary as to [Black's] first claim for violation of [Black's] federal civil rights; (2) for [Black] against defendant City of East Cleveland as to [Black's] second claim for municipal liability; (3) for [Black] against defendant Detective Randy Hicks and defendant Officer Jonathan O'Leary as to [Black's] third claim for false imprisonment/arrest; (4) for [Black] against defendant Detective Randy Hicks and defendant Officer Jonathan O'Leary as to [Black's] fourth claim for battery; joint and several liability as to Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4[;] (5) for [Black] against defendant Chief Spotts as to [Black's] fifth claim for supervisory liability; and (6) for [Black] against defendant Chief Spotts as to [Black's] sixth claim for spoilation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Furthermore, the jury finds $12,000,000.00 (twelve million dollars) in punitive damages for [Black] as follows: (1) for [Black] against defendant Officer\n   Jonathan O'Leary in the amount of 1,000,000.00 (one million dollars) as to [Black's] first claim for violation of [Black's] federal civil rights, as to [Black's] third claim of false imprisonment/arrest, and as to [Black's] fourth claim for battery; and, (2) for [Black] against defendant Chief Spotts in the amount of $11,000,000.00 (eleven million dollars) as to [Black's] fifth claim for supervisory liability and as to [Black's] sixth claim for [spoliation].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On June 15, 2016, appellants filed an appeal challenging the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Black v. Hicks,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104613 (\"\n   <em>\n    Black IV\n   </em>\n   \"). On November 8, 2016, this court dismissed the appeal for lack of a final appealable order, finding that judgment was not entered on all of Black's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On November 14, 2016, Black filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of Counts 7 (reckless/wanton/willful conduct pursuant to R.C. 2921.52 ) and 8 (civil conspiracy). On June 20, 2017, Black filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of Counts 7 and 8 of his complaint with prejudice. On June 29, 2017, the trial court issued a journal entry confirming that Black dismissed Counts 7 and 8 of his complaint. The trial court indicated that these counts were dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On December 12, 2016, appellants filed an appeal challenging the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Black v. Hicks,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105248 (\"\n   <em>\n    Black V\n   </em>\n   \"). This court dismissed the appeal, sua sponte, on March 21, 2017, due to appellants' failure to file an appellate brief. This court granted appellants' motion to reinstate the appeal on March 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In the instant appeal, appellants assign four errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I. The lower court's conduct of an ex parte jury trial was in violation of Civ.R. 39(A) and Loc.R. 21.0.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   II. The lower court's notices failed to provide reasonable, constructive, and/or actual notice that trial was [set] for May 25, 2016; [a]ccordingly, appellants' constitutional right to due process was violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   III. The lower court's May [9], 2016, May 2[5], 2016 and J[uly] 7, 2016 orders must be vacated as such rulings, entered during the pendency of appeals, were not made in execution, and thus were inconsistent with the reviewing courts' exercise of jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   IV. The lower court lacked authority to conduct the May 25, 2016 ex parte jury trial, as such trial proceeded during the pendency of appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Trial Court's Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} We will address appellants' third assignment of error first, because it is dispositive of the appeal. In the third assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court was without jurisdiction to issue the May 9, 2016 orders, commence a jury trial on May 25, 2016, and dismiss appellants' cross-claim on July 7, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   It is well settled that \"the filing of the notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction to proceed with the adjudication during the pendency of the appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The trial court's commencement of the jury trial was inconsistent with the Ohio Supreme Court's jurisdiction to reverse, modify, or affirm this court's May 24, 2016 dismissal of\n   <em>\n    Black II\n   </em>\n   for lack of a final appealable order that appellants appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 30} We further find that the jury's May 31, 2016 verdict, and the trial court's June 3, 2016 order journalizing the verdict, are also void. The appeal in the Ohio Supreme Court was pending from May 25, 2016 until September 14, 2016, when the court declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    3. July 7, 2016 Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Finally, appellants argue that the trial court was without jurisdiction to issue the July 7, 2016 order dismissing appellants' cross-claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 32} On May 3, 2016, Hicks filed a motion to dismiss appellants' cross-claim pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B) and (C) for failure to prosecute. Therein, Hicks argued that he was unable to defend against the cross-claim based on appellants' failure to provide discovery to him and Black. Specifically, Hicks asserted that appellants failed to produce police reports, detective reports, and dash camera footage. On July 7, 2016, the trial court granted Hicks's motion to dismiss appellants' cross-claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 33} As noted above, appellants' appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court was pending from May 25, 2016 to September 14, 2016. When the trial court granted Hicks's motion to dismiss the cross-claim, the Ohio Supreme Court appeal was still pending. Because Hicks's motion to dismiss was premised on appellants' failure to provide discovery to Hicks and Black, the trial court's order granting Hicks's motion to dismiss the cross claim was inconsistent with the Ohio Supreme Court's jurisdiction to reverse, modify, or affirm this court's May 24, 2016 dismissal of\n   <em>\n    Black II\n   </em>\n   for lack of a final appealable order that appellants appealed. Accordingly, the trial court's July 7, 2016 order is void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Black maintains that appellants' May 6, 2016 and May 10, 2016 appeals to this court, and appellants' May 25, 2016 appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction because appellants knew that the orders\n   from which they appealed were not final appealable orders. Black further contends that appellants filed the appeals for the sole purpose of delaying the trial court proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 35} After reviewing the record, we find that appellants engaged in questionable conduct throughout the trial court proceedings. Appellants failed to respond to Black's and Hicks's discovery requests, failed to produce evidence requested by Black and Hicks, and failed to appear for trial on multiple occasions. Most importantly, there is no evidence in the record that appellants informed the trial court on May 25, 2016, that they had filed an appeal in the Ohio Supreme Court before the jury trial commenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The record reflects that the May 25, 2016 notice of appeal in\n   <em>\n    Black III\n   </em>\n   was sent by ordinary U.S. mail to Black's counsel. The Ohio Supreme Court docket indicates that a copy of the notice of appeal in\n   <em>\n    Black III\n   </em>\n   was sent to this court's clerk of courts on May 26, 2016. This notice of appeal is reflected on this court's docket in\n   <em>\n    Black II\n   </em>\n   on May 31, 2016. The notice of appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court is not, however, reflected on the trial court's docket. Had appellants made the trial court aware of the appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, we presume that the trial court would not have commenced the jury trial, which lasted five days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 37} If a party files an appeal for improper purposes, such as delaying the final resolution of the case, or files a frivolous appeal, the party may be subject to sanctions and/or disciplinary action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , App.R. 23 (\"[i]f a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may require the appellant to pay reasonable expenses of the appellee including attorney fees and costs.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Nevertheless, even if appellants' appeals were frivolous or filed for improper purposes, when appellants perfected the appeals to this court and the Ohio Supreme Court, the trial court was required to stay the proceedings, except to take action in aid of the appeals, until the resolution of the appeals. We must emphasize that this unfortunate waste of judicial time and resources could have been avoided had appellants appeared in court on May 25, 2016, or informed the trial court or Black's counsel that the appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court had been perfected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 39} For all of the foregoing reasons, appellants' third assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The trial court was divested of jurisdiction to issue the May 9, 2016 orders because\n   <em>\n    Black I\n   </em>\n   was pending in this court. The trial court was divested of jurisdiction to commence a jury trial on Black's claims, to journalize the jury's verdict, and to issue the July 7, 2016 order dismissing appellants' cross-claim because\n   <em>\n    Black III\n   </em>\n   was pending in the Ohio Supreme Court. Accordingly, these orders and the jury's verdict are void and must be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 41} This case essentially remains at the state of the proceeding as it existed on May 10, 2016, when this court dismissed\n   <em>\n    Black I\n   </em>\n   for lack of a final appealable order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sunshine L.P.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.
