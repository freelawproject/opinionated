GRENDELL, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, Robbie Sankey, appeals from the judgment of the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas, dismissing his lawsuit with prejudice for failure to prosecute. The issue to be determined by this court is whether a court can dismiss a civil case filed by an incarcerated individual for failure to prosecute when he was unable to physically appear at trial and no alternative methods for appearance were considered. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the lower court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 7, 2017, Sankey filed a Complaint against defendants-appellees, Lois and Amico Fasano. It alleged that Lois Fasano forged a fraudulent \"Quiet Claim Deed of Conveyance of Land\" (sic) in relation to certain property located in Ashtabula and that Amico Fasano did \"knowingly notarize\" the fraudulent deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Fasanos filed an Answer on July 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On the same date, Sankey filed a \"Motion to Appear at Hearing Via Skype Video, Jammer, or 'Writ Testificandum,' \" noting that he was unable to appear in person due to his incarceration. On October 17, 2017, a Magistrate's Order was filed allowing Sankey to appear via telephone for a mediation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On November 15, 2017, Sankey moved to be permitted to appear at the pretrial hearing. A Magistrate's Order allowed him to appear via telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Sankey filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on December 1, 2017, which was opposed by the Fasanos. On January 31, 2018, the trial court denied the Motion for Summary Judgment since there was a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Sankey filed a Motion for Order to Convey on February 2, 2018, requesting to be conveyed to the court for the trial scheduled on February 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} A Magistrate's Order was issued on the same date, following a pretrial hearing. The Order stated that \"[d]ue to Plaintiff's incarceration in a State prison facility, it was made clear to the Plaintiff that the court is requiring him to be present to prosecute his case and will not allow the trial to proceed by way of a telephone connection from the prison facility.\" The Order stated that \"[a] failure to prosecute this action may result in its Dismissal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Pursuant to a February 6, 2018 Magistrate's Order, on the date of the trial, as previously instructed, Sankey\n   called the court to confirm he could not be present in person for the trial. Sankey moved to hold the trial at the prison, continue the trial, or dismiss the case without prejudice. The magistrate denied each of these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On February 21, 2018, two weeks after the trial date, the court issued a Judgment Entry in which it denied Sankey's Motion to Convey, noting the cost, need for extra security, and the late date of the motion's filing. The court noted that at the trial, defense counsel moved to dismiss, emphasized that \"Plaintiff was previously put on notice that the case would proceed to trial on February 6th, 2018, and that it was his responsibility to be present to prosecute his case.\" The court dismissed the case with prejudice for failure to prosecute. Subsequent Objections to Magistrate's Order filed by Sankey were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On February 26, 2018, Sankey filed a Notice of Dismissal which was overruled by the trial court on March 5, 2018, since a final disposition had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Sankey timely appeals and raises the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"[1.] The Court erred in not permitting the Plaintiff to prosecute his case at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"[2.] The Court erred by dismissing the Plaintiff's case for want of prosecution with Prejudice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} We will consider Sankey's assignments of error jointly, as they both relate to his inability to proceed with his case and its dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} As an initial matter, we note that Sankey argues that the court's decision was based, at least in part, upon bias against him and that the judge should have recused herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The proper procedure for raising an issue of bias of a court of common pleas judge is to \"file an affidavit of disqualification with the clerk of the supreme court * * *.\" R.C. 2701.03(A). Sankey asserts that he did so and the Supreme Court \"chose to believe the Judge Affidavit and did not recuse her.\" \"Pursuant to R.C. 2701.03, the determination of a claim that a common pleas judge is biased is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.\"\n   <em>\n    Aloi v.

However, courts may permit attendance at a hearing following an evaluation of various factors, including the cost of transporting the prisoner, whether the claim has merit and can be intelligently argued by the prisoner, and the danger of transporting the prisoner.\n   <em>\n    Mancino\n   </em>\n   at 222,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20N.E.2d%20332\">\n    523 N.E.2d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no question that the lower court considered these factors in the present matter, finding that transporting Sankey would be costly, create additional security concerns, and there was not sufficient notice prior to trial to grant the motion. The Fasanos' main argument in their appellate brief is that there was not an abuse of discretion in that decision, a contention with which we do not disagree. Sankey, however, primarily argues not that the court erred in disallowing him to be transported to court for the trial but that he should have been permitted to participate in some manner, such as by phone, or, at the least, his case should have been dismissed without prejudice. The question, then, is whether, by denying Sankey\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   opportunity to litigate his case, the lower court abused its discretion in dismissing for failure to prosecute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Dismissal of actions for failure to prosecute is governed by Civ.R. 41(B)(1) which states: \"Where the plaintiff fails to prosecute, or comply with these rules or any court order, the court upon motion of a defendant or on its own motion may, after notice to the plaintiff's counsel, dismiss an action or claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In general, there is no question that Sankey was an active participant in these proceedings, filed various motions, completed discovery, and repeatedly requested to be able to participate by several methods, including via telephone or Skype. It was evident from the beginning of the proceedings that he would be incarcerated throughout this matter. He also moved prior to dismissal for options such as holding the trial at the jail, granting a continuance, or dismissing the matter without prejudice. The dismissal for failure to prosecute was related solely to the fact that Sankey was unable to appear at trial as was required by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Several appellate districts have held that a court cannot dismiss a civil complaint from an incarcerated individual based solely on the fact that the individual is incarcerated. Where an action was dismissed for failure to prosecute due to the inmate's incarceration and inability to appear at a hearing, and the inmate had been an active participant in the proceedings, this court found that \"[d]ismissing the action with prejudice without considering less drastic alternatives did not advance the judicial principle of deciding cases on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

Further, to the extent that the Fasanos argue Sankey did not move for appointed counsel, it does not follow that all of the other methods for proceeding with his case discussed above should not have been adequately considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We find nothing in the record to indicate why the court failed to allow alternate methods for hearing this case, although it was evident Sankey attempted to advance alternatives to physical appearance. The February 2, 2018 Magistrate's Order indicates that \"it was made clear to Plaintiff that the Court is requiring him to be present to prosecute his case and will not allow the trial to proceed by way of a telephone connection from the prison facility,\" but fails to provide an explanation of why this was the case. There is no question that the court had the physical capability to do so, given that it allowed Sankey to appear in such a manner both for mediation and pretrial hearings. As explained in the litany of cases above, the courts should provide alternative means to an incarcerated individual rather than dismissing solely due to his failure to appear in person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 28} It is also unclear why the court dismissed this matter with prejudice when it could have stayed the proceedings or even dismissed without prejudice, as Sankey requested. The Fasanos note that Sankey is due to be released several months prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations for a fraud claim, so it appears he could have timely refiled his claims. Such opportunity was taken away from him by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The Fasanos argue that since no transcript was filed, we should presume the regularity of the proceedings below. They raise this claim, however, in relation to the court's consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Mancino\n   </em>\n   factors regarding the transport of a prisoner for trial. As noted above, we find no error in the court's holding as to that issue. The Fasanos are also unclear as to what transcripts should have been provided and it is not evident whether any record of the pretrial hearings where these matters\n   would have been discussed was made. In any event, as noted above, the court's own statements appear to indicate that it determined the failure to be physically present in court alone provided grounds for dismissal, even though it appears other methods for trial were available to the court. The court failed to address any of these issues in its judgment entries and magistrate orders addressing Sankey's various requests for the court to provide an alternative method to hear his claims. A court speaks through its judgment entries and its failure to provide any basis for its decisions makes it impossible to determine whether the court considered any of the alternatives to dismissal, let alone its reasons for rejecting these alternatives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dvorak v.
