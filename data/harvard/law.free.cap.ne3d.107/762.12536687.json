Chapter 2971 in effect in 1998, when he was sentenced, had not conferred upon the trial court the authority to enhance his kidnapping sentences based on the specifications that he was a \"sexually violent predator,\" because those specifications were not, as R.C. 2971.03 then required, based on a sexually-violent-offense conviction that had existed before the indictment charging the sexually-violent-predator specification, but were instead based on the conduct underlying the sexually-violent-offense charges contained in the jointly-tried indictments in the cases numbered B-9800321 and B-9802147. The motion sought relief in the form of \"removing [the] Sexual Violent Predator sanction\" from the judgment of conviction and a declaration that the state had \"forfeited any rights\" to so sanction him or to classify him as a sexual predator under R.C. 2950.09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Ingels had previously presented\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   claims, on direct appeal from the second common pleas court entry correcting postrelease control and in postconviction motions filed in 2009, 2011, and 2012. In 2011, we affirmed the dismissal of Ingels's 2009 motion, upon our determination that the claimed error did not render his sentences void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ingles\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

We then relied on that determination to hold that the law of our 2011 decision precluded the trial court, in correcting postrelease control, and the common pleas court, in deciding Ingels's subsequent postconviction motions, from granting relief on that ground.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ingl\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

Hamilton No. C-120052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In this appeal from the overruling of Ingels's 2016 motion, we revisit that determination. We conclude that the sentences imposed for the kidnapping offenses charged in counts one and three of the indictment in the case numbered B-9800321 are void, because the trial court lacked the statutory authority to impose them. And on that basis, we overrule our prior decisions to the extent that they hold to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     No Statutory Authority to Enhance the Kidnapping Sentences\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The kidnapping charges in counts one and three of the indictment in the case numbered B-9800321 each carried a sexual-motivation specification and a sexually-violent-predator specification. With respect to each offense, the jury found that Ingels had acted with a sexual motivation, and the trial court found that Ingels was a \"sexually violent predator\" for purposes of the sentencing-enhancement provisions of R.C. Chapter 2971. Thus, the trial court,\n   pursuant to R.C. 2971.03(A)(3), enhanced Ingels's sentences for the sexually motivated kidnappings, imposing for each offense a prison term of nine years to life, instead of a definite prison term of up to ten years prescribed for first-degree-felony kidnapping.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2929.14(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} R.C. 2971.03, in relevant part, mandates an enhanced sentence upon a guilty verdict or plea on a kidnapping charge if the offender also \"is convicted of or pleads guilty to both a sexual motivation specification and a sexually violent predator specification that were included in the * * * count in the indictment * * * charging that offense.\" R.C. 2971.03(A). R.C. 2971.01(H)(1), as it provided in 1998 when Ingels was sentenced, defined a \"sexually violent predator\" as \"a person who\n   <em>\n    has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to committing\n   </em>\n   , on or after January 1, 1997, a sexually violent offense and is likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually violent offenses.\" (Emphasis added.) In 2005, the General Assembly amended the statute to define a \"sexually violent predator\" as \"a person who, on or after January 1, 1997,\n   <em>\n    commits\n   </em>\n   a sexually violent offense and is likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually violent offenses.\" (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2971.01(H)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The 2005 amendment was prompted by the Ohio Supreme Court's 2004 decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the court held that a \"[c]onviction of a sexually violent offense cannot support the specification that the offender is a sexually violent predator as defined in R.C. 2971.01(H)(1) if the conduct leading to the conviction and the * * * specification are charged in the same indictment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=818%20N.E.2d%20283\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at syllabus. That holding derived from the court's reading of former R.C. 2971.01(H)(1) to require that a sexually-violent-predator specification be supported by a sexually-violent-offense \"conviction * * * that [had] existed prior to the * * * indictment\" charging the specification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In the proceedings below, the trial court enhanced Ingels's sentences for the sexually motivated kidnappings based upon its finding, in support of the accompanying sexually-violent-predator specifications, that Ingels was a \"sexually violent predator.\" But the court's finding that Ingels was a \"sexually violent predator\" was based on the conduct underlying the sexually-violent-offense charges contained in the indictments in the cases numbered B-9800321 and B-9802147; its \"sexually violent predator\" finding was not, as former R.C. 2971.01(H)(1) had required, based on a sexually-violent-offense \"conviction * * * that [had] existed prior to the * * * indictment\" in the case numbered B-9800321, charging the sexually-violent-predator specifications. Accordingly, R.C. Chapter 2971, as it provided when Ingels was sentenced, did not confer upon the trial court the authority to enhance his sentences for the sexually motivated kidnappings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Kidnapping Sentences Are Subject to Correction as Void\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Ohio Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In so holding, the court concluded that a successful\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   claim would not have rendered Waver's convictions void, because the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   had expressly held that \"the trial court\n   <em>\n    erred\n   </em>\n   in relying on the jury's convictions of the underlying rape and kidnapping charges to prove the sexually-violent-predator specification alleged in the same indictment.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4, quoting\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"430584\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/104/106/\">\n    104 Ohio St.3d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-6238\">\n    2004-Ohio-6238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=818%20N.E.2d%20283\">\n    818 N.E.2d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 33.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nor is it persuasive. For the purpose of determining whether a\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   error renders a sentence void, we perceive no significance in the Supreme Court's use of the word \"erred\" in declaring its holding. The void-or-voidable issue was not before the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   because the case was before the court on direct appeal, requiring no more to \"remedy\" the sentencing error than to hold that \"the trial court erred\" and to order that Smith be resentenced. But a void-or-voidable inquiry is not superfluous when, as here and in\n   <em>\n    Waver\n   </em>\n   , it is undertaken in a collateral proceeding. To the contrary, the determination in a collateral proceeding of whether an unauthorized sentence is void effectively determines whether the court may \"remedy\" the error at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758933\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/128/92/\">\n    128 Ohio St.3d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-6238\">\n    2010-Ohio-6238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=942%20N.E.2d%20332\">\n    942 N.E.2d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 40 (holding that \"void sentences are not precluded from appellate review by principles of res judicata and may be reviewed at any time, on direct appeal or by collateral attack\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Nor do we find persuasive the decisions of the Ninth and Tenth Appellate Districts affirming the rejection of\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   claims advanced in postconviction motions.

Accordingly, the common pleas court cannot be said to have erred in declining to afford Ingels the relief sought in his 2016 motion, in light of our previous rulings in his case that the claimed\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   error did not render his sentences void. But we possess, and here exercise, the prerogative to overrule those previous decisions and hold that, because R.C. Chapter 2971, as it provided when Ingels was sentenced, did not confer upon the trial court the authority to enhance his sentences for kidnapping as charged in counts one and three of the indictment in the case numbered B-9800321, those sentences are void and thus now subject to correction by the common pleas court under its jurisdiction to correct a void judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
