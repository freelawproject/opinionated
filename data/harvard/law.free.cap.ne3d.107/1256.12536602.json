L. c. 93A, \u00a7 4, alleging that the defendants engaged in deceptive business practices against purchasers of surplus lines insurance. The Commonwealth contended that, for years, the defendants charged their clients hidden agency fees by altering or withholding legal documents. Following a twenty-two day jury-waived trial, a judge of the Superior Court determined that defendant Andrew Crowther's active concealment of agency fees was a deceptive practice in violation of c. 93A. However, the judge found codefendant Kathleen Burke not liable. The judge ordered Crowther to \"pay damages in the nature of restitution,\" which represented \"any money Crowther received above a twenty percent commission.\" The judge also ruled that the KIA defendants were vicariously liable for Crowther's actions, on the basis of apparent authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Final judgment entered in the amount of $2,183,637.30 plus statutory interest against Crowther and the KIA defendants.

We start with a brief overview of the surplus lines insurance industry. Surplus lines insurance carriers fill a niche for higher risk clients who are unable to obtain insurance in the standard or admitted markets. In a typical surplus lines transaction, a client in need of insurance contacts a retail broker like Crowther. In turn, the retail broker speaks to one or more wholesale brokers, seeking the best bottom-line price for the client.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After checking with the surplus lines insurance carriers that provide the desired coverage, the wholesale broker provides the retail broker with a written quote, which is then relayed to the client. Ordinarily, the bottom-line premium price contained in the quote includes a commission for the brokers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the client agrees to the terms of the quote, the insurer or wholesale broker issues a \"binder\" to the retail broker, who relays that document to the insured to formalize the coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the premium owed to the insurer must be paid up front, retail brokers often offer premium financing through separate companies. Additionally, within twenty days of procurement, the wholesale broker must file a surplus lines affidavit signed by the insured, or their authorized designee, with the Division of Insurance (DOI).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 168.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Crowther's relationship with KIA\n   </em>\n   . In late 1995 or early 1996, Crowther began his affiliation with defendants Jeffrey and Cyrus Kilgore as an in-house insurance producer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specializing in surplus lines, Crowther agreed to split his compensation with their agency in exchange for, among other things, office space, supplies, and administrative services. Jeffrey and Cyrus\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   assigned several customer service representatives, including defendant Kathleen Burke, to assist him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although Crowther was the main point of contact for his clients, KIA's name -- not Crowther's -- appeared on all major insurance documents. For example, KIA billed Crowther's clients directly using the KIA invoicing system, and then paid Crowther his share. Insurance binders, surplus lines affidavits, and premium finance agreements always listed KIA as the \"producer,\" \"broker,\" or \"agency.\" Cyrus signed the affidavits and binders, and either Cyrus, Jeffrey, or Burke signed the finance agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, when Crowther communicated with his clients, he used the KIA telephone number as well as the KIA computer network, and included the KIA name in his electronic mail (e-mail) signature line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Crowther's business practices\n   </em>\n   . Crowther routinely rolled agency fees into the premiums established by the insurance carriers, and presented the augmented figure to his clients as \"the total cost.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Crowther's view, his clients were interested only in obtaining the lowest bottom-line price.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, Crowther took active steps to conceal the undisclosed agency fees from these clients. First, Crowther (or more often the customer service representatives performing clerical functions at his direction) \"whit[ed] out\" the premiums set forth on the policy declarations pages and inserted the total cost figures quoted to and accepted by his clients. Second, Crowther created invoices, outside the usual invoicing system, showing total cost instead of the true premium set by the insurer. Third, Crowther routinely signed, without authorization, the insureds' names to the surplus lines affidavits (which contained the true premiums). Fourth, Crowther either altered the premium finance agreements by removing any reference to the true premiums and agency fees, or failed to mail to the insureds the third page of the agreements containing the true premium. As the judge found after hearing the evidence, these practices occurred when there were no formal laws or regulations regarding \"fees which [could] be charged for surplus lines insurance placement, disclosure of those fees[,] or recalculation by the retail broker of the 'premium' set by the insurer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With all of this in mind, the judge found that Crowther \"deliberately kept his clients in the dark as to matters which directly impacted the cost of the clients' insurance.\" He did so, according to the judge, to deprive them of the opportunity to negotiate his compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Rulings of law\n   </em>\n   . The judge concluded that Crowther's active concealment of the agency fees, \"particularly considering the size of the agency fee in most instances,\" was a deceptive practice that violated c. 93A. The judge reasoned that Crowther's actions had the capacity to mislead his clients and prospective clients to act differently from the way they otherwise would have acted (i.e., purchasing insurance policies that they might not have purchased if they were aware of Crowther's fees). See\n   <em>\n    Purity Supreme, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Gen\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"478943\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/380/762/#p777\">\n    380 Mass. 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 777 (1980) ;\n   <em>\n    Aspinall\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Phillip Morris Cos\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183036\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/442/381/#p394\">\n    442 Mass. 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394 (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . a.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth's appeal\n   </em>\n   . i.\n   <em>\n    Twenty percent commission retention\n   </em>\n   . The Commonwealth first contends that the judge erred in fashioning the restitution remedy, and in failing to require full disgorgement of all fees acquired by the defendants. We disagree. Pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 4, as appearing in St. 1969, c. 814, \u00a7 3, a judge may \"make such ... orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore to [the injured parties] any moneys ... which may have been acquired by means of [the unlawful acts].\" This permissive language allows the courts to use their traditional equity power to tailor appropriate remedies to the facts of each case. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeCotis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314521\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/234/#p245\">\n    366 Mass. 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245 (1974).

Restitution is one recognized equitable remedy in a \u00a7 4 case. See\n   <em>\n    DeCotis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314521\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/234/#p245\">\n    366 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   244-245 ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    AmCan Enterprises, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480340\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/47/330/#p337\">\n    47 Mass. App. Ct. 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 (1999). Thus, contrary to the Commonwealth's claim, neither the language of \u00a7 4, nor anything in our case law, required the judge to select the complete disgorgement of profits as the damages remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Moreover, on the facts of this case, the judge did not abuse her broad discretion in fashioning a remedy that required the defendants to turn over all profits above a twenty percent commission. See\n   <em>\n    Demoulas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343543\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/1/#p17\">\n    433 Mass. at 17-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, the evidence showed that placing surplus lines policies is \"work-intensive\"; that the standard ten percent commission is far less than that on other lines of insurance, which rises to thirty to forty percent in some cases; that there is little rationale underlying the various sizes of these commissions; and that some surplus lines retail brokers actually do charge a twenty percent fee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under these circumstances, the restitution awarded was an appropriate remedy.

L. c. 93A is a legal, not a factual, determination\"). In declining to hold Burke liable, the judge reasoned that Burke was following the directions of her supervisor, and neither planned nor had a financial stake in his business practices. We conclude that the judge did not err as a matter of law in ruling that Burke's administrative role in Crowther's scheme did not rise to the level of unscrupulous conduct contemplated by c. 93A.

App. Ct. 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 606 (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To the extent that the Commonwealth challenges the judge's subsidiary findings, they were amply supported by Burke's testimony and the reasonable inferences that could be drawn from it.

Before Crowther's arrival, Burke did not \"work that much with surplus lines.\" As instructed by Crowther upon his arrival, Burke consistently used a \"total cost\" figure on all paperwork she generated for him for presentation to his clients. She did not question Crowther about the reasons underlying his instructions; she just followed them. In addition, Burke understood from Crowther's instructions \"to go ahead and place the insurance\" that (a) he had explained the purposes of the surplus lines affidavits to the clients; and (b) had obtained their authorization for Crowther (and his assistants) to sign them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Burke, she was not involved in establishing premiums or setting the agency fees charged to Crowther's clients. She had no substantive conversations with Crowther's clients and was not privy to what Crowther told them; and in light of her knowledge of industry customs and practices, she did not believe that she did anything illegal or deceptive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Insofar as the Commonwealth argues that the judge was required to find Burke liable on an aiding and abetting theory, the judge may reasonably have concluded that Burke did not unlawfully aid actions she did not understand to be wrong. See\n   <em>\n    Go-Best Assets Ltd\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Citizens Bank of Mass\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685741\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/50/#p64\">\n    463 Mass. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64 (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While Burke is a licensed insurance producer, the evidence reasonably could be taken to establish that she was not acting in that capacity in connection with the acts deemed c. 93A violations. In contrast to the millions reaped by Crowther and the KIA defendants, Burke received only a salary from KIA and no additional benefits. Under these circumstances we cannot say that Burke's conduct rose to the level of \"unscrupulous, coercive, or '[i]ntentionally gainful misconduct' that is characteristic of wrongdoing under G.

Indeed, the evidence demonstrates that, had Crowther's clients been privy to the agency fees that he had concealed, they may have \"act[ed] differently from the way [they] otherwise would have acted\" by seeking to negotiate his compensation\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   or purchase other insurance.\n   <em>\n    Purity Supreme, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"478943\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/380/762/#p777\">\n    380 Mass. at 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, he essentially contends that the judge's finding that he \"actively concealed\" the agency fees is clearly erroneous. To the contrary, the evidence in support of this finding is overwhelming and need not be repeated here. See\n   <em>\n    Demoulas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"117659\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/424/501/#p510\">\n    424 Mass. at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, there is no merit to Crowther's argument that the altered and withheld documents were immaterial. Indeed, as noted above, Crowther's acts of concealment were material insofar as they deprived his clients of the opportunity to negotiate or obtain cheaper insurance. See\n   <em>\n    Klairmont\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275295\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/165/#p175\">\n    465 Mass. at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, to the extent Crowther argues that there was no causal connection between his actions and any loss suffered by his clients, he cites no evidence indicating that the judge's finding to that effect was clearly erroneous. See\n   <em>\n    DiMarzo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    American Mut. Ins. Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"912958\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/389/85/#p100\">\n    389 Mass. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 100-101 (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Each of Crowther's remaining arguments are based on mischaracterizations of the judge's findings and rulings. A fair reading of the judge's decision undercuts Crowther's argument that the judge applied the wrong G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, standard \"to this [\u00a7] 11 business case.\" Notwithstanding that this case actually arose under \u00a7 4, footnote fifteen of the judge's decision (of December 3, 2013) establishes that she properly considered the sophisticated nature of Crowther's clients, and recognized the distinctions between \u00a7 11 and \u00a7 9 standards in evaluating a claimed c. 93A violation. See\n   <em>\n    Kattar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343543\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/1/#p17\">\n    433 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   14 ;\n   <em>\n    Giuffrida\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    High Country Investor, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830374\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/73/225/#p238\">\n    73 Mass. App. Ct. 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238 (2008). Next, the judge did not, as Crowther argues, \"appl[y] the wrong concept of unfairness to determine that the charging of any fee above [twenty percent] was unfair.\" The judge grounded Crowther's c. 93A liability on his\n   <em>\n    deceptive\n   </em>\n   conduct, specifically finding that Crowther's conduct was not unfair within the meaning of G.

Primarily, they contend that the Commonwealth failed to sustain its burden in establishing the elements of apparent authority. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   By way of procedural background, on May 10, 2012, the judge issued an order bifurcating the trial. For the sake of efficiency, the issue whether Crowther and Burke violated c. 93A was to be tried first, followed by a second trial on the KIA defendants' vicarious liability \"if necessary.\" However, in her December 3, 2013, order for partial judgment after the first phase of trial, the judge stated that she was \"inclined to find from the evidence presented thus far, an agency relationship, based on apparent authority, as between Crowther and the Kilgore defendants.\" Thereafter, the judge ordered briefing on whether the Commonwealth had established a prima facie case of apparent authority. Post-briefing, she concluded that it had, and ordered the KIA defendants to submit an offer of proof rebutting the Commonwealth's evidence and demonstrating a question of material fact. Following the offer, she asked the Commonwealth to renew its motion for summary judgment, which she then allowed in a comprehensive memorandum and order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We review a grant of summary judgment de novo to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    RDI Logistics, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462661\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/95/#p99\">\n    476 Mass. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (2016).

Initially, the Commonwealth's proffer was sufficient to establish the elements of apparent authority. As to the KIA defendants' \"manifestation\" of apparent authority, the evidence shows, inter alia, that they billed all of Crowther's clients directly using the KIA invoicing system. In addition, the KIA name was also listed as some variation of \"producer\" in all binders, surplus lines affidavits, and premium finance agreements. For these reasons, as well as those stated in the judge's memorandum and order allowing the Commonwealth's renewed motion for summary judgment, such communication was enough to satisfy the manifestation requirement in the present case.
