Moton guilty of aggravated murder, murder, felonious assault, and having a weapon while under disability (along with associated firearm specifications) for shooting the victim as the victim sat in his car. The issues on appeal argue that the court violated Moton's right to a public trial by limiting the number of people who could attend trial; that the convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were otherwise against the\n   manifest and weight of the evidence; and that the court improperly admitted hearsay evidence. We find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In the second and third assignments of error, Moton complains that the state failed to prove the aggravated murder charge contained in Count 1; the felony murder charge in Count 2; the felonious assault charge in Count 3; the weapons while under disability charge in Count 4, and the firearm specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The state charged Moton with aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(A). That section states that no person shall purposely, with prior calculation and design, cause the death of another. Moton argues that the state failed to prove that he acted with prior calculation and design because there was no evidence that the shooting was a planned act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} We determine whether a conviction is supported by sufficient evidence by viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The victim had been shot twice in the head from no more than 18 inches away. He was holding a cell phone. The victim's cell phone contained contact information for a person named \"Floyd.\" On the day the murder occurred, the victim called Floyd's phone five times; two of those were missed calls occurring at 6:25 p.m. and 6:29 p.m. At around 6:40 p.m., witnesses saw vehicles belonging to both Moton and the victim in the parking lot. One witness testified that she heard shouting and then saw a man open the victim's car. She watched the man's hands recoil and then heard gunshots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Witnesses said that the shooter drove a truck or pickup truck. Surveillance video taken from the time of the shooting enabled the police to identify the make and model of the truck. Bureau of Motor Vehicles records showed that Moton had very recently registered a truck matching the description of the vehicle used by the shooter. The police recovered Moton's DNA from the door handle of the victim's car. Surveillance cameras captured the truck circling the area just prior to when the murder occurred. The truck could not be located after the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} An examination of the victim's cell phone showed that he received telephone calls from a person named \"Floyd.\" The calls were made with a cell phone using a prepaid data plan that could not be traced to the owner. The police were, however, able to obtain a log of the calls made from\n   the \"Floyd\" phone and determined that seven calls were made from that phone to the victim's phone. After the murder, no more calls were made from the \"Floyd\" phone nor could the phone be recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} For purposes of the prior calculation and design test, it appears that Moton and the victim knew each other as evidenced by the phone records. In addition, the records of phone calls made just prior to the murder create the inference that Moton planned to meet the victim; indeed, surveillance footage showed that he drove around the area where the murder occurred as though waiting for the victim to arrive. The court could find that Moton contemplated the use of force by bringing a firearm to the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} It was unclear whether the murder was drawn out or an instantaneous eruption of events: the witnesses only heard shouting and saw the shooting, so there was no additional context. Nevertheless, in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court stated that \"[s]hooting a person execution-style may also establish, at least in part, prior calculation and design.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280945\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/150/409/\">\n    150 Ohio St.3d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280945\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/150/409/\">\n    2016-Ohio-8295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20N.E.3d%201124\">\n    82 N.E.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 21. When announcing its verdict, the court stated, \"for a finder of fact I think [the murder] can only be seen as one thing. It was an execution. It was clear to me that there was prior calculation and design.\" This was a rational conclusion given that Moton knew the victim, used an untraceable cell phone when calling the victim, appeared to preplan a meeting with the victim, was armed when he met the victim in the parking lot, and then shot the victim execution-style from only inches away. The shooting occurred so quickly that the victim did not even appear to have time to defend himself. These facts gave rise to the inference that Moton executed the victim, thus establishing that he acted with prior calculation and design. And the same facts also prove that he possessed an operable firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Having found the conviction for aggravated murder to be supported by legally sufficient evidence, we need not consider Moton's arguments in his third assignment of error that the murder and felonious assault counts were also unsupported by legally sufficient evidence. The court determined that the murder and felonious assault counts were allied offense of similar import under R.C. 2941.25(A). The state elected to have Moton sentenced on the aggravated murder count; the murder and felonious assault counts were merged for sentencing. Error, if any, with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the finding of guilt for murder and felonious assault would be harmless.\n   <em>\n    State v.

That offense prohibits a person from using or carrying a firearm if, among other things, the person has been convicted of trafficking in any drug of abuse. Moton stipulated to a prior conviction for drug trafficking, and the evidence supporting the aggravated murder count proved that he possessed a weapon.\n   <em>\n    State v. Knowles\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 16AP-345,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-8540\">\n    2016-Ohio-8540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207493652\">\n    2016 WL 7493652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B. Manifest Weight of Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In the fourth assignment of error, Moton complains that the court's verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence. He argues that no witness identified him as the shooter, that the witnesses gave conflicting testimony when describing the truck used by the shooter, and that he could not be linked to the murder weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The manifest weight of the evidence standard requires the reviewing court to examine the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n   <em>\n    State v. Otten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6711870\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/33/339/#p340\">\n    33 Ohio App.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20N.E.2d%201009\">\n    515 N.E.2d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Dist.1986). This is a difficult burden for an appellant to overcome because the trier of fact has the sole responsibility to resolve factual issues.\n   <em>\n    State v. DeHass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1788172\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/10/230/\">\n    10 Ohio St.2d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=227%20N.E.2d%20212\">\n    227 N.E.2d 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), paragraph one of the syllabus. Because the standard of review uses the word \"manifest,\" it means that we can only reverse the trier of fact if its decision is very plainly or obviously contrary to the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} When issuing its verdict, the court said, \"I will say this: I don't know that I've ever had a case with such consistent witness testimony. The witnesses were very consistent.\" Indeed, the case came together rather easily for the state. With evidence that Moton's truck and cell phone appeared to disappear following the murder, the court could infer that Moton bought and used them specifically to facilitate the murder. Not only was Moton in communication with the victim just prior to the murder, he was placed at the scene of the crime because his DNA was found on the victim's car. Moton argued that his DNA likely found its way on the door handle because he worked at a car wash where the victim's car had been cleaned. The court rejected this theory, noting that Moton offered no proof that he actually worked at the car wash. In addition, the court thought it unlikely that Moton's fingerprints would have survived the car wash itself (as argued by Moton), and noted that Moton contradicted his own argument by claiming at trial that rain occurring near the time of the shooting would have compromised the DNA evidence found on the door handle. In any event, the DNA evidence was compelling: a forensic analyst testified and described the DNA match as \"beautiful.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} It is true that witnesses gave varying descriptions of the vehicle used by the shooter. The state's case, however, did not depend on descriptions of the truck itself. The DNA evidence placed Moton at the scene of the crime. Phone records showed that the victim had been in contact with a person called \"Floyd\" shortly before the murder. Records from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles confirmed that Moton had very recently registered a truck that matched a description given by one witness to the shooting, surveillance footage showed that same type of truck had been seen circling the area shortly before the murder occurred. This evidence made discrepancies in witness descriptions of the vehicle largely immaterial. The court did not lose its way by finding Moton guilty of aggravated murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II. Public Trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} During the cross-examination of the second state witness, the court stopped testimony to ask a spectator \"what case are you here for?\" When the spectator told the court it was for the \"Moton case,\" the court told the spectator to \"step\n   out.\" The court then identified a man and woman in the courtroom and likewise asked them what they were there for-they, too, replied, \"the Moton case.\" The court said, \"I asked the State to limit it to three people and there's no in and out when I'm in session. Please step outside. I would appreciate it if you tell these people that I am going to keep doing this, and if I have to keep doing it, there's going to be a problem.\" Moton complains that the court's actions violated his right to a public trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \"The right to a public trial is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial judge may not have known if the people entering the courtroom were witnesses who could be subject to a separation of witnesses. This case was tried to the court, so the constant monitoring of people entering the courtroom in the middle of witness testimony would have been particularly distracting. It was likely for this reason that the trial judge told the state that \"I would appreciate it if you tell these people that I am going to keep doing this, and if I have to keep doing it, there's going to be a problem.\" This comment indicated that the trial judge was not excluding the public from the courtroom, but only asking these persons to refrain from entering and exiting the courtroom so that the trial judge could maintain control over the courtroom. This was a reasonable course of action and well within the trial judge's discretion: \"the right to a public trial is not absolute and an order barring spectators from observing a portion of an otherwise public trial does not necessarily introduce error of constitutional dimension.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state argues that Moton waived his right to a public trial by not objecting to the closure of the courtroom.

In that case, the trial court decided to close the proceedings for the rest of the day to all members of the public except the media following a few disruptive incidents. The appellant objected, but the trial court overruled the objection. The next day, the trial court, again, ordered that the courtroom be cleared of all spectators except the media. This time, however, the appellant did not object. On review, the Ohio Supreme Court noted that \"[t]he violation of the right to a public trial is considered structural error and not subject to harmless-error analysis\" and found that the closure on the former day was appropriate under the\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50, citing\n   <em>\n    Waller.\n   </em>\n   As to the latter day of trial, however, and despite its earlier statements concerning structural error, the court declined to review the closure,\n   finding that the appellant had waived his right to a public trial. Specifically, the court noted that \"the defense did not object to the trial court's action. Defense counsel were present during the entire proceedings and were fully aware of the exclusion of the spectators from the courtroom. Thus, counsel's failure to object to the closing of the courtroom constitutes a waiver of the right to a public trial[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 43}\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Drummond\n   </em>\n   have rendered confusion in Ohio appellate courts, who seemingly have felt the need to adopt one case's holding over the other based on their contrary approaches to a defendant's failure to object. Some, including the Second, Ninth, and Tenth districts, continue to follow\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   , holding that the defendant's failure to object to the closure of the courtroom does not waive the issue on appeal.

In other words, the failure to renew an objection to the closure is proof that a defendant consented to the closure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 26014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5873\">\n    2012-Ohio-5873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206206843\">\n    2012 WL 6206843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7. In\n   that light,\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   is still good law and stands for the proposition that a defendant's silence is not evidence that a defendant consents to or waives the issue of closure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Nevertheless, this court's previous holding in\n   <em>\n    Bolan\n   </em>\n   must still be addressed. I would find that our reference to\n   <em>\n    Drummond\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Bolan\n   </em>\n   was merely dicta, because the facts in that case clearly showed that the appellant not only did not object during the proceedings but affirmatively waived his right during one witness's testimony and actually requested that the courtroom be closed during another witness's testimony. Specifically, we noted, \"With respect to Olgetree, defense counsel consented to the closure and acknowledged that Bolan waived any prejudice by the courtroom being emptied at the time Ogletree testified. With Smiley, defense counsel requested that the courtroom be closed during his testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bolan\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65. Hence, our observation that \"the defense did not object to the closure\" and citation to\n   <em>\n    Drummond\n   </em>\n   was unnecessary because defendants are permitted to waive their right to a public trial. Further,\n   <em>\n    Bolan\n   </em>\n   did not implicate\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   because, like the appellant in\n   <em>\n    Drummond\n   </em>\n   , the appellant was anything but silent on the issue of closure, actively waiving the issue for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 47} In this case, Moton did not object or make any statements in regard to the closure. In other words, he was completely silent. In light of the above discussion, I would therefore find both\n   <em>\n    Drummond\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bolan\n   </em>\n   to be distinguishable and\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   to be controlling, and in accord with\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   , I would reject the state's argument and find that Moton's failure to object to the trial court's order did not waive his right to a public trial and the issue is properly before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The record demonstrates that the trial court violated Moton's right to a public trial during the cross-examination of Officer Saffo. During that testimony, an unidentified individual entered the courtroom, and the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   COURT: Excuse me. What case are you here for?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   SPECTATOR: The Moton case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   COURT: Step out. Lady in the hat and the man in the back, what case are you here for?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   SPECTATOR: This one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   COURT: Okay. I asked the State to limit it to three people and there's no in and out when I'm in session. Please step outside. I would appreciate it if you tell these people that I am going to keep doing this, and if I have to keep doing it, there's going to be a problem. Go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 49} In support of its holding that Moton's right to a public trial was not violated, the majority states, \"The limited record of the proceedings provides no basis for finding that the trial judge's actions implicated the primary protections conferred by the right to a public trial.\" The majority supports that conclusion by arguing that (1) the trial judge was merely controlling her courtroom and not required to make the necessary findings under\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   , (2) the ordering of three spectators was not a \"closure,\" and, (3) even if Moton's right to a public trial were implicated, the triviality standard would apply and result in no error. I disagree with all of these points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 50} First, it is my view that the trial court's order removing the spectators without making any findings, even if to control its courtroom, is contrary to\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/\">\n    467 U.S. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In other words, even if the trial court had stated on the record that it was closing the courtroom to prevent disruption, nothing in the record shows that the \"lady in the hat and the man in the back\" entered during the testimony or caused any type of disruption.

In both of those cases, it was clear that the short, inadvertent courtroom closure and the removal of a disruptive spectator did not impede the values served by the Sixth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 62} The Second Circuit, however, reached a different conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Gupta.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   There, \"despite not making any\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   findings, the district court intentionally excluded the public from the courtroom for the entirety of\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 687. The court held that \"a trial court's intentional, unjustified closure of a courtroom during the entirety of\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   cannot be deemed 'trivial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 689. The court reiterated the importance of the right to a public trial and found that to classify such closure as trivial \"would eviscerate [that] right entirely.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Here, the trial court's closure was not inadvertent, there is no evidence showing how long the closure occurred, how many spectators (beyond the three removed) were affected, whether the removed spectators (and possibly others) were ever allowed back inside the courtroom, and there is no evidence that any of the removed spectators were disruptive. In fact, like\n   <em>\n    Gupta\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's actions here, as demonstrated by the record, and particularly in relation to the \"lady in the hat and the man in the back,\" were entirely unjustified. Therefore, it is my view that the majority's reliance on the triviality standard is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 64} In sum, allowing a trial judge to close the courtroom without setting forth the necessary findings as required by\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/\">\n    467 U.S. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193857\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/39/\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , sets forth a dangerous precedent. It would allow a trial judge to eviscerate a defendant's constitutional right to a public trial by not explaining themselves and calling it \"courtroom control.\" There would be no way of telling whether a trial court's \"courtroom control\" was an abuse of discretion and violation of a defendant's constitutional right to a public trial because trial judges would no longer be required to set forth the required findings on the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Presley v.

This is not what\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   requires, and departing from clearly established Supreme Court precedent does nothing to assist in the furtherance of justice and the protection of constitutional rights. Instead, it robs Moton of his constitutional right to a public trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 65} When a trial court improperly closes its proceedings during trial in violation of a defendant's right to a public trial, an appellate court must remand the case for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 94141 and 94142,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-817\">\n    2011-Ohio-817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 27 ;\n   <em>\n    Dubose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3832316\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/174/637/\">\n    174 Ohio App.3d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-7217\">\n    2007-Ohio-7217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=884%20N.E.2d%2075\">\n    884 N.E.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 123 ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"220282\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/142/268/#p271\">\n    142 Ohio App.3d 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=755%20N.E.2d%20422\">\n    755 N.E.2d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Dist.2001) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, I believe we have no choice but to reverse and remand the case for a new trial. In light of that holding, I would find that Moton's fourth assignment of error challenging the manifest weight of the evidence and his fifth assignment of error regarding hearsay are moot. But because a sufficiency challenge is never moot, I concur in judgment only with respect to the majority's opinion regarding Moton's second and third assignments of error.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
