(\"mother\") and C.J.

For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This case involves FCCS's request for permanent custody of K.J., born July 21, 2010; L.J., born January 3, 2012; and M.J., born June 6, 2013. On January 12, 2015, FCCS filed a complaint alleging the children to be neglected and dependent minors. At that date, K.J. was four years old, L.J. was three years old, and M.J. was one year old. FCCS filed the neglect and dependency actions after receiving information that father was physically abusive to mother in the presence of the children, mother \"whoops\" the children very hard, K.J. was burned by a cigarette, father and mother were possibly using heroin, the family was being evicted from their home, the children wear clothes that are dirty and do not fit, the floor of the home is covered in both dog and human feces, the parents do not seek medical treatment for the children, the children were allowed to play near the open oven being used to heat the home, and the home is infested with roaches and fruit flies. Initially, FCCS placed the children with relatives in an out-of-home safety plan. During this time, mother and father were scheduled to complete drug screens but failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 12, 2015, the relatives informed FCCS they could no longer care for the children. That same day, the trial court granted an emergency care order placing the children into the temporary emergency custody of FCCS. The next day, January 13, 2015, the trial court issued an order returning the children to the care of mother and father with a protective supervision order. As part of the protective supervision order, the trial court ordered parents not to use physical discipline with the children, to cooperate with random drug screens and assessments, and to cooperate with the caseworker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Less than one month later, on February 6, 2015, the trial court awarded temporary custody of the children back to FCCS after the parents tested positive for heroin and the parents lacked income, police came to the home and discovered unsanitary and unsafe conditions, and father failed to provide any care to the children at all. On February 25, 2015, the trial court adjudicated the children dependent and awarded temporary custody to FCCS. Subsequently, the trial court extended temporary custody on January 11, 2016 and again on August 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 15, 2016, FCCS filed a motion for permanent court commitment (\"PCC\"), also known as permanent custody, of the children. Initially, the trial court scheduled the PCC hearing for December 16, 2016. However, the trial court granted mother's motion to schedule a pretrial conference March 1, 2017. Neither mother nor father attended the March 1, 2017 pretrial conference. Counsel for mother stated mother \"may be in an emergency room.\" (Mar. 1, 2017 Tr. at 5.) During the pretrial conference, the trial court discussed scheduling the final trial date. Counsel for FCCS indicated she would be out on family leave in July and August. The trial court scheduled the final trial date for June 5 and 6, 2017. Additionally, the trial court scheduled a second pretrial conference for April 26, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the April 26, 2017 pretrial conference, the trial court conducted an in camera interview with K.J. Once again, neither mother nor father attended the pretrial\n   conference. Counsel for mother stated that while he was not certain of the reason for mother's absence, he \"heard that she is with her sick mother at the hospital.\" (Apr. 26, 2017 Tr. at 29.) Counsel for father stated father may be in Florida. The trial court reminded the parties of the June 5 and 6, 2017 trial date, and counsel for FCCS stated she intended to only present the FCCS caseworker and the guardian ad litem for the children as witnesses, and she stated she would call the parents to testify if they appeared for trial. Counsel for FCCS specifically noted on the record her concern that the parents would not show up for the PCC hearing based on mother's and father's failures to attend prior hearing dates or to make progress on their case plan requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 5, 2017, the trial court conducted the scheduled hearing on FCCS's motion for permanent custody. At the beginning of the hearing, counsel for both mother and father made oral motions to continue the case because neither mother nor father was present. Counsel for mother stated mother may have suddenly become ill and could not attend. Meanwhile, counsel for father stated that counsel learned from FCCS's counsel that same morning that father had been arrested on a minor theft charge in South Carolina and was currently incarcerated pending the resolution of that charge. Father's counsel presented the court with a printout from the webpage for Horry County, South Carolina stating father was arrested by the Myrtle Beach Police Department on June 2, 2017. Counsel for FCCS, the guardian ad litem, and counsel for K.J. all objected to the continuance requests. The trial court overruled the continuance requests and proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the PCC hearing, FCCS presented the testimony of three witnesses: Sarah Terstage, a child welfare caseworker for FCCS; Wanda Ganjehsani, the children's guardian ad litem; and Joyce Sanders, a case manager for Ohio Guidestone who provided substance abuse and other counseling to mother. After the testimony of the witnesses and the submission of FCCS's exhibits, the court issued a written decision on June 12, 2017 granting FCCS's petition for permanent custody. The trial court considered the factors in R.C. 2151.414(D) and determined there was clear and convincing evidence that it was in the children's best interest to grant the motion for permanent custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mother and father both timely appeal. This court sua sponte consolidated the cases for purposes of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mother assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [1.] The trial court did abuse its discretion when it denied Appellant's motion for continuance and granted the Franklin County Children Services Motion for Permanent Custody of the minor children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, father assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [1.] The lower court violated Father-Appellant's right to Due Process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and his right to Due Course of Law under Article I, Sections 1 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution when it failed to ensure the presence at trial of Father-Appellant who at the time was incarcerated and/or when it failed to make alternative arrangements for his participation in the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [2.] The lower court erred when it denied Father-Appellant's continuance request which undermined his right to be present and/or participate at the parental rights termination trial in violation of\n   the Due Process Clauses of Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, the Due Course of Law Clauses of Article I, Sections 1 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution and Juv.R. 23.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Mother's First Assignment of Error and Father's First and Second Assignments of Error-Request for a Continuance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mother's sole assignment of error and father's two assignments of error are interrelated and we address them jointly. In her first assignment of error, mother argues the trial court erred when it denied her motion for continuance at the start of the permanent custody hearing. In his first assignment of error, father argues the trial court violated his due process rights when it failed to ensure his presence at the permanent custody hearing. In his second assignment of error, father argues the trial court erred when it denied his request for a continuance at the start of the permanent custody hearing. Taken together, these assignments of error assert the trial court erred when it denied the continuance requests and proceeded to the permanent custody hearing when mother and father were not present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Parents have a constitutionally-protected fundamental interest in the care, custody, and management of their children.\"\n   <em>\n    In re H.D.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

Mother's Request for a Continuance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mother failed to appear the day of trial and her counsel orally moved for a continuance. Loc.R. 2 of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Division of Domestic Relations, Juvenile Branch provides that a trial court will not grant a continuance the day of trial without a showing of good cause. Counsel for mother stated mother had tried to come to the hearing but had a \"medical emergency\" and had to call an ambulance. (June 5, 2017 Tr. at 4-5.) However, counsel for mother stated that he was unable to track down the ambulance and did not know whether mother actually went to a hospital or, if so, to what hospital she went. Counsel stated he was unsure how long of a continuance he was requesting because he did not know the extent of the medical emergency, but he asked for \"a couple weeks\" for mother's condition to improve. (June 5, 2017 Tr. at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In objecting to mother's request for a continuance, counsel for FCCS noted mother's history throughout the case of failing to appear for scheduled hearings under the stated reason of a \"medical emergency\" only for the parties to discover upon investigation that mother was not actually in the hospital on those occasions. (June 5, 2017 Tr. at 7-8.) Counsel for FCCS stated she made a point at the last pretrial conference before the PCC hearing to note on the record her concern that mother would not show up for the final hearing. Additionally, counsel for FCCS noted the testimony at the hearing would indicate that mother makes frequent trips to different medical providers related to her substance abuse issues. The FCCS caseworker testified mother had been to the emergency room 25 times between August 2014 and August 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Considering all the circumstances surrounding mother's request for a continuance, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying her oral motion for continuance on the day of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Though counsel for mother requested an unspecified delay so that mother could be present, mother had a history of failing to attend hearings at the last minute. The trial court initially scheduled the PCC hearing for December 16, 2016 but ultimately rescheduled the hearing for June 5, 2017 to allow for ample pretrial hearings and preparation. Still, the PCC hearing on June 5, 2017 marked the third consecutive hearing date for which mother knew of the hearing and yet failed to attend.
