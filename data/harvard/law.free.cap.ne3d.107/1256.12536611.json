We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . On July 9, 2016, the Lincoln police department cited the defendant for traveling seventy-four miles per hour in a forty-five mile per hour speed zone, in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 17. The defendant filed an appeal from that civil motor vehicle infraction, which, after a hearing before a clerk-magistrate, resulted in a finding of responsible. After exercising his right under G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 3(A)(4), to a de novo hearing before a justice of the District Court, the defendant was again found responsible. The defendant then appealed to the Appellate Division, which on March 2, 2017, issued (and sent to the defendant) a notice informing him that his appeal has been received and that his brief was due by March 16, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On March 15, 2017, the defendant filed a motion for enlargement of time to file his brief bearing the case caption \"Lincoln Pig Department v. Richard Maximus Strahan and the People of Amerika.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Appellate Division entered (and sent to the defendant) an order on March 22, 2017, in which it declined to act on the motion because it could not \"take any action on a motion that does not properly state the parties that have an action before this [Appellate] Division.\" The Appellate Division ordered the defendant to file a revised motion \"with a proper caption\" on or before March 29, 2017, and warned that the failure to do so would result in the dismissal of the appeal. On April 25, 2017, after the defendant failed to file a revised motion or an appellate brief, the Appellate Division dismissed the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . All papers filed with the Appellate Division of the District Court are required to contain a caption bearing the name of the case to which the papers pertain. Rule 20(b) of the Dist./Mun. Cts. Rules for Appellate Division Appeal (1994). A court has the inherent authority to dismiss an action that is not prosecuted diligently.\n   <em>\n    Maciuca\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Papit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4005620\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/31/540/#p544\">\n    31 Mass. App. Ct. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544 (1991) (\n   <em>\n    Maciuca\n   </em>\n   ). \"A litigant's inability to adhere to procedural rules, moreover, frequently and without violation of due process rights results in the denial of motions and dismissals of appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence Sav.

App. Ct. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164 (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Here, the Appellate Division did not err in declining to act on a motion that did not comply with Rule 20(b) of the Dist./Mun. Cts. Rules for Appellate Division Appeal. When, despite the Appellate Division's warning, see\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Globe Newspaper Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022974\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/38/923/#p924\">\n    38 Mass.
