The issues before this court are whether, for the purposes of applying the statute of limitations, postconviction proceedings constitute civil actions; whether a trial court errs by sua sponte ruling on a counterclaim challenging the\n   constitutionality of a statute when granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff where the statute's constitutionality would have constituted a defense to the plaintiff's claim; and whether a trial court may consider a party's postconviction filings to support a determination that he is a vexatious litigator. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 29, 2016, Dennis Watkins, the Trumbull County Prosecuting Attorney, filed a Complaint to Designate Defendant as Vexatious Litigator against Alfonsia Perry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 20, 2016, Perry filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint pursuant to Civil Rule 12(B)(6), based on the statute of limitations and the claim that the \"litigation identified in the complaint to declare the Defendant a vexatious litigator is not reviewable by the plain language of the statute.\" Watkins responded on December 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On January 5, 2017, the trial court denied Perry's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On January 31, 2017, Watkins filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On February 13, 2017, Perry, with leave of court, filed an Answer and Counterclaim. In the counterclaim, Perry asserted that the Ohio Vexatious Litigator Statute, as amended by Senate Bill 168, is unconstitutional. Watkins replied to the counterclaim on February 22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On February 24, 2017, Perry filed his Opposition against the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On March 14, 2017, the trial court granted summary judgment in Watkins' favor, determining that it was \"abundantly clear\" that \"Defendant exceeds any and all definitions of a vexatious litigator.\" The court summarized the litigation underlying its decision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant was indicted by the January 1994 Term of the Trumbull County Grand Jury on one count of Aggravated Murder pursuant to R.C. 2903.01, for the beating death of his live-in girlfriend, Jeanette Purdue, in Case Number 1994-CR-0042.

In contrast to the\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   cases, there was a motion for summary judgment filed in the present case. In that motion, the constitutionality of R.C. 2323.52 was asserted. If the constitutional infirmity of the statute precluded the entry of judgment in Watkins' favor, it was necessary for Perry to raise such arguments before the trial court. Perry had the opportunity and the obligation to present his arguments regarding the statute's constitutionality in his Opposition to Watkins' Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Perry counters that Watkins' Motion was filed prior to the filing of his Counterclaim raising the issue of the statute's constitutionality and, therefore, \"the short statement [asserting the statute's constitutionality] could not have challenged the counter claim since it did not exist when Watkins filed his motion for summary\n   judgment.\" Appellant's brief at 8. Regardless of whether Perry's Counterclaim had been filed, the constitutionality issue was before the court by virtue of Watkins' Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Perry further indicates that the basis of his constitutional challenge is unrelated to the claim that he is a vexatious litigator. Perry's constitutional challenge focuses on division (G) of the statute which provides that \"no appeal by the person who [has been declared a vexatious litigator] shall lie from a decision of the court of common pleas or court of appeals * * * that denies that person leave for the institution or continuance of, or the making of an application in, legal proceedings in the court of claims or in a court of appeals, court of common pleas, municipal court, or county court.\" R.C. 2323.52(G). The Counterclaim maintains that division (G) \"is unconstitutional as written when applied to an appeal of right from a criminal case and civil action subsequent to a final order being issued by an inferior court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In the context of the present case, however, Perry has no standing to raise such an argument in that he has not been denied the right to appeal the determination that he is a vexatious litigator. It is well established that \"[a] party has standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute only insofar as it has an adverse impact on his own rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Cty.

While conceding that postconviction proceedings may constitute collateral civil attacks on a criminal conviction, Perry maintains they do not constitute civil actions so as to come under the censure of the statute: \"the trial court was not permitted to convert any collateral 'civil' attack motion/petition and appeal from a final order in [Perry's] criminal case as a civil action to label or declare Perry a vexatious litigator.\" Appellant's brief at 12-13. Perry misconstrues the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Perry may be found a \"vexatious litigator\" if it is shown that he has \"habitually, persistently, and without reasonable grounds engaged in vexatious conduct in a civil action or actions * * *.\" R.C. 2323.52(A)(3). The sort of \"conduct\" which may support a vexatious litigator determination is not limited to the filing of a civil action, but encompasses \"the assertion of a claim, defense, or other position in connection with a civil action, the filing of a pleading, motion, or other paper in a civil action, including, but not limited to, a motion or paper filed for discovery purposes, or the taking of any other action in connection with a civil action.\" R.C. 2323.51(A)(1)(a). As demonstrated under the first assignment of error, a postconviction proceeding does constitute a civil action, although not initiated by the filing of a complaint pursuant to Civil Rule 3(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watkins v.
