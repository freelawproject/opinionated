L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 48 - 55 (reform act), inserted by St. 2011, c. 124, \u00a7 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ricard contends that the trial judge committed error in awarding Deborah Dutton (Ricard's former wife) alimony beyond the presumptive durational limit established by the reform act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n   . Ricard and Dutton were married on October 12, 1986, and were divorced,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   by a judgment nisi, on March 5, 2003. The divorce judgment incorporated the parties' separation agreement; however, provisions regarding alimony were \"merged in the [divorce] judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In October, 2015, Ricard filed a complaint seeking the termination of his alimony obligation based on the running of the durational limit established by G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 49. Pursuant to \u00a7 49(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   )(4), for marriages lasting between fifteen and twenty years,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   as was the case here, \"general term alimony shall continue for not longer than 80 per cent of the number of months of the marriage.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the statutory durational limit for spousal alimony was just over 155 months or February, 2016. The parties submitted a joint stipulation of uncontested facts and were the only trial witnesses. Following the trial, the judge made written findings of fact. The judge expressly found that Dutton was unable to provide sufficiently for her own support, due largely to her serious \"pre-existing medical situation and disability,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   a grave circumstance warranting deviation from the presumptive durational limits in the interests of justice. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53(\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   )(1) &amp; (8). The judge found that Dutton suffers from a congenital spinal defect that \"continues to substantially hamper her ability to provide for her own needs,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Dutton lives on a meager income, comprised of modest disability benefits and occasional aid from family, which often left Dutton unable to pay for medical treatment or medication. In short, the judge determined that Dutton had to make do under strained financial circumstances. On the other hand, the judge concluded that Ricard failed to meet his burden of establishing an inability to pay alimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the end, the judge determined that Dutton met her burden of demonstrating an ongoing need for alimony, and that the interests of justice warranted a deviation from the presumptive statutory durational limit. For the reasons cited, the judge denied Ricard's request to modify or terminate alimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   . We review a judge's denial of a party's request for modification of alimony for an abuse of discretion.

App. Ct. 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 773 (2014). A complaint for modification of alimony is governed by the reform act, which \"changed neither the essential purpose nor the basic definition of alimony: 'the payment of support from a spouse, who has the ability to pay, to a spouse in need of support.' \"\n   <em>\n    Van Arsdale\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Van Arsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451899\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/218/#p219\">\n    477 Mass. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 (2017) (\n   <em>\n    Van Arsdale\n   </em>\n   ), quoting from G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 48. The reform act did bring about certain changes to the Commonwealth's alimony laws, notably, the \"creation of durational limits-or presumptive termination dates-for alimony obligations arising from marriages lasting fewer than twenty years.\"\n   <em>\n    Van Arsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451899\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/218/#p219\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451899\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/218/#p219\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The presumption that alimony must terminate after a stated period of time \"may be overcome, however, by showing that the payment of alimony beyond the relevant durational limit is 'required in the interests of justice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   ., quoting from G.

The fundamental purpose of alimony has remained constant despite the provisions of the reform act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Awards predating the enactment of the reform act may be modified by a judge, in amount and duration, based upon a party's showing of a material change in circumstances but \"for not longer than 80 per cent of the number of months of the marriage\" if the duration of the marriage is, as here, between fifteen and twenty years. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 49(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   )(4).

A judge may, however, deviate beyond these termination dates if the judge's written findings establish that doing so is warranted in the interests of justice. \"The recipient spouse bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that deviation beyond the presumptive termination date is 'required in the interests of justice.'

The judge essentially found that Dutton's \"chronic illness[ ] or unusual health circumstances\" warranted the deviation.
