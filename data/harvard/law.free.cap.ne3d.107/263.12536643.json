Levin, Jean Conde, and Kathleen N. Griffin's motion to dismiss pursuant to sections 2-615 and 2-619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) ( 735 ILCS 5/2-615, 2-619 (West 2014) ), dismissing with prejudice Robert's lawsuit alleging legal malpractice against defendants, who served as his legal counsel during the dissolution of his marriage against Julie Tebbens. In that malpractice action, Robert claimed that his former counsel failed to submit to the trial court a marital settlement agreement (MSA) that accurately reflected the parties' intent regarding the division of Robert's pension plan between himself and Julie. On appeal, Robert contends that the trial court erred in finding his claims were barred by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Robert filed his complaint against defendants in October 2014. By this complaint, Robert asserted claims for legal malpractice and breach of contract against all defendants (the malpractice case). Thereafter, the malpractice case was stayed due to Robert's pending appeal in his underlying dissolution of marriage proceeding (the divorce case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Meanwhile, the underlying divorce case was appealed to this court.\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Tebbens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20140566-U\">\n    2015 IL App (1st) 140566-U\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201774393\">\n    2015 WL 1774393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our decision in that cause fully lays out the facts, which we recite here in relevant part. Robert and Julie were married in 1995 and filed for dissolution of marriage in 2009. Both parties were represented by counsel during dissolution proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 In brief, the trial court entered a judgment for dissolution of marriage in October 2012, incorporating a MSA into the judgment for dissolution. In part, the MSA divided the parties' retirement accounts and pension plans. Thereafter, the pension administrator requested an order that reflected a specific dollar amount for Julie's distribution, rather than the percentage formula that was set out in the MSA. By this time, Robert was represented by new counsel. Eventually, the trial court modified the MSA over Robert's objection. Robert appealed this modification, and on appeal, this court enforced the MSA language upon which the parties had originally agreed, holding that Robert was entitled to the entry of an order clarifying the dollar value of Julie's share of the pension as Robert had originally requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 In more detail, specific to the divorce appeal, Robert challenged the trial court's entry of a Qualified Illinois Domestic Relations Order (QILDRO) by the circuit court, which apparently divided the pension percentage-wise in such a way that Julie took more than the parties had agreed upon. In April 2015, we reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded with directions. In that cause, we recited the following facts, which are pertinent to the present appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"In December 2009, Robert initiated the instant dissolution proceedings. The trial court entered a judgment for dissolution of marriage on October 31, 2012. Both parties were represented by counsel during dissolution proceedings. A marital settlement agreement (MSA) was incorporated into the judgment for dissolution. Amongst other things, the MSA divided the parties' retirement accounts and pension plans:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Regarding Robert's pension from the Chicago Fire Department, the MSA provides:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   '7.5 ROBERT's interest in the Fireman's Annuity Fund shall be allocated between the parties as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   a. To JULIE, a sum equal to fifty percent (50%) of the marital value of ROBERT's vested accrued benefit under the Fireman's Annuity Fund.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   b. To ROBERT, the remaining balance of his vested accrued benefit under the Fireman's Annuity Fund including all sums not otherwise allocated to the Wife, and all contributions on or after November 1, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The foregoing allocations to JULIE shall be implemented pursuant to the terms of a Qualified Illinois Domestic Relations Order (QILDRO).'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Other retirement accounts were also divided:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In November 2012, Robert filed a 'motion to amend, or in the alternative, to vacate judgment for dissolution of marriage.' Through this motion, Robert argued, in pertinent part, that paragraph 7.5 should be amended, as it did not conform to the parties' true agreement. Specifically, Robert alleged the paragraph as submitted during negotiations read:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   '[Draft] 7.5 ROBERT's interest in the Fireman's Annuity Fund shall be allocated between the parties as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   a. To JULIE, a sum equal to fifty percent (50%) of the marital value of ROBERT's vested accrued benefit under the Fireman's Annuity Fund, valued as of __________, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   b. To ROBERT, the remaining balance of his vested accrued benefit under the Fireman's Annuity Fund including all sums not otherwise allocated to the Wife, and all contributions and accruals to his vested accrued benefit on or after __________, ____.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The court entered a ruling on the motion on December 21, 2012, stating, in relevant part:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   'Over Robert's objection, Paragraph 7.5a of the Marital Settlement Agreement shall be modified to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"2. To JULIE, a sum equal to fifty percent (50%) of the marital value (8-26-95 to 10-31-12) of ROBERT's vested accrued benefit under the Fireman's Annuity Fund, and all accruals to her portion after November 1, 2012.\" '\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   3. By Agreement, Paragraph 7.5b of the Marital Settlement Agreement shall be modified to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"To ROBERT, the remaining balance of his vested accrued benefit under the Fireman's Annuity Fund including all sums not otherwise allocated to the wife, and all contributions and accruals to his portion after November 1, 2012.\" '\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   On January 18, 2013, Robert filed a motion to clarify both the October 31, 2012 judgment, and the December 21, 2012 order, asking the court to clarify these 'to conform same to the parties' agreement.' In support, Robert recounted that while Paragraph 7.5 of the MSA awarded Julie 50% of the marital portion of his vested, accrued benefit under the Fireman's Annuity Fund, and awarded Robert all remaining benefits and interest, that paragraph stated a percentage amount rather than a dollar amount for Julie. According to Robert, this percentage amount was insufficient for the Firemen's Annuity Fund and Benefit Fund of Chicago to divide the asset as agreed upon by the parties. In support, Robert relied on a letter dated November 30, 2012, from the Fireman's Annuity Fund. That letter states:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   'In response to your recent request, we quote the following figures:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Based on our accountants review of your pension records we estimate that as of November 1, 2012 you would be entitled to a monthly annuity in the amount of $1,201.21 payable at age 50 with monthly annuity payments continuing for your lifetime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   This calculation is made pursuant to ILCS 5/6-126, and is based on your years of pensionable service credit at 17.93 years from your date of hire on December 1, 1994 through November 1, 2012 and total contributions made to the Fund during that period.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Because Robert and Julie were married August 26, 1995, argued Robert, his pre-marital service credits from December 1, 1994, through September 25, 1995, are his non-marital property. Thus, Robert submitted, it was the intent of the MSA that Julie should receive 50% of a monthly annuity of an amount less than the $1,201 amount, but rather should receive 50% $1,201 minus the credit for his premarital service. However, because of the 'mechanics' of a QILDRO and because a percentage order (rather than a dollar amount order) was entered, Julie 'will not only receive the monies stated above, but also [ ] any increases in the pension earned by Robert through his post-divorce, non-marital efforts, including without limitation, promotions, salary raises, and the like.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The record on appeal also contains a document entitled 'Firemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago QILDRO Benefit Estimate Statement' dated November 1, 2012, reflecting Robert's 'Monthly Retirement Benefit as of last available payroll' as $1,201.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   In her response, Julie admitted that service credits earned by Robert prior to the marriage would be considered Robert's non-marital asset. Julie generally denied all other allegations or alleged she had insufficient information to provide an answer. She also stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   'JULIE further states that pursuant to the terms of the Judgment, the division of ROBERT's pension will be effectuated by entry of a QILDRO. JULIE stipulates that any QILDRO entered in this matter with respect to ROBERT's pension shall be in conformity with the stated requirements of the Fireman's Annuity Fund.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Julie then filed her 'memorandum in support of response to motion to clarify' in which she argued that Robert's motion to clarify was actually seeking a modification of the judgment and was\n   therefore barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . In the alternative, Julie also asked the court to apply the\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   formula, as set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Hunt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5602728\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/78/653/\">\n    78 Ill. App. 3d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Ill.%20Dec.%2055\">\n    34 Ill.Dec. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=397%20N.E.2d%20511\">\n    397 N.E.2d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979), to the pension division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Robert then filed his 'motion to strike, or in the alternative, response to memorandum in support of response to motion to clarify.' The motion contained two counts: Count I, a motion to strike; and Count II, a motion to clarify. By Count I, Robert asked that Julie's memorandum be stricken, alleging she filed it late and without leave of court. Additionally, Robert argued that Julie could not now seek to have the pension divided under the\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   formula. By Count II, Robert argued that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   did not bar his clarification motion because he was 'not seek[ing] to amend, modify, vacate or otherwise change the substance of the Judgment or December 21, 2012 order, but rather to clarify the orders for the purpose of the preparation and entry of a [QILDRO].' Additionally, he argued that 'through no fault of the parties, the Fireman's Annuity Fund is unable to give effect to the intention of the parties with the current [percentage] language of the Judgment, and therefore the Judgment must be clarified to include a dollar amount.' He specified:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   'Robert is not trying to amend or vacate the Judgment, but to clarify the December 21, 2012 order. Robert does not dispute that Julie is entitled to 50% of his pension plan as of October 31, 2012, and does not seek to change this fact. However, in order for Julie to receive 50% of his pension plan as of October 31, 2012, that number must be reduced to a dollar amount. There exists no other way to accomplish the mandate of the orders. Robert further does not dispute that Julie is entitled to accruals to her portion of the plan, i.e. cost of living increases. However, she is not entitled to accruals to Robert's portion of the plan, as those accruals are and will be due to Robert's post-marital efforts. This is not an attempt at a second bit [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] of the apple, but an attempt to effectuate the language contained in the December 21, 2012 order, and accordingly that order must be clarified to list a specific dollar amount, which has already been calculated by Firemen's Annuity Fund.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, Robert argued that the application of the\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   formula for the first time in postjudgment motions was inappropriate, as, in a motion to clarify, the application of a new division formula would not possibly effectuate the intent of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The court heard arguments from the parties, and took the matter under advisement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   In July 2013, the trial court entered a memorandum opinion in which it denied the motion to clarify, finding that it 'function[ed] effectively as a motion to reconsider' and was, therefore, barred by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, regarding the motion to clarify versus the motion to reconsider, the court found:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   'Because the language of the agreement was modified in a prior Order, this Court finds the proposed clarification to be previously decided on the merits in the December 21, 2012 Order. Additionally, ROBERT's motion changes the distribution of the pension in question [by adding a specific dollar amount], altering the substantive nature of the Judgment. Because a motion to clarify cannot enlarge the judgment, ROBERT's Motion to Clarify functions effectively as a motion to reconsider.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The court also determined that the Firemen's Annuity letter on which Robert relied was not new evidence and 'does not purport to necessitate a dollar amount, but rather details the current value of the pension fund benefits as they stand.' The court determined that the\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   formula already applied to the pension division where 'the plain language of \u00b6 7.5 of [the MSA] uses\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   as written.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Thereafter, Julie filed a motion for entry of a QILDRO in which she asked the court to enter a QILDRO consistent with the July order, that is, consistent with the\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   formula for division of the pension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Robert also filed a motion for entry of a QILDRO in which he urged '[t]he plain language of the MSA and the December 21, 2012 order provides that only Robert's vested accrued benefit as of November 1, 2012 is to be divided, and that Robert is to receive all contributions after November 1, 2012.' Specifically, it stated, '[a]s Robert's future employment is not \"fully and unconditionally guaranteed,\" any increase in his pension as a result of his continued employment and/or continued monetary contributions to the pension were not part of the \"vested accrued benefit\" as of November 1, 2012. Therefore, the plain language of the December 21, 2012 order (and the MSA) provide that Julie is not entitled to any portion of the pension that was not a vested accrued benefit as of the date of entry of Judgment. * * * Further, while Julie is awarded \"all accruals to her portion\" after November 1, 2012, the term \"accrual\" implies increases in value intrinsic to the asset, i.e. interest or dividend reinvestments, or in this case costs of living allowances.' Robert proffered a draft dollar-amount QILDRO, which he submitted was consistent with the Firemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund's calculation of Robert's vested benefits as of October 31, 2012. Robert also submitted an alternative draft percentage-division QILDRO in which Julie is awarded one-half the marital portion of Robert's vested accrued benefit as of October 31, 2012, while still providing Julie with accruals to her portion after November 1, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   After briefing and short arguments from the parties on January 17, 2014, the court 'declin[ed] to conduct an evidentiary hearing as to the parties' intent,' entered Julie's proposed QILDRO instanter; denied Robert's motion for entry of QILDRO; and ordered that the 'QILDRO calculation order to be entered in accordance with FABF policies and Robert's motion to enter QILDRO calculation order is denied, without prejudice, based upon time not being right.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Tebbens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20140566-U\">\n    2015 IL App (1st) 140566-U\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4-21,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201774393\">\n    2015 WL 1774393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 7 Robert and Julie each initialed every page of the MSA containing the paragraph 7.5 language prior to tendering the proposed MSA to the court for entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 8 On November 27, 2012, around the time Robert filed the motion to amend, defendants sought leave to withdraw as counsel for Robert, alleging a \"breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.\" The court granted the motion to withdraw on December 21, 2012. The same day, the circuit court entered the order described above regarding the motion to amend, stating in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"THIS CAUSE coming on to be heard this 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   day of December, 2012, before this Honorable Court for hearing on Robert's Motion to Amend, or in the Alternative, to Vacate Judgment for Dissolution of Marriage,\n   counsel for Robert's Motion to Withdraw, and Julie's Petition for Rule to Show Cause, and the court being fully advised in the premises:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   2.

This counsel filed the motion to clarify after the Firemen's Annuity Fund administer requested a specific dollar amount for each party's share of the pension rather than the percentage formula set forth in the MSA. The circuit court, however, did not grant Robert the clarification he requested through his subsequent counsel but instead modified the MSA in a manner unfavorable to Robert, entering a July 17, 2013, order that improperly applied, contrary to the parties' agreement regarding the division of the pension, the reserved-jurisdiction method, also known as the\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   formula, for the first time.

Robert objected to the fee petition, arguing in part that defendants should not be awarded the full amount of their fees because the motion to amend that they filed was unsuccessful, Robert had to hire new counsel due to defendants' failure to obtain a satisfactory outcome, and new counsel had to incur the expense of a separate motion for clarification. After a hearing on the petition, the court granted the fee petition, entering the following written order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \"This matter coming before this court for hearing on the Petition for Setting Final fees and Costs, Jean Conde and counsel for Robert appearing and the court conducting a hearing and being fully advised in the premises:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court hereby finds that the fees charged were fair and reasonable and necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   That Robert Tebbens acknowledged receipt of the Clients Rights and Responsibilities and executed a written engagement letter.

The gravamen of this Complaint is the failure of the Defendants to protect Robert's interest in his pension benefits in accordance with the agreement Robert had with his counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   12. The proposed MSA contained a Paragraph 7.5 which addressed the allocation of Robert's pension benefits between Robert and Julie. Specifically, the proposed MSA provided that Julie was to receive fifty percent (50%) of the accrued value of Robert's City of Chicago Fireman's Annuity and Benefit Fund as of the day of the Dissolution decree subject to a modest reduction based upon Robert's employment by the City of Chicago for several months prior to his marriage to Julie. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   13.

Thus, rather than Julie receiving the intended and agreed to Fifty Percent of the accrued value of Robert's pension benefits as of the day of the Dissolution decree, the MSA presented to the Court as agreed resulted in an Order which provided that Julie's interest in Robert's pension benefit would be '50% of the martial value of Robert's vested accrued benefit under the Fireman's Annuity Fund (sic)'. The difference in value between these two versions was calculated at approximately $368,820. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   15. In an attempt to correct this error, the Defendants filed, on November 30, 2012, a 'Motion to Amend or Vacate' the October 31, 2012, judgment order in an effort to restore the agreed upon language from the draft used during hallway negotiations (using defendant counsel's terms). * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   16.

Further, at Paragraph 16 of their Motion to Vacate, Defendants stated: 'Paragraph 7.5 of the Marital Settlement Agreement that was entered on October 31, 2012 is erroneous and should be amended to reflect the parties' agreement...' * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   18. The omitted portion of the parties' agreement required a specific valuation date, the absence of which created the possibility that Julie's portion of Robert's pension benefit would be over $368,000 more than had been agreed to. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [19]. That Defendants did not proof read [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] the MSA they erroneously submitted to the trial court is made abundantly clear by the fact\n   that the Motion to Vacate [ ] identified a second remarkable error.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   22.

Defendants in their Motion to Amend made a judicial admission to the trial Court that the erroneous term contained in the MSA which allocated a larger share of Robert's pension benefits to Julie was made possible because Tebbens' attorneys did not review the complete final version of the MSA tendered to the Court by Julie's counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   27.

Specifically, defendants argued in part that the cause should be dismissed pursuant to section 2-615 because (1) the trial court's error in rewriting the MSA rather than simply clarifying the parties' intent was an intervening cause of any injury sustained by plaintiff; (2) the malpractice claim cannot stand where the plaintiff ultimately prevails on appeal,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Robert's position remained viable through his success on appeal, and thus he cannot now claim that defendants proximately caused any harm; and (3) Robert failed to allege that defendants breached the standard of care. Defendants also argued that the cause should be dismissed pursuant to section 2-619 because (1) the claims are barred by the principles of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , where the same core facts alleged in Robert's complaint had previously been addressed and rejected by the court in resolving the fee petition and (2) Robert fails to allege a breach of contract claim. The trial court dismissed the malpractice action in its entirety based on the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   in October 2016, noting: \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs third amended complaint is granted for reasons stated in open court (due to the elements of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   having been met).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 15 Robert filed a motion to reconsider, which the trial court denied in February 2017, specifically noting that: \"Plaintiff's Motion to Reconsider is denied for the reasons stated in open court, based on the requirements of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   being met.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 16 Robert appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 17 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 18 On appeal, Robert contends the trial court erred in dismissing his malpractice lawsuit. Specifically, Robert argues that\n   the cause should not, in fact, be barred by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . Robert claims no damages related to the division of his pension but seeks only to recover the fees incurred on appeal, a refund of the fees billed by defendants from the date the MSA was signed, and the attorney fees incurred in the malpractice case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 19 As noted above, defendants' motion to dismiss alleged that dismissal was appropriate pursuant to both section 2-615 and 2-619 of the Code. This motion included the argument that the cause should be dismissed pursuant to section 2-619 based on the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   where the same core facts alleged in Robert's complaint had previously been addressed and rejected by the court when resolving the fee petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a hearing, the trial court dismissed the malpractice action in its entirety based on the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , noting: \"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs third amended complaint is granted for reasons stated in open court (due to the elements of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   having been met).\" Robert filed a motion to reconsider, which the trial court denied in February 2017, specifically noting that:\" Plaintiff's Motion to Reconsider is denied for the reasons stated in open court, based on the requirements of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   being met.\" This, then, was a dismissal pursuant to section 2-619(a)(4), which allows for involuntary dismissal when \"the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment.\" 735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(4) (West 2014).

For example, the trial court previously rejected Robert's argument that defendants should not be awarded the full amount of their fees because the motion to amend they filed was unsuccessful. Now, the court dismissed Robert's malpractice claim by which he argued his attorneys were negligent in filing the motion to amend. Like\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   , there is a common core of facts between Robert's defense to the fee petition (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , counsel failed in regards to the motion to clarify) and his malpractice action (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , counsel was negligent in regards to the motion to clarify). When ruling on a petition for attorney fees under section 508(c) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, a court must analyze the attorney's performance, the attorney's skill, and the benefits obtained by the client, among other factors.

In our opinion, the malpractice claim and the fee petition in the case at bar are even more closely related to one another than the\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   claim and petition where Robert only claims his attorney fees as damages, and the\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   litigant claimed her attorneys failed to accurately assess the husband's assets and failed to conduct adequate discovery.

Here, on the other hand, Robert's malpractice claims are based on concepts the trial court rejected when Robert contested defendants' fee petition. Robert objected to the petition and denied that the defendants' services were all reasonable and necessary. Robert argued that the defendants had to seek clarification of the divorce judgment and that he had to retain new counsel to further seek clarification of the judgment due to the defendants' lack of success with the motion to amend. The court rejected Robert's arguments in this regard, found that all of the defendants' fees were fair, reasonable, and necessary, and entered judgment against Robert for the full $42,345.25 in unpaid fees. This is the precise core of facts that form the basis of the malpractice suit. Although we do not have a transcript of any hearing on the fee petition, a bystander's report, or an agreed statement of facts, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , it does not appear that the court barred or excluded evidence relating to attorney competency. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , here Robert was not precluded from litigating those issues in the first case.

In\n   <em>\n    Dowd\n   </em>\n   , an attorney filed a fee petition to recover a referral fee from a client.

The client then filed a complaint against the lawyer alleging, in part, that the referral was obtained through fraud and that if she and the attorney had an attorney-client relationship, the attorney committed malpractice by failing to properly advise her before she signed a contingency agreement. The trial court dismissed the complaint on\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   grounds, and the plaintiff appealed, arguing that, because counterclaims are not mandatory in Illinois, she should not be precluded from filing her\n   lawsuit to raise those claims.\n   <em>\n    Dowd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261298\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/362/523/\">\n    362 Ill.

Initially, we note that plaintiff has waived this argument by failing to raise it in the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477014\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/201/403/#p413\">\n    201 Ill. 2d at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20Ill.%20Dec.%20879\">\n    266 Ill.Dec. 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=775%20N.E.2d%20951\">\n    775 N.E.2d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (an appellant may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal; issues not raised below are considered waived). Waiver aside, the exception for continuing conduct does not apply here, where the alleged wrong is neither continuing nor recurring. Rather, Robert contends the defendants committed legal malpractice during their representation of him in his dissolution case. The specific conduct at issue occurred when the MSA was executed and submitted to the circuit court in October 2012. The fee judgment was not entered until August 2013. Additionally, the defendants were given leave to withdraw as counsel prior to the fee petition being heard. Robert argued in opposition\n   to the fee petition that defendants had to file a motion seeking to clarify language in the judgment and that Robert subsequently had to hire new counsel to address the same issue due to defendants' lack of success. Robert's malpractice claim is based on those same criticisms of defendants' work. There is no recurrent or continuing wrong here, and the trial court properly found that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   bars this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 48 Finally, as to the third proposition, that fundamental fairness compels this court to reverse the dismissal, Robert urges us to find that \"[i]f there is a set of facts that fits [the fundamental fairness exception], it is this case\" and that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   should not apply for fairness reasons because he would not have been able to obtain a full remedy in the fee petition proceeding. We disagree. We understand that Robert is on the hook for a large sum of attorney fees. Nonetheless, Robert was not restricted to merely contesting the fees he owed but could have filed a counterclaim in response to the fee petition. Again, the malpractice claim and the earlier fee petition pertain to the same operative core of facts, and the malpractice claim was properly barred by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 49 In summary, Robert's malpractice suit is an improper attack on the trial court's ruling that found the attorney fees were fair, reasonable, and necessary. The trial court has already ruled, over Robert's objection, that all of defendant's fees for their legal services were \"fair reasonable and necessary.\" Robert failed to appeal that ruling and cannot now appeal it by default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 50 III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 51 Accordingly, for all of the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court of Cook County is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 52 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Presiding Justice Cobbs and Justice Howse concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Robert was given leave to file a series of amended complaints. The final complaint of which we are concerned here is his third amended complaint. For the reader's ease, we refer to this third amended complaint simply as \"the complaint\".\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The error referenced in paragraph 18 was a scrivener's error regarding the valuation of the marital residence. This error was remedied by the trial court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Defendant Conde and Griffin filed the initial motion to dismiss, and defendants Levin and Levin &amp; Conde joined.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    To the extent Robert argues that the court considered a separate theory for dismissal pursuant to the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    , that is, that Robert's claims were barred by paragraph 12.3 of the MSA, which required Robert to pay his own \"past and future attorneys' fees\" to any other attorney or expert retained in the divorce case, and that one cannot know upon which\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    theory the court dismissed this cause, we disagree. In our estimation, defendants' motion to dismiss presents one theory for dismissal based on\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    grounds-the \"core facts\" theory-and the sub-issue regarding paragraph 12.3 is argued as to a section 2-619 dismissal, but not pursuant to the theory of\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    . In any event, we cannot know what was considered or discussed at the dismissal hearing as there is no transcript of the dismissal hearing, any hearing on the motion to reconsider, or any other hearing, and nor is there an agreed statement of facts or a bystander's report included in the record on appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Our supreme court has repeatedly held that the burden is on the appellant to present a sufficiently complete record of the trial proceedings to support a claim of error on appeal.\n    <em>\n     Corral v.
