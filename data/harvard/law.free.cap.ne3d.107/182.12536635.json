Hernandez (\"Hernandez\"), appeals his jury conviction for rape, kidnapping, and gross sexual imposition. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In December 2015, Hernandez was charged in an eight-count indictment with two counts of rape, four counts of kidnapping, and two counts of gross sexual imposition (\"GSI\"). Each count carried a sexually violent predator specification. The indictment alleged that Hernandez sexually assaulted two young girls: his great-niece, K.T., and her cousin, M.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In May 2016, Hernandez moved to sever Counts 1 through 4 from Counts 5 through 8, effectively moving for separate trials on the allegations of each victim. The trial court denied this motion. Prior to jury selection, and again after the close of all evidence, the defense renewed its motion to sever and the trial court denied the renewed motion. The parties stipulated that Hernandez's immigration status would not be mentioned in the presence of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The following evidence was adduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Allegations of K.T.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Twelve year-old K.T. described in detail two separate instances where she testified that Hernandez sexually assaulted her. K.T. testified that the first sexual assault occurred when she was about five years old. At that time, she lived with her parents in the downstairs unit of a triple house. K.T.'s grandmother and great-grandmother lived in the second floor unit. Hernandez, as well as K.T.'s other great-uncle and his wife, J.H., lived upstairs in the third floor unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} K.T. explained that the first instance of sexual assault took place while she was visiting the third floor unit of the home with her mother, N.H. N.H. went into the living room to talk with J.H. Hernandez called K.T. to his room, telling her that he had something to show her. She explained that once inside Hernandez's room, Hernandez proceeded to lay her on the bed, pull down her pants and his own pants, put a condom on, and put his penis inside her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} K.T. testified that at some point, J.H. began knocking on the door, telling K.T. that her mother was waiting and wanted her to come out of the room. K.T. explained that Hernandez took off the condom and pulled up his pants and K.T.'s pants. He then gave K.T. a small toy, told her \"not to tell anyone,\" and sent her out of the room. K.T. testified that she was confused and scared so she told Hernandez that she would not tell anyone what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} K.T. explained that the second sexual assault occurred years later when she was in the fifth grade. At that time, K.T. and her immediate family lived in a new home in the downstairs unit of a double house owned by her grandmother-Hernandez's sister. K.T. testified that Hernandez would come to this house a few times each week to visit his mother-K.T.'s great-grandmother-who lived in the second-floor unit with Hernandez's sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} K.T. testified that a few weeks before Hernandez raped her a second time, Hernandez snuck up on her while she was in the basement doing laundry. K.T. explained that she ran upstairs and into her mother's room. She forgot to lock the door, so Hernandez came in, tried to touch her, and asked her \"why are you ignoring me?\" She testified that Hernandez forcefully pulled her pants down, whispered\n   in her ear \"don't ignore me again or I'm going to do the same thing to your [younger] sister,\" and then walked away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} A few weeks later, K.T. went up to the second-floor. K.T. testified that her parents were at work and her great-grandmother was in the basement of the home. K.T. noticed that Hernandez was in one of the bedrooms. She testified that he began to walk toward her; she tried to walk away, but he followed her into the living room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Once in the living room, K.T. sat on the couch and covered herself with a blanket. Hernandez took the blanket off of her and began to pull down her pants. He then lifted her up and put her on the ground. He unzipped his pants, put on a condom that he had retrieved from his wallet, put his penis inside her vagina, and \"started thrusting for about three minutes.\" K.T. testified that during this second rape she was scared and thought \"it happened again, * * * I didn't want it to, and I couldn't do anything about it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} K.T. explained that Hernandez stopped when he heard the kitchen door creaking, as if someone was coming in. He took the condom off, put it in a small plastic bag in his wallet, and put it in his back pocket. Hernandez then left K.T. lying on the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} K.T. testified that she first told her cousin, M.R., about the sexual assaults, and eventually, she also told her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Allegations of M.R.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Eleven-year-old M.R. also testified that Hernandez had sexually assaulted her on two separate occasions. M.R. explained that K.T. is her cousin and \"good friend.\" Through the testimony of adults in the family it was established that M.R. is not related to Hernandez, but their families are close. K.T.'s father and M.R.'s mother are brother and sister, whereas Hernandez is K.T.'s maternal great-uncle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} M.R. testified that when she was younger Hernandez's mother-K.T.'s great-grandmother-cared for her five days a week while her parents were at work. Hernandez's mother would care for M.R. in the home Hernandez shared with his brother and his brother's family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} M.R. testified that while in this home, she was in Hernandez's room with his nephews playing on Hernandez's computer. M.R. testified that she was sitting on Hernandez's lap. His nephews left the room. M.R. testified that Hernandez pushed her against the door and began touching her breasts both over and under her shirt. She testified that eventually Hernandez's nephews knocked on the door, so Hernandez stopped touching her and let the boys in the room. M.R. testified that she could not remember how old she was or how long ago this happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} M.R. also testified to a second incident when she was in Hernandez's room sitting on his lap. Hernandez grabbed her hand and attempted to put her hand on his penis. M.R. testified that she told Hernandez she had to go to the bathroom. Hernandez let her go, and she ran out of his room to the bathroom. She testified that this second incident occurred when she was around five-years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Testimony of N.H.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} N.H., K.T.'s mother, testified that in November 2015, she and K.T. had an argument while preparing to go to a family picnic. N.H. had noticed that K.T. had recently been withdrawn and would not leave her bedroom. N.H. explained that K.T. did not want to go to family functions and was upset that she had to go to this particular family picnic. K.T. told N.H. that she wanted to stay home, and N.H. and K.T. began fighting. During the argument, K.T. told N.H. that Hernandez had\n   sexually assaulted her. K.T. also told N.H. that she had confided in M.R. about the assaults. N.H. and K.T. then went to M.R.'s home. Once at M.R.'s home, M.R. confided in N.H., her aunt, that Hernandez had sexually assaulted her as well. That same day, K.T.'s father called Cleveland police to report Hernandez's sexual assaults of both K.T. and M.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The investigating detective, Traci Hill (\"Detective Hill\"), testified about her investigation of the girls' allegations of sexual abuse by Hernandez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The defense called Hernandez's sister-in-law, J.H., his niece, as well as his sister-K.T.'s grandmother. Notably, J.H. testified that she did not remember having knocked on Hernandez's bedroom door and asking K.T. to come out of his room, as K.T. had testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on Counts 1 through 4 and Counts 7 and 8. The jury found Hernandez not guilty of Counts 5 and 6, which related to M.R.'s first sexual assault allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The trial court held a hearing on the sexually violent predator specifications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court found Hernandez not guilty on all sexually violent predator specifications and proceeded to sentence Hernandez to life in prison with parole eligibility after 25 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Hernandez now appeals his convictions, raising the following assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The court abused its discretion in denying repeated defense motions to sever, allowing the joinder [of] the individually weak [K.T.] and [M.R.] allegations [in one trial].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The manifest weight of the evidence was not established to allow for convictions in any of the crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Three\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The court abused its discretion when it admitted \"other acts\" evidence pursuant to [ Evid.R. 404(B) ]; evidence of other alleged sexual acts by [Hernandez] upon [K.T.] deemed to be too weak to indict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Four\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [Hernandez] was denied a fair trial when his status as a non-citizen was hinted at by Detective Hill after motion in limine prohibiting introduction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Five\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [Hernandez] was denied a fair trial when the trial court denied [Hernandez's] attempts to review [K.T. and M.R.'s] statements through testimony of [Detective Hill].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 24} For ease of analysis, we address Hernandez's assignments of error out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Manifest Weight\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In the second assignment of error, Hernandez argues that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence because they were \"depend[ent] upon the cloudy and shaky testimony of two young girls.\" Hernandez contends that K.T.'s and M.R.'s testimony lacks credibility, pointing to inconsistencies in their testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The Ohio Supreme Court has addressed the standard of review we must apply for a criminal manifest weight challenge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The criminal manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard was explained in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The jury also heard corroborating testimony from the girls' parents, the investigating officer, and Detective Hill. Hernandez argues that inconsistencies in K.T.'s and M.R.'s testimony indicate\n   their lack of credibility. However, other than Hernandez's general statement that \"[K.T.'s and M.R.'s family members] were not living in certain homes when the girls alleged these crimes to have occurred,\" he does not specify any particular inconsistencies between the statements K.T. and M.R. made to police and their trial testimony.

As discussed above, inconsistent and contradictory testimony alone does not render Hernandez's convictions against the manifest weight of the evidence.

On appeal, the state argued that the testimony about the unindicted offenses was admissible under Evid.R. 404(B) because it demonstrated why the victims tolerated the abuse. The Second District disagreed, finding that the state's reasoning at trial for the testimony was different than argued on appeal and failed to establish any of the exceptions under Evid.R. 404(B). The court reversed the defendant's convictions, finding that the \"extensive\" and \"pervasive\" testimony about other acts had denied the defendant a fair trial, especially because no limiting instruction regarding the evidence was given.\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Heft\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was indicted for rape, sexual battery, and gross sexual imposition.

The state confirmed to the trial court that it would \"instruct witnesses * * * not to make any reference [to Hernandez's immigration status], and certainly no questions will address the topic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 56} However, Detective Hill, a state witness, made an unprompted reference to Hernandez's immigration status.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [THE STATE]: And are you able to obtain information from [K.T.] that you then used in your investigation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   [Detective Hill]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   [THE STATE]: Following that interview [of K.T.], what did you do next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   [Detective Hill]: I spoke to, I believe it was our Intelligence Unit, due to the suspect's status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   THE COURT: Sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 57} As illustrated above, Detective Hill's reference to Hernandez's immigration status was vague and was clearly not prompted by the state. Hernandez recognizes that this testimony merely \"hinted at\" his immigration status. Defense counsel objected to and cut off Detective Hill's testimony before she could elaborate as to what she meant when she mentioned Hernandez's \"status.\" The trial court properly sustained the objection, and no further mention was made of Hernandez's noncitizen status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 58} The objection to Detective Hill's comment was sustained.
