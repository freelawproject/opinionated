L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ). On appeal, the defendant contends that (1) there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction; (2) the defendant was prejudiced by inadmissible hearsay testimony for which no curative instruction was given; (3) the judge erred in not giving an eyewitness identification instruction; and (4) his counsel was ineffective for not requesting a curative or eyewitness jury instruction.

Anushka Narcisse and the defendant had been in a dating relationship for several years. On the night of February 27, 2015, Narcisse was visiting the defendant at his house on Fuller Street in Dorchester. At around 10:00 P.M. , Robert Brown and Anthony Gonzalez\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   saw Narcisse running from Fuller Street onto Morton Street. Narcisse was screaming, crying, and asking for help. A six-feet tall, dark-skinned man, who wore dreadlocks, and who was carrying a bottle of bleach, chased her. Narcisse fell or was pushed and was then straddled by the man, who then poured bleach on her. After emptying the bottle of bleach, the man ran from the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Narcisse testified pursuant to a court order. She claimed that she was intoxicated and did not remember what happened after she tripped while running to catch a bus. As Brown and Gonzalez approached Narcisse, there was a strong odor of bleach and her clothes were fading. She did not smell of alcohol and did not appear to be intoxicated. A nearby emergency medical technician, Caitlin Waibel, observed Narcisse running from a pursuer, who dumped something over her. As Waibel approached, Narcisse was distressed, smelled of bleach, and had minor burns on her body. According to Waibel's partner, Kenneth Arienti, Narcisse was crying uncontrollably, smelled of bleach, and her clothing was damp and discolored. Upon arriving at the scene, Officer Ismael Sosa also observed that the liquid on the ground smelled like bleach and that Narcisse smelled like bleach and did not smell of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Eight months later, Brown was asked to identify the man he saw pour bleach on Narcisse. Detective Erin Schroeder showed Brown a photographic array (photo array) of nine to twelve individuals. She used specific parameters for the photo array; she selected individuals who had roughly the same age, height, and other characteristics as the defendant, including dreadlocks. Brown picked a photograph of someone other than the defendant. At trial Detective Schroeder testified that after the photo array Brown stated, \"I don't really remember what [the perpetrator] looked like. I was more concentrating on [Narcisse] on the ground.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient, because there was no eyewitness identification and the remaining evidence was purely speculative. \"Proof of the identity of the person who committed the offense may be established in a number of ways and it is not necessary that any one witness should distinctly swear that the defendant was the man, if the result of all the testimony, on comparison of all its details and particulars, should identify him as the offender.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Blackmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837987\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/77/474/#p483\">\n    77 Mass.

Thereafter, multiple witnesses viewed Narcisse screaming frantically while being chased down Fuller Street-the street on which the defendant lived. The assault occurred on Morton Street, in close proximity to the defendant's house. Narcisse was chased by a six-feet tall, dark-skinned man with dreadlocks carrying a bottle of bleach. The fact that the perpetrator was carrying a bottle of bleach-an item commonly used and stored in the household rather than carried on the street-gives support to the inference that the pursuer took the bleach from a nearby home, chased Narcisse down the street, and poured it on her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The physical description of the assailant matched the defendant's appearance. Notwithstanding the lack of an in-court identification, the jury were able to see the defendant in the court room and compare his appearance to the descriptions given by the witnesses.

The defendant maintains that he was prejudiced by the following hearsay testimony by Officer Sosa.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   PROSECUTOR : \"And when you saw that liquid on the ground did you see anything on the woman that you were speaking with?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   OFFICER SOSA : \"Yeah, the woman was apparently soiled; and I guess during the incident with her ex-boyfriend or boyfriend, whoever it was, the suspect it turned out to be later, it was relayed to us that he had poured bleach on her.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL : \"Objection.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT : \"Okay. Objection sustained as to the statement that someone else made to the officer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the judge sustained the initial objection the defendant did not ask for a curative instruction or move to strike. The defendant claims that the judge erred in not giving a curative instruction sua sponte. Our review is limited to whether the judge erred, and if so, whether the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.

See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Isabelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"985787\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/444/416/#p420\">\n    444 Mass. 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420 (2005). Furthermore, although Officer Sosa's answer that \"it was relayed to us that [the defendant] had poured bleach on [Narcisse]\" was hearsay, the adverse effect of the improper testimony was mitigated by the judge's jury instructions as a whole. The judge instructed the jury at the outset of trial and during his final jury instructions regarding the purpose of objections at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, he informed the jury to \"not consider any answer that [he] struck from the record and told [them] to disregard.\" Although the judge did not explicitly tell the jury to disregard Officer Sosa's answer, the judge immediately stated: \"Objection sustained as to the statement that someone else made to the officer.\" The jury are presumed to have \"[a] certain measure of ... sophistication.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kozec\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795275\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/399/514/#p517\">\n    399 Mass. 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517 (1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant also asserts error in Officer Sosa's testimony that Narcisse told him that bleach was poured on her. Officer Sosa's statement that \"it must have been that bleach because that's what she was saying was poured on\" was hearsay. Even if counsel's objection was sufficient to reach the challenged testimony, the testimony did not prejudice the defendant as it was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310260\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/336/#p348\">\n    427 Mass. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348 (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Ineffective assistance\n   </em>\n   . The defendant maintains that his counsel was ineffective when he failed to move to strike and request an instruction following Officer Sosa's hearsay testimony. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant bears the burden of showing \"that there has been a 'serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel-behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,' and that counsel's poor performance 'likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Millien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173422\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/417/#p429\">\n    474 Mass. 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429-430 (2016), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96 (1974).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant \"raises this issue for the first time on appeal, presenting the weakest form of such a challenge because it is bereft of any explanation by trial counsel for his[, her, or their] actions and suggestive of strategy contrived by a defendant viewing the case with hindsight.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Beaulieu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461262\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/773/#p781\">\n    90 Mass.
