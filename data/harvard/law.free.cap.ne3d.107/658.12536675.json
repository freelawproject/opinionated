JONES, SR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Walter Harris (\"Harris\"), appeals his convictions on multiple counts related to the sexual assault of H.S. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2015, Harris was charged with 28 counts as follows: nine counts of rape, eight counts of kidnapping, six counts of sexual battery, four counts of gross sexual imposition, and one count of attempted rape. The counts were accompanied by various repeat violent offender and sexual motivation specifications. The date of Harris's offenses ranged from March 1, 2012 to June 2014, and the victim was his girlfriend's minor daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The matter proceeded to trial in April 2016, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The case proceeded to a second jury trial in May 2016 on 27 counts because the state dismissed one count of rape prior to the second trial. The repeat violent offender and sexual motivation specifications were tried to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The following pertinent evidence was presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Harris dated H.S.'s mother. H.S. did not have a stable home life. At first, H.S. and her brother, \"E.S.,\" lived out of state with their mother. Because Harris lived in Cleveland, H.S. would visit with her mother and brother on the weekends. H.S. subsequently lived with her grandmother, her mother in a homeless shelter, and finally with Harris and E.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Harris eventually became the legal guardian of H.S. and E.S. H.S. testified that she thought of Harris as her \"father.\" From 2005 through 2012, H.S. lived with Harris, E.S., and Joanna Wilcox (\"Wilcox\"), who was dating Harris. Harris and Wilcox's relationship ended in September 2012 and Wilcox moved out. H.S. and Wilcox remained friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} When H.S. was in the eighth grade, she discovered she was attracted to girls. Harris found out and was mad. H.S. testified that Harris first assaulted her when she was in the eighth grade and after Harris found out she was gay. One night, Harris called H.S. downstairs. According to H.S., there was a pornographic movie playing on the television, depicting two females. Harris grabbed H.S.'s arm, threw her down onto his bed, and touched her. H.S. testified that although she did not want Harris to be touching her in that way, she was frightened and did not feel that she was able to get away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} H.S. testified that the next instance occurred toward the beginning of her ninth grade school year. E.S. was at school and H.S. was on the couch. Harris approached her with his pants off and touched her. Again, H.S. was frightened but did not feel like she could leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} H.S. testified that after Wilcox moved out, Harris was \"lonely\" and wanted H.S. and E.S. to sleep in his bedroom. The siblings slept on couch cushions on the bedroom floor. During one of these nights, H.S. remembered she was at a friend's house for the evening. She returned home, fell asleep on the couch cushions, and woke up in Harris's bed without pants. Harris touched her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} H.S. testified that eventually Harris's assaults escalated to sexual intercourse. H.S. testified that one such occurrence took place when she was in the tenth grade, before Harris moved them from their house on East 64th Street to a house on Homer Avenue. H.S. remembered she had been sleeping on the couch because she was sick. During the night, she got up to get a drink of water; when she returned, Harris was sitting on the couch waiting for her. Harris told H.S. to come to his bedroom, where he had sex with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The sexual abuse continued after they moved to the new house. H.S. testified to another instance that occurred shortly after the move, sometime between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Harris called H.S. into his bedroom and told her that they needed to \"mess around.\" H.S. testified that Harris grabbed her, took off her pants, turned her around, and made her have sex with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} According to H.S., the last time Harris assaulted her was toward the end of 2014. She testified that Harris continuously and repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted her until the end of 2014 and would never wear a condom. Instead, Harris bought H.S. the \"morning after pill.\" The state entered into evidence a receipt from Discount Drug Mart, dated September 12, 2014, that detailed the purchase of emergency contraceptive. The state also entered into evidence video surveillance from September 12, 2014, at the same Discount Drug Mart, that showed Harris making a purchase in the pharmacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Veronique White, a Discount Drug Mart pharmacy technician, testified that Harris was a regular customer at the pharmacy. White stated that she personally sold Harris the emergency contraceptive on two or three occasions, and that he told her that he was buying the pills for his daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} According to H.S., Harris gave her these contraceptive pills \"too many times to count\"; in fact, at one point Harris told H.S. that she needed to go on birth control because he was \"tired\" of buying her the expensive pills. H.S. told Harris that she did not want to go on birth control because she wanted to date only girls and wanted him to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} H.S. testified she was scared to tell anyone about Harris. At one point, she asked E.S. what he would do if she told him that someone was hurting her. Both H.S. and E.S. testified that E.S. got angry and told H.S. that he would \"kill\" anyone who hurt her. Because of this response, H.S. decided not to tell her brother about Harris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} H.S. finally told her girlfriend, C.R., about Harris. H.S. called C.R. after one instance of abuse. C.R. heard H.S. crying on the phone and H.S. confided in C.R. about what Harris had been doing to her. H.S. asked C.R. to keep the abuse a secret, but C.R.'s mother found out and C.R. and her mother reported the abuse to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Cleveland Police Detective Alan Strickler was assigned to the case. H.S. told the detective that the allegations were false and to throw the case out. H.S. testified that she was scared that if she divulged the abuse, E.S. would be placed in foster care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} H.S. then confided in Harris's former girlfriend, Wilcox. Wilcox testified that H.S. texted her on October 15, 2014, and asked if she would make H.S. tell if someone was hurting her. Wilcox met with H.S. the next day. H.S. told Wilcox that Harris was forcing her to have sex with him. Wilcox told H.S. that she needed to tell someone right away but H.S. said she did not want to go to the police because she was afraid of Harris. According to Wilcox, H.S. thought people would believe Harris over her and feared for her brother's future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Towards the end of December 2014, Harris and H.S. got into an argument over H.S.'s music. H.S. left the house and went to stay with her girlfriend, C.R., without telling Harris where she was going. H.S. called Wilcox and told her that she was finally ready to go to the police and file a report. Wilcox took H.S. to the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Detective Cindy Bazilius (\"Detective Bazilius\") interviewed H.S. Detective Bazilius testified that H.S. indicated that the abuse had been going on for several years. According to Detective Bazilius, when she interviews a child victim that has been subjected to frequent abuse, she will try to get the child to focus on a few detailed incidents, rather than trying to remember every single incident. During her interview, H.S. was able to relate specific incidents of abuse to specific years in school and other major life events, rather than specific dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The police secured a search warrant for Harris's house. Detective Bazilius testified that she conducted the search with the knowledge that it was important to look for old towels and clothing in the home and particularly in Harris's bedroom, because H.S. had stated that Harris would often use towels and clothing to clean up after they had sex. Forensic testing conducted on a blue towel taken from the top of Harris's bedroom dresser contained seminal material with a DNA profile\n   that matched Harris's. The police also took Harris's bedding into evidence and forensic testing confirmed that the bedding contained DNA from both Harris and H.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services social worker Hope Gula (\"Gula\") interviewed H.S. Gula testified that in her experience as a social worker in the sex abuse unit, child sex abuse victims often delay disclosure of their abuse. Gula noted that it is common for children to be mistaken about the time elements of the abuse, especially when the abuse occurred frequently over a long period of time. Gula testified that while interviewing H.S., H.S. disclosed to her certain behaviors that Harris possessed that are typically known as \"grooming behaviors\" in which the level of sexual activity he subjected H.S. to was slowly increased. Gula explained that these activities were consistent with her experience with other victims of sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The jury found Harris guilty on all counts and the sexual motivation specifications. The court convicted Harris of the repeat violent offender specifications, acquitted him of the sexually violent offender specifications, and sentenced him to a total of 11 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Harris now appeals, raising the following six assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I. The trial court erred by denying appellant's motion to suppress evidence in violation of his fourth and fourteenth amendment rights to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   II. Appellant's constitutional rights were violated because social worker Gula was permitted to give expert testimony in violation of Evid.R. 702 and testimony that improperly bolstered H.S.'s credibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   III. Appellant's convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and the trial court erred by denying his motion for acquittal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   IV. The convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   V. Appellant's federal and state constitutional right to a speedy trial and due process were violated and his conviction should be vacated and dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   VI. The trial court erred by granting the state's oral motion to amend counts 12-15 [of] the indictment after the close of the state's case in chief which deprived appellant of a fair trial and violated his due process rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Trial court did not err in denying motion to suppress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In the first assignment of error, Harris contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 26} This court reviews a decision on a suppression motion under a mixed standard of review. \"In a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and evaluate witness credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The key inquiry is whether the warrant could reasonably have described the items more precisely.\n   <em>\n    State v. Benner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1415499\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/40/301/#p307\">\n    40 Ohio St.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20N.E.2d%20701\">\n    533 N.E.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In this case, the warrant stated that the following could be searched and seized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   photographs of the interior and exterior of the premises and any objects therein, said premises being crime scene; any and all bedding including sheets, pillowcases and blankets; Vaseline; DVDs, VHS tapes and/or movies; Pain pills and/or packaging; any and all biological and/or forensic material and/or items that might have such materials including that visible only by an alternate light source; and any and other evidence tending to establish violation of the criminal laws of the State of Ohio, including but not limited to: Rape, R.C. 2907.02.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Detective Bazilius testified that when she executed the search warrant, she was looking for any towels that could contain evidence of Harris's DNA. She further testified that H.S. had previously disclosed that Harris would use a towel to clean up after ejaculating on the floor when he abused her. Thus, the detective was aware that there may be a towel in Harris's house that had biological fluids on it that would connect him to the rape allegations. The warrant specifically stated that police would search for \"items that might have\" \"biological and/or forensic material\" \"and any and other evidence tending to establish\" \"[r]ape.\" Clearly, the seized towel falls under the purview of the search warrant as it was an item that could contain biological and/or forensic material or could be other evidence tending to establish the crime of rape. We do not find that the omission of the specific word \"towel\" sanctioned an impermissible general exploratory search in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The common pleas court case Harris relies on,\n   <em>\n    State v. Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6699322\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-misc/64/42/\">\n    64 Ohio Misc. 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=412%20N.E.2d%20956\">\n    412 N.E.2d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.P.1980), is easily distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Simpson,\n   </em>\n   the search warrant affidavit listed that officers were requesting to search Apts. 204 and 304. However, Apt. 304 was omitted from the command section of the warrant. Despite the omission, the officers searched both apartments. The court suppressed the items found in Apt. 304, reasoning that because Apt. 304 was missing from the command section, meant the executing court considered the request to search Apt. 304 and rejected the request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=412%20N.E.2d%20956\">\n    412 N.E.2d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, there is no suggestion that the executing court rejected the request to seize towels, because it allowed the broader search and seizure of \"any and all biological and/or forensic material and/or items that might have such material.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In\n   <em>\n    Benner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1415499\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/40/301/#p307\">\n    40 Ohio St.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20N.E.2d%20701\">\n    533 N.E.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court upheld a search warrant that authorized a search of the defendant's houses and truck for \"fibers and hairs and other trace evidence for comparison,\" but that did not specifically identify the items to be seized. The court found that the \"fibers and hairs\" language used in the warrant \"placed a meaningful restriction on the executing officers, viz., they could only seize those items that could be sources of fibers and hairs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 307,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20N.E.2d%20701\">\n    533 N.E.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"While\n   the 'fibers and hairs' clause in the warrants was undoubtedly broad, we believe that it did not permit the officers to simply take any item they wanted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20N.E.2d%20701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Likewise, in this case, the language used in the warrant, while broad, still identified many items with particularity and did not permit the officers to take any item they wanted from Harris's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In light of the above, the trial court did not err in denying Harris's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The date of the offense was September 11, 2014. Although H.S. did not testify that she was raped on the specific date of September 11, 2014, she testified that she was sexually assaulted by Harris numerous times and Harris would buy emergency contraception from the drugstore the day after he had unprotected sex with her. The state introduced evidence that Harris bought emergency contraception, or the \"morning-after pill,\" from Discount Drug Mart on September 12, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 51} The evidence also supports a finding that Harris committed rape as charged in Count 9 of the indictment. Harris argues that the evidence did not support the conviction because the indictment stated that the date was between September 1, 2012, and May 30, 2013, and H.S. testified that she believed that this event occurred in the fall of 2014, right after Harris and Wilcox ended their relationship. But other evidence showed that Harris and Wilcox ended their relationship in the fall of 2012. H.S. testified that this incident of rape occurred right after the couple broke up; she associated the incidence with that timeframe. While H.S. testified as to the wrong year, the social worker testified that (1) child sex abuse victims are often mistaken about the time elements of the abuse, especially when the abuse has occurred frequently over a long period of time and (2) child sex abuse victims will often associate incidents with landmark events that occurred around the same time rather than remember specific dates. Based on this, we find sufficient evidence to support a conviction on Count 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The evidence also supports convictions for Count 16, gross sexual imposition as defined in R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) ; Counts 17 and 23, kidnapping; Count 21, rape; and Count 22, sexual battery. Counts 16 and 17 related to an incident that H.S. testified about where Harris assaulted her on the couch. Counts 21-23 related to an incident that occurred in the fall of 2014. H.S. testified specifically as to this incident\n   and that it was one of the last times that Harris raped her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Harris claims that the record does not support his convictions because E.S. never saw Harris abuse H.S., Wilcox never noticed any inappropriate behavior, and H.S. delayed in reporting the abuse. None of these assertions, however, mean that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions. Nor does it mean that a reasonable trier of fact lost its way in finding that Harris was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. H.S. testified that E.S. was often not home when the abuse occurred and H.S. explained why she delayed disclosing the abuse; she was trying to protect her brother and she did not think anyone would believe her word over Harris's. Social worker Gula, an expert in child sex abuse, explained why children often delay in reporting their abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Harris further argues that H.S. fabricated the allegations in retaliation for wanting to be emancipated, because Harris filed a missing persons report on her, and because he would not let her attend a party. H.S.'s credibility, however, is a judgment that was left to the trier of fact, who clearly believed H.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Harris also asserts that there is no forensic or DNA evidence that substantiates the charges, arguing that H.S.'s DNA in Harris's bedroom on his bedding is only indicative that H.S. lived in the same house and that Harris's DNA found on the blue towel is unremarkable. We disagree. This evidence does not go against H.S.'s allegations; the discovery of H.S.'s DNA in Harris's bedroom and his seminal fluid on the blue towel is consistent with the facts H.S. testified to at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Having reviewed the record, and deferring to the jurors' decisions regarding whether and to what extent to credit the testimony of the witnesses, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support Harris's convictions and the convictions are not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Therefore, the third and fourth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Harris's speedy trial rights not violated\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 58} In the fifth assignment of error, Harris contends his speedy trial rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 59} As an initial matter, we note that Harris filed a pro se motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. The record reflects that Harris was represented by counsel when he filed his pro se motion. Hybrid representation is not allowed; therefore, the trial court was unable to consider his motion.\n   <em>\n    State v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

In regard to the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, the United States Supreme Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is * * * not primarily intended to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by passage of time; that interest is protected primarily by the Due Process Clause and by statutes of limitations. The speedy trial guarantee is designed to minimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused\n   while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We disagree and note that the six-month delay was largely a result of Harris's actions. The second trial was originally set for May 2016; however, pretrials were continued twice in May, at Harris's request. The trial was rescheduled to begin August 1, 2016, but Harris filed a motion for continuance on July 15. The court granted the motion and set a new trial date for October 24, 2016. Because we find the length of the delay was not prejudicial, we need not inquire into the other\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Having found no merit to Harris's constitutional and statutory speedy-trial challenges, his fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    E. No error in amending indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 70} In the sixth assignment of error, Harris contends that allowing the state to amend the dates on the indictment violates his due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Crim.R. 7(D) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   The court may at any time before, during, or after a trial amend the indictment * * * in respect to any defect, imperfection, or omission in form or substance, or of any variance with the evidence, provided no change is made in the name or identity of the crime charged. If any amendment is made to the substance of the indictment * * * or to cure a variance between the indictment * * * the defendant is entitled to a discharge of the jury on the defendant's motion, if a jury has been impaneled, and to a reasonable continuance, unless it clearly appears from the whole proceedings that the defendant has not been misled or prejudiced by the defect or variance in respect to which the amendment is made, or that the defendant's rights will be fully protected by proceeding with the trial, or by a postponement thereof to a later day with the same or another jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Thus, pursuant to Crim.R. 7(D), the court may amend the indictment to conform to the evidence. Here, after the close of the state's case, the state moved to amend the dates of Counts 12-17 to conform with the evidence presented in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Harris claims he was prejudiced by the amended indictments, but he does not support his contention with any arguments as to\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   he was prejudiced. Specific dates and times are not elements of the offenses upon which he was indicted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Rogers\n   </em>\n   , 12th Dist.

Moreover, Harris's defense centered upon his denial that the acts in question ever occurred, regardless of when the acts were alleged to have occurred. Put another way, Harris's defense to the allegations of sex abuse were that the allegations were entirely false; we do not see how changing the date range during which the abuse occurred would affect his defense. Thus, Harris has failed to demonstrate how amending the dates on some counts of the indictment prejudiced him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Harris has failed to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the amendment of the indictment; therefore, the sixth and final assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 75} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, P.J., and FRANK D.
