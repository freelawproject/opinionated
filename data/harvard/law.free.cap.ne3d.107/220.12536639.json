For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 11, 2011, appellant, by and through its principals, Edward Polina and Richard Coleman, purchased the real property at issue in this case for $250,000 at a sheriff's sale. For the year 2010, the auditor assigned a fair market value for the property of $491,800. On March 31, 2011, appellant filed a complaint with the BOR, pursuant to R.C. 5715.19(A), challenging the auditor's valuation and seeking a reduction in the fair market value to $101,004.65 for the 2010 tax year. The school district filed a countercomplaint seeking to retain the auditor's value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The BOR conducted an evidentiary hearing on the complaint on October 30, 2016. Polina appeared at the hearing with counsel, and he testified as to the description of the property and the method he used to determine the value of his property. Polina described the property as a one acre, undeveloped residential lot that abuts a roundabout. He stated the other three corner lots that make up the property surrounding the roundabout are zoned commercial. According to Polina, the reason appellant purchased the property is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   And so the logic was to get it rezoned and put an office building to put my company in. And what had happened, I-evidently years ago I think a Speedway gas station was trying to get it rezoned to put a gas station. So the homeowner's association rallied and did everything they could to stop that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   And ever since then, they've had the same taste in their mouth that they want to keep anything commercial off of that corner. And they think that it's good for a home to be built there. So that's why it's currently zoned residential and that's why it has not changed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Oct. 30, 2013 Tr. at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Polina stated appellant has made no effort to market the property, preferring to hold on to it until the abutting property owners changed their minds about rezoning. With respect to appellant's estimate of fair market value, Polina testified he compared the auditor's tax valuations for several surrounding residential properties to appellant's undeveloped parcel and calculated a fair market value per square foot for each property. Polina's counsel explained to the BOR appellant's method of valuation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   And currently the appraised value of the land, according to the County records, is 491,800. [B]ased off of the County records of-of land that's close to it, adjacent to it, that's also zoned residential.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   And what we did, we-we broke down, you know, the value. We looked at the acreage value. * * * There's nothing on this, it's undeveloped, there's no house on this land. And what we looked at was what is compare-what are the comparable land costs of other properties in that area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   And what we see is the subject property is currently valued at, according to the Auditor's records, at $6.82 per square foot, while the surrounding land that-that are-that's residential is valued anywhere from $1.09 to a high of 1.81, which is actually a church property, per square foot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   So we feel that there's significant overvaluation right now by the County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Oct. 30, 2013 Tr. at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Over the school board's objection, appellant submitted the auditor's public record showing the tax valuation of each of the properties surrounding appellant's parcel and the square footage of each of those parcels. Appellant also submitted a chart comparing the value per square foot for these six properties to the assessed value of his property per square foot. Counsel for the school board cross-examined Polina, but the school board did not present any other evidence at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The BOR announced its decision to deny appellant's request for a reduction in value at a meeting held on November 1, 2013. Member Kimbol Stroud explained BOR's decision to deny appellant's request as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [W]e were presented testimony from the-the owner of the property regarding some of the physical attributes of the property as well as zoning issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   We were also presented a number of tax comparables which we are rejecting as evidence of value due to WJJK Investments versus Licking County BOR, Ohio-Ohio Supreme Court. We were not presented an appraisal report so we really, unfortunately, you know-we didn't have a-a-the sale of the property we do not consider arm's length because it was a-a court-ordered sale, so we really have no competent probative evidence of value on which to base the requested reduction in value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Nov. 1, 2013 Tr. at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The BOR issued a written decision memorializing its determination on November 8, 2013. Appellant elected to appeal the BOR's decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas under R.C. 5717.05. The trial court heard the appeal on the BOR's record and the arguments of counsel. On April 25, 2017, the trial court issued a decision adopting the auditor's valuation of appellant's property for the tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant timely appealed to this court from the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant asserts a single assignment of error as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The Trial Court acted unreasonably and unconscionably and therefore abused its discretion by affirming the November 8, 2013 Decision of the Franklin County Board of Revision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The BOR rejected appellant's contention that comparing the auditor's assessed values of surrounding properties to the auditor's valuation of appellant's parcel yielded probative evidence of fair market value. The BOR cited the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    WJJK Invests.\n   </em>\n   as authority for its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In\n   <em>\n    WJJK Invests.\n   </em>\n   , the taxpayer challenged a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (\"BTA\"), which affirmed the valuation assessed by the county auditor on its 24.43-acre mobile home park. The only witness for the taxpayer at the BTA hearing was the president of the closely held corporation that owned the park, who presented evidence that other mobile home parks were assessed at lower values. The Supreme Court held the taxpayer failed to show the BTA abused its discretion in assessing the property's true value. In rejecting the taxpayer's claim that the auditor valued its property in an entirely different manner than the comparable properties, the court stated \"[a] review of the auditor's property record cards shows that the same assessment ratio was used for all the properties. Merely showing that two parcels of property have different values without more does not establish that the tax authorities valued the properties in a different manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=665%20N.E.2d%201111\">\n    665 N.E.2d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Piepho\n   </em>\n   , the taxpayer filed a complaint with the BOR seeking a reduction in the assessed value of her condominium from $72,500 to $34,473. The BOR voted to reduce the true value of appellant's property to $58,000 for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012. Appellant filed an appeal with the BTA. The BTA found appellant did not provide competent and probative evidence to support her opinion of value, and there was insufficient evidence to support the BOR's reduction in value. Accordingly, the BTA reinstated the county auditor's value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On appeal to this court, appellant argued the BTA erred when it rejected her evidence comparing the auditor's valuation of her condominium to the auditor's valuation of condominiums in neighboring complexes. This court found \"the BTA correctly rejected appellant's argument that the county auditor unfairly assessed her property based on her evidence regarding valuation of neighboring properties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. In adopting the auditor's original valuation of the property, this court explained that because the record contained no evidence as to how the county auditor actually determined the value of the taxpayer's property or the value of the comparable properties provided by the taxpayer, the taxpayer's evidence did not support her claim that the county auditor unfairly assessed her property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Piepho\n   </em>\n   court cited\n   <em>\n    WJJK Invests.\n   </em>\n   stating \"the fact that two parcels have different values, without more, does not prove the tax authorities valued the properties in a different manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Piepho\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Here, appellant's chart and Polina's testimony simply compared the auditor's valuation of six surrounding properties,\n   on a per square-foot basis, with the auditor's valuation of appellant's parcel.

Appellant did not present the BOR with an appraisal of appellant's property or any recent sales data for comparable parcels in the area. On this record, appellant's evidence is insufficient to establish the requested reduction in the auditor's value.\n   <em>\n    Piepho\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    WJJK Invests.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant relies on a case from the Eleventh District Court of Appeals in support of its contention that comparable tax values can be used to support a reduction in the auditor's valuation. In\n   <em>\n    Kister v. Ashtabula Cty. Bd. of Revision\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist.

At the BTA hearing, the owner offered comparative sales and tax valuations on two nearby properties to support his position. The BOR offered no evidence in rebuttal. The BTA did not give any weight to the owner's evidence of value and affirmed the BOR valuation. In reversing the BTA, the court noted that due to his ownership of the property, the owner was competent to present his opinion of value, and he provided a detailed explanation to support his valuation position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant argues that\n   <em>\n    Kister\n   </em>\n   requires us to reverse the trial court in this case. The school board contends that\n   <em>\n    Kister\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on its facts.

On appeal, the\n   <em>\n    Kister\n   </em>\n   court acknowledged the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    WJJK Invests.\n   </em>\n   that \" ' \"[m]erely showing that two parcels of property have different values (or in this case roughly the same values) without more does not establish that the tax authorities valued the properties in a different (same) manner.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Kister\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30, quoting\n   <em>\n    Sherman v. Bd. of Tax Appeals\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. No. 75971,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20263277\">\n    2000 WL 263277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mar. 9, 2000), quoting\n   <em>\n    WJJK Invests.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. In distinguishing\n   <em>\n    WJJK Invests.,\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Kister\n   </em>\n   court noted the owner \"clearly used more than just the auditor's records to establish values.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. The Eleventh District Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Kister\n   </em>\n   also concluded the credentials of the owner qualified him as an expert in real estate appraisal, even though the owner was not a licensed appraiser. The owner in\n   <em>\n    Kister\n   </em>\n   testified that \"as a real estate developer, he is qualified as an expert in the area of real estate appraisal [because] most of the appraisers in the county call him for values; he manages two hundred tenants; he is more qualified than most appraisers; and he has been buying and developing land since 1963.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Here, appellant supported its opinion of value with a comparison of the auditor's valuation of adjacent properties only, with no supporting sales data. Appellant did not attempt to qualify Polina as an\n   expert in property value and has not argued that Polina so qualifies. Thus, even if we were to agree that a comparison of the auditor's valuation of surrounding properties is probative of the fair market value of a particular parcel when combined with other relevant evidence of value, including recent sales data and the owner's expert opinion regarding fair market value, appellant presented no such additional evidence in this case. Thus, the facts in\n   <em>\n    Kister\n   </em>\n   are materially different from the facts in this case.\n   <em>\n    Kister\n   </em>\n   does not, therefore, support appellant's contention the trial court abused its discretion in determining the taxable value of the subject property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Moreover, to the extent appellant argues that Polina's testimony constitutes competent and probative evidence of value under the owner-opinion rule, we note Polina's testimony regarding the value of appellant's parcel was vague and inconsistent. When a BOR member asked Polina why appellant did not have the property appraised, he responded that \"[w]hen we bought it for $250,000, we figured that was fair market value.\" (Oct. 30, 2013 Tr. at 10.) Polina also testified \"[t]here's been resistance from the Post Road Civic Association to rezone it as a commercial lot, which really makes the property worthless other than putting a house there.\" (Oct. 30, 2013 Tr. at 7.) He later opined \"if * * * it did get rezoned commercial, then you might have a valid argument as far as the pricing of it. But as of right now, a-a one-acre residential lot, that's a pretty high valuation, I believe.\" (Oct. 30, 2013 Tr. at 11.) As noted above, appellant advocated a reduction in value to $101,004.65 for the 2010 tax year based on appellant's comparison of the auditor's tax values for surrounding properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 25} R.C. 5713.04 specifically states \"[t]he price for which * * * real property would sell at auction or forced sale shall not be taken as the criterion of its value.\" The Supreme Court has held, pursuant to R.C. 5713.04, a forced sale of real property, such as a sheriff's sale, is not probative evidence of true value.\n   <em>\n    Olentangy Local Schools Bd. of Edn. v.
