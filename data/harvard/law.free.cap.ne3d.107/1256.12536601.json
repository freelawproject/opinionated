The Commonwealth contends that\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because the judge in this case did not make similar findings. But the judge's statements at the hearing on the motion for a new trial can be read to mean that he found a motion to suppress to constitute a substantial ground of defense. Specifically, when defense counsel offered to explain why a motion to suppress was viable, the judge stated that he did not need to hear about it further, telling counsel, \"I've read it in your [motion for a new trial]. I see there was -- it was a result of a stop, and there could've been, certainly, a challenge -- well, at least arguably, there could've been a challenge on the basis of search and seizure. I agree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Furthermore, even assuming that the judge did not so find, the viability of a motion to suppress depends solely on questions of law, as applied to undisputed facts in the record. An evidentiary hearing and factual findings were therefore not necessary on this point. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sylvain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=483%20Mass.%20872\">\n    483 Mass. 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 839 (2016);\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3847885\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/82/389/#p395\">\n    82 Mass. App. Ct. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395 (2012). While we need not decide the motion to suppress itself, having reviewed the parties' briefing on the issues that would have been raised therein, we independently conclude that such a motion would have been a substantial ground of defense. Though it may not have resulted in suppression and acquittal, it was at least substantial enough to make it rational for the defendant to have rejected the pleas. See\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p184\">\n    468 Mass. at 183-184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This is especially so when we \"take into account the particular circumstances informing the defendant's desire to remain in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p184\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p184\">\n    . at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Though the judge made no findings on this point, he also did not reject the defendant's affidavit detailing his special circumstances. In the context of this case, we do not agree with the Commonwealth that the absence of findings precludes us from considering the affidavit. The Commonwealth did not file a written opposition to the motion, nor did it contest the facts in the affidavit. We are not barred from considering uncontested facts in the record that the judge implicitly accepted. See\n   <em>\n    Sylvain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801512\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/42/#p47\">\n    473 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   839 ;\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3847885\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/82/389/#p395\">\n    82 Mass. App. Ct. at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Moreover, there is evidence corroborating much of the defendant's affidavit, including his allegation that immigration concerns were of specific concern to him when he entered the pleas. Based on our review of the record, we conclude that there is no genuine dispute as to at least the following facts. At the time of the pleas, the defendant was twenty-one years old, a lawful permanent resident, and attending college on scholarship. He arrived in this country from Kenya when he was fourteen years old to live with his mother, who is HIV positive. The defendant and his mother are very close, as detailed in a psychodiagnostic evaluation report. According to the report, both the defendant and his mother would fear for his safety and suffer extreme emotional hardship were he forced to leave the United States and return to Kenya.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In light of these uncontested facts, and the availability of a substantial defense, the record \"provide[s] a sufficient basis on which to conclude that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, [the defendant] would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Sylvain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801512\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/42/#p47\">\n    473 Mass. at 833-834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).
