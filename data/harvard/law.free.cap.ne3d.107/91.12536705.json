(\"CR-One\") engaged Mike McGarry &amp; Sons, Inc. (\"MMS\") to clean, prime and paint part of an unoccupied manufacturing facility. The property owner, Cuyahoga Heights Commerce One, LLC. (\"Cuyahoga Heights\"), was negotiating with a tenant, and CR-One's job was to prepare part of the building for occupancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The painting aspect of the project was beset by cost-overruns and delays. MMS alleges that Cr-One breached an agreement to pay it for those extra costs. When CR-One did not pay, MMS filed a mechanic's lien against the property owner, asserting more than twice the value of the original contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 24, 2014, MMS filed a four count complaint in the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas against CR-One and Cuyahoga Heights (referred jointly as \"appellees\") for breach of contract, violation of Ohio's Prompt Payment Act, unjust enrichment, and foreclosure of a mechanic's lien. Cuyahoga Heights counterclaimed, asserting fraud and tortious interference with business relations based upon the filing of the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Acting on the parties' cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court dismissed all of MMS' claims, except the breach of contract claim. After a bench trial, the trial court found that MMS failed to show that appellees breached an agreement to compensate it for any amount over the original contract. The court found in favor of Cuyahoga Heights as to both of its counterclaims. The court also sanctioned MMS for maintaining the mechanic's lien and for unnecessary motion practice. MMS appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The facts giving rise to the claims asserted in this case, unless noted, are not disputed and are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Cuyahoga Heights owns commercial properties throughout northern Ohio, including property located at 4600 Oak Harbor Road, in Fremont, Ohio. In 2013, it hired CR-One to act as general contractor and to prepare the vacant facility for occupancy. At the time, Cuyahoga Heights was negotiating with \"Unican\" to lease the facility. Among other items, Unican manufactures paint cans. It was to occupy part of the property and operate a single manufacturing line, with the hope that it would add lines, and with them, the need for more space in the future. Accordingly, Cuyahoga Heights hired CR-One to refurbish the facility in four phases. Phases two, three and four would be added when and if the need arose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} CR-One's President, Matt Ambrose (\"Ambrose\"), invited MMS to submit a quote to clean, prime, and paint the walls and ceiling of phase I, which consisted of 105,717 square feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Cuyahoga Heights and CR-One share common owners. Real estate developers Christopher Semarjian and Stuart Lichter are the majority owners of Cuyahoga Heights and the co-owners of CR-One. Semarjian testified that CR-One is Cuyahoga Heights' exclusive general contractor, although CR-One occasionally performs contracting service for other clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} MMS is in the commercial painting business. Sean McGarry (\"Sean\") is MMS' estimator and project manager. Sean has been in the painting industry for 26 years and has estimated thousands of projects. In preparation for quoting this job, Sean was given complete access to the property. After visiting the property, Sean provided CR-One with a quote of $118,340, which amounted to $1.12 per square foot. Sean estimated that the project would require six weeks, three to prime and clean and three weeks to paint. The evidence\n   shows that CR-One had no input on the methods or products used by MMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On February 13, 2013, prior to executing a written contract, MMS set up at the property. As it did so, MMS asked CR-One for access to water so that it could power wash the surfaces, to turn off the electricity, and to increase the temperature to at least 50 degrees so that paint could adhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} CR-One delivered heaters to the property and hung tarps to enclose phase I so as to prevent heat from escaping. The temperature improved when the heaters were delivered. MMS did not raise any concerns about temperature after the delivery of the heaters. At MMS' request, CR-One also delivered water trucks to allow MMS to power wash. To maintain safety while power washing, Ambrose proposed that CR-One would shut off the electricity in segments (so MMS would have access to lighting and power), and he asked MMS to cover the electrical bus ducts to avoid electrocution. MMS did not object to this proposal or state that it would result in extra cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Despite asking for access for water, MMS decided to \"blow down\" the surfaces of the property, rather than to power wash. This change was not done at CR-One's request. On February 28, 2013, after MMS had decided to change its cleaning method, Ambrose asked Sean for a breakdown of the costs for the project, including the \"blow down.\" On March 6, 2013, Sean responded that the cost would remain $118,340.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} MMS' paint supplier on the project was Glidden. On February 20, 2013, Glidden agent, Brian Conroy, recommended that MMS should prime \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all surface\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   areas (100%)\" with a primer called \"Devguard 436.\" At trial, Sean testified that he viewed the recommendation to prime the entire project as \"overkill.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} MMS began working on the property on or about February 21, 2013, still without a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On March 7, 2013, MMS, through its president, Brendan McGarry, signed a \"SUBCONTRACT AGREEMENT BETWEEN GENERAL CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR.\" Before sending it to Ambrose for CR-One's signature, Brendan unilaterally made some handwritten changes to a few provisions, but he left undisturbed the originally quoted price, notwithstanding that, by then, (1) MMS had decided to change its cleaning methods and (2) it was aware of its paint supplier's recommendation that MMS prime the whole structure, not just to \"spot prime.\" The quoted price included \"spot priming,\" which means only priming certain areas, not the entire structure. Sean reviewed the contract and advised Brendan that it was acceptable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Paragraph 2 of the contract provides, \"[f]or performing the scope of work, The Subcontractor will be paid in monthly payments, based on completion percentages, the following not-to-exceed amount: $118,340.00.\" The term \"scope of work\" is used throughout the contract, but is not defined. CR-One's president, Ambrose, told Sean that he wanted phase I properly cleaned, primed, and painted to an industry standard. Sean testified that MMS's promise to CR-One was more than just that MMS \"would clean and paint,\" but instead that phase I would be cleaned, primed, and painted \"appropriately\" so that \"[t]he paint would stay on the wall\" and the \"paint would stay on the ceiling,\" or else MMS would fix the problems at MMS's cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On or about March 15, 2013, CR-One asked MMS to vacate the property and to stop working, due to Cuyahoga\n   Heights' uncertainty over lease negotiations with Unican.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On March 25, 2013, during the shutdown, Sean sent Ambrose an email (the \"March 2013 Email\"). In it, Sean stated that he had \"anticipated maybe 20-30% of the [old] paint would come off but it is more like 70-80%.\" Sean then relayed MMS' decision to prime \"the entire structure to prevent further rusting.\" The email then lists four costs after the word \"Add\": $55,000 for primer; $23,400 for labor; $4,000 for overtime; and $3,000 for equipment rental delays, for a total of $85,400.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Paragraph 13 of the contract provides for a process whereby \"change orders\" can be added to the contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sean testified that the March 2013 email, quoted above, amounts to a change order request because he used the word \"Add\" at the bottom of it. Ambrose testified that neither party ever discussed the change order provision and that MMS never requested a change order for changed specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} On April 2, 2013, Sean added a chain to the March 2013 email asking, \"let me know if you [h]ave had a chance to review our costs due to changing the Spec and Overtime and Rental delays.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On CR-One's behalf, Ambrose signed the contract on April 5, 2013 and returned it to Sean. He left undisturbed those handwritten changes made by Brandon, except to initialize them. Ambrose did not address Sean's recent email regarding the increased costs. Likewise, upon receipt of the fully executed contact, Sean did not object to its price or terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On or about May 15, 2013, MMS returned to the property to resume working. Ambrose told Sean that he would discuss \"with ownership\" MMS' delay costs caused by the shutdown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 24} When MMS returned to the property, there were \"obvious defects,\" according to the trial court's findings of fact. MMS did not dispute this during trial, and the email correspondence bear this out. Specifically, there were spots of rust \"bleeding through\" newly painted surfaces and new paint was peeling and chipping off the surface. Ambrose testified that falling paint chips posed safety and quality control problems for its tenant. Ambrose and Sean had many conversations about MMS's defective work, and MMS never objected or claimed that its work was not defective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In compliance with Paragraph 15, CR-One advised MMS in writing that its defective work was jeopardizing completion of the project. CR-One did not, however, instruct MMS how to fix the defective work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Sean, the defects in MMS's work were covered under MMS's warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On May 16, 2013, upon resuming the project, Sean re-sent the March 2013 email to Ambrose. He wrote, \"I should be able to get there * * * [t]o work on a fix for the bleed through. We need to work out the extras for [t]he delay and changing the specifications. Maybe we could do this on a Cost plus basis. I sent you this estimate back in March.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 27} That same day, Ambrose responded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Sean; As you are aware, we are at a critical time on this project in which we need to be out of the way for the tenant to set up his assembly line and we need your resolution on deficient work in order to be clear for him. I will have a check for you either today or tomorrow as discussed, yet ownership here along with the tenant is eyeing your performance to fix the here and now and then finish the project.\n   <em>\n    I will absolutely discuss the extras you had presented to me and I assure you we will both be happy in the end, yet I cannot discuss that until we are on course for the here and now\n   </em>\n   . (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Ambrose explained at trial that he told Sean that MMS could have \"the opportunity to bid competitively on future projects including those in the building.\" He added that this future business would make MMS \"happy,\" because MMS could recover cost overages through profits on future jobs if those jobs were run more efficiently. It is undisputed that CR-One never agreed to pay for any additional amounts for \"changed specifications.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Sean testified that it was his \"understanding\" that MMS would get a change order for the delay, and that MMS would be hired on the other phases of the project. Sean testified that Ambrose agreed to \"help me out as much as he could right now and then, and then fully help me out, you know, when we did the work on the rest of the building.\" Brendan also interpreted Ambrose's email as a guarantee that CR-One would pay \"something above MMS' costs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 30} As it corrected the problems, MMS decided to use a different primer, but it never discussed that primer with CR-One. The record also indicates that MMS power washed some, if not all, of phase I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 31} On June 13, 2013, Sean wrote to Ambrose that MMS' costs \"may be over $200,000.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 32} On or about July 9, 2013, MMS sent CR-One a quote to clean, prime, and paint phases 2, 3, and 4, totaling $538,710, or $2.13 per square foot. Ambrose responded that, \"I cannot turn the remaining work loose without getting out of the first phase. Got to out-done/ done by August 19. I will write a check to you the beginning of next week, please step this up.\" To that, Sean responded, by email dated July 25, 2013, \"I am glad that [my rest-of-building quote] works for you in your budget.\" Ambrose testified at trial that he did not know what Sean meant because and he had not yet developed a budget for the other phases and he had not indicated that Sean's quote was or would be accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 33} On September 4, 2013, Sean provided a timeline for finishing the project. He included a request to \"collect the remainder of the [contract price of] $118,000 and the delay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 34} During the course of the project, MMS' controller, Linda Vasquez, sent two payment applications to CR-One. The first one, on March 31, 2013, requested $94,500 and the second one, on October 31, 2013, sought $12,006. Both payment applications were signed under oath by Vasquez, do not reference any extra work, and state that there were no change orders. The applications contains a field for \"Net Change by Change Orders.\" They also contain a grid entitled \"Change Order Summary,\" in which the preparer can insert amounts for change orders. In each designated area in which change orders could be reflected, Vasquez inserted zero (\"0\") dollars. Vasquez testified that she did not include a request for additional monies for any additional work or charges because she knew that CR-One would have rejected the payment application if she had done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Lien waivers accompanied both payment applications. A lien waiver is an acknowledgement by the party seeking payment that it will not file a lien against the property for the amount of the compensation received. The two payment applications total $106,506. Thus, as of October 31, 2013, the full contract price had been billed by MMS, less 10%. The ten percent that was not billed represents \"retainage.\" Retainage is money taken out of each invoice, to be paid by the general contractor at the conclusion of the project. The retainage in this case was $11,834. As of the trial date in this case, MMS had not submitted a payment application or invoice for the retainage amount, despite Ambrose's request that it do so. In its decision, the trial court ordered CR-One to pay MMS that amount, and CR-One does not dispute that it is owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 36} On October 3, 2013, Sean sent Ambrose an email requesting $37,000 in \"delay costs\" that MMS alleged it incurred as a result of the two month delay. Ambrose testified that he was expecting a $5,000 to $7,000 cost for the delay. As he said he would, Ambrose discussed MMS's delay claim with CR-One's co-owner, Christopher Semarjian (\"Semarjian\"). The trial court found that, \"Semarjian, with Ambrose's recommendation, rejected the request.\" On December 30, 2013, Ambrose communicated the denial of the delay claim to Sean via email. Ambrose explained, \"[l]ooks like delay claim will not be entertained. There was quite a bit of damage * * * due to pressure washing that was done. This ended up costing us more money to repair and along with everything else put us over the budget significantly.\" Sean did not object or otherwise complain that CR-One denied its delay claim. In its decision, the trial court ordered CR-One to pay MMS $7,000 in compensation for the delay, in addition to the retainage amount. In all, the court ordered CR-One to pay MMS $18,834. CR-One did not appeal the judgment or otherwise object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 37} On November 6, 2013, MMS submitted a quote for Phase II of the project in the amount of $382,610.00, or $5.20 per square foot. Ambrose responded to the quote with questions. He also pointed out that areas in phase 1 still suffered from \"bleed through.\" To that specific issue, Sean responded, \"[i]f you want me to touch up in Phase 1 let me know if I can coordinate with Gary. Let me know if you would like me to proceed.\" At trial, Sean testified that he did not remember whether Ambrose ever called him in response to this email. Ambrose testified that he never spoke to Sean about it and he did not authorize MMS to come back to the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Sean contacted Gary Paxson, a Unican representative, to arrange for access to the property. MMS then sent painter Duane Blake there to perform \"touch up\" work. Blake's last day at the property was November 22, 2013. The trial court found that \"CR-One was without any knowledge of this work and did not order it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 39} On January 31, 2014, Vasquez executed a mechanic's lien in the amount of $269,960.00 in favor of MMS against the property, which it recorded with the Sandusky County Recorder, and sent to CR-One. Upon receipt, Ambrose contacted MMS and demanded that it be withdrawn. Ambrose sent two writings to MMS, each one claiming that the lien was filed in error or fraudulent and must be removed. MMS refused to release the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Cuyahoga Heights learned of the mechanic's lien in November of 2014. At that time, it was in the process of financing the property with lender FC Bank. Its request for a loan had been approved, and it had received a \"term sheet\" from the\n   bank. Once the lien was discovered, however, processing of the loan \"ground everything to a halt.\" To maintain its financing arrangement with the bank, Cuyahoga Heights took out a bond on the property with SureTec, a bonding company. Cuyahoga Heights had to make a deposit of $405,000 into an escrow account and pay $8,100 in premiums. The deposit that was placed in an escrow account was unavailable for use throughout the 456 days that the lien was in place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cuyahoga Height proffered evidence that it suffered $63,570 in damages based upon the loss of use of those funds plus the premiums. MMS did not challenge the calculation method or damages amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 41} On October 24, 2014, MMS filed a four count complaint in the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas against appellees for breach of contract, violation of Ohio's Prompt Payment Act, unjust enrichment, and foreclosure of the mechanic's lien. Cuyahoga Heights counterclaimed, asserting fraud and tortious interference with business relations based upon the filing of the lien. On December 21, 2015, MMS moved for leave to file an amended complaint. It sought to add claims of fraud and breach of a duty to act in good faith against the appellees. The trial court denied MMS leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The appellees filed for summary judgment as to counts 1, 2, and 3, and, Cuyahoga Heights filed a separate motion for summary judgment as to the alleged invalid mechanic's lien. MMS also filed for summary judgment as to Cuyahoga Heights' counterclaims. By judgment dated April 29, 2016, the trial court granted, in part, the appellees' motions, dismissing all claims asserted against them, except for MMS' breach of contract claim (Count 1). The trial court denied, in toto, MMS' cross motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Following a two day bench trial, the lower court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law. In its December 29, 2016 decision, the court ruled against MMS as to the breach of contract claim, based upon its finding that MMS failed to show that appellees breached an agreement to compensate it for any amount over the original contract. It ruled in favor of Cuyahoga Heights as to both counterclaims, and it awarded $63,570 in damages. It also sanctioned MMS for \"persistent maintenance of claims premised on a late-filed Mechanic's Lien\" and for unnecessary motion practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 44} At issue in this appeal are rulings by the trial court as to three pretrial motions: the denial of MMS' motion for leave to amend its complaint, the denial of MMS' motion for summary judgment as to Cuyahoga Heights' counterclaims, and the grant of Cuyahoga Height's motion for summary judgment as to MMS' claim to foreclose on the mechanic's lien. The remaining issues on appeal involve the trial court's findings of fact and conclusion of law, following the bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    MMS' Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   1.

MMS requested leave to add claims of fraud and breach of a duty to act in good faith against appellees. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that it was untimely, prejudicial-because it would require the reopening of discovery-and \"pointless\" because MMS' claims failed as a matter of law. On appeal, MMS assigns error only as it relates to its fraud claim. It argues that it expeditiously moved for leave once it learned of its potential claim and that it sufficiently pled operative facts of fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Before a responsive pleading is served, a plaintiff may file an amendment to the complaint without leave of court. Thereafter, Civ.R. 15(A) directs a court to grant leave to amend freely \"when justice so requires.\" The decision whether to allow a party leave to amend a complaint lies exclusively within the discretion of the trial court, and the ruling will not be disturbed on appeal by a reviewing court absent an affirmative showing of an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Wilmington Steel Prod., Inc. v.

MMS failed to allege, much less to demonstrate, anything other than a vague promise by CR-One to pay MMS an undefined amount, at some unknown time in the future. Moreover, there are no facts to suggest that Ambrose, when he made the \"promise,\" had no intention of keeping it. Because MMS, as the movant, failed to present operative facts in support of its new allegations, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to amend.\n   <em>\n    Solowitch v.

In its proposed fraud claim, MMS alleged that Ambrose promised to present its claim for extra costs and its delay claim to \"ownership.\" In reality, MMS claims that Ambrose unilaterally denied those claims. The only evidence on this point was offered by (1) Ambrose who testified during his deposition that \"the ownership, Chris Semarjian\" decided that MMS' delay claim would not be considered; and (2) Semarjian who testified during his deposition that Ambrose came to him to discuss the fact that MMS was seeking \"extra compensation for work performed\n   in [p]hase 1.\" Semarjian asked whether the claim was \"valid\" and whether \"we had changed any scope.\" Ambrose answered \"no\" to both, and Semarjian \"moved on because I didn't think it was realistic.\" Thus, the record on this point, at the time MMS moved for leave, was that Ambrose was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the decision-maker with regard to MMS' delay claim and/or claim for extra costs. We find that MMS' proposed fraud claim is both legally and factually flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Finally, to the extent that MMS cites the timing of Semarjian's December 7, 2015 deposition to justify waiting until December 18, 2015 to request leave, that reliance is misplaced. Throughout the legal memoranda filed in this case, MMS laments that it did not know that, while it was negotiating the contract and then performing services under the contract, CR-One and Cuyahoga Heights shared common owners, namely Chris Semarjian and Stuart Lichter. MMS inconsistently argues on the one hand, that this common ownership precluded CR-One from being \"independent\" from Cuyahoga Heights and, on the other, that Ambrose, as the president of CR-One, unilaterally determined that MMS would not be compensated for its extra costs. Either way, MMS acknowledges that \"[a]t the time the promise [to pay its claim] was made [by Ambrose], MMS reasonably relied upon the promise because it did not know the Property's owner and the general contractor were one and the same.\" MMS learned of the co-ownership of the businesses back on September 15, 2015, when it deposed Ambrose. Thus, to the extent that MMS' lack of knowledge of that fact led it to \"rely to its detriment that CR-1 was an independent general contractor,\" MMS learned otherwise in September. It offers no basis for waiting an additional three months before seeking leave. \"Where a motion for leave to file an amended complaint is not timely tendered and there is no apparent reason to justify the delay, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying the amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Leo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547609\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/1268/\">\n    2017-Ohio-2690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547609\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/1268/\">\n    89 N.E.3d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10 citing\n   <em>\n    Vitek v.

Due to MMS' failure to seek leave on a timely basis and its failure to allege legally sufficient facts, supported by the record, we cannot find an abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying MMS' motion for leave to amend its complaint.

In its second assignment of error, MMS argues that the trial court erred in granting Cuyahoga Height's motion for summary judgment as to MMS' foreclosure of its mechanic's lien claim. It asserts that there was an issue of fact regarding whether the mechanic's lien was valid, which precluded dismissal of its claim at the summary judgment phase.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, in its third assignment of error, MMS argues that the trial court\n   should have granted summary judgment in its favor as to Cuyahoga Heights' counterclaims.

It premised its argument on MMS' second application for payment, signed by Vasquez on October 31, 2013, in which she represented that 100% of the work, excluding retainage, had been completed. Assuming the accuracy of that date, the lien would have been due no later than January 14, 2014. Cuyahoga Heights argued that the lien filing date of February 5, 2014 was late and rendered it invalid, as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 62} MMS countered that the payment application established that the work was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   fully completed by that date, specifically an amount reflecting 10% of the contract price. MMS argued that the project was not completed until November 22, 2013 when its painter, Duane Blake, finished doing touch up work and correcting bleed through issues at the property. Using that date, MMS' lien filing 75 days later, on February 5, 2014, was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 63} The summary judgment evidence on this point established that Ambrose sent an email to Sean McGarry on November 6, 2013, with several agenda items, including to complain that \"a number of areas in phase 1 are [still] bleeding through.\" The next day, Sean responded, \"If you want me to touch up in Phase 1 let Me know if I can coordinate with Gary. Let me know if you would like me to proceed.\" [sic] Ambrose responded generally but not as to that issue. MMS, then, contacted the tenant of the building and arranged for MMS painter Duane Blake to return to the job site to paint over the rusted areas. The parties disagree as to the legal significance, if any, of that visit by Blake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 64} In its judgment entry granting Cuyahoga Height's motion for summary judgment, the court found,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [T]here is no question that [MMS] did re-enter the warehouse premises and attempt 'to extend our lien rights' which [Sean McGarry] indicated were to expire on 11/21/13. When paired with the deposition testimony of Belinda Vasquez, * * * there is no genuine issue of fact that the lien filed on February 5, 2014 was untimely. Thus, [MMS'] prayer to foreclose on the mechanic's lien is dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Without referring to it by name, the trial court quoted from an internal email from Sean to brother, Brandan McGarry, the president of MMS. In that email, Sean wrote that, \"our lien rights expire next Thurs 11-21-13. * * * I also spoke to Gary the plant manager about touching up area [sic] that have rust bleed through (I'm trying to touch up before 11-21-13 to extend our lien rights) * * *.\" The trial court concluded that the email,\n   paired with the payment application, established that the lien was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 66} In support of the trial court's decision, Cuyahoga Heights argues that Blake's visit was \"surreptitious\" and \"unauthorized\" and \"corrective,\" and amounted to nothing more than \"minor touch up painting work.\" It cites a string of cases for the proposition that unnecessary and unsolicited tinkering and repair do not extend the last day of performance for purposes of establishing the lien filing deadlines.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walter v.

These facts were material to determining whether the lien was timely, and MMS, as the non-movant, was entitled to have those facts construed in its favor. We find that the trial court erred when it resolved those material facts against MMS and when it dismissed Count 4 via summary judgment. Therefore, we find MMS' second assignment\n   of error well-taken. As set forth below, however, because the lien affidavit formed the basis for Cuyahoga Height's counterclaims, the validity of the lien was, in fact, fully litigated at trial. MMS was given the opportunity, and did, put forth evidence demonstrating that it had a good faith basis to assert in its lien affidavit that its last day of work was November 22, 2013. However, the trial court resolved that issue against MMS. It specifically found, in the context of resolving the fraud claim, that \"MMS pretextually arranged with the tenant at the Property to perform this work in order to inappropriately extend its lien rights\" and \"MMS falsely represented the last day of work.\" As an appellate court, we are not fact finders. We do not weigh the evidence or judge the credibility of evidence. \"Our role is to determine whether there is relevant, competent, and credible evidence upon which the fact finder could base his or her judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Thompson Thrift Constr. v Lynn,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547624\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/249/\">\n    2017-Ohio-1530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547624\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/249/\">\n    89 N.E.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 93. We find that there is competent and credible evidence to support the trial court's determination that MMS' work at the property in November of 2013 was done without CR-One's knowledge or consent and undertaken for the purpose of extending the lien deadline. Therefore, we sustain the trial court's conclusion that the lien was invalid. Accordingly, we find that the trial court's dismissal of MMS' foreclosure claim via summary judgment, while erroneous, was harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 70} This brings us to MMS' third and sixth assignments of error. Both concern Cuyahoga Heights' counterclaims for fraud and tortious interference with a business relationship. MMS argues that the trial court improperly denied its motion for summary judgment (third assignment of error) and, following the bench trial, improperly found in favor of Cuyahoga Heights as to those claims (sixth assignment of error). We agree with MMS that the trial court improperly denied its motion for summary judgment as to those claims. Accordingly, we sustain its third assignment of error, rendering moot its sixth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 71} In its counterclaim, Cuyahoga Heights argued that the last day that MMS worked at the property was September 25, 2013; that any work done after that, specifically in November, 2013 was without appellees' permission or knowledge; and that MMS' purpose in returning to the property was to \"artificially\" extend the deadline to record a mechanic's lien. Cuyahoga Heights argues that MMS made the following false statement in its lien affidavit: \"The last of the labor or work was performed or material was furnished to [the Real Property on] November 22, 2013.\" (Counterclaim at \u00b6 13). Cuyahoga Heights asserts that MMS knew that statement was false and that it, Cuyahoga Heights, relied to its detriment on the false statement. It argues, \"[b]ecause of [the lien] the Real Property could not be offered as collateral for financing and [Cuyahoga Height's] lender refused to extend financing to [it]. In order to obtain the necessary financing, [Cuyahoga Heights] had to * * * pay premiums and incur other costs to 'bond off' MMS's Mechanic's Lien, and has been forced to detain significant funds as security for MMS's fraudulent lien.\" Cuyahoga Heights argues that MMS is liable to it for fraud and tortuously interfering with its business relationship with its lender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Without comment, the trial court denied MMS' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 73} On appeal, MMS argues that Cuyahoga Heights failed to make a prima facie case as to either counterclaim. As to the fraud claim, MMS argues that Cuyahoga\n   Heights (1) could not demonstrate that MMS made a misrepresentation on the lien affidavit or (2) that it relied upon any misrepresentation to its detriment. As to the tortious interference claim, MMS argues that because Cuyahoga Heights failed to introduce any evidence that MMS knew of its relationship with its lender, that claim failed as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 74} A claim of common-law fraud requires proof of the following elements: (a) a representation or, where there is a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact, (b) which is material to the transaction at hand, (c) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred, (d) with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it, (e) justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment, and (f) a resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance.\n   <em>\n    Russ v.

Rather, Cuyahoga Heights claims that the lien interfered with the processing of its loan and its ability to use the property as collateral without \"bonding off\" the lien. The summary judgment evidence on this point was offered by Cuyahoga Height's property manager, Gregory Scott. At the time the lien was filed, Cuyahoga Heights had been approved for financing with FC Bank, and it had received a \"term sheet,\" setting forth the terms of the loan. The mechanic's lien was discovered when it appeared on the title report, which was prepared in furtherance of the loan. After that, the loan \"process ground to a halt.\" In order to maintain the loan, FC Bank required Cuyahoga Heights to \"bond off\" the lien. The purchase of the bond allowed the loan to proceed, but with it, came $8,100 in premiums.

CR-One, through Ambrose, did not accept MMS' repeated attempts to recover those costs and CR-One never agreed to any change in its terms in writing, as required by the contract. Upon review, we find insufficient evidence in the record of a clear and unequivocal act demonstrating CR-One's intent to waive the change order provision.

In its decision, the trial court cited two instances of frivolous conduct by MMS: its \"persistent maintenance of claims premised on a\n   late-filed Mechanic's Lien\" and its \"filing of motions and papers accusing Ambrose of dishonesty under oath * * * result[ing] in extensive briefing.\" The trial court ordered the parties to brief the issue of attorney's fees and costs attributable to that frivolous conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 107} Appellees submitted an affidavit and billing records seeking $65,419.26 in sanctions. MMS did not respond to that issue, but on January 24, 2017, it filed a motion to stay all proceedings, pending its appeal. The court granted MMS' motion. Thus, no finding with regard to sanctions has been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   {\u00b6 108} A ruling on a contempt motion is not a final appealable order unless the trial court has made a specific finding of contempt and has imposed a penalty or sanction.\n   <em>\n    Kimani v.
