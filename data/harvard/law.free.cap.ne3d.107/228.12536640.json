Appellee is Katharine Moore in her capacity as Executor of the Estate of her father, Robert L. Moore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2010, Robert L. Moore engaged the Dagger Johnston law firm (\"Dagger\") to re-write his Last Will and Testament in order to leave his home and the 31/2 acres of land on which it was situated (collectively, the \"Property\") to his two children. Dagger assigned the task to attorney Ray Michalski. Instead of leaving Moore's Property to his children, Michalski's secretary or probate assistant made minor revisions to Moore's existing Will that left the Property to Moore's then estranged second wife, Joan Ellis (\"Ellis\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Confronted with Ellis's claim to the Property, the Estate filed a declaratory judgment action asking the probate court to interpret the 2010 Will. Faced with the reality that (1) the 2010 Will drafted by Michalski had, in fact, left the Property to Ellis, (2) the probate judge instructed plaintiff and Ellis to work things out, and (3) the Executor had a fiduciary obligation to preserve as much of the Estate as possible, Appellee was forced to compromise. In the settlement that was ultimately negotiated, the Estate retained some of the value of the Property, but was required to make cash payments to Ellis and her attorneys. The settlement required the Estate to: (1) pay a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Property to Ellis; (2) pay Ellis's attorneys' fees in the probate proceedings; and (3) waive the Executor's fees. In addition, the Estate incurred its own attorneys' fees and costs in the probate proceedings because of Michalski's malpractice and Ellis' consequent claim to the Property. The Property was sold to pay the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellee filed its Complaint against Appellants on March 22, 2016. Generally, the Complaint alleged legal malpractice by Appellees in the drafting of a Will for the decedent, Robert L. Moore. Appellants never properly filed an Answer in the case.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   1T. at 42-53. The trial court dismissed Katharine Moore, individually, as a plaintiff on the pleadings by entry of August 8, 2016. Appellants then moved for summary judgment against The Estate of Robert L. Moore on June 12, 2017, arguing against attorney fees incurred in presenting the malpractice case and that the claims had been waived by settlement. The trial court denied the Motion for Summary Judgment by Entry and Order of August 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Prior to the start of trial, the Appellee waived its motion for default judgment and requested the matter proceed to a jury trial. (1T. at 50). The trial court further ruled that the Appellees would not be permitted to make arguments concerning affirmative defenses of waiver or contributory negligence because they were not plead in accordance with Civ.R. 8. (1T. at 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The case proceeded to a jury trial on September 12, 2017, and a final entry verdict and jury interrogatories were filed September 15, 2017. Specifically, the jury found $8,375.00 in economic loss, $7,000.00 in \"non-economic loss\", $70,000.00 for attorney's fees incurred in bringing and maintaining the legal malpractice case, and $5,125.00 in attorney's fees incurred in a probate court dispute with Robert L. Moore's wife, Joan Ellis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Appellants submit that this case is on appeal mainly because the trial court improperly allowed the Complaint to proceed to trial on claims for attorney's fees incurred in prosecuting the legal malpractice action, as opposed to fees incurred in attempting to rectify purported malpractice, and in allowing claims for non-economic damages. (Appellant's Brief at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Assignments of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant's raise six assignments of error,\n   {\u00b6 9} \"I.

In other words, Appellants contend that where a client is required to engage new counsel for a separate action proximately resulting from his attorney's negligence, whether legal fees paid by the plaintiff to prosecute a subsequent legal malpractice action against the offending lawyer may be awarded in the legal malpractice action as an item of special damages is a question of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \" 'When a court's judgment is based on an erroneous interpretation of the law, an abuse-of-discretion standard is not appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swartzentruber v.

The trial court in this case correctly held that corrective fees were recoverable, and this ruling was not appealed. The trial court's ruling that initial fees were not recoverable was appealed, and the Court of Appeals properly reversed.

The decedent instructed a lawyer regarding his desire, and the lawyer drafted a Will that accomplished the opposite of what the decedent intended. The error proximately resulted in the loss of unique property that had economic and noneconomic value to the decedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Appellant's Fifth Assignment of Error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In their Sixth Assignment of Error, Appellants argue that the trial court erred in denying summary judgment and failing to instruct the jury on Appellee's waiver of a malpractice claim by settling with Joan Ellis in probate proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF APPELLATE REVIEW.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Summary judgment proceedings present the appellate court with the unique opportunity of reviewing the evidence in the same manner as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Smiddy v.

We note Civ.R. 8(C) states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, want of consideration for a negotiable instrument, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations,\n   <em>\n    waiver\n   </em>\n   , and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   (Emphasis added).

(1T. at 50). The trial court further ruled that the Appellees would not be permitted to make arguments concerning affirmative defenses of waiver or contributory negligence because they were not plea in accordance with Civ.R. 8. (1T. at 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 44} The Appellant has not separately assigned as error or argued that the trial court's express finding that Appellant has waived the argument of Appellee's waiver of a malpractice claim by settling with Joan Ellis in probate proceedings was in error. Appellants cannot circumvent the trial court's express ruling that Appellants waived this argument by seeking to nullify the trial court's ruling on Appellant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 45} However, the result does not change if we review the trial court's decision of Appellants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

According to Defendants, Plaintiff already had \"a full and fair opportunity to challenge Ellis's positions\" in the probate litigation but declined to do so. (MSJ at 7). Specifically, Defendants assert that \"enforcement of the Antenuptial Agreement against Ellis was highly likely, but the Estate knowingly and voluntarily waived its ability to gain such a judicial determination.\" (MSJ at 6). Therefore, Defendants ask the Court to preclude Plaintiff from pursuing its malpractice claim in this Court. The Court declines to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendants rely exclusively on the case of\n   <em>\n    Estate of Callahan v. Allen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1763202\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/97/749/\">\n    97 Ohio App. 3d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=647%20N.E.2d%20543\">\n    647 N.E.2d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] (1994) in support of its argument, In\n   <em>\n    Callahan,\n   </em>\n   a probate attorney allegedly provided inaccurate advice to an estate with regard to inheritance disclaimers and tax deductions. The estate subsequently entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS instead of appealing the issue. The\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   court held that the estate had waived any malpractice claim against the probate attorney, as the tax appeals board could have interpreted the IRS provisions differently and, in essence, found that the attorney's\n   advice was actually sound. Therefore, the estate failed to establish proximate cause, i.e., that the estate would have prevailed in the IRS action but for the attorney's negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   First, the Court notes that\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   , a decision by the Fourth District Court of Appeals is not binding on this Court. Second, the Court finds\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the case-at-hand in one important aspect: the malpractice alleged in\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   \"arose in the course of strategic decisions made by the attorney,\" and the estate had not shown that the attorney's interpretations of the tax provisions were clearly unreasonable or unsupported by law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DePugh v. Sladoje\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"852603\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/111/675/#p686\">\n    111 Ohio App. 3d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 686,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=676%20N.E.2d%201231\">\n    676 N.E.2d 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (recognizing this distinction). Here, Defendants can hardly argue that their disregard of the Testator's wishes was a \"strategic decision\": it is alleged that Defendants blatantly ignored the Testator's wishes and sloppily drafted a Will that expressly contradicted them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Third, the Court disagrees with Defendants' position that if the Antenuptial Agreement was presented to a court for determination, its enforcement \"against Ellis was highly likely,\" and no malpractice claim would exist. (MSJ at 6). Defendants appear to forget that the Antenuptial Agreement contains two relevant clauses, One provision in the Agreement stated that Ms. Ellis renounced, waived, and relinquished all spousal, dower, and inheritance rights to any real property then owned by the Testator. But this provision was subject to another: one that gave Testator the overriding authority to bequeath real property to whomever he chose, including Ms.\n   Ellis. Thus, even if a court had found the Antenuptial Agreement enforceable, the issue of whether Ms. Ellis was entitled to the Testator's residence would still depend on the provisions of the Testator's Last Will and Testament, i.e., the basis of Plaintiff's malpractice claim. For these reasons, Defendants' second argument is not well-taken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Entry and Order,\n   </em>\n   filed Aug. 14, 2017 at 7-9 (Docket Entry # 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE FOR APPEAL.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   1).\n   <em>\n    Whether after independent review of the record Appellee waived her right to pursue a legal malpractice claim against Appellant by entering into a settlement agreement with Ms. Ellis in the context of their probate litigation.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 47} On appeal, Appellants again assert that enforcement of the Antenuptial Agreement against Ellis was highly likely, but the Estate knowingly and voluntarily waived its ability to gain such a judicial determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Appellants' argument is somewhat disingenuous. Moore instructed Michalski to draft a Will leaving the Property to his children. Because of sloppy draftsmanship and sloppy proofreading, Michalski betrayed the wishes of his client by bequeathing the Property to an ex-wife of Moore. Nowhere does Appellant point to any part of the trial court record in which Michalski claimed that he purposely drafted the Will to leave the Property to Ellis in a strategic, well-reasoned legal decision to rely on the Antenuptial Agreement to effectuate Moore's intent that the Property go to his children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The Antenuptial Agreement contains two relevant clauses.
