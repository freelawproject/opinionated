The defendant now directly appeals his convictions, alleging errors by the trial judge and the prosecutor. He also argues that the Commonwealth did not present sufficient evidence to support his convictions. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The jury were warranted in finding the following facts. In December, 2012, Mike,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a twelve year old boy, lived with his grandparents in Dartmouth. Mike was confused about his sexuality and sought the advice of his friend Dana,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who was then seventeen years old. Dana suggested that Mike contact the defendant for advice. Mike sent the defendant a friend request on Facebook; the defendant accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Mike and the defendant began corresponding via Facebook's messenger feature. The two exchanged a series of messages between December 27, 2012, and January 4, 2013, that became increasingly sexually explicit. They discussed engaging in various sexual acts with each other, including oral and anal sex. The defendant initiated some of the conversations; Mike initiated others. During these exchanges, the defendant sent Mike several photographs of himself, including a photograph of his covered groin area and one of his exposed penis. The defendant repeatedly urged Mike to reciprocate by sending photographs of himself and of his penis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant also repeatedly attempted to make plans to meet Mike in person. He encouraged Mike to leave his grandparents' house, or to have his grandparents drop him off in downtown New Bedford, so that they could meet and perform the sexual acts they had discussed. In one message, Mike gave the defendant his grandparents' address; the defendant replied that he would drive by and sent Mike an aerial photograph of a house, which Mike confirmed was his grandparents' house. A few days later, the defendant messaged Mike to tell him that he was on Mike's street. In addition, when Mike told the defendant that he could leave his grandparents' house to walk in the woods behind the house, the defendant replied, \"woods are thin except by the pond\"; when Mike asked, \"u want to do it near the pond?\" the defendant answered, \"better here in a bed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A few days later, Mike's aunt discovered these messages and contacted the Dartmouth police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Required findings of not guilty\n   </em>\n   . The defendant first argues that the trial judge should have allowed his motion for required findings of not guilty as to both charges. Specifically, the defendant argues that the Commonwealth did not present sufficient evidence to prove that his conversations with Mike constituted child enticement or dissemination of matter harmful to a minor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"In reviewing the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty, we examine the evidence as it stood at the close of the Commonwealth's case, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schmieder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"65657\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/58/300/#p301\">\n    58 Mass.

Here, the defendant sent twelve year old Mike sexually explicit messages and photographs.

The defendant next argues that the trial judge erroneously allowed testimony regarding his sexual relationship with Dana, then a minor, which he claims constituted prejudicial propensity evidence. He also argues that it was improper for the Commonwealth to cross-examine the defendant's technology expert, over his objection, regarding the presence of sexually explicit photographs on the defendant's cellular telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Relationship with Dana\n   </em>\n   . Generally, evidence of a defendant's prior bad acts is inadmissible for the purpose of demonstrating the defendant's propensity to commit the crimes charged.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Crayton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144342\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/228/#p249\">\n    470 Mass. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249 (2014). However, such evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as \"establish[ing] motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or pattern of operation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144342\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/228/#p249\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144342\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/228/#p249\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   See Mass.

Although the defendant and Dana first met in person, they subsequently engaged in correspondence via Facebook and text messaging. Like the defendant's conversations with Mike, those exchanges began platonically, but then became sexually explicit. Eventually, the defendant and Dana, then age seventeen, engaged in physical sexual activity. This evidence was relevant because one of the elements that the Commonwealth must prove in a child enticement prosecution is that the defendant intended to engage in criminal activity. See\n   <em>\n    Disler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788806\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/216/#p222\">\n    451 Mass. at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since intent is often not susceptible to direct proof, the Commonwealth must frequently resort to alternative sources of evidence.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Casale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"816139\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/381/167/#p173\">\n    381 Mass. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (1980). Here, the similarity between the defendant's relationships with Dana and Mike and their temporal proximity\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   were probative of his intent to engage in sexual activity with Mike. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083709\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/70/757/#p765\">\n    70 Mass. App. Ct. 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 765 (2007) (defendant's possession of photographs of young girls probative of whether he intentionally touched young girl). Furthermore, the defendant's relationship with Mike began through Dana, who put Mike in touch with the defendant when Dana encouraged Mike to speak with the defendant after Mike confided in Dana about his sexual confusion. Thus, the judge properly admitted evidence of the defendant's sexual relationship with Dana because it \"was inextricably intertwined with the facts of the case and essential to the jury's understanding of the entire picture.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842175\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/79/179/#p188\">\n    79 Mass.

The defendant also argues that it was improper for the prosecutor to cross-examine the defendant's technology expert regarding the presence of sexually explicit photographs on the defendant's cellular telephone. Again, while evidence may not be used to suggest a defendant's propensity to commit a certain crime, \"it is admissible for other relevant probative purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tobin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876222\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/392/604/#p613\">\n    392 Mass. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 613 (1984) (quotation omitted). Here, part of the defense strategy was to suggest that someone other than the defendant might have sent Mike the inappropriate messages and photographs. It is clear that the prosecutor's purpose in questioning the expert on the photographs was to rebut such a suggestion, not to suggest that the defendant was predisposed to commit the charged conduct. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670262\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/744/#p754\">\n    454 Mass. 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754-756 (2009) (prosecution entitled to elicit testimony that rebuts defendant's defense). Thus, there was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Unanimity instruction\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the defendant argues that the trial judge should have given the jury a specific unanimity instruction regarding the child enticement charge, because jurors may have convicted the defendant without agreeing on which of the enumerated offenses he intended to commit when he enticed Mike. We disagree. While it is generally true that \"a specific unanimity instruction is appropriate when there is evidence of alternate incidents that could support the charge,\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Federico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4084204\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/70/711/#p719\">\n    70 Mass. App. Ct. 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719 (2007) (quotation omitted), the defendant is mistaken that one was required here. In this case, there was no evidence of separate incidents that could serve as a basis for the defendant's conviction. Rather, \"[the defendant's] conviction was based on a series of electronic 'instant messages' he exchanged with [Mike].\"\n   <em>\n    Disler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788806\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/216/#p222\">\n    451 Mass. at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the general rule that \"when a jury are instructed on two different theories of guilt and return a general verdict, there must be a new trial if the evidence could permit the jury to convict the defendant under only one theory,\" is not applicable here, because the enumerated crimes in the enticement statute \"are not separate theories ....
