Swanson, Kevin A. Shepard, and Michael Rumery. We reproduce the spelling of the defendants' names as they appear in the amended complaint. All of the defendants are named individually and in their official capacity as officials of MCI-Cedar Junction and Souza Baranowski Correctional Center.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   The plaintiffs, Tony Gaskins and Buthchhay Chourb, appeal from a judgment of dismissal of their amended complaint. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The plaintiffs are prisoners in lawful custody of the Department of Correction (DOC). The defendants are various correction officers and officials. As alleged, the defendants at various times improperly lost, destroyed, allowed to be stolen by unknown persons, or confiscated as \"contraband\" some of the plaintiffs' personal property. All of the individual incidents alleged have been the subject of grievance procedures initiated by either Gaskins or Chourb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In their present action, purportedly under G. L. c. 231A (declaratory relief) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Federal civil rights violations), the plaintiffs seek declarations that certain State regulations have \"the force of law\" and that their personal property \"must be returned to\" them; that they have \"a right ... to the safekeeping and delivery of their property\"; and that any lost or destroyed property \"must be replaced in full or [the plaintiffs] be fully compensated monetarily for their loss.\" The judge denied the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary injunction; the judge later, on the defendants' motion pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20754\">\n    365 Mass. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), dismissed the plaintiffs' amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As the judge observed, \"Although framed as a suit for declaratory judgment ..., plaintiffs' complaints are more properly challenging the application of those regulations to grievances each plaintiff filed at one or more DOC institutions. As such, there is an adequate remedy at law without need for declaratory relief.\" See G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 38H, inserted by St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 133 (\"A final decision with respect to a grievance shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with section 14 of chapter 30A\");\n   <em>\n    Grady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848869\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/126/#p135\">\n    83 Mass. App. Ct. 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135-136 (2013). The plaintiffs have not alleged \"sufficient facts [demonstrating that DOC] has 'practices or procedures ... in violation of the Constitution of the United States ... which ... ha[ve] been consistently repeated.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848869\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/126/#p135\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848869\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/126/#p135\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 137 n.9, quoting from G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 2. In sum, the judge properly dismissed the plaintiffs' claims under the declaratory relief act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The judge's dismissal of the plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims was also proper. To succeed under \u00a7 1983, the plaintiffs must first \"prove that the defendant[s] ha[ve] deprived [them] of a right secured by the 'Constitution and laws' of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Mancuso\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Assn\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658441\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/453/116/#p122\">\n    453 Mass. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 122-123 (2009), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Adickes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    S.H.

The plaintiffs' allegations did not implicate such a right, and were therefore properly dismissed under rule 12(b)(6).
