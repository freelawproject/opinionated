(law office), which is controlled by defendant Leonard Y. Nason. An employment agreement obligated the law office to pay the plaintiff a percentage of settlement fees from cases he brought to the firm. The plaintiff was paid accordingly until the defendants refused to pay the fee percentage for settlements generated by the plaintiff but awarded\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he had terminated his employment with the law office. In consequence, the plaintiff filed suit for breach of contract. The defendants now appeal from a summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
