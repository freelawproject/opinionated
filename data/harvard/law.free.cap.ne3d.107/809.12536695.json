We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Martin was charged with violations of R.C. 4511.33, marked lane violations; R.C. 4510.11(A), driving under a suspended license; and R.C. 4511.19(A), operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Martin filed a motion to suppress all evidence. He claims that the arresting police officer did not articulate a reasonable suspicion justifying the initial stop based on the strength of the city's evidence in support of the marked lane violation. According to Martin, the recording of the traffic encounter demonstrated that although the tires of Martin's vehicle touched the lane boundary lines on several occasions, the evidence was insufficient to definitively prove that the tires completely crossed the boundary markers. In the alternative, Martin claims that even if the stop was valid, the officer lacked a reasonable and articulable suspicion justifying the administration of field sobriety tests and that those tests were not conducted according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The arresting officer encountered Martin around 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning driving in the rightmost, eastbound lane on I-90. The officer witnessed Martin drift over the white hash marks of an exit lane, lazily veer back into the through lane, and cross over the solid white line dividing the exit lane and the shoulder of the highway before drifting back into the through lane. After the second perceived infraction, the officer initiated a traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} While approaching the vehicle, the officer detected an odor of alcohol in the vehicle compartment and he also noticed that Martin's eyes were bloodshot. The officer asked Martin for his driver's license, and Martin admitted he was driving under suspension. Martin was then removed from his vehicle and acknowledged his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). The officer noted that the odor of alcohol followed Martin, who admitted the consumption of one or two alcoholic drinks that evening. Because of the erratic driving, Martin's bloodshot eyes, and the persistent odor of alcohol, the officer proceeded\n   to administer field sobriety tests. Martin failed the tests and was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court suppressed all of the city's evidence, even the evidence supporting the marked lane violation and the driving under suspension. Tr. 66:4-12 (for \"the driving under the influence charge, I think that the tests are suppressed. But as it relates to the rest of the stop, I'm thinking your predicate is also suppressed too.\"). According to the trial court, the marked lane violation that occurred was minor, and therefore, the officer lacked reasonable suspicion justifying the initial traffic stop. Further, the trial court concluded that the officer's observation of the odor of alcohol and bloodshot eyes was insufficient to support a reasonable and articulable suspicion justifying the administration of the field sobriety tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellate review of a motion to suppress involves mixed questions of law and fact. \"When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The facts are undisputed in this case; the only issue is the application of the facts to the law and the legal conclusions that are drawn from the trial court's review of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court erred in suppressing the evidence of Martin's marked lane violation and Martin's admission to driving under suspension. The trial court concluded that a marked lane violation occurred, but that the violation was minimal. It is well settled that \"[a]n officer is not required to determine whether someone who has been observed committing a crime might have a legal defense to the charge.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Mays\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3839565\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/119/406/\">\n    119 Ohio St.3d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-4539\">\n    2008-Ohio-4539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=894%20N.E.2d%201204\">\n    894 N.E.2d 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17. Martin's sole defense to the traffic violation was that the strength of the city's evidence in support of a marked lane violation was questionable in light of the distorted depiction of the violation in the grainy dashboard camera footage. Although this may be grounds to challenge the merits of the charge, an officer need only form a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a crime occurred in order to initiate a traffic stop; he need not disprove all potential defenses to the criminal act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=894%20N.E.2d%201204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In this case, the dashboard camera footage depicted at least two instances when it could not be readily discerned whether a marked lane violation actually occurred. R.C. 4511.33 (A)(1) provides that a vehicle must \"be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\" The officer believed that he witnessed such a violation, and he testified that although the dashboard camera footage was not clear, it depicted the tire completely crossing the boundary line. The trial court agreed that in at least one of the instances, the footage arguably depicted Martin's vehicle completely violating\n   the boundary of his lane of travel. The initial stop was constitutionally valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} That the violations appeared minimal or de minimis in nature is irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Dayton v.

Courts cannot impose a requirement on officers to definitively prove that a traffic violation occurred to justify the initial stop in all situations. In some cases, that may preclude officers from fulfilling their duty to the public at large.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Nevertheless, the trial court in this case concluded that a marked lane violation occurred, but that the violation was nonetheless minor. Having concluded that a violation occurred, the stop is not unreasonable regardless of the extent of that violation.\n   <em>\n    Erickson\n   </em>\n   at syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} During the initial stages of that valid traffic stop, the officer asked Martin for his driver's license. Martin admitted he was driving under suspension, as defined under R.C. 4510.11(A), and that he could not produce a valid license. Martin could not be allowed to drive away, and the failure to produce a valid driver's license transformed the nature of the traffic stop. In light of the admission, the officer was justified in removing Martin from the driver's seat. As a result, the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence related to the driving under a suspended license charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Once removed from the vehicle, Martin was advised, and voluntarily waived, his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . Martin then admitted he had consumed one or two alcoholic drinks that evening. In consideration of the erratic driving, the odor of alcohol that followed Martin, Martin's bloodshot eyes, Martin's admission to consuming alcoholic beverages, and the time of day, the trial court erred in suppressing the results of the field sobriety tests. We acknowledge that the officer did not testify to relying on Martin's admission regarding the consumption of alcohol. The dashboard camera footage is part of the trial record, and as such, it was part of the facts to be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Once a driver has been lawfully stopped, an officer may not administer field sobriety tests unless the invasion of privacy is separately justified by a reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts that the motorist is impaired.\n   <em>\n    Parma Hts. v.

Although the marked lane violation would not be sufficient to justify the field sobriety tests in and of itself, the officer noted the odor of alcohol upon approaching Martin's vehicle and described Martin's eyes as being bloodshot. Martin admitted to having consumed \"one or two\" alcoholic drinks that evening. Although the officer did not expressly describe the intensity of that odor, he described the odor as being persistent, in that it followed Martin when he was lawfully removed from the vehicle.

C-160668, C-160669, and C-160670,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-9114\">\n    2017-Ohio-9114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206508720\">\n    2017 WL 6508720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (there is no requirement that an officer detect the odor of alcohol on or about the person in order to support a reasonable and articulable suspicion of driving under the influence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Although the intensity of the odor of alcohol is a factor to consider, the failure to be descriptive is not dispositive, especially when intensity can be inferred through context. In this case, the fact that the odor persisted with Martin's movement provides the context within which the officer reasonably formed his suspicion of impairment. Martin asks us to disregard the olfactory observation solely because the officer failed to provide a rote description of the odor's intensity. The failure to specify the odor's intensity was not dispositive in\n   <em>\n    Mays,\n   </em>\n   and therefore, it cannot be in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We have not been presented with a situation where a de minimis traffic violation and a slight odor of alcohol were the only factors justifying the field sobriety tests. The initial traffic stop and removal of Martin from his vehicle were independently justified based on the trial court's conclusion that marked lane violations occurred and based on Martin's admission to driving while under suspension. After waiving his rights, Martin admitted to consuming one or two alcoholic beverages. The officer noticed that Martin's eyes were bloodshot, and the officer detected a persistent odor of alcohol coming from Martin himself. Finally, it was 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning and the officer testified to basing his suspicion in part on Martin's driving behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Although the remaining\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   factors are not present or discussed, police officers are not required to produce evidence supporting every factor in order to articulate a reasonable suspicion that the driver was impaired. Nor are police officers required to obtain evidence demonstrating overt intoxication, such as slurred speech or stumbling, sloppy behaviors, in order to justify the administration of field sobriety tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} As it stands, R.C. 4511.19(A) penalizes motorists for driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The phrase \"under the influence\" has been defined as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   the condition in which a person finds himself after having consumed some intoxicating beverage in such quantity that its effect on him adversely affects his actions, reactions, conduct, movement or mental processes or impairs his reactions to an appreciable degree, thereby lessening his ability to operate a motor vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    State v.
