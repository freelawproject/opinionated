CASE BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2016, during the course of grand jury proceedings, appellee issued a subpoena to appellants requesting internal investigation documentation related to a self-reported incidence (\"SRI\") report submitted by appellants to the Ohio Department of Health in 2014. Appellants refused to produce certain internal investigation documentation related to the SRI on the grounds that the requested documents were protected under the \"work-product privilege\" and provided a corresponding privilege log based on a claimed work-product privilege. Appellee filed a motion for a show cause order as to why appellants should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with the subpoenas. Appellants opposed the show cause motion arguing the documents underlying the SRI investigation at issue are not legally required as a part of internal investigations, are not required to be turned over to the state under any law, are instead work product prepared in anticipation of litigation, and are not required to be disclosed for good cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 12, 2017, the trial court found the documents sought by appellee are not work product. Therefore, the trial court ordered appellants to provide the requested documents to appellee before a\n   certain date as appellee had failed to show cause why it should not be held in contempt. Enforcement of the order to produce the documents is stayed pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellants filed a timely appeal to this court, presenting two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [1.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING APPELLANTS' COUNSEL'S INTERNAL INVESTIGATION WAS NOT PROTECTED, PRIVILEGED WORK PRODUCT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [2.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FINDING THE STATE WAS ENTITLED TO SECURE APPELLANTS COUNSEL'S DOCUMENTS THROUGH SUBPOENA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In its appeal, appellants request this court find that documentation supporting appellants' investigation is protected by the \"work-product privilege\" and that appellee has not shown good cause to compel production of those documents before the grand jury. (Appellants' Brief at 37.) Appellants did not address in their briefs or at oral argument why the trial court's order is final and appealable or specifically why an immediate appeal is necessary in order to afford them a meaningful and effective remedy. In its appellate brief, appellee \"concedes\" that the order is appealable pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   at paragraph two of the syllabus.

However, before dismissing for lack of a final appealable order in\n   <em>\n    Chen\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court first ordered the parties to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to R.C. 2505.02.\n   <em>\n    Chen\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Thus, it was only after the parties failed to articulate why they would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment,\n   <em>\n    when specifically prompted\n   </em>\n   , that the Supreme Court found no final appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The specific factual and procedural posture is vital to\n   <em>\n    Chen\n   </em>\n   and to the cases that purport to follow it. As this court noted in\n   <em>\n    Summit Park Apts., LLC v. Great Lakes Reinsurance (UK), PLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-1514\">\n    2016-Ohio-1514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20N.E.3d%20363\">\n    49 N.E.3d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , also cited by the majority, to the extent the Supreme Court intended to impose an affirmative burden to establish that an immediate appeal is necessary in an order compelling the production of allegedly privileged work product, such an affirmative burden is highly fact-specific.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11 (noting that, in\n   <em>\n    Chen\n   </em>\n   , \"factually, the party seeking to defend privilege and work product on appeal in [\n   <em>\n    Chen\n   </em>\n   ] failed to show cause when ordered to do so on whether there was a final appealable order\"). It follows, then, that the requirement of the affirmative burden should not be used as a basis for dismissal without first giving the party the opportunity to meet that burden. Additionally, we noted in\n   <em>\n    Summit Park Apts.\n   </em>\n   that the appellant in that case argued in its briefing that it would be denied a meaningful remedy if it could not immediately appeal and, thus, declined to find no final appealable order pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Chen\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Summit Park Apts.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Critically here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Summit Park Apts.\n   </em>\n   , this court sua sponte raised the issue of a potential lack of a final appealable order. Therefore, at a minimum, I would not decide this issue without giving the parties the opportunity to weigh in through supplemental briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11 (noting that, through briefing, the appealing party was able to affirmatively demonstrate than an immediate appeal was necessary).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nami v.

To the extent this court is going to interpret\n   <em>\n    Chen\n   </em>\n   to impose an affirmative burden in work-product privilege cases, I would not impose such a burden without giving the parties an opportunity to be on notice of the issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

I would not find the issue to be so neatly contained. Though they are indeed two distinct concepts, the work-product privilege emanates from, and is interrelated with, attorney-client privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey, L.L.P. v.

Thus, many of the same concepts applying to the disclosure of attorney-client privilege, most notably the notion that \"the proverbial bell cannot be unrung,\" apply equally to an analysis of the final nature of an order compelling the production of work-product privilege as it would to an order compelling the production of materials deemed to be attorney-client privilege.\n   <em>\n    Summit Park Apts.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11 (internal quotations omitted).
