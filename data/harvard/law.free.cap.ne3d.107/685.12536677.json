This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Senz was indicted in March 2015 on one count of petty theft, a first degree misdemeanor, and one count of complicity to commit trafficking in cocaine, a fifth degree felony. Following a trial, a jury found Senz not guilty of complicity to commit trafficking in cocaine and guilty of petty theft. Senz then filed a motion for acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(C) and renewed his previous motions made at trial. The trial court denied the motions and sentenced Senz to 180 days in jail and fined him $1000. The sentencing entry reflects that court costs were waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Senz has appealed, raising four assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FAILING TO GRANT A JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL, PURSUANT TO CRIM.R. 29(A), ON THE CHARGE, AND THEREAFTER ENTERING A JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION OF THE OFFENSE AS THAT CHARGE WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE, IN VIOLATION OF DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW, AS GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Senz argues in his first assignment of error that the trial court erred in denying his Crim.R. 29 motion. Specifically, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence establishing mens rea and whether he used deception. In addition, he maintains that the State was required to demonstrate that he had the specific purpose to deprive the Medina County Drug Task Force/Medina County Commissioners of the $60 in light of the language in the indictment. Thus, he asserts that he had to know the money belonged to the drug task force/county, which he argues the State failed to establish. We will confine our analysis to the limited arguments made by Senz on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Crim.R. 29(A) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The court on motion of a defendant or on its own motion, after the evidence on either side is closed, shall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the indictment, information, or complaint, if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.

In early 2015, members of the Medina County Drug Task Force began working with a confidential source, B.S., in order to buy drugs from Charles Sarno. Sarno, who was on house arrest, indicated that he had a supplier in Akron that could get Sarno an eight ball of cocaine for $180 and 20 Percocet pills for $180. On February 5, 2015, B.S. was provided with $360 of the Medina County Drug Task Force's money in order to conduct the transaction. B.S. and his vehicle were searched prior to the transaction and the money was photocopied to document the serial numbers. B.S. was also wired so that the members of the task force could monitor what was happening to help ensure B.S.'s safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} B.S. arrived at Sarno's residence and was invited inside. B.S. provided Sarno with the money and Sarno expressed concern about buying from the person who was going to bring the drugs because he\n   did not really know the person. Sarno told B.S. that if anything went wrong, Sarno would repay B.S. Sarno also indicated that he would call the person to have him come over. Shortly thereafter, Sarno went outside and met the driver of a blue Saturn who had pulled into the driveway. Sarno went back inside and the car left. Sarno told B.S. that the driver had a gun on his lap and told Sarno to take the drugs and go or leave them. Sarno returned to the house with pills and a bag containing a powdery white substance. Sarno and B.S. both thought the pills and powder were counterfeit. Ultimately, the pills were found to be acetaminophen and the powder was described by one witness as being baking soda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Upon hearing Sarno mention that the driver of the vehicle had a gun, Agent John Stayrook of the Medina County Drug Task Force called B.S. and told him to leave. B.S. left and met at the predetermined spot where the pills were recovered from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In the interim, Deputy Dan Kohler with the Medina County Sheriff's Department initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle that had left Sarno's residence. No gun was found in the vehicle. Senz, who was the driver, had $60 in his hand; the serial numbers on the money matched serial numbers on the money given to B.S. to use in the attempted drug transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Gary Hubbard, the Director of the Medina County Drug Task force, spoke with Senz at the traffic stop after Senz was read his rights. Senz, who was Sarno's half-brother, told Director Hubbard that Senz received a call from Sarno around 1 p.m. on February 5th. Sarno \"asked him if he wanted to make $50. [ ] Senz told [Director Hubbard] that, you know, [he'd] give [Senz] $50.\" Sarno told Senz that \"[t]his guy's coming over to buy drugs and [Sarno was] going to rip him off, meaning give him fake drugs.\" Senz indicated that \"he agreed to do that, that he was supposed to show up around 5 o'clock and that's when the entire transaction took place.\" Senz also indicated that Sarno was going to call Senz to tell him when to arrive. Senz relayed that, when he arrived, Sarno walked out of the residence, approached the driver's side of the car and gave him $60, walked back into the house, and Senz left. From the conversation, Detective Hubbard concluded that Senz \"knew exactly what was going on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Agents also went to Sarno's residence, arrested him, and searched the premises. Agent Michael Barnhardt located a plastic bag containing baking soda in the trash and Sarno informed the agents that the money was in kitchen cabinet; $300 was recovered from the cabinet. The serial numbers on that money matched serial numbers on the money that was given to B.S. to complete the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Considering Senz's limited arguments on appeal, and the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Senz's Crim.R. 29 motion. Part of Senz's argument is that, in order to be found guilty, the State had to demonstrate that it was Senz's purpose to deprive the Medina County Drug Task force of U.S. currency. Thus, he asserts that he had to know that the money belonged to that agency. He bases his argument on the language in the indictment that specifically references the Medina County Drug Task Force/Medina County Commissioners as the owners of the currency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are unpersuaded by his argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Senz has pointed us to no authority indicating that the State was required to demonstrate that Senz knew the identity of the owner of the property at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 16(A)(7).

The Supreme Court has even concluded that, under the statute, \"a thief can steal from a thief[.]\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

This is so because \"it is merely necessary to prove that a defendant deprived someone of property who had 'possession or control of, or any license or any interest in' that property. It is unnecessary, however, for one from whom possession or control is taken to have lawful possession or control[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=442%20N.E.2d%201299\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, if the State did not have to prove who owned the property, it would seem logical that the State would not have to demonstrate that the defendant knew who owned the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 18} To the extent that Senz generally argues that the State failed to demonstrate that he acted knowingly or purposely, or that he used deception, we also disagree. Viewing the testimony in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there was evidence that Sarno informed Senz that Sarno was supposed to sell someone cocaine and that he planned to \"rip him off\" by selling fake drugs. Sarno asked Senz if he wanted to make $50 helping Sarno do so. There was evidence that Senz agreed to assist Sarno and that Senz showed up at Sarno's residence at the designated time and took money from Sarno when he came out to Senz's vehicle to meet him. From those circumstances, when considered in light of Senz's limited argument and when viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a trier of fact could infer that Senz had the purpose to deprive the owner of property and knowingly obtained or exerted control over the property by deception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2913.02(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Senz's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   APPELLANT'S CONVICTION IS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Senz argues in his second assignment of error that his conviction for petty theft is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   In determining whether a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Senz, who was 42 at the time of trial, acknowledged that he had a prior conviction for trafficking in marijuana when he was 18 or 19 years old. However, he asserted that since then, he had no history of drug trafficking and was not involved with his brother's drug deals. Nonetheless, he was aware that Sarno was involved in drug trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Senz testified that he lost his job in the beginning of January 2015, and was unemployed on February 5, 2015. Thus, money was tight. Sarno, Senz's half-brother, was aware that Senz needed money. Around 1 p.m. on February 5, 2015, Sarno called Senz and offered to loan him money to get license plates because Senz's 30-day plates were about to expire. Sarno told Senz that someone owed Sarno money and that if Senz came over around 5 p.m., Sarno would give Senz $50 to get his license plates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 24} When Senz arrived at Sarno's residence, Sarno came outside, hopped in Senz's backseat, handed Senz $60, jumped out, and went back in the house. Senz testified that there was no exchange of drugs, real or counterfeit, or talk about drugs. Senz then left and was shortly thereafter pulled over by the police. Senz denied that he ever confessed to participating in Sarno's drug transaction; Senz testified that he told Director Hubbard exactly what he had just told the jury. Thus, Senz maintained that Director Hubbard was lying when he testified that Senz told Director Hubbard about agreeing to assist Sarno in the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In light of Senz's limited argument on appeal, we cannot say that he has demonstrated that the jury lost its way in convicting Senz of petty theft. The jury was not required to believe Senz's version of events and heard from Director Hubbard that Senz had admitted to having a role in Sarno's scheme to steal money by passing counterfeit drugs off as genuine drugs.

Senz replied affirmatively. Senz, who was 42 years old at the time of trial, testified that he was 18 years old when he was convicted. Trial counsel then asked Senz whether he had any history of drug trafficking since that point in time, and Senz replied that he had not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On appeal, Senz argues that there was no reason to ask Senz about the drug trafficking conviction, and that doing so only harmed his credibility with the jury.
