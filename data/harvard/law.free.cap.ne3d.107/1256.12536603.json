Based on the evidence presented at trial on November 10, 2016, the jury could have found the following facts. Around 6:00 P.M. on August 3, 2016, Brockton police Officer Brain Benvie responded to a motor vehicle pursuit near Brockton High School. Upon arriving at the area, Officer Benvie observed an unoccupied motor vehicle that had crashed. After Officer Benvie parked his cruiser, the juvenile came out of a backyard and started \"walking towards the street up a driveway.\" One of the officers on the scene yelled, \"Grab that guy. That's one of the passengers.\" Officer Benvie testified that the juvenile was \"yelling and swearing\" at the officers, and that because the juvenile was \"hostile\" and \"slightly resistant,\" the officers \"had to take him to the ground and handcuff him on the ground.\" This occurred \"at the end of the driveway and on the sidewalk.\" Officer Benvie testified that while the officers were arresting the juvenile, the street was \"heavily trafficked\" due to the time of day, and that a \"number of vehicles\" stopped. Officer Benvie also testified that \"[s]ome people in the neighboring houses came up to see what was going on.\" It took the officers approximately five to ten minutes to get the juvenile into the back of a cruiser. The jury found the juvenile delinquent on the charge of disturbing the peace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Probation revocation hearing\n   </em>\n   . The judge could have found the following facts from the evidentiary hearing conducted on January 19, 2017. On December 9, 2016, Sergeant Daniel Desmarais of the Lowell police department was working the overnight shift when he observed a motor vehicle run a red light around 2:30 A.M. Sergeant Desmarais observed \"three younger-looking Hispanic males\" inside the vehicle. Sergeant Desmarais pursued the motor vehicle with his blue cruiser lights and siren on. The vehicle took off at a \"high rate of speed.\" The vehicle then stopped in the middle of the street and the three males got out of the vehicle and fled on foot. Sergeant Desmarais testified that while the three males were running up the middle of the street, a vehicle turned on to the same street and because the three males \"were running directly in [the vehicle's] path,\" the driver had to \"brake heavily\" to avoid hitting them. The group of three males then split into two groups with one male running in one direction and the two other males running in another. Sergeant Desmarais pulled his cruiser next to the group of two males, which included the juvenile, and ordered them to \"stop\" and \"get on the ground.\" The juvenile and the other individual did not comply, rather, they continued to flee and dispersed in different directions. The juvenile as well as another male were later located by other officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Adjudication of delinquency for disturbing the peace\n   </em>\n   . The juvenile maintains that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to support the jury finding him delinquent by reason of disturbing the peace, and, therefore, the judge erred in denying the juvenile's motion for a required finding. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding, we \"consider and determine whether the evidence, in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the contrary evidence presented by the defendant, is sufficient ... to permit the jury to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged ....\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p676\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676-677 (1979), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sandler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"307050\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/368/729/#p740\">\n    368 Mass. 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 740 (1975). \"The evidence may be primarily or entirely circumstantial, provided that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, it and the inferences permitted to be drawn therefrom [are] of sufficient force to bring minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity to the persuasion of [guilt] beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271485\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/21/#p27\">\n    459 Mass. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27 (2011), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p676\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p676\">\n    at 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We use a two-part test in determining whether an individual's conduct amounts to that of disturbing the peace. First, the activity must be that which \"most people find to be unreasonably disruptive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 714, quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Orlando\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320446\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/371/732/#p735\">\n    371 Mass. 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (1977).

Officer Benvie testified that the juvenile was \"hostile,\" and \"yelling and swearing\" at the officers, and that such conduct, in combination with the arrest occurring on the sidewalk next to a \"heavily trafficked\" street, caused a number of vehicles stopped to observe the commotion. In addition, there was testimony that neighbors left their homes to observe the commotion. The fact finder therefore could reasonably infer that \"the average bystander would have found the [juvenile's] conduct at the time of his arrest,\" (i.e., his yelling and swearing at the officers, his hostile behavior as well as slightly resistant conduct), \"unreasonably disruptive,\" as evidenced by the stopped vehicles and neighbors leaving their homes to watch.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hokanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833016\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/74/403/#p405\">\n    74 Mass.
