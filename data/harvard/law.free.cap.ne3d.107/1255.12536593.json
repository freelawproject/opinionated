L. c. 265, \u00a7 23 ; indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B ; disseminating matter harmful to a minor, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28 ; and witness intimidation, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The defendant was the boy friend of the victim's mother. Their romantic relationship began in 2011, when the victim lived with her mother and two siblings in Brockton. At that time, the victim was six years old, her sister was eight years old, and her brother was four years old. The defendant did not live with the family but often stayed with them for one or two weeks at a time in the three different apartments they lived in from 2011 through 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   At the family's first apartment, the defendant touched the victim's genitals and made her touch his penis on multiple occasions. He also told the victim not to tell her mother or \"anyone\" or she would get in trouble. At their second apartment, the defendant similarly touched the victim and also digitally penetrated her. At the third apartment, he made her watch a video of \"naked people in a tattoo shop\" \"kissing each other's privates,\" and then forced her to touch his penis under a blanket -- hurting her arm until she did so. He also made her look at pornographic material and made her upload pornography onto her iPod. At one point, the defendant pulled down his pants and exposed his penis to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In December of 2014, the defendant and the victim's mother ended their romantic relationship, but the defendant continued to spend time at the family's apartment. On April 24, 2015, the victim's mother saw pornographic images on the victim's iPod. She asked the victim where the pictures came from, and the victim said the defendant made her put them there. Her mother called the police, and the defendant was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant's trial in the Superior Court turned on the credibility of the victim, who was eleven years old at the time. The jury returned verdicts against the defendant on one count of child rape, five counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, one count of disseminating matter harmful to a minor, and one count of witness intimidation. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Child witness instruction\n   </em>\n   .

See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849235\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/640/#p642\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849235\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/640/#p642\">\n    . at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The victim testified that, after the defendant made her touch his penis, he told her to \"not tell my mom or anyone 'cause then my mom would ground me for a year and take all my toys away.\" The victim further stated she did not report the abuse to any adult because \"then they would probably tell my mom and then I can get in big trouble.\" Given the obvious consequences the defendant faced if discovered, the jury were well justified in inferring that the defendant's instruction to the victim to not report the abuse to \"anyone\" was motivated by a desire to avoid criminal investigation.

Nonetheless, the threat had that effect; the victim said she did not tell her mother because \"then my mom would call the police.\" Even as a child the victim understood disclosure to her mother would result in police intervention. The jury could infer the defendant knew the same and intended his threats to prevent a criminal investigation from being initiated.

Furthermore, the judge reminded the jury that the attorneys' opening and closing arguments were not evidence and repeatedly instructed that they alone could determine the credibility of the victim.
