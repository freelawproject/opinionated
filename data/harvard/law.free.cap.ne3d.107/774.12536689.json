He raises three assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. The trial court failed to obtain a valid jury waiver from the Appellant prior to conducting a bench trial in the instant matter, thus violating appellant's constitutional rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. The trial court's judgments of conviction against appellant are based upon insufficient evidence and in violation of appellant's state and federal due process rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3. The judgments of conviction as to all counts are against the manifest weight of the evidence, in violation of appellant's right to a fair trial and due process of law, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} After careful review of the record, we agree with Krebs's first assignment of error in part, i.e., we agree that the trial court failed to obtain a valid jury waiver on the failure to comply charge. The trial court did, however, have jurisdiction to conduct a bench trial on the two minor misdemeanor offenses: failure to yield to a public safety vehicle and driving on the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} We further agree with Krebs's second assignment of error that the city failed to present sufficient evidence of failure to comply and failure to yield to a public safety vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Thus, while we would normally remand Krebs's conviction for failure to comply with a lawful order of police due to\n   the trial court's failure to obtain a valid jury waiver, that is not necessary in this case because the state failed to present sufficient evidence of this charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Finally, we disagree with Krebs that his conviction for driving on a sidewalk is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} We, therefore, vacate Krebs's convictions for failure to comply with a lawful order of police and failure to yield to a public safety vehicle, and affirm his conviction for driving on the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In March 2017, Krebs was cited for (1) failure to comply with a lawful police order in violation of Cleveland Codified Ordinances (\"CCO\") 403.02(A), a first-degree misdemeanor offense, (2) failure to yield to a public safety vehicle in violation of CCO 431.21, a minor misdemeanor offense, and (3) driving on the sidewalk, street, lawn, or curbs in violation of CCO 431.37, a minor misdemeanor offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} At his arraignment, Krebs pleaded not guilty to the charges and also signed and filed a written jury demand. On April 26, 2017, the trial court convened for a bench trial. The trial transcript establishes that at the outset of the proceeding the judge gave all parties notice of the previously filed jury demand and asked Krebs if he wanted to proceed to a bench trial. After consulting with his attorney, Krebs stated that he did. There is no indication in the record that Krebs ever executed a written jury waiver before his trial commenced or at any point thereafter. The following facts were presented to the bench.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On the evening of March 14, 2017, there was a Cleveland Cavaliers game in downtown Cleveland. The game was sold out, and at around 5:30 p.m. there were many pedestrians and vehicles in downtown Cleveland. Rafael Mercado, a Cleveland police officer, was instructed by his supervisor to block the intersection of Prospect Avenue and Huron Road so that vehicles traveling on Prospect Avenue could not drive onto Huron Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Officer Mercado testified that he parked his police vehicle, a sports utility vehicle, in the middle of Prospect Avenue, parallel to the crosswalk on Huron Road, and faced his car forward (east) on Prospect Avenue. In doing so, he said that he blocked cars from turning onto Huron Road from Prospect Avenue. He also activated the lights on his police vehicle. Officer Mercado, who was in his police uniform and wearing a green vest, got out of his vehicle and began directing traffic from all directions away from Huron Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} At around 5:30 p.m., Krebs, who was going to the game, was driving east on Prospect Avenue and turned right onto Huron Road to get to the \"east garage\" to park for the Cavaliers game. Officer Mercado testified that when he saw Krebs's vehicle begin to make the right-hand turn, he was about 15 feet away from Krebs, and he signaled Krebs to stop and began walking toward Krebs's car. Officer Mercado said that Krebs ignored his command, continued turning right onto Huron Road, and that to do so Krebs had to drive onto the sidewalk to \"squeeze right through\" and avoid hitting Officer Mercado's police vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Officer Mercado immediately got into his vehicle, followed Krebs and effectuated a traffic stop. He then issued Krebs the three citations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Krebs testified that he saw the police vehicle, but did not see a police officer. He thought that a police officer must be directing traffic on the other side of the police vehicle. Krebs further stated that he did not hear Officer Mercado's\n   command to stop because he had his windows rolled up and his radio on in his car. Krebs stated that when he turned right, he could see that he had \"adequate room to get by,\" make the turn onto Huron Road and that he did not have to drive on the sidewalk to do so. Krebs felt his tires brush the edge of the curb, but he did not drive onto the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The trial court found Krebs guilty on all counts and sentenced him to a suspended jail term of ten days, with fines amounting to $275 and court costs. It is from this judgment that Krebs now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jury Waiver\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In his first assignment of error, Krebs argues that the trial court erred in conducting a bench trial instead of a jury trial. We agree in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Under the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure, a defendant has the right to be tried by a jury for certain petty offenses, which are generally considered to be misdemeanor offenses carrying up to a six-month term of imprisonment. Crim.R. 23(A), (C) (D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Relevant to this appeal, Crim.R. 23(A) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   In petty offense cases,\n   <em>\n    where there is a right of jury trial\n   </em>\n   , the defendant shall be tried by the court unless he demands a jury trial. Such demand must be in writing and filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Although a defendant has a right to a jury trial for certain petty offenses if properly invoked by the dictates of Crim.R. 23(A), the right does not extend to minor misdemeanor offenses. R.C. 2945.17(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Once a defendant has invoked his or her right to a jury trial on applicable petty offenses, R.C. 2945.05 governs how a defendant may go about waiving the previously invoked right. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   In all criminal cases pending in courts of record in this state, the defendant may waive a trial by jury and be tried by the court without a jury. Such waiver by a defendant, shall be in writing, signed by the defendant, and filed in said cause and made a part of the record thereof. It shall be entitled in the court and cause, and in substance as follows: \"I ____, defendant in the above cause, hereby voluntarily waive and relinquish my right to a trial by jury, and elect to be tried by a Judge of the Court in which the said cause may be pending. I fully understand that under the laws of this state, I have a constitutional right to a trial by jury.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Such waiver of trial by jury must be made in open court after the defendant has been arraigned and has had opportunity to consult with counsel. Such waiver may be withdrawn by the defendant at any time before the commencement of the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In interpreting R.C. 2945.05, Ohio courts have been very clear that \"to be valid, a waiver [under Section 2945.05 ] must meet five conditions. It must be (1) in writing, (2) signed by the defendant, (3) filed, (4) made part of the record, and (5) made in open court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

There is no indication in the record, however, that Krebs ever validly waived his right to be tried by a jury on this charge by signing a written waiver pursuant to R.C. 2945.05.

While we would normally remand for a new trial on this charge, it is not necessary in this case (due to a lack of sufficient evidence for failure to comply as discussed in the next assignment of error).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Krebs's first assignment of error is sustained in part and overruled in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

When statutes do not specify a mens rea for an offense, courts are guided by R.C. 2901.21, which states in subsection (B):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 29} This statute further states in subsection (C)(1):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   When language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts recklessly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 30} This court has adopted the holding in\n   <em>\n    State v.

A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Here, the city argues that Krebs's own admission that he saw the police SUV parked in the street with it lights activated and decided to go around it was sufficient evidence to establish the elements of failure to comply with a lawful order of police. We disagree. Seeing a police vehicle with its lights on and deciding to drive around it is not tantamount to failing to comply with a lawful order. Indeed, under just these facts, there is no failure to comply with anything nor is there even an order, let alone a lawful one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 38} In this case, Officer Mercado testified that when he saw Krebs begin to make a right-hand turn onto Huron Road, he was \"right in the middle of the intersection,\" about 15 feet away from Krebs's car, directing traffic from all directions. Officer Mercado testified that Krebs \"maybe saw\" that Officer Mercado \"turned [his] back for a moment,\" and took that opportunity to turn. Officer Mercado said that when he saw Krebs beginning to make the turn, he \"signaled to\" Krebs and \"started to go toward his car.\" Yet Krebs continued to turn onto Huron Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Krebs, however, testified that he saw the police vehicle with its lights flashing, but he did not see Officer Mercado. He assumed that there was probably a police officer directing traffic on the other side of the vehicle, but that he did not believe Huron Road was closed. In fact, he said that he could see cars with brake lights on Huron Road, so he believed it to be open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 40} After review, we find that these facts simply do not establish that Krebs violated a lawful order of police. He could not have been reckless in violating an order that he did not see.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 41} When Officer Mercado was asked on cross-examination if it was possible that Krebs saw Officer Mercado's police vehicle, but did not see Officer Mercado. Officer Mercado responded, \"I don't know where he was looking, but he needs to pay attention to pedestrians too.\" If we were to find Krebs's violated a lawful order of police based on this, however, it would amount to strict liability. Yes, Krebs should have been paying attention to pedestrians too, but there is no evidence that he was not doing so. Indeed, Krebs testified that although there were many pedestrians that he could see on Ninth Street and the east side of Huron Road, there were \"no pedestrians in the intersection when [he] turned\" from Prospect onto Huron. Moreover, even if Krebs was not paying attention to pedestrians, that would not establish that Krebs violated Officer Mercado's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In the city's closing arguments, it argued that when there is a police vehicle in the street with its lights activated, Krebs had to have seen the officer directing traffic. Notably, however, Officer Mercado never testified that he saw Krebs looking at him or make eye contact with him before he turned right onto Huron Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The city further argued in its closing arguments that even if Krebs did not see the officer, he is still guilty of failure to comply with a lawful order of police because Krebs was either not paying attention or he should have seen the officer. The city's argument, however, would only have merit if CCO 403.02(a) was strict liability offense. As we previously stated, failure to comply is not a strict liability offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 44} We have reviewed other cases where there was sufficient evidence of failure to comply with a lawful order of police.

There are many police officers directing traffic on those streets as well. Yet despite there being a lot of police officers, traffic, and pedestrians, people driving to the game can-and do-get through the traffic to their designated parking lot. While we acknowledge that the Cleveland Police Department's presence in downtown is certainly welcomed-especially when it is extremely busy due to an event-that does not change the fact\n   that in this case, the city failed to establish that Krebs was aware of Officer Mercado's order and recklessly failed to comply with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Accordingly, after a thorough review of the facts in this case, we find that the city failed to present sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Krebs failed to comply with a lawful order of police. We, therefore, vacate his conviction for failure to comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Failure to Yield to a Public Safety Vehicle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 47} To be convicted of CCO 431.21, failure to yield to a public safety vehicle, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Upon the approach of a public safety vehicle or coroner's vehicle, equipped with at least one (1) flashing, rotating or oscillating light visible under normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of five hundred (500) feet to the front of such vehicle and the driver is giving an audible signal by siren, exhaust whistle, or bell, no driver of any other vehicle shall fail to yield the right-of-way, immediately drive, if practical, to a position parallel to, and as close as possible to, the right edge or curb of the highway clear of any intersection, and stop and remain in that position until the public safety vehicle or coroner's vehicle has passed, except when otherwise directed by a police officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Krebs maintains that he could not have been convicted of CCO 431.21 because the police vehicle was parked, did not have a driver, and was not giving an \"audible signal by siren, exhaust whistle, or bell.\" He further maintains that he could not have been guilty of this provision because he \"never failed to yield\" to the police vehicle's \"right-of-way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 49} After review, we agree with Krebs that the city failed to prove that he violated CCO 431.21. The city failed to prove that \"a driver\" of the public safety vehicle gave an \"audible signal by siren, exhaust whistle, or bell\" because there was no driver of the police vehicle (the officer was standing in the street) nor was there an audible signal (the police vehicle had it lights activated, but not an audible signal). Further, the city did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Krebs failed to \"yield the right-of-way\" to a public safety vehicle and \"stop and remain in such a position until the public safety vehicle\" passed him-because there was no public safety vehicle attempting to pass him. This ordinance simply does not apply to the facts in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Accordingly, we also vacate Krebs's conviction for failure to yield to a public safety vehicle.

Cuyahoga No. 91999,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-5816\">\n    2009-Ohio-5816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203647081\">\n    2009 WL 3647081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 63-65. R.C. 2901.22(C) provides the following definition for recklessness:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [a] person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the person's conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 62} In this case, Officer Mercado testified that he parked his police vehicle near the intersection of Prospect Avenue and Huron Road in order to block access to Huron Road. The police vehicle was parked parallel with the crosswalk on Huron Road and its emergency lights were activated in order to bring attention to the closed roadway. While directing traffic, Officer Mercado observed Krebs drive his vehicle around the parked police vehicle in order to access the blocked roadway. Officer Mercado stated that when he observed Krebs begin to turn onto the blocked roadway, he immediately walked towards Krebs's vehicle and unsuccessfully \"signaled\" for him to stop. According to Officer Mercado, Krebs had to drive onto the sidewalk in order to \"squeeze\" past the police vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Based on the foregoing testimony, I would find the state presented sufficient evidence that Krebs recklessly failed to comply with a lawful order or direction of a police officer who was invested with authority to direct, control, or regulate traffic. Collectively, the evidence presented at trial establishes that Officer Mercado was lawfully regulating traffic by blocking access to Huron Road for public safety at the time Krebs ignored Officer Mercado's order to stop and accessed Huron Road. In short, I believe Krebs disregarded substantial and justifiable risks by driving around the carefully positioned police vehicle, over the sidewalk, and onto the blocked roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 64} I recognize that Krebs testified that he did not observe Officer Mercado directing traffic or see Officer Mercado's commands to stop until after he turned onto Huron Road. However, whether Krebs saw Officer Mercado directing traffic or saw his command to stop goes to the weight of the evidence and is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trier of fact. While Krebs contends that he did not see Officer Mercado, he admits that he observed the police vehicle parked in the middle of the intersection before he decided to drive around the police vehicle and onto Huron Road. Furthermore, Officer Mercado testified that he was just 15 feet, or five yards, away from Krebs's vehicle when he signaled for him to stop. Under the totality of these circumstances, I would defer to the trial court's assessment of credibility and find that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Krebs was aware of Officer Mercado's presence and disregarded his lawful order to not turn onto the blocked roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Furthermore, I am not convinced the state was required to prove that Krebs saw Officer Mercado directing traffic in order to prosecute the failure to comply offense. I believe a reasonable person would understand that a roadway is not accessible, pursuant to a lawful order or direction of a police officer, when an officer activates his or her vehicle's emergency lights and parks the vehicle in such a manner so as to intentionally block access to that roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Accordingly, I would affirm Krebs's failure to comply conviction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
