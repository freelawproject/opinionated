Although uninvited, he knocked on the door while carrying a bottle of Hennessey and a loaded gun on his person. D.C.'s fianc\u00e9 (\"M.G.\") answered the door while only wearing a pair of boxer shorts. Mr. Hunter wanted to talk to D.C., but M.G. said that D.C. did not want to talk to him and closed the door. According to D.C., M.G. put on some clothes several minutes later and went outside to smoke a cigarette. According to Mr. Hunter, M.G. came toward him with his hands in his pockets while looking reckless and biting his lip, so he shot M.G. in the neck. M.G. fell down and then retreated back into the apartment. Mr. Hunter followed M.G. into the apartment. Once inside the apartment, Mr. Hunter tried to shoot M.G. in the back, but the gun jammed, so he had to un-jam and reload it. Mr. Hunter resumed shooting at M.G. as he retreated down the hallway and then followed M.G. into the back bedroom to shoot him four more times, killing him. Overall, Mr. Hunter shot M.G. a grand total of ten times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After a jury trial, Mr. Hunter was found not guilty of aggravated murder and several other felonies, but guilty of murder and felonious assault with accompanying firearm specifications. The trial court denied Mr. Hunter's motion to merge the two convictions for sentencing and ultimately sentenced Mr. Hunter to an aggregate total of 29 years to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mr. Hunter now appeals from his convictions and raises three assignments of error for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANT'S REQUESTED JURY INSTRUCTION REGARDING VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AS AN INFERIOR DEGREE OFFENSE TO MURDER.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In his first assignment of error, Mr. Hunter argues that the trial court erred in denying his request for a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter because his rage at the crime scene was compounded by fear, and thus his intent to kill was awakened in a sudden fit of passion.

The State opposed the instruction and the trial court denied Mr. Hunter's request to give the instruction to the jury. The court stated that, even when considered in a light most favorable to Mr. Hunter, there was not enough evidence of provocation to require the instruction. Moreover, the court stated that even if there was sufficient provocation, the fact that Mr. Hunter took the time to un-jam the weapon and reload it \"sort of strip[ped] the sudden fit of rage or passion\" and provided time in between to cool off, even if it was only for a few seconds, which was enough to not require an instruction on voluntary manslaughter in this case. The court noted defense counsel's objection for the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} At trial, Mr. Hunter testified that he went back out to his car after M.G. closed the apartment door on him. D.C. testified that M.G. put some clothes on several minutes later and went outside to smoke a cigarette. Mr. Hunter testified that M.G. came outside and was \"looking reckless\" and \"biting his bottom lip\" while coming toward Mr. Hunter with his hands in his pockets, which scared Mr. Hunter. He admitted on cross-examination that M.G. did not draw a weapon. When M.G. was about an arm's length away, Mr. Hunter shot him in the neck. M.G. fell down and then retreated toward the apartment. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Mr. Hunter if he agreed that, at that moment, he had a choice to leave the scene and just let M.G. go. Mr. Hunter replied, \"Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Mr. Hunter testified that he instead chose to follow M.G. into the apartment and then shot him in the back because he was \"still mad and scared.\" According to Mr. Hunter, the gun jammed \"[a]round the second shot * * * [i]n the house.\" Mr. Hunter removed the jammed bullet from the gun and reloaded the weapon. As M.G. staggered toward the back bedroom, Mr. Hunter resumed shooting at him several more times. Mr. Hunter then followed M.G. into the back bedroom and shot him four more times in the back because he was \"still mad.\" He initially testified on cross-examination that he did not intend to kill M.G., but also testified that he purposely killed M.G. by repeatedly shooting him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court stated that it did not find enough evidence of provocation to require a voluntary manslaughter instruction. Even assuming Mr. Hunter's version of the events is true and accurate, and M.G. did in fact come toward Mr. Hunter while \"looking reckless\" and \"biting his bottom lip\" with his hands in his pockets, we agree with the trial court's determination that these actions were not reasonably sufficient to bring on sudden passion or a sudden fit of rage. The evidence does not show these actions as being serious or reasonably sufficient to incite Mr. Hunter to use deadly force, as Mr. Hunter admitted that M.G. did not draw a weapon on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Even if we were to assume arguendo that M.G.'s actions constituted reasonably sufficient provocation, we would nonetheless agree with the trial court's determination that Mr. Hunter was not under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage in this particular matter. After being shot in the neck, M.G. retreated into the apartment while bleeding. Mr. Hunter agreed at trial that he could have simply left the scene at that point, but he chose instead to follow M.G. into the apartment and continue shooting him. He even took some time around the second shot to un-jam and reload the gun, which provided him with sufficient time to \"cool down\" after the alleged provocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27 (stating a voluntary manslaughter instruction is not required if the evidence shows a sufficient time to \"cool down\" after being provoked.). After un-jamming and reloading the gun, Mr. Hunter resumed shooting at M.G. down the hallway and then followed him into the back bedroom to shoot him several more times in the back. Mr. Hunter testified repeatedly that he was scared and mad, but again, \"[f]ear alone is insufficient to demonstrate the kind of emotional state necessary to constitute sudden passion or fit of rage.\"\n   <em>\n    Mack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323340\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/82/198/#p201\">\n    82 Ohio St.3d at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20N.E.2d%201328\">\n    694 N.E.2d 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} After a review of the record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the evidence presented at trial, even when considered in a light most favorable to Mr. Hunter, did not establish reasonably sufficient provocation to require a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Accordingly, Mr. Hunter's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR TWO\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO MERGE THE CONVICTIONS FOR MURDER AND FELONIOUS ASSAULT FOR SENTENCING.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In his second assignment of error, Mr. Hunter argues that the trial court erred by failing to merge his felonious assault and murder convictions as allied offenses of similar import for the purposes of sentencing.

Although Dembie went downstairs and resumed attacking the victim moments later, the fall created a \"distinct line of demarcation\" between the felonious assault at the window and the murder on the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, we concluded that the felonious assault at the window carried a\n   separate animus from the murder on the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Mr. Hunter bears the burden of establishing his entitlement to a merger of these convictions for sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. He argues that his testimony on cross-examination that he purposely killed M.G. by repeatedly shooting him established a single animus for both the felonious assault and the murder, requiring merger of the two convictions for purposes of sentencing. Mr. Hunter attempts to distinguish the\n   <em>\n    Dembie\n   </em>\n   case from his own by emphasizing that there was no admission of intent to kill in\n   <em>\n    Dembie\n   </em>\n   and the trial court had to make its decision based upon inferences from the circumstances. However, Mr. Hunter's testimony during cross-examination was rather inconsistent and in fact contradictory regarding his intent while committing these crimes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q: And your intent was to kill him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A: No, it wasn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q: When you were shooting him eight, nine times, that wasn't your intent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q: Okay.

Your intent was to end the life of [M.G.], right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus, Mr. Hunter surprisingly testified both that he\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   intend to kill M.G. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court acknowledged Mr. Hunter's admission of his intent to kill and stated: \"[T]hat's a factor that I'm considering as I'm considering whether or not felonious assault and murder merge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 24} After reviewing the record, we agree with the trial court's determination that Mr. Hunter's attack on M.G. was interrupted by certain events over a sufficient passage of time, particularly the fleeing of the victim into the apartment and the jamming and reloading of the gun. We conclude that these interrupting events created a \"distinct line of demarcation\" between the felonious assault that was completed outside of the apartment and the subsequent murder that was completed inside of the apartment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dembie\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

This is also not an exceptional case where the evidence presented weighs heavily in favor of the appellant and against conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompkins\n   </em>\n   at 387,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20N.E.2d%20541\">\n    678 N.E.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Mr. Hunter's third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Mr. Hunter's first, second, and third assignments of error are overruled.
