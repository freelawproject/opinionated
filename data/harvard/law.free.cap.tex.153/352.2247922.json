Respondent alleged damages to her land and improvements thereon, and the loss of two cows. Respondent charged the petitioner with negligence in permitting water containing harmful chemicals to flow from its compressor station upon her land thereby causing the damages incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Petitioner answered the suit with a general denial and a special plea denying that the water complained of was impure and contaminated with chemicals of any nature. Petitioner further alleged that respondent\u2019s cause of action accrued more than two years prior to the time respondent filed her original petition in this cause, and, therefore, was barred by the provision of Article 5526, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, the two-year statute of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The issues thus raised were presented to the court and jury, but at the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court responded to petitioner\u2019s motion for instructed verdict and motion that the case be withdrawn from the jury, and rendered judgment that respondent take nothing by her suit. The Court of Civil Appeals has held that the cause of action alleged by respondent was not barred by the statute of limitations and has reversed and remanded the cause for new trial. 263 S.W. 2d 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Petitioner and respondent agree that the Court of Civil Appeals has correctly stated the nature of the suit. Petitioner contends here that the Court was in error in holding that the cause was not barred by the statute of limitations, supra. We have concluded that the case, from the standpoint of pleadings and proof, is barred by the statute of limitations and that the petitioner\u2019s position should be sustained. The rules controlling our conclusion in this case have been announced and followed in many cases. \u201cWhere there is a direct invasion of one\u2019s property of a permanent character, and the original invasion and its continuance are necessarily injurious, the damage is original, and may be at once fully compensated * * *. In such case the statute begins to run from the date of the invasion * * 28 Tex. Jur. 149, Limitation of Actions, Section 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>The early case of Houston Water-Works Co. v. Kennedy, 70 Texas 233, 8 S.W. 36, 37, is decisive of the prime question here, involved. The question is: When did respondent\u2019s cause of action accrue? After stating the facts, the Court said: \"This was an act wrongful towards the owner of the property, for which an action might have been maintained as soon as the tort was committed. When an act is in itself lawful as to the person who bases an action on injuries subsequently accruing from, and consequent upon, the act, it is held that the cause of action does not accrue until the injury is sustained. * * * if, however, the act of which the injury was the natural sequence was a legal injury, \u2014 by which is meant an injury giving cause of action by reason of its being an invasion of a plaintiff\u2019s right, \u2014 then, <em>be the damage however slight, </em>limitation will run from the time the wrongful act was committed, and will bar an action for any damages resulting from the act, although these may not have been fully developed until within a period less than necessary to complete the bar.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\">A careful reading of respondent\u2019s pleadings and the evidence introduced in the case conclusively reveals that respondent\u2019s legal rights were invaded the moment water from the petitioner\u2019s plant began to flow upon her land. Water was wrongfully discharged from petitioner\u2019s plant on to respondent\u2019s land as early as February, 1948\u2019 and continuously flowed thereon until it was diverted by acts of petitioner sometime in September, 1950. Respondent\u2019s cause of action accrued at the time petitioner began wrongfully discharging the water on the land, and not on the date when the extent of the damages to the land were fully ascertainable. The rule discussed in Houston Water-Works Co. v. Kennedy, supra, gives rise to two distinct classes of action. Repondent relies on the case of Baker v. City of Fort Worth, 146 Texas 600, 210 S.W. 2d 564 as authority for her contention. The facts in that case determined the rule to be followed. The Court said in part: \u201cThe erection of the bridge with its approaches was a lawful undertaking. * * * It was not constructed upon petitioner\u2019s land, nor did it constitute an invasion of his rights or premises at the time it was built. Though the structure was permanent in character, no immediate injury arose, and the injuries resulting were only in consequence of some intervening cause.\u201d The bridge was completed in 1937 and a flood occurred in March, 1945, causing injury to Baker\u2019s land. The suit was filed within less than two years from the time of the flood. The Court held that the cause of action was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Such conclusion was based on that part of the rule announced in Houston Water-Works Co. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Kennedy, supra, which reads: \u201cWhen the act is in itself lawful as to the person who bases an action on injuries subsequently accruing from, and consequent upon, the act, it is held that the cause of action does not accrue until the injury is sustained.\u201d The Court correctly applied the rule applicable to the facts in that particular ease. That rule cannot be applied to the facts in the present case. In this case we have a different factual background. It is true that petitioner erected its plant on its own land. This was a lawful act just as the act of building the bridge was lawful. The act of erecting the plant did not constitute an invasion of plaintiff\u2019s rights. No injury occurred by virtue of the construction of the plant. Respondent testified that injury to her property arose at the time water began flowing from the plant on to her land. The evidence further shows that this wrongful invasion of plaintiff\u2019s rights occurred at a date more than two years prior to the filing of the original petition, and injury continued until the water was diverted from respondent\u2019s land, as stated above. Admitting that the greater part of the damage did not occur until within two years next preceding the filing of the suit, the fact does not alter the rule which we have concluded is controlling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">The rule announced in Houston Water-Works Co. v.
