Clark v. Eads, 165 S.W. 2d 1019, writ refused; Gray v. Blau, 223 S.W. 2d 53, writ refused N.R.E.; 33 Am.

And since payment by respondent for the fee provided for in Article 3271a, section 16, Vernon\u2019s Civil Statute of Texas, was not and is not a condition precedent to the petitioner\u2019s liability under the contract of employment, the judgment for petitioner\u2019s liability was correct. Sanguinett &amp; Staats v. Colorado Salt Co., 150 S.W. 490, writ of error refused; Mood v. Methodist Episcopal Church, 300 S.W. 30, Com. App.; Bellinger v. Schutte, 244 S.W. 2d 661, writ of error refused.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b244-6\">Mr. Justice Garwood</author>\n<p id=\"AE6\">delivered the opinion of the Court-</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The primary question in this proceeding is whether an engineer, who has been issued an original certificate under Sec. 15 of the statute regulating the practice of professional engineering (Art. 3271a Vernon\u2019s Tex. Civ. Stats. Ann.) is yet illegally practicing when he contracts to and does render engineering services during a year for which he has failed to pay his annual certificate renewal fee as required by Sec. 16 of the same law. Both mentioned sections are copied in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The suit is one by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>respondent, A. J. Mitchell, for the $5,250 balance of a sum which our petitioner, M. M. M., Incorporated (defendant below) agreed in writing to pay him for the services in question. Since we determine the primary issue adversely to the respondent-plaintiff, we need not decide the subsidiary question of whether he is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees under Art. 2226, Vernon\u2019s Tex. Civ. Stats. Ann.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">At the close of the evidence both sides moved for an instructed verdict, which was granted to the respondent-plaintiff in respect of his claim for services but to the petitioner-defendant in respect of its alleged liability for attorney\u2019s fees. Both parties appealed upon an agreed \u201cstatement of the case and of the facts proven\u201d therein, Rule 378, Tex. R. Civ. Proc., and the Court of Civil Appeals (on rehearing) affirmed the trial court judgment after reforming it so as also to allow the respondent-plaintiff his attorney\u2019s fees. 261 S.W. 2d 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The agreed statement abovementioned establishes that: (a) the services of respondent-plaintiff as contracted for and rendered \u201cconstituted the \u2018practice of professional engineering\u2019 within the meaning of that term as defined in Section 2 of * * * Article 3271a * * (b) the respondent-plaintiff \u201cwas duly registered as a professional engineer by the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers on June 10, 1938, under and in accordance with the provisions of Article 3271a, V.A.C.S., and on August 18, 1938, said Board issued to the plaintiff a certificate of registration in conformity with the provisions of said article\u201d; (c) neither said registration nor certificate has ever been \u201crevoked under the provisions of said Article 3271a\u201d; (d) the contract sued on was made \u201cin the month of July 1949\u201d and the services in question duly performed thereafter prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>an unspecified day in November 1949 when payment was demanded and, of course, prior to the filing of the suit, which occurred on April 6, 1951; (e) the respondent-plaintiff during the period from January 1, 1948 through December 31, 1949 failed to \u201cpay the fee of Five ($5.00) dollars or any other fee provided for in Section 16\u201d abovementioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">The stipulation thus omits reference to when, if ever, the renewal fee was paid either before or after the calendar years 1948 and 1949. It likewise fails to state whether the notice required in Sec. 16 was sent to the respondent-plaintiff, although this subject is not stressed in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">It was further stipulated that the judgment of the trial court for the $5,250 balance in question should be affirmed, or reversed and rendered against the respondent-plaintiff, accordingly as the payment by the latter of the annual fee abovementioned \u201cfor the renewal of his certificate for the year 1949 was and is\u201d (or was and is not) \u201ca condition precedent to the Defendant\u2019s liability * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The question as last above presented is for our purposes the same as whether the respondent-plaintiff could lawfully practice his profession under the circumstances, because, if he could not, he is, and seems admittedly to be, barred from recovery under decisions such as Kadane v. Clark, 135 Texas 496, 143 S.W. 2d 197, dealing with the Securities Act (\u201cWhile the law does not specifically provide that a contract made in violation of this Act shall be void, * * *. Any other construction would nullify the very purpose for which it was enacted.\u201d 143 S.W. 2d 197, 200). Since the declared purpose of Art. 3271a, supra, (Sec. 1) \u201cto safeguard life, health and property\u201d from dangers arising from the \u201cunlawful\u201d practice of engineering, is obviously more important than the fraud prevention purposes of the Securities Act, and since the penalties (Sec. 23) are certainly no less severe, we easily conclude that a contract for engineering services to be rendered by one prohibited under Art. 3271a from rendering them is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The critical question of the effect of default in payment of the annual fee requires at least an abbreviated review of the entire act in question, which was passed in 1937, was the first such regulation of general engineering and has not been amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Section 1 in general terms forbids the practice of engineering unless the practitioner shall have previously proved his qualifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>cations and been \u201cregistered as hereinafter provided.\u201d Section 2 defines professional engineers and engineering.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Sections 3 through 11 provide for the body to administer the Act (\u201cState Board of Registration for Professional Engineers\u201d) with numerous details as to its organization, duties and operation. From these provisions, especially Section 9, which includes establishing the \u201cProfessional Engineers\u2019 Fund,\u201d it is quite plain that the continued operation of the Board depends upon its receiving the \u201cmoneys derived under the provisions of this Act,\u201d none of which consist of appropriations from the State- Section 11 requires the Board to prepare an <em>annual </em>\u201croster showing the names and places o\u00ed business of all registered professional engineers\u201d and to mail a copy thereof \u201cto each person so registered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Section 12 deals with qualifications \u201cfor registration as a professional engineer,\u201d Section 13 with \u201capplications for registration\u201d and the corresponding \u201cregistration fee\u201d (maximum $25); and Section 14 with examinations to determine \u201cthe qualifications of applicants for registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Sections 15 and 16 have been heretofore quoted in footnote 1. In connection with the private seal required in the second paragraph of Section 15 to be obtained by each engineer \u201cupon registration,\u201d there is the further requirement that it shall be affixed to documents issued by a registrant if the latter are filed with public authorities \u201cduring the life of the registrant\u2019s certificate\u201d and a provision that use of said seal while the certificate stands expired or revoked \u201cshall be unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Section 17 permits the practice of professional engineering by partnerships, corporations, and joint stock associations through individual engineers \u201cregistered in this state.\u201d Section 18 provides that, during the year following the effective date of the Act, and under certain conditions, \u201cthe Board shall issue a certificate of registration, without written or oral examination, to any professional engineer\u201d then practicing in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Section 19 requires for certain public works that \u201ca registered engineer\u201d prepare the plans, specifications and estimates and supervise the construction, this evidently being one of the instances contemplated by Section 15 for use of an engineering seal \u201cduring the life of the registrant\u2019s certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Section 20 exempts certain persons and activities from the operation of the Act and Section 21 permits the Board, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>certain conditions, to \u201cissue a certificate of registration\u201d to persons holding certificates from sources other than this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\">\u25a0 Section 22, among other provisions, empowers the Board to hold hearings and \u201crevoke the certificate of registration of any registrant\u201d for fraud in its procurement or for malpractice and to \u201cre-issue a certificate of registration to any person whose certificate has been revoked\u201d as well as to issue \u201ca new certificate\u201d in lieu of \u201cany certificate revoked, lost, destroyed or mutilated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Section 23 provides severe fines and imprisonment for \u201cany person who shall practice * * * engineering * * * without being registered * * * in accordance with * * * this Act * * * or any person presenting or attempting to use as his own the certificate or the seal of another * * * or any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">It cannot be denied that, under the foregoing provisions, the original licensing of an engineer is one thing and the annual certificate renewal quite another. For all the statute provides, an engineer, once licensed, may fail to pay his renewal fee for twenty years and yet renew his certificate thereafter and be undoubtedly authorized to practice upon payment of a renewal fee \u2014apparently limited to $10.00 (Sec. 16). Nor, with exception of the right to use a seal (Sec. 15) is there any perfectly clear provision that practice by one whose certificate has lapsed (or, for that matter, been revoked) is unlawful. The original licensing is spoken of in terms of \u201cregistration\u201d; the letter of the condition for lawful practice is that the practitioner be \u201cduly registered\u201d (Sec. 1) ; the letter of the penalty section (23) is \u201cwho shall practice * * * without being registered.\u201d The last sentence of the first paragraph of Sec. 15 says that \u201cthe issuance of a certificate of registration * * * shall be <em>evidence </em>that\u201d the holder \u201cis entitled to all rights and privileges of a registered engineer, while the said certificate remains unrevoked or unexpired.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">On the other hand, in Sec. 22 the certificate itself is identified with the right to practice; and despite the use of the bare words \u201cwithout being registered\u201d in the penalty section (23), it will hardly be disputed that practice by one whose certificate has been revoked for \u201cgross negligence, incompetency or misconduct in the practice\u201d would be unlawful, because the whole purpose of the statute is \u201cto safeguard life, health and property\u201d from these very hazards. \u201cRegistered\u201d in Sec. 23 thus means something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>different from \u201conce registered.\u201d Section 15 contains not only the above quoted sentence with the word \u201cevidence,\u201d but also the provision that, \u201cin case of a registered engineer, the certificate shall authorize the practice of professional engineering.\u201d This provision does not by its terms refer only to the <em>origmal </em>certificate, and certainly in the normal course of things an \u201cexpired\u201d certificate is no certificate at all. In the \u201cevidence\u201d sentence, moreover, a revoked and lapsed certificate are treated as if the same, and yet obviously revocation deprives the holder of the right to practice as distinguished from mere evidence of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">There is thus substantial ground in the letter of the statute on which to rest the conclusion we have reached. There is even more ground in the general purpose or spirit. The object of the renewal obligation is both to supply an obviously important part of the revenues on which the whole operation of the law depends and to keep an up to date record of practicing engineers. Unless there is some substantial penalty to compel compliance, the burden of supporting the Board falls entirely on those who comply while the others get the benefits of the law but evade its obligations. The penalty of not being able to use the seal is, indeed, provided; yet the inference, that this is the only penalty, applies equally to the matter of practice after the certificate has been revoked, and, as before indicated, the right to even limited practice by one whose certificate is revoked, cannot have been intended; nor is it a likely intent of the legislature to allow one, who permits his certificate to expire, to- practice generally, while not allowing him to use a seal. The peculiar wording of the statute makes a conclusion either way not free from doubt, and in .such cases a claim for services rendered is normally most appealing. But a construction that favors better enforcement of an act for the protection of life and health at an occasional loss to those, who somehow fail to carry its almost insignificant burdens for maintaining their high profession, also has its equitable appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The decision in Stokes v. Sundermeyer, Tex. Civ. App., 170 S.W. 2d 583, writ of error refused, does not conflict with our holding. There are important factual differences in the two cases, and the delinquency notice provision in the applicable Supreme Court rules governing dues in the State Bar has no parallel in Sec. 16 or other part of Art. 3271a. Nor do we believe that under the stipulation in the instant case we can assume that the State Board failed to do its statutory duty of notifying the respondent-plaintiff \u201cof the date of expiration of his certificate and the amount of the fee * * * required for its renewal for one (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>year,\u201d such notice to be mailed \u201cat least one (1) month in advance of the date of expiration * *</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\">The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is reversed. The judgment of the trial court is reformed so as to deny recovery to the respondent-plaintiff on his claim for services and as so modified it is affirmed. The costs are equally divided between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Opinion delivered March 3, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Rehearing overruled March 31, 1954.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\">. Sec. 15. \u201cCertificates, Seals.- \u2014 The Board shall issue a certificate of registration upon payment of registration fee as provided for in this Act, to any applicant, who, in the opinion of the Board, has satisfactorily met all the requirements of this Act. In case of a registered engineer, the certificate shall authorize the practice of professional engineering. Certificates of registration shall show the full name of the registrant, shall have a serial number, and shall be signed by the Chairman and the Secretary of the Board under seal of the Board. The issuance of a certificate of registration by this Board shall be evidence that the person named therein is entitled to all rights and privileges of a registered professional engineer, while the said certificate remains unrevoked or unexpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u201cEach registrant hereunder shall upon registration obtain a seal of the design authorized by the Board, bearing the registrant\u2019s name and the legend \u2018Registered Professional Engineer.\u2019 Plans, specifications, plats and reports issued by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>registrant shall be stamped with the said seal when filed with public authorities, during the life of the registrant\u2019s certificate, but it shall be unlawful for any one to stamp or seal any documents with said seal after the certificate of the registrant named thereon has expired or has been revoked, unless said certificate shall have been renewed or re-issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Sec. 16. \u201cExpirations and Renewals. \u2014 Certificates, of registration shall expire on the last day of the month of December following their issuance or renewal. It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Board to notify every person registered under this Act of the date of expiration of his certificate and the amount of the fee that shall be required for its renewal for one (1) year; such notice shall be mailed at least one (1) month in advance of the date of the expiration of said certificate. Renewal may be effected at any time during the month of December by the payment of a fee of Five ($5.00) Dollars. The failure on the part of any registrant to renew his certificate annually in the month of December as required above shall not deprive such person of the right of renewal, but the fee to be paid for the renewal of a certificate after the month of December shall be increased ten (10%) per cent for each month or fraction of a month that renewal payment is delayed; provided, however, that the maximum fee for delayed renewal shall not exceed twice the normal fee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
