The Mollettes alleged that city council reached its decision after deliberating in private sessions in violation of the charter and the statute. In granting summary judgment in favor of the Mollettes, the trial court invalidated the ordinance and enjoined the city council from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>deliberating in any executive sessions, i.e., closed to the public. Nonetheless, the Mollettes appeal and argue that the trial court erred in \u201cdiscounting\u201d its award of attorney fees by calculating them using a local fee structure, rather than using a statewide reasonable-fee standard. However, we do not reach the merits of the Mollette\u2019s appeal because the cross-appeal is dispositive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 2} In its cross-appeal, the city argues that the Mollettes failed to file their complaint within the one-year time limitation of the statute dealing with certain taxpayer actions. However, the Mollettes brought their action under the Open Meetings Act, which contains its own limitations period. R.C. 121.22(I)(1) (two years). Under rules of statutory construction, where two statutes of limitations could apply to a cause of action, the more specific prevails over the more general. Because the Open Meetings Act provision is the more specific statute, and because the right of action and the limitations period are found in the same subparagraph in the Open Meetings Act, we hold that the two-year statute of limitations found in that law applies to the Mollettes\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 3} Next, the city argues that the Mollettes failed to properly commence their action before the statute of limitations expired because they named the city council, an entity that lacked the capacity to be sued, as the sole defendant in their original complaint. The Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure provide that an action is commenced by the filing of a complaint if service is obtained upon the named defendant within one year after the filing of the complaint. When a defendant is improperly identified or unknown, the rules also allow a plaintiff to amend the complaint to name the proper party. But in order for this amendment to \u201crelate back\u201d to the initial filing date of the complaint, the plaintiff must have obtained service on a defendant with the capacity to be sued within the one-year period provided for commencing the action. Here, the Mollettes sued an entity without the capacity to be sued. And they failed to amend and serve their complaint on a party with the capacity to be sued within the one-year period. Thus, they failed to commence the suit as required by Civ.R. 3(A), and their amendment does not relate back. As a result, they failed to commence the action before the statute of limitations expired. Accordingly, the trial court should have dismissed their action.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">I. Facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 4} In early 2002, Portsmouth Mayor Greg Bauer informed members of the Portsmouth City Council that a local business would be closing its doors and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>its downtown building was available to the city. The city clerk set up two meetings with the Richard D. Marting Foundation representative, attorney Clay Johnson. The city council members purposely met with Johnson in groups of three so that there would not be a quorum for a council meeting. Various members of the city council testified in depositions that they met in these groups of three because they did not want the meetings to be construed as official council meetings. For instance, Councilman Howard E. Baughman III testified that the council \u201cdidn\u2019t want it even considered that we were making a decision at that time. * * * [Otherwise,] it would appear that we would deliberate on it, and we can\u2019t deliberate on it.\u201d Councilman Baughman testified that the council did not have discussions as a legislative body and that the meeting with Johnson and the tour of the building was \u201cinformational.\u201d Councilwoman Maddeline Carol Caudill explained that the council had met in two groups of three because \u201cwe cannot have a vote. And so if we had a full council meeting with them, it would have appeared that we were voting on something when we were not. We were only getting information.\u201d She explained that she did not remember any negotiations with Marting Foundation representatives at the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">{\u00b6 5} Councilman James Kalb explained that the Open Meetings Act \u201cwas on everybody\u2019s mind. Any time there are more than three council members present * * *, that\u2019s one of the three criteria involved for the Sunshine Law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his deposition testimony, Councilman Kalb explained that the city council only received information about the building, including its condition, price, and availability. Councilwoman Ann S. Syndor clarified that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t a meeting. It was a tour.\u201d Former councilwoman Barbara E. Halcomb testified that all that happened at the meeting is that the Marting Foundation representative gave a presentation regarding the organization and purpose of the foundation and that there was a question-and-answer session regarding the condition of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 6} Later, the city council did discuss the proposed purchase of the building in its formal sessions. However, council members disagreed regarding how many times the council recessed into an \u201cexecutive session.\u201d Councilman Baughman remembered the City Council conducting two executive sessions regarding the Marting building. Councilwoman Caudill and Councilman Kalb remembered only one executive session. Councilwoman Syndor remembered there being several executive sessions, and Councilwoman Halcomb remembered more than one. The city clerk, JoAnn Aeh, testified at the hearing on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment that there had been only one executive session. She also testified that the council minutes reflect only one executive session taking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On April 22, 2002, the city council held a regular meeting. Even though the council\u2019s agenda did not disclose that it would discuss the purchase of the Marting building, the city council recessed into an executive session to discuss buying this property for use as city office space. After the city council reconvened the public meeting, Councilman Pyles moved to add to the agenda an ordinance authorizing the mayor to negotiate a real-estate purchase agreement for Marting building. The other council members agreed and provided a copy of the proposed ordinance to the members of the public. Subsequently, the city clerk gave a first reading to the proposed ordinance. After voting to suspend the rule requiring three readings of the ordinance, the city council adopted the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 8} Three weeks later, on May 13, 2002, the city council held another regular meeting. Like all of the council\u2019s regular meetings, this meeting consisted of a legislative session and a conference session. According to the minutes of the legislative session, the council did not discuss the purchase of the Marting building. At the conclusion of the legislative session, the city council held a conference session to discuss pending legislation. The agenda for the conference session included a letter from the mayor regarding the real-estate purchase agreement for the Marting building. Although conference sessions are open to the public, the city council does not prepare minutes. Councilwoman Syndor testified that the council discussed the purchase of the building at length during the conference meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 9} On May 29, 2002, the city council held its next regular meeting. During the meeting, the council added an ordinance authorizing the mayor to enter into a real-estate purchase agreement for the Marting building \u201cin an amount not to exceed $2,000,000 to be paid for from the proceeds of bond anticipation notes\u201d to the agenda for the legislative session. Subsequently, the city clerk gave a first reading to this ordinance. The council voted to suspend the rule requiring three readings of the ordinance and adopted Ordinance 63-02. The city clerk then gave a first reading to the ordinance authorizing the city to issue the $2,000,000 bond anticipation notes. After voting to suspend the three-reading requirement, the council members also adopted this ordinance. The city council passed both of these ordinances without public discussion at the May 29, 2002 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 10} On May 28, 2004, Teresa and Robert Mollette filed suit against \u201cPortsmouth City Council\u201d alleging that Ordinance 63-02 resulted from private deliberations in violation of the Portsmouth City Charter and R.C. 121.22. The city council, represented by the city attorney, responded by filing an answer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings. In the motion, council argued that the one-year statute of limitations in R.C. 733.60 barred the Mollettes\u2019 claim. The Mollettes filed a response, arguing that the two-year statute of limitations in R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>121.22 governed their claim. In August 2004, the trial court scheduled the matter for an evidentiary hearing. The day before the hearing, the city council filed a \u201chearing brief\u2019 requesting \u201csummary judgment on the pleadings.\u201d The trial court held a hearing at which the city clerk and Mrs. Mollette testified. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court converted the city council\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings into a motion for summary judgment. The Mollettes then filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. They supported their motion with the minutes from the council meetings in April and May, the testimony from the hearing, and the depositions of Mr. Baughman, Mrs. Caudill, Mr. Kalb, Mrs. Sydnor, and Mrs. Halcomb. One week after the Mollettes filed their cross-motion for summary judgment, the city council filed a \u201cformal\u201d summary judgment motion supported by the same evidence relied upon by the Mollettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u2018 {\u00b6 11} In November 2004, the trial court denied the city council\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the Mollettes. The court concluded that the cause of action arose under the Open Meetings Act and that the two-year statute of limitations in R.C. 121.22(1) applied. Additionally, the court concluded that Ordinance 63-02 resulted from private deliberations in violation of R.C. 121.22 and the Portsmouth City Charter. As a result, the court declared the ordinance and the resulting real-estate purchase agreement invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">A. <em>Mollette I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 12} The city council appealed and the Mollettes cross-appealed. After receiving permission from the trial court to intervene as a defendant, the Marting Foundation also appealed. In this court, the Foundation moved to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the city council is not \u201csui juris\u201d and lacked the capacity to be sued. Before we could rule on this motion, however, the Foundation dismissed its appeal. One week after the Foundation filed its motion, the city council filed a similar motion. However, in July 2005, we dismissed the city council\u2019s appeal and the Mollettes\u2019 cross-appeal for lack of a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 13} When the case returned to the trial court, the Mollettes sought leave to amend their complaint. In their motion, the Mollettes maintained that the city council is sui juris, i.e., had the capacity to be sued. However, they argued in the alternative that they should be allowed to amend their complaint to name the city and the individual members of the city council as defendants. The city council opposed the motion and argued that the trial court should dismiss the case. In September 2005, the court denied the Mollettes\u2019 motion, finding that the amendment of the complaint was unnecessary. That same month, the court issued an injunction prohibiting, the city council from (1) going into executive session during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>its meetings and (2) holding private back-to-back meetings that, taken together, are attended by a majority of council members.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 14} In the meantime, the trial court granted the Mollettes\u2019 motion requesting attorney fees. Furthermore, the court declined to reduce the award, finding that the city council members knew that their actions violated R.C. 121.22 and the charter. In the end, the court awarded the Mollettes a $500 civil forfeiture and $18,317.70 in attorney fees. The trial court based the amount of attorney fees on testimony establishing a reasonable hourly rate in Scioto County. The trial court\u2019s decision on attorney fees disposed of the remaining issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">B. <em>Mollette II</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 15} The parties brought a second appeal, and we reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Concluding that a city council is not sui juris and cannot be sued in its own right absent statutory authority, we held that the judgment against the city council in this case was void. <em>Mollette v. Portsmouth City Council, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 557, 2006-Ohio-6289, 863 N.E.2d 1092, at \u00b6 15, 24. We also held that the trial court had abused its discretion in denying the Mollettes the opportunity to amend their complaint to name the city of Portsmouth and the individual members of the city council as defendants. On the grounds that the city council lacked standing to raise arguments on the behalf of the proper parties, i.e., the individual council members who had not yet been named to the case, we reserved judgment on the city council\u2019s arguments that the Mollettes failed to timely commence this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 16} Upon remand, the Mollettes filed an amended complaint seeking to join the city and the individual members of the city council. However, the amended complaint came more than one year after they initially filed suit. The Mollettes also amended their claim for relief in Count IV, dropping their request for mandamus relief and seeking an injunction ordering the city to comply with the charter and to hold open meetings. The parties again filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court decided that the Mollettes\u2019 amended complaint related back to the filing of the original complaint, and it incorporated and reaffirmed its prior entries concluding that the charter prohibits executive sessions, enjoining the city from recessing into executive sessions, and awarding the Mollettes attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">C. <em>Mollette III</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">{\u00b6 17} The Mollettes now appeal the trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees based upon a local reasonable hourly rate rather than a statewide reasonable hourly rate. The city filed a cross-appeal, challenging both the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>decision entering summary judgment in the Mollettes\u2019 favor, and the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 18} The Mollettes present one assignment of error: \u201cThe Trial Court committed plain error in reducing the amount of attorney fees granted to Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The city brings eight assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">1. The trial court erred in finding as a matter of law that the Charter of the City of Portsmouth prohibited City Council from conducting executive sessions as its meetings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">2. The trial court erred in finding as a matter of law that Portsmouth City Council violated the Sunshine Law in adopting Ordinance 63-02.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">3. The trial court erred in awarding the Mollettes\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and a civil forfeiture because no violation of the Sunshine Act occurred and because the Mollettes never sought, nor were they granted injunctive relief under a Sunshine Law claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">4. The trial court erred by refusing to reduce the attorneys\u2019 fee award where the evidence established that the Portsmouth City Council could reasonably have believed that it was not violating the Sunshine Law and that its actions served public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">5. The Mollettes\u2019 claim to enjoin the purchase [of] the real property pursuant to the real estate contract entered into in accordance with Ordinance 63-02 was barred by the one year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 733.60.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">6. Assuming arguendo the two year statute of limitations under the Sunshine Law applied, the trial court erred in holding that the filing of the Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint related back to the filing of Plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-14\">7. The trial court erred in denying the City of Portsmouth Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the Mollettes\u2019 complaint was moot because after the city ordinance, which was the subject of the Mollettes\u2019 original complaint was declared void by the trial court, the City of Portsmouth entered into a new transaction and did so in conformity with Ohio\u2019s Sunshine Law and the Portsmouth City Charter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">8. The trial court erred in denying the Appellee/Cross-Appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on its counterclaims that under Section 4 of the Portsmouth City Charter the City is subject to all the duties, requirements and privileges of Ohio\u2019s Sunshine Law, R.C. \u00a7 121.22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">Because one of the city\u2019s assignments of error is dispositive, we address the cross-appeal first.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">{\u00b6 19} In reviewing a summary judgment, the lower court and the appellate court utilize the same standard, i.e., we review the judgment independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243. A summary judgment is appropriate only when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, and (3) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. See also <em>Bostic v. Connor </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 144, 146, 524 N.E.2d 881; Civ.R. 56(C). The burden of showing that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact falls upon the moving party in requesting summary judgment. <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 115, 526 N.E.2d 798. If the moving party satisfies this burden, the nonmoving party then has the reciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the nonmovant does not satisfy this evidentiary burden and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the court should enter a summary judgment accordingly. <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 145, 677 N.E.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">IV. The Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 20} The city argues that the Mollettes failed to file their claims alleging violations of the charter and the Open Meetings Act in a timely manner. Specifically, the city contends that the Mollettes\u2019 action is governed by the one-year statute of limitations provided in R.C. 733.60. The Mollettes argue that the relevant statute of limitations is found in the Open Meetings Act, which allows a two-year period for bringing an action. This conflict presents a question of statutory interpretation that we review de novo. <em>Covert v. Ohio Aud. of State, </em>Scioto App. No. 05CA3044, 2006-Ohio-2896, 2006 WL 1570598, at \u00b6 18 (\u201cGenerally, statutory construction is a legal issue that appellate courts review de novo\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 733.60 imposes a limitations period for taxpayer actions brought under R.C. 733.56 et seq. See <em>Cuyahoga Falls v. Robart </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 567 N.E.2d 987 (\u201cAlthough [R.C. 733.60] does not expressly refer to cases involving misapplication of funds, when the purported misapplication of funds is the result of an illegal contract, the one-year limitations period of R.C. 733.60 applies\u201d); <em>Westbrook v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 166, 169, 524 N.E.2d 485 (\u201c[A]ny action predicated upon R.C. 733.56 and 733.59 must be instituted within the limitation period prescribed by R.C. 733.60\u201d). R.C. 733.56 requires, among other things,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the village solicitor or the city law director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>seek an injunction in the name of the municipal corporation to restrain \u201cthe execution or performance of any contract made in behalf of the municipal corporation in contravention of the laws or ordinance[s] governing it.\u201d If the village solicitor or the city law director fails to apply for an injunction after a taxpayer requests that he do so, R.C. 733.59 permits the taxpayer to file an action in her own name on behalf of the municipal corporation. R.C. 733.60, however, provides that \u201c[n]o action to enjoin the performance of a contract entered into or the payment of any bonds issued by a municipal corporation shall be brought or maintained unless commenced within one year from the date of such contract or bond.\u201d The city entered into the contract with the Marting Foundation to purchase the building on May 29, 2002, and the Mollettes filed their complaint on May 28, 2004. Thus, if R.C. 733.60 governs, this action is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 22} However, the Mollettes brought their complaint alleging a violation of the charter and the Open Meetings Act. R.C. 121.22(I)(1) provides: \u201cAny person may bring an action to enforce this section. An action under division (I)(1) of this section shall be brought within two years after the date of the alleged violation or threatened violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cIn making the choice between two statutes of limitations applicable to the same conduct, it is settled law that: \u2018A special statutory provision which relates to the specific subject matter involved in litigation is controlling over a general statutory provision which might otherwise be applicable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Love v. Port Clinton </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 98, 99, 524 N.E.2d 166, quoting <em>Andrianos v. Community Traction Co. </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 47, 44 O.O. 72, 97 N.E.2d 549, paragraph one of the syllabus; see also <em>Minster Farmers Coop. Exchange Co. v. Meyer, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 459, 2008-Ohio-1259, 884 N.E.2d 1056, at \u00b6 25 (\u201cWhen statutes conflict, the more specific provision controls over the more general provision\u201d). Furthermore, R.C. 1.51 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 24} Both statutes of limitations apply to lawsuits seeking to invalidate municipal contracts. R.C. 733.56 et seq. authorizes taxpayer actions to enjoin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u201cthe misapplication of funds of the municipal corporation, the abuse of its corporate powers, or the execution or performance of any contract made in behalf of the municipal corporation in contravention of the laws or ordinance[s] governing it, or which was procured by fraud or corruption.\u201d R.C. 733.60 applies to only a subset of cases authorized by R.C. 733.56 et seq.: those seeking to invalidate a municipal contract on the ground that the city lacked the legal authority to enter into it. Nonetheless, the potential grounds for relief are broader than the grounds for relief provided in the Open Meetings Act, which invalidates only those official acts that should have been, but were not, deliberated and enacted at a public meeting. Although the statute of limitations in R.C. 121.22(1) applies to all actions to enforce the Open Meetings Act, including actions seeking a declaratory judgment or an injunction and actions against other public bodies besides municipal corporations, the statute of limitations in R.C. 733.60 applies to taxpayer actions seeking to enjoin the performance of a contract for a variety of reasons besides the failure to hold an open meeting. Thus, the statutory provisions authorizing taxpayer actions are more general that the statutory provisions enacting the Open Meetings Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 25} We conclude that the two-year statute of limitations provided in R.C. 121.22(I)(1) applies to this action. Not only did the General Assembly place this limitations period in the same statute granting individuals the right to sue for violations of the Open Meetings Act, the limitations period appears in the next sentence in the same subparagraph. We believe that it would be incongruous to conclude that an action brought under the Open Meetings Act was not subject to the statute of limitations found in that very act. Furthermore, despite the fact that the Open Meetings Act was enacted after R.C. 733.60, the Open Meetings Act does not demonstrate any legislative intent that some claims brought under the act be limited by the one-year limitations period found in R.C. 733.60. See also <em>Koncsol v. Niles </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 535, 538, 664 N.E.2d 616 (explaining that the placement of the statute of limitations in the same code chapter as the right to sue a political subdivision reinforces the analysis that the more specific statute prevails over the more general). Accordingly, we overrule the city\u2019s fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">V. Relation Back of the Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 26} In its sixth assignment of error, the city argues that the Mollettes\u2019 amended complaint naming the city as a party did not relate back to the filing of the initial complaint and, therefore, was untimely under the two-year statute of limitations of R.C. 121.22(I)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 27} First, the city argues that the failure to name a legal entity rendered the Mollettes\u2019 initial complaint a nullity. Under the city\u2019s reasoning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>even if the amended complaint had been served within one year of the initial complaint, the relation-back doctrine could not apply because there was no valid initial complaint upon which the relation-back doctrine could operate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Baker v. McKnight </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 125, 4 OBR 371, 447 N.E.2d 104, the plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident and filed a lawsuit against the allegedly negligent defendant. After negotiations with the defendant\u2019s insurance carrier failed, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the defendant. However, by the time she filed her complaint, the defendant had died, and the statute of limitations expired before the plaintiff learned of the defendant\u2019s death. The plaintiff moved to amend her complaint to substitute the defendant\u2019s administrator for the defendant. The trial court, relying on the principle articulated by the court in <em>Barnhart v. Schultz </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 59, 7 O.O.3d 142, 372 N.E.2d 589, that a deceased person is not a legal entity and therefore cannot be a party to a lawsuit, dismissed the complaint. \u201cBecause a party must actually or legally exist \u2018one deceased cannot be a party to an action\u2019 and a suit brought against a dead person is a nullity.\u201d Id. at 61, 7 O.O.3d 142, 372 N.E.2d 589, quoting <em>Brickley v. Neuling </em>(1950), 256 Wis. 334, 336, 41 N.W.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 29} The court in <em>Baker </em>overruled the holding in <em>Barnhart </em>that the relation-back doctrine cannot apply to a complaint naming a dead person. Instead, the court treated the case as one involving a misnomer, explaining that the real party in interest was the administrator, not the decedent. Thus, even though the plaintiffs complaint named as defendant a legal nonentity, the deceased, it was not true that \u201c \u2018there was no complaint against an existing party for the amended complaint to relate back to.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker, </em>4 Ohio St.3d at 127, 4 OBR 371, 447 N.E.2d 104, quoting <em>Barnhart, </em>53 Ohio St.2d at 62, 7 O.O.3d 142, 372 N.E.2d 589. Accordingly, the court rejected the same \u201cnullity\u201d theory that the city puts forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 30} Similarly, in <em>Hardesty v. Cabotage </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 114, 1 OBR 147, 438 N.E.2d 431, the plaintiff filed a malpractice action naming the \u201cBoard of Trustees of Blanchard Valley Hospital\u201d as defendant. However, the entity that the plaintiff actually attempted to sue was \u201cBlanchard Valley Hospital Association, Inc.\u201d (\u201cthe hospital\u201d). Thus, the plaintiffs original complaint named what was, technically, a legal nonentity. After the statute of limitations expired but within one year of filing the initial complaint, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint naming the proper defendant \u2014 the hospital. The plaintiff served both the original and the amended complaint at the same address, and the same hospital employee accepted service. The hospital moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired and that \u201cthere was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>entity to which such relation back could apply.\u201d <em>Hardesty </em>at 116, 1 OBR 147, 438 N.E.2d 431. The trial court dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 31} The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that \u201cin the original complaint, an existing defendant was improperly named and served.\u201d <em>Hardesty </em>at 116-117, 1 OBR 147, 438 N.E.2d 431. Thus, notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff technically brought the action against a nonexistent entity, the plaintiff timely commenced his action because the amended complaint related back to the initial complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 32} The city relies on <em>Patterson v. V &amp; M Auto Body </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 573, 589 N.E.2d 1306, for the proposition that a complaint brought against an entity that is not sui juris is a nullity. However, the court in <em>Patterson </em>did not hold that a complaint naming a legal nonentity is a nullity and that, therefore, an amended complaint naming a legal entity cannot relate back to an original complaint naming a legal nonentity. Those issues never arose because the plaintiff never amended his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 33} In <em>Patterson, </em>the plaintiff named a sole proprietorship as the defendant. The owner of the sole proprietorship notified the plaintiff on three occasions that the plaintiff had sued an entity without the capacity to be sued. However, the \u25a0plaintiff did not amend his complaint, and over the defendant\u2019s objections, the case proceeded to trial and judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that no action had been commenced pursuant to Civ.R. 3(A) because the plaintiff never served the complaint on a proper defendant or upon \u201can incorrectly named defendant whose name is later corrected\u201d in an amended complaint. Thus, the judgment was void. However, the Supreme Court explained that it would have been -within the trial court\u2019s discretion to substitute the owner of the business for the business named in the complaint had the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 34} Based upon <em>Baker, Hardesty, </em>and <em>Patterson, </em>we reject the city\u2019s argument that the Mollettes\u2019 original complaint was a nullity that could not serve as a basis for the application of the relation-back doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">{\u00b6 35} Next, the city argues that the Mollettes\u2019 amended complaint cannot relate back to the original complaint because the Mollettes failed to serve an entity that was sui juris within one year of filing the original complaint. Thus, they argue, the action cannot be deemed commenced at the filing of the original complaint, and the Mollettes\u2019 action is barred by the statute of limitations. The Mollettes argue that they did not need to serve the amended complaint within the one-year period provided by Civ.R. 3(A) as long as the proper defendants had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>notice of the action within one year from the date they filed their original complaint. We begin our analysis with the language of Civ.R. 3(A) and 15(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 36} Civ.R. 3(A) addresses the commencement of an action and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court, if service is obtained within one year from such filing upon a named defendant, or upon an incorrectly named defendant whose name is later corrected pursuant to Civ.R. 15(C), or upon a defendant identified by a fictitious name whose name is later corrected pursuant to Civ.R. 15(D).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 37} Civ.R. 15 provides for amended and supplemental pleadings. Under Civ.R. 15(C), an amendment changing a party may relate back to the filing date of the original complaint for purposes of applying the statute of limitations. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading. An amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing provision is satisfied and, within the period provided by law for commencing the action against him, the party to be brought in by amendment (1) has received such notice of the institution of the action that he will not be prejudiced in maintaining his defense on the merits, \u25a0 and (2) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">{\u00b6 38} The Supreme Court of Ohio has construed the language \u201cwithin the period provided by law for commencing the action\u201d in Civ.R. 15(C) to refer to the time allowed for effectuating service of a party under Civ.R. 3(A) \u2014 one year \u2014 not the applicable statute of limitations. <em>Cecil v. Cottrill </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 367, 371, 618 N.E.2d 133. Thus, in order for an amended complaint to relate back to an initially filed complaint, the action must be properly and timely commenced pursuant to Civ.R. 3(A), which requires service of process within one year, and the requirements of Civ.R. 15(C), which requires actual notice to the proper party within one year, must also be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">{\u00b6 39} Caselaw supports this construction. In <em>Baker, </em>4 Ohio St.3d 125, 4 OBR 371, 447 N.E.2d 104, the defendant died between the accrual of the cause of action and the filing of the complaint, and the plaintiff unknowingly filed suit against the decedent rather than his estate. Although the statute of limitations had run before the plaintiff filed her amended complaint substituting the administrator for the decedent, the court allowed the amendment to relate back \u201cwhen the service on the administrator is obtained within the one-year, post filing period provided for in Civ.R. 3(A).\u201d <em>Baker, </em>supra, at syllabus. Thus, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>explicitly required any amendment substituting the administrator for the decedent to occur within the one-year period set forth in Civ.R. 3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">{\u00b6 40} We find <em>Baker </em>to be on point. In <em>Baker, </em>the plaintiff named and attempted to serve a complaint on a party that no longer existed, i.e., the decedent. The court held that the initial complaint was not a nullity, but it did not suffice to commence the action under Civ.R. 3(A). Instead, the plaintiff had to serve the proper party, the decedent\u2019s estate, within the one-year limitation period of Civ.R. 3(A) in order for the action to be deemed timely commenced. Likewise, the Mollettes named an entity that was not sui juris. But unlike the plaintiff in <em>Baker, </em>they failed to serve their amended complaint on the proper parties within the one-year period provided in Civ.R. 3(A) for effectuating service. Applying <em>Baker, </em>we conclude that the Mollettes failed to timely commence their action.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 41} The Mollettes rely on the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s decision in <em>Cecil, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 367, 618 N.E.2d 133, for the proposition that their original complaint commenced this action notwithstanding the fact that they failed to serve the city and the individual members of the city council within the one-year period provided by Civ.R. 3(A). However, we believe that <em>Cecil </em>is distinguishable on its facts. In <em>Cecil, </em>the plaintiffs brought suit against \u201cJames C. Cottrill,\u201d the owner of the vehicle and father of the driver, rather than his son, \u201cJames L. Cottrill,\u201d who was the tortfeasor and proper defendant. The plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to name James L. as the defendant more than 17 months after the complaint had been filed and after the statute of limitations had expired. The Supreme Court held that the amended complaint related back to the initial complaint, emphasizing that the proper party had notice of the action at the filing of the complaint. The court explained that \u201c[njotice is the essential reason for service. There is no question that * * * the party intended to be sued was indeed provided adequate notice of such suit.\u201d <em>Cecil </em>at 371, 618 N.E.2d 133. Thus, the Mollettes argue, because the proper parties had adequate notice of this lawsuit, they did not need to serve the amended complaint on the city of Portsmouth and the individual members of the city council within one year from the filing of the initial complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 42} Unlike the Mollettes, however, the plaintiff in <em>Cecil </em>named a party that had the capacity to be sued, i.e., the father. And the plaintiff commenced the action by serving his complaint on that named party, even though the father was not the real party in interest. Doing -so commenced the action for purposes of Civ.R. 3(A), and the plaintiff in <em>Cecil </em>only had to comply with Civ.R. 15(C) in order for the amended complaint to be deemed timely filed. Civ.R. 15(C) requires notice of the action \u2014 not personal service- \u2014 -within the time period provided Civ.R. 3(A). In contrast, the Mollettes\u2019 complaint named an entity that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>did not have the capacity to be sued. Furthermore, the Mollettes did not serve the complaint on a party with capacity to be sued within one year of filing the original complaint. Thus, the Mollettes failed to accomplish service of process of the initial complaint within the period required by Civ.R. 3(A), and thus, they failed to commence the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 43} Furthermore, the court in <em>Cecil </em>suggested that the plaintiff in that case had merely inadvertently misspelled the defendant\u2019s name by using the wrong initial. The same cannot be said for the Mollettes, who brought suit against an entity that lacked the capacity to be sued. We also disagree with the Mollettes\u2019 contention that they were simply \u201cmistaken as to the proper name of the defendants.\u201d They were not mistaken about the name of the party to be sued; they were mistaken about their ability to sue the entity in its own name. However, the law was clear at the time they filed their complaint that the Portsmouth City Council was not sui juris.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 44} More important, the court in <em>Cecil </em>did not expressly hold that a plaintiff can commence an action under Civ.R. 3(A) without serving a codefendant with the capacity to be sued within one year from filing the action. The father, who was initially named, had the capacity to be sued and he was served within the time provided by Civ.R. 3(A). Furthermore, given that the court did not explain its reasoning in allowing the amended complaint to relate back despite the failure of untimely service, other legal theories such as estoppel could have served as the basis of the court\u2019s decision. In <em>Cecil, </em>the facts suggested that the real defendant was aware that the plaintiff had named the wrong party but took steps to delay the plaintiff from learning of the mistake and then, upon the expiration of the one-year period, pulled the failure of service like a rabbit from a hat. In this case, however, there is no indication that the city was aware of the Mollettes\u2019 mistake and waited until the time for service had run. In fact, the city raised the defense that the city council was not sui juris within the one-year period of Civ.R. 3(A). Moreover, equitable estoppel may not have been available against the city. See, e.g., <em>Hortman v. Miamisburg, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 194, 2006-Ohio-4251, 852 N.E.2d 716, at \u00b6 25 (holding that \u201cthe doctrines of equitable estoppel and promissory estoppel are inapplicable against a political subdivision when the political subdivision is engaged in a governmental function\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">{\u00b6 45} However, the Mollettes could have filed and served an amended complaint on the city and the individual members of the city council within one year from the initial complaint, and, if they satisfied the requirements of Civ.R. 15(C), their amended complaint would relate back to the filing date of the initial complaint for purposes of the statute of limitations. <em>Baker, 4 </em>Ohio St.3d 125, 4 OBR 371, 447 N.E.2d 104, at syllabus. The Mollettes failed to do so, despite having notice of the defect in their initial complaint before the one-year period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Civ.R. 3(A) elapsed. The Mollettes apparently first became aware that they had sued a defendant who cannot be sued while the first appeal in this case was pending. On February 17, 2005, they filed a motion in this court seeking leave to amend their complaint. The one-year period provided in Civ.R. 3(A) for effectuating service expired on May 28, 2005. However, the Mollettes argued, and we agreed, that we lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because the trial court\u2019s order was not final and appealable. Without jurisdiction, we did not and could not address the motion for leave to amend. But because we never acquired jurisdiction over the appeal, the trial court was not divested of jurisdiction over the case. See <em>State ex rel. Everhart v. McIntosh, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 195, 2007-Ohio-4798, 874 N.E.2d 516, \u00b6 14 (\u201c[A] premature notice of appeal * * * does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to proceed because the appeal has not yet been perfected\u201d). However, the Mollettes did not file their motion to amend in the trial court until July 26, 2005, after the one-year period for effectuating service had elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">{\u00b6 46} Nor do we believe that <em>Fields v. Dailey </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 33, 587 N.E.2d 400, also relied upon by the Mollettes, leads us to a different result. In <em>Fields, </em>the defendants argued that the action should be dismissed because the plaintiff sued the Columbus Police Department, which lacked the capacity to be sued, rather than the city of Columbus. The court rejected this argument, noting that at all times that the city attorney had adequately represented the interests of the proper party and that \u201cany deficiency in plaintiffs complaint was purely technical and did not prejudice defendants.\u201d Id. at 45, 587 N.E.2d 400. The court also concluded that \u201c[t]o the extent defendants claim the police department lacks the legal capacity to be sued, such matter must be raised in the answer by specific negative averment. Civ.R. 9(A). Defendants\u2019 failure to aver the lack of legal capacity of the police department supports the decision of the trial court to deny defendants\u2019 Civ.R. 50(A) motion.\u201d <em>Fields </em>at 45, 587 N.E.2d 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 47} However, we reaffirm our prior holding that where the named defendant lacks the capacity to be sued, failure to raise the issue of that defendant\u2019s non-sui-juris status in a responsive pleading does not constitute waiver of the issue. <em>Mollette II </em>at \u00b6 24. On our own motion, we directed the parties to file briefs discussing the appropriateness of reconsidering our holding in <em>Mollette II </em>that a non-sui-juris entity cannot waive its lack of capacity to be sued. After due consideration, we adhere to our holding in that case. But to the extent that <em>Mollette II </em>described the city council as a legal nonentity, rather than as a legal entity lacking capacity, it was erroneous. We relied in part on our erroneous conclusion that the city council was not a legal entity in deciding that it could not waive the lack-of-capacity defense. However, the city council is a legal entity. The Ohio Revised Code distinguishes between the \u201clegislative authority\u201d and the \u201cmembers of the legislative authority.\u201d R.C. 731.01; R.C. 731.04; R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>731.05. This distinction demonstrates that the city council, as the legislative authority, has a legal existence separate from its individual members in their legislative capacity. Moreover, R.C. 731.05 grants the legislative authority power to act in many capacities. Thus, the city council is a legal entity, albeit one that lacks capacity to sue or be sued. However, that oversight does not change our conclusion that an entity without capacity to sue or be sued can neither initiate nor defend a lawsuit. Thus, waiver does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">{\u00b648} Finally, the Supreme Court of Ohio has previously considered and rejected the argument that amending a complaint is a mere technicality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">The plaintiff has urged that [the proper defendant\u2019s] appearance and defense enabled the court to reach the merits of the case, and that amendment of the complaint was an unnecessary technicality. This court has said: \u201cThe spirit of the Civil Rules is the resolution of cases upon their merits, not upon pleading deficiencies. * * *\u201d <em>Peterson v. Teodosio, </em>[34 Ohio St.2d 161, 175, 63 O.O.2d 262, 297 N.E.2d 113]; accord <em>Baker v. McKnight, </em>supra, 4 Ohio St.3d at 129, 4 OBR at 374, 447 N.E.2d at 107. The case law illustrates the liberality with which Ohio courts will permit amendments to cure defective pleadings. These holdings do not, however, stand for the proposition that amendments are unnecessary, that where defects appear they may be ignored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\"><em>Patterson </em>at 576-577, 589 N.E.2d 1306. For these reasons, we decline to follow <em>Fields.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">{\u00b6 49} Finally, the dissent relies upon our decision in <em>Marcinko v. Carson, </em>Pike App. No. 04CA723, 2004-Ohio-3850, 2004 WL 1615938, to conclude that the Mollettes\u2019 complaint relates back. We do not share that conclusion because <em>Marcinko </em>is factually distinguishable. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s implication that the one-year period set forth in Civ.R. 3(A) for commencing an action had expired, the opinion notes otherwise. The accident between Marcinko and Carson occurred on October 29, 2001. The Marcinkos filed their complaint on October 6, 2003, within the two-year limitations period. Thus, they had until October 7, 2004 to obtain service on a party with the capacity to be sued in order to properly commence their action under Civ.R. 3(A). However, the \u201cdefendant\u201d filed a motion to dismiss on November 3, 2003, and the trial court dismissed the complaint on December 2, 2003, well before the one-year period for obtaining service had run. In fact, the Marcinkos filed their notice of appeal on January 2, 2004, but also filed a post-dismissal motion for leave to amend their complaint and substitute the administrator of the estate for the \u201cdefendant.\u201d This motion to amend clearly occurred prior to the passage of the one-year period set in Civ.R. 3(A) as the trial court filed an entry on January 23, 2004, addressing that issue without resolving it. Thus, <em>Marcinko </em>is clearly distinguishable. Had the Mollettes sought leave to amend their complaint <em>to </em>add the proper parties prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the expiration of the one-year period, we would be faced with a different issue. But those are not the facts before us, nor does <em>Marcinko </em>control the facts that are.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 50} We agree with the city that the Mollettes did not commence their action within the time provided by the statute of limitations. Because the Portsmouth City Council is not sui juris, filing a complaint naming it as the sole defendant did not in itself commence this action before the limitations period elapsed. Because the Mollettes failed to serve an amended complaint on a party with the capacity to be sued within the one-year period provided by Civ.R. 3(A), the amendment could not relate back for purposes of the statute of limitations. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying the city\u2019s motion for a summary judgment and in entering a summary judgment in favor of the Mollettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">VI. The Parties\u2019 Other Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 51} Based on our determination that the Mollettes have failed to file a timely complaint and commence this action, all other assignments of error raised in the Mollettes\u2019 appeal and the city\u2019s cross-appeal are rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">VII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 52} We hold that the two-year statute of limitations applies in actions challenging ordinances adopted in violation of the Open Meeting Act as incorporated by the city charter. But because the Mollettes failed to serve a legal entity with the capacity to be sued, they failed to commence their action within the applicable statute of limitations. Moreover, because this action was never commenced, the trial court erred in concluding that the amended complaint related back to the initial complaint naming the city council as a party.

Despite the fact that the motion for leave was not granted within the one-year period, we found that the administrator of the estate had actual notice and that once the amended complaint was formally filed, it would relate back to the original complaint. Id. at \u00b6 26-27.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I also observe that in the <em>Cecil </em>case, the original complaint was filed on the day the statute of limitations ran but permission to file an amended complaint that properly named defendant did not occur until 16 months later. <em>Cecil v. Cottrill </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 367, 367-368, 618 N.E.2d 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 55} Here, there is no dispute that the city had actual notice of the lawsuit and knew that it was the proper party before the one-year period for service expired. In fact, while this case was on appeal the first time, the city made the argument to this court that the city council was not sui juris and was improperly named. In the prior appeal, we remanded the case, ordering the trial court to allow the Mollettes to amend their complaint, which they did. I would, therefore, rely on <em>Marcinko </em>and overrule the assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 56} Accordingly, I dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">. The majority opinion states that service was not perfected within a year. I respectfully disagree. While this case was on its first appeal, the city was served with the motion for leave to amend during the one-year period. This service was sufficient under Civ.R. 3(A). See Civ.R. 5(B)(permitting service on the party's attorney); <em>Ervin v. Patrons Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 8, 20 OBR 80, 484 N.E.2d 695 (suggesting an attorney of record could be served with an amended complaint even without service on the first complaint); <em>Knotts v. Solid Rock Ents., Inc., </em>Montgomery App. No. 21622, 2007-Ohio-1059, 2007 WL 715998, \u00b6 42, 45; <em>O\u2019Brien v. Citicorp Mtge., Inc. </em>(Feb. 12, 1994), Franklin App. No. 93AP-1074, 1994 WL 57675 (stating that an amended complaint not asserting new claims can be served by regular service).

Illuminating Co., </em>Mahoning App. No. 05MA120, 2006-Ohio-1283, 2006 WL 696125, \u00b6 44-46 (finding that when reading the rules in pari material, notice, but not necessarily service, on the properly named defendant must occur within one year); <em>Guerrero v. C.H.P., Inc. </em>(Aug. 16, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 78484, 2001 WL 931640 (holding that the filing of a motion for leave to file an amended complaint with the amended complaint attached satisfies the service requirement).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
