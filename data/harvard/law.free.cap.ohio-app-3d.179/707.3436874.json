Appellee and cross-appellant, HCMC, Inc., d.b.a. We Care Medical (\u201cHCMC\u201d), cross-appeals. For reasons that follow, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the common pleas court and remand the matter to the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">{\u00b6 2} HCMC is a company that provides oxygen respiratory services. Between November 2004 and November 2005, the Ohio Auditor of State audited Medicaid reimbursements that were made to HCMC for the period of October 1, 2001, through June 30, 2004. During the period under audit, HCMC received reimbursements totaling $1,436,907.52 for 7,993 claims. According to the state auditor\u2019s report, the scope of the audit was limited to claims, not involving Medicare copayments, for which HCMC rendered services to Medicaid patients, and all of HCMC\u2019s reimbursements were for the supply of oxygen concentrator services to Medicaid residents in long-term care facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">{\u00b6 3} After reviewing HCMC\u2019s Medicaid services, the state auditor determined that HCMC had received $1,010,404.26 in overpayments and separated the results into \u201cexception testing\u201d and \u201cusual and customary\u201d categories.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ODJFS thereafter issued a proposed adjudication order with a demand that HCMC repay $1,010,404.26, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Challenging factual and legal conclusions of the audit, HCMC requested an administrative hearing pursuant to R.C. Chapters 119 and 5111. After conducting an administrative hearing, a hearing examiner issued a report and recommendation, wherein the hearing examiner concluded that HCMC owed the full amount identified in the audit. Objecting to this report and recommendation, HCMC sought relief from ODJFS. Adopting the hearing examiner\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation, the director of ODJFS rejected HCMC\u2019s objections and issued an adjudication order directing HCMC to repay $1,010,404.26, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">{\u00b6 5} From this order, ODJFS appealed to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. On condition that HCMC post a supersedeas bond in the amount of $200,000, the common pleas court stayed enforcement of the adjudication order. Later, the common pleas court reversed the agency\u2019s adjudication order and remanded the matter to ODJFS to calculate a \u201cusual and customary\u201d charge based on the common pleas court\u2019s findings and conclusions. From the common pleas court judgment, ODJFS appeals and HCMC cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">{\u00b6 6} Upon ODJFS\u2019s unopposed motion, this court permitted ODJFS to collect $34,250.10, plus applicable interest from HCMC, thereby excepting an amount from the common pleas court\u2019s stay order that represented the \u201cexception testing\u201d portion of the state\u2019s audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">{\u00b6 7} In its appeal, ODJFS advances four assignments of error, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">First Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">The trial court erred by ordering further factual development of appellant\u2019s cost calculations when the appellant \u201cchose not to supply more detailed information on its cost calculations\u201d during the audit or the administrative hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-10\">Second Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">The lower court erred when it concluded that oxygen services provided to Medicaid and non-Medicaid patients are different because the oxygen supply company bills the nursing home and terms the service a rental.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-12\">Third Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-13\">The lower court erred when it ordered ODJFS to pay a surcharge to compensate a Medicaid provider for its \u201coverhead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-14\">Fourth Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-15\">The trial court erred by staying enforcement of an entire adjudication order where the Medicaid provider stipulated that it was required to repay a specific amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-16\">{\u00b6 8} On cross-appeal, HCMC advances the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\n<em>Cross-Appeal Assignment Of Error No. I:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">The trial court erred by remanding this matter to the department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agx\">\n<em>Cross-Appeal Assignment Of Error No. II:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">The trial court abused its discretion when it failed to reverse the department\u2019s decision to exclude relevant evidence offered by HCMC at hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">{\u00b6 9} For ease of review, we shall address ODJFS\u2019s and HCMC\u2019s claims of error in a different order from the sequence offered by the parties. We shall begin, however, by sua sponte considering whether this court has subject-matter jurisdiction to consider ODJFS\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">{\u00b6 10} An appellate court may sua sponte consider whether subject-matter jurisdiction properly lies. <em>State ex rel. White v. Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 543, 544, 684 N.E.2d 72; <em>Buzard v. Triplett, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-579, 2006-Ohio-1478, 2006 WL 772024, at \u00b6 7; <em>Mogavero v. Lombardo </em>(Sept. 25, 2001), Franklin App. No. 01AP-98, 2001 WL 1117542. Subject-matter jurisdiction is a condition precedent to a court\u2019s ability to consider a case. Absent subject-matter jurisdiction, a court\u2019s proclamation is void. See <em>State ex rel. Ohio Democratic Party v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 246, 2006-Ohio-5202, 855 N.E.2d 1188, at \u00b6 8, quoting <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, at \u00b6 11, quoting <em>State ex rel. Tubbs Jones v. Suster </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 70, 75, 701 N.E.2d 1002, reconsideration denied (1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 1475, 704 N.E.2d 582 (\u201c \u2018[subject-matter jurisdiction] is a \u201ccondition precedent to the court\u2019s ability to hear the case. If a court acts without jurisdiction, then any proclamation by that court is void.\u201d \u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">{\u00b6 11} Fundamental to ODJFS\u2019s appeal is a contention that the common pleas court incorrectly interpreted ODJFS\u2019s administrative rules. R.C. 119.12 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">An appeal by the agency shall be taken on questions of law relating to the constitutionality, construction, or interpretation of statutes and rules of the agency, and, in the appeal, the court may also review and determine the correctness of the judgment of the court of common pleas that the order of the agency is not supported by any reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the entire record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">{\u00b6 12} In its decision, the common pleas court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">It is * * * concluded that the audit did not compare rates for the same service. While the audit may constitute prima facie evidence, nothing prohibits review of the underlying premises upon which the audit is based. The Court has considered the applicable rules in pari materia and finds Appellant\u2019s interpretation legally correct. Phraseology of \u201cusual and customary fee charged to patients for the same service\u201d does not comport with construing rental of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>machines to a facility to be the same as supplying services, to individual Medicaid patients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 13} Because the common pleas court \u201cconsidered the applicable rules in pari materia,\u201d its judgment involved the construction and interpretation of ODJFS\u2019s administrative rules, rather than a simple application of law to facts. Accordingly, we hold that ODJFS properly may appeal to this court. See R.C. 119.12; <em>Wolff v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Serv., </em>165 Ohio App.3d 118, 2006-Ohio-214, 844 N.E.2d 1238, at \u00b6 13 (\u201cbecause the trial court\u2019s decision involved a question of law relating to the interpretation of Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06 and 5101:3-3-08, ODJFS could properly appeal to this court\u201d); see also <em>Enertech Elec., Inc. v. W. Geauga Bd. of Edn. </em>(Sept. 3, 1996), Franklin App. No. 96APE03-370, 1996 WL 506825, citing <em>Ramey v. Ohio State Bd. of Chiropractic Examiners </em>(Aug. 3, 1995), Franklin App. No. 94APE10-1512, 1995 WL 458957. Cf. <em>Ramey, </em>(\u201c[a] simple application of the law to facts does not amount to an interpretation within the meaning of R.C. 119.12\u201d). (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 14} Pursuant to R.C. 119.12, when a common pleas court reviews an order of an administrative agency, it must consider the entire record to determine whether the agency\u2019s order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 110-111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265; see also <em>Andrews v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 275, 280, 58 O.O. 51, 131 N.E.2d 390; <em>Our Place, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 570, 571, 589 N.E.2d 1303 (defining reliable, probative, and substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\"> {\u00b6 15} The common pleas court\u2019s \u201creview of the administrative record is neither a trial <em>de novo </em>nor an appeal on questions of law only, but a hybrid review in which the court \u2018must appraise all the evidence as to the credibility of the witnesses, the probative character of the evidence, and the weight thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lies v. Ohio Veterinary Med. Bd. </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 204, 207, 2 OBR 223, 441 N.E.2d 584, quoting <em>Andrews, </em>164 Ohio St. at 280, 58 O.O. 51, 131 N.E.2d 390. In its review, the common pleas court must give due deference to the administrative agency\u2019s resolution of evidentiary conflicts, but the findings of the agency are not conclusive. <em>Conrad, </em>63 Ohio St.2d at 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">{\u00b6 16} An appellate court\u2019s review of an administrative decision is more limited than that of a common pleas court. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 614 N.E.2d 748. In <em>Pons, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">While it is incumbent on the trial court to examine the evidence, this is not a function of the appellate court. The appellate court is to determine only if the trial court has abused its discretion, i.e., being not merely an error of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>judgment, but perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency. Absent an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, a court of appeals may not substitute its judgment for [that of an administrative agency] or a trial court. Instead, the appellate court must affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Id. at 621, 614 N.E.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">{\u00b6 17} An appellate court does, however, have plenary review of questions of law. <em>Chirila v. Ohio State Chiropractic Bd. </em>(2001), 145 Ohio App.3d 589, 592, 763 N.E.2d 1192, citing <em>Steinfels v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of Sec. </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 800, 803, 719 N.E.2d 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">{\u00b6 18} Bearing in mind these principles, we shall address ODJFS\u2019s assignments of error and HCMC\u2019s assignments of error on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">{\u00b6 19} By its fourth assignment of error, ODJFS asserts that the common pleas court erred by staying enforcement of the agency\u2019s entire adjudication order where HCMC stipulated that it was required to pay $34,250.10, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">{\u00b6 20} Upon ODJFS\u2019s motion, this court already has excepted $34,250.10, plus applicable interest, from the common pleas court\u2019s stay, thereby permitting ODJFS to collect this amount from HCMC. Because, as to ODJFS\u2019s fourth assignment of error, this court already has granted ODJFS the relief it seeks, ODJFS\u2019s fourth assignment of error lacks any practical significance, thereby rendering it moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">{\u00b6 21} By its second assignment of error, claiming the common pleas court incorrectly interpreted ODJFS\u2019s administrative rules, ODJFS asserts that the common pleas court erred when it concluded that oxygen services provided to Medicaid and non-Medicaid patients are different because HCMC bills the nursing home and terms the service a rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">{\u00b6 22} Generally, \u201cadministrative rules do not dictate public policy, but rather expound upon public policy already established by the General Assembly in the Revised Code. \u2018 \u201cThe purpose of administrative rulemaking is to facilitate an administrative agency\u2019s placing into effect a policy declared by the General Assembly in the statutes to be administered by the agency.\u201d \u2019 * * * Yet determination of public policy remains with the General Assembly. * * * Administrative agencies may make only \u2018subordinate\u2019 rules.\u201d <em>Chambers v. St. Mary\u2019s School </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 563, 567, 697 N.E.2d 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cUnlike the legislative process, rulemaking by administrative agencies does not involve the collaborative effort of elected officials. Directors of administrative agencies are appointed by the Governor. * * * It is these directors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>and/or their employees who propose and adopt administrative rules. Administrative agencies have the technical expertise to compose such rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">{\u00b6 24} Thus, appellate courts generally \u201cmust give due deference to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own administrative rules.\u201d <em>Salem v. Koncelik, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 597, 2005-Ohio-5537, 843 N.E.2d 799, at \u00b6 16, citing <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities v. Professionals Guild of Ohio </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 147, 545 N.E.2d 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">{\u00b6 25} Due deference to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own administrative rules, however, is not unfettered. If an agency\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable and fails to apply the plain language of a statute or rule, then an appellate court need not defer to such an unreasonable interpretation. See <em>Guethlein v. Ohio State Liquor Control Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-888, 2006-Ohio-1525, 2006 WL 827434, at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">{\u00b6 26} Claiming that the state auditor compared rates for the same service, ODJFS asserts that (1) HCMC provided the same medical service, namely, oxygen concentrator services, to Medicaid recipients and non-Medicaid recipients in long-term care facilities (\u201cLTCFs\u201d) and (2) despite providing the same medical service, HCMC received Medicaid reimbursement at a higher rate than the \u201cusual and customary\u201d fee it charged non-Medicaid recipients for the same medical service in violation of former versions of Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-1-17.2(A), which were in effect at all times pertinent to the proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cf. former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-10-13(H)(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">{\u00b6 27} HCMC disputes ODJFS\u2019s characterization that it provided the same medical service to Medicaid recipients and non-Medicaid recipients. Distinguishing between delivery of a \u201cservice\u201d and delivery of a \u201cgood,\u201d HCMC contends it delivered a \u201cservice\u201d to Medicaid recipients in LTCFs; whereas, it delivered a \u201cgood,\u201d namely, an oxygen concentrator, to LTCFs with whom HCMC had contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Delivery of an oxygen concentrator for rental purposes is distinguishable from useful labor related to the operation or maintenance of an oxygen concentrator. Our review of the evidence shows, however, that in this case, the service that HCMC provided to Medicaid recipients in LTCFs, and the service that HCMC provided to LTCFs \"with whom HCMC had contractual obligations involved both the delivery of oxygen concentrators and useful labor related to the operation and maintenance of the oxygen concentrator. Thus, to the extent that the common pleas court\u2019s decision is construed to conclude that oxygen services provided to Medicaid and non-Medicaid patients are different because HCMC bills the nursing home and terms the service a rental, we agree with ODJFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">{\u00b6 29} We disagree, however, with ODJFS\u2019s claim that despite providing the same medical service, HCMC received Medicaid reimbursement at a higher rate than the \u201cusual and customary\u201d fee it charged non-Medicaid recipients for the same medical service in violation of former versions of Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3 \u2014 1\u2014 17.2(A), which were in effect at all times pertinent to the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">{\u00b6 30} Rather, we find that the common pleas court properly concluded that \u201cthe [state auditor\u2019s] audit did not compare rates for the same service\u201d and \u201c[t]here is no evidence provided by the Department that comprises an analysis of or a comparison of the difference between billing by volume versus billing by device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">{\u00b6 31} Here, through its adjudication order, ODJFS adopted the state auditor\u2019s audit, wherein the state auditor compared HCMC\u2019s Medicaid billing records for oxygen concentrator services to patients in LTCFs with contracts that HCMC entered into with LTCFs for rental of oxygen concentrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">{\u00b6 32} Former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-10-13, which was effective October 11, 2001, through October 31, 2007, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-9\">(H) Payment for oxygen claims-long-term care facility. (LTCF).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">Payment for oxygen services for recipients in an LTCF is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-11\">(I) All claims must show billed charges for one month\u2019s service. Billed charges shall be the provider\u2019s usual and customary charge for the oxygen actually used by the recipient. The amount of oxygen actually used each month (as determined from a meter reading or refill amount and delivery information) must be determined and documented by the provider prior to submitting the monthly claim for reimbursement. Documentation of the amount of oxygen used each month must be maintained in the provider\u2019s file. (2) Provider maintenance of documentation of the amount of oxygen used does \u2022 not meet the requirements of this rule when such documentation is created, or collected from sources other than the provider, after the service has been billed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>(3) Regardless of delivery modality, i.e., gaseous system, liquid system, or concentrator, amounts less than seven hundred fifty cubic feet, or the equivalent, must be billed using the special codes established for that purpose and listed in appendix A of rule 5101:3-10-03 of the Administrative Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">(4) Payment will be limited to the lower of the usual and customary charge of the supplier, or the medicaid maximum as set forth in appendix DD of rule 5101:3-1-60 of the Administrative Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">(5) All equipment and supplies associated with oxygen administration to residents of an LTCF must be reimbursed through the facility\u2019s cost report as set forth in rule 5101:3-3-11 of the Administrative Code. Therefore, the cost of reservoirs, stands/carts, regulators, humidifiers, cannulas, masks, and tubing must be billed to the facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">(6) A separate set of procedure codes has been established for oxygen services provided to a resident of an LTCF. Oxygen services provided to a resident of an LTCF must be billed to the department using these codes which are listed in the \u201cMedicaid Supply List\u201d (see appendix A of rule 5101:3-10-03 of the Administrative Code.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Cf. Former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-10-13(C), effective August 1, 1998, through October 10, 2001 (oxygen services provided to residents of long-term care facilities).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">{\u00b6 33} Under former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-10-13(H)(1), HCMC\u2019s billed charges for oxygen services provided to Medicaid recipients in an LTCF were required to be HCMC\u2019s \u201cusual and customary charge for the oxygen actually used by the recipient.\u201d Cf. former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-110-13(C)(5) (\u201c[bjilled charges shall be the provider\u2019s usual and customary charge for the oxygen actually used each month\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Stated differently, under both former Ohio Adm. Code 5101:3-10-13(H)(1) and former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-10-13(C)(5), HCMC\u2019s reimbursement claims for oxygen services provided to Medicaid recipients in an LTCF were linked to a Medicaid recipient\u2019s consumption of oxygen, or the volume of oxygen used by a Medicaid recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">{\u00b6 34} By contrast, however, reimbursement rates through HCMC\u2019s contracts with LTCFs for oxygen concentrators were not linked to the volume of oxygen consumed by patients. Rather, under HCMC\u2019s contracts with LTCFs that specifically referenced oxygen concentrator services, reimbursement rates for oxygen concentrators were based on daily or monthly fixed rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Because HCMC\u2019s claims for oxygen services provided to Medicaid recipients in an LTCF were linked to a recipient\u2019s consumption of oxygen, and because HCMC\u2019s contracts with LTCFs were not linked to a patient\u2019s consumption of oxygen, reimbursement methodologies between HCMC\u2019s billed Medicaid charges and HCMC\u2019s billed charges to individual LTCFs were not interchangeable and lacked equivalency.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 36} Because the essential character of these reimbursement methodologies qualitatively differed, by contrasting these qualitatively different reimbursement methodologies, the state auditor compared factors that were not identical in effect or significance. And because in her analysis the state auditor does not appear to have adjusted for these qualitative differences between the factors, the resulting analysis, which ODJFS adopted when it determined that HCMC owed $976,154.16 for reimbursed services in excess of HCMC\u2019s usual and customary fee, is lacking. Cf. Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-10-13.1(E)(10), effective November 1, 2007 (requiring oxygen providers to bill usual and customary charges for rendered services when compared to similar services provided in the same setting to consumers with payor sources other than Medicaid).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">{\u00b6 37} Additionally, ODJFS\u2019s conclusion that HCMC violated former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-1-17.2(A)(1) is founded on comparisons lacking equivalency. Pursuant to former versions of Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-1-17.2(A), which were in effect at all times pertinent to the proceedings, HCMC, as a Medicaid provider, agreed to (1) render services as medically necessary without regard to factors such as race, creed, color, age, sex, national origin, handicap, or source of payment; (2) submit claims only for services actually performed; and (3) bill ODJFS \u201cfor no more than the usual and customary fee charged other <em>patients </em>for the same service.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Cf. former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-10-13(H)(1), effective October 11, 2001, through October 31, 2007 (requiring billed charges to be the \u201cprovider\u2019s usual and customary charge for the oxygen actually used by the <em>recipient </em>\u201d). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">{\u00b6 38} But here, when the hearing examiner concluded that HCMC received reimbursements at a greater amount than its usual and customary fee for the same medical service, the hearing examiner adopted the state auditor\u2019s analysis contrasting billed charges for oxygen claims involving Medicaid <em>patients </em>in an LTCF with charges to long-term care <em>facilities </em>that had contracted with HCMC for rentals of oxygen concentrators. Thus, rather than contrasting charges between Medicaid patients and non-Medicaid patients, the state auditor and the hearing examiner instead contrasted groupings from conceptually dissimilar categories, namely, patients and facilities, to reach a conclusion that HCMC was reimbursed by Medicaid for an amount that exceeded its usual and customary fee charged other <em>patients </em>for the same service.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>{\u00b6 39} In sum, to the extent that the common pleas court\u2019s decision is construed to conclude that oxygen services provided to Medicaid and non-Medicaid patients are different because HCMC bills the nursing home and terms the service a rental, we agree with ODJFS. We disagree, however, with ODJFS\u2019s contention that HCMC received Medicaid reimbursement at a higher rate than the \u201cusual and customary\u201d fee it charged non-Medicaid recipients for the same medical service in violation of former versions of Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-1-17.2(A), which were in effect at all times pertinent to the proceedings. And we further find that the common pleas court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that \u201cthe [state auditor\u2019s] audit did not compare rates for the same service\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no evidence provided by the Department that comprises an analysis of or a comparison of the difference between billing by volume versus billing by device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 40} Accordingly, we sustain in part ODJFS\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 41} By its third assignment of error, claiming that no statute or administrative rule exists to entitle a Medicaid provider to be reimbursed for overhead expenses, ODJFS asserts that the common pleas court erred when it ordered ODJFS to pay a surcharge to compensate HCMC for its \u201coverhead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 42} In response, HCMC does not call our attention to any statute or administrative rule to support a conclusion that it was entitled to an overhead surcharge. Rather, HCMC claims, among other things, that (1) the Ohio Administrative Code permitted HCMC to be reimbursed for its \u201cusual and customary\u201d charges for the same service; (2) the Ohio Administrative Code does not define \u201cusual and customary\u201d; and (3) except for its charges to Medicaid, HCMC has no \u201cusual and customary\u201d charge for oxygen actually consumed by a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">{\u00b6 43} Generally, under Medicaid law, states have freedom to develop their own standards and methods for reimbursement of Medicaid services. In Congressional Research (\u201cCRS\u201d) Report for Congress (Received through the CRS Web), Medicaid Reimbursement Policy (Oct. 25, 2004), Order Code RL 32644, Summary, Mark Merlis, the report\u2019s author, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">Under Medicaid law, states have considerable freedom to develop their own methods and standards for reimbursement of Medicaid services. Congress has periodically intervened to modify the broad guidelines within which states operate, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] has used its regulatory authority to restrict certain state practices. Actual payment methodologies, however, are still left largely to the discretion of the states.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>{\u00b6 44} In \u201cMedicaid: A Primer,\u201d a Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, which was updated January 17, 2008, Order Code RL 33202, Elicia J. Herz, Specialist in Social Legislation, Domestic Social Policy Division, comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA-\">For the most part, states establish their own payment rates for Medicaid providers. Federal regulations require that these rates be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that covered benefits will be available to Medicaid beneficiaries at least to the same extent they are available to the general population in the same geographic area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">Medicaid regulations place restrictions on how Medicaid cost-sharing may be used in determining provider reimbursement. States are prohibited from increasing the payments they make to providers Jo offset uncollected amounts for deductibles, co-insurance, co-payments or similar charges that the provider has waived or are uncollectible (with the exception of providers reimbursed by the state under Medicare reasonable cost reimbursement principles). In addition, if a state contracts with certain managed care organizations that do not impose the state\u2019s Medicaid cost-sharing requirements on their Medicaid members, the state must calculate payments to such organizations as if those cost-sharing amounts were collected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">(Footnotes omitted.) Id. at CRS-10 to CRS-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">{\u00b6 45} Here, in its judgment, the common pleas court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">The Court finds no provision offered by the Department to justify the conclusion that Appellant, by agreeing to provide services to Medicaid patients, has waived the right to recover overhead or administrative costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">The Court is not determining that the full additional amounts claimed are appropriate in establishing the proper reimbursement rate. The evidence does support that the original $15.00 is at least reasonable as a bottom limit. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">It is incumbent upon the Department to calculate the proper usual and customary charge based upon the findings and conclusions in this decision. Accordingly, the matter is therefore REVERSED AND REMANDED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">{\u00b6 46} Absent any statute or administrative rule permitting a Medicaid provider to be reimbursed for a surcharge for overhead expenses, and to the extent that the common pleas court determined that HCMC was entitled to a surcharge for overhead expenses of at least $15, we find that the common pleas court abused its discretion by ordering ODJFS to recalculate \u201cthe proper usual and customary charge based upon the findings and conclusions in [its] decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">{\u00b6 47} Accordingly, we sustain ODJFS\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>{\u00b6 48} By its first assignment of error, ODJFS asserts that the common pleas court prejudicially erred by ordering further factual development of appellant\u2019s cost calculations when the appellant \u201cchose not to supply more detailed information on its cost calculations\u201d during the audit or the administrative hearing. Specifically, ODJFS asserts that (1) HCMC waived a right to present evidence concerning its costs; (2) HCMC breached a duty to cooperate with the state auditor during the audit; and (3) HCMC failed to sustain its burden of production at the administrative hearing after ODJFS established a prima facie case by submitting the auditor\u2019s report into evidence at the administrative hearing, See <em>St. Francis Home, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Serv., </em>Franklin App. No. 06AP-287, 2006-Ohio-6147, 2006 WL 3365504, at \u00b6 30 (finding that under former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:6-50-09(A)(4) any audit report, report of examination, exit conference report, or report of final settlement issued by ODJFS and entered into evidence is to be considered prima facie evidence of what it asserts).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 49} Our review of the evidence shows that during the audit, HCMC failed to fully provide evidence to the state auditor to support its claims of overhead expenses. And at the administrative hearing, although HCMC offered testimonial evidence that it incurred overhead expenses in providing oxygen services to Medicaid patients in an LTCF, HCMC provided no documentary evidence to support its claims of overhead costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 50} Waiver may be defined as \u201cthe \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

Cf. R.C. 119.09, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">The agency shall pass upon the admissibility of evidence, but a party may at the time make objection to the rulings of the agency thereon, and if the agency refuses to admit evidence, the party offering the same shall make a proffer thereof, and such proffer shall be made a part of the record of such hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">{\u00b6 56} Under former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:6-50-05(E)(3) and 5101:6-50-09(A)(3), the hearing examiner therefore had authority to admit or exclude evidence at the administrative hearing. See also <em>In re Waste Technologies Industries </em>(1998), 132 Ohio App.3d 145, 152, 724 N.E.2d 819 (finding a hearing examiner had discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence); <em>Reed v.

The term discretion itself involves the idea of choice, of an exercise of the will, of a determination made between competing considerations.

I don\u2019t think they did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">I think [HCMC] did not properly share this. I think [HCMC] should have shared this information. Even if [it] had, though, I\u2019m not sure it would have been especially relevant given its limited scope and time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">{\u00b6 61} Finding no error based on the hearing examiner\u2019s exclusion of HCMC\u2019s offered evidence, the common pleas court stated, \u201cAppellant has chosen, at its own risk, to keep information private. Had it intended to use the VITAS charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>to help establish the usual and customary charge, then it should have * * * given the Auditors the benefit of that information any [sic] chose not to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANQ\">{\u00b6 62} We likewise find no abuse of discretion. As ODJFS notes, mere failure to supply information during the audit process may not be enough to preclude the admission of such information at a hearing to challenge the final audit. Here, however, the hearing examiner specifically requested briefing on the question whether HCMC\u2019s alleged failure to cooperate precluded admission of the contracts and related information. ODJFS briefed the issue; HCMC did not. The hearing examiner also allowed HCMC to offer testimony concerning the contracts. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the common pleas court abused its discretion by failing to reverse the hearing officer\u2019s exclusion of evidence. Stated differently, we cannot conclude that the common pleas court\u2019s failure to reverse the hearing examiner\u2019s evidentiary ruling, was \u201c \u2018so palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason but rather of passion or bias.\u2019 \u201d <em>Huffman, </em>19 Ohio St.3d at 87, 19 OBR 123, 482 N.E.2d 1248, quoting <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 63} Finding that the common pleas court did not abuse its discretion by failing to reverse the hearing examiner\u2019s exclusion of evidence offered by HCMC at the administrative hearing, we therefore overrule HCMC\u2019s second assignment of error on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 64} By its first assignment of error on cross-appeal, HCMC asserts that the common pleas court erred by remanding the matter to ODJFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 65} R.C. 119.12 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">The court may affirm the order of the agency complained of in the appeal if it finds, upon consideration of the entire record and any additional evidence the court has admitted, that the order is supported by rehable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.

Specifically, we agree with the common pleas court\u2019s finding that the state auditor\u2019s analysis was flawed and with the court\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]here is no evidence provided by the Department that comprises an analysis of or a comparison of the difference between billing by volume versus billing by device.\u201d Therefore, for different reasons from those of the common pleas court, we agree with the common pleas court\u2019s view that ODJFS improperly calculated the \u201cusual and customary\u201d rate with respect to HCMC\u2019s reimbursed Medicaid charges. Under such circumstances, we cannot conclude that the common pleas court\u2019s order remanding the matter to ODJFS was unsupported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 69} Accordingly, HCMC\u2019s first assignment of error on cross-appeal is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b6 70} In summary, ODJFS\u2019s fourth assignment of error is moot; ODJFS\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled; ODJFS\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained in part; and ODJFS\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained. HCMC\u2019s two assignments of error on cross-appeal are overruled. Finding that absent any authority in statute or administrative rule to support its finding, the common pleas court abused its discretion when it found that HCMC was entitled to a surcharge for \u201coverhead\u201d costs associated with Medicaid billing, we reverse in part the judgment of the common pleas court. However, agreeing with the common pleas court\u2019s view that ODJFS\u2019s adjudication order was based upon comparisons lacking in equivalency, we affirm in part the judgment of the common pleas court. We also remand the matter to the common pleas court with instructions to return this matter to ODJFS for reconsideration of HCMC\u2019s \u201cusual and customary\u201d Medicaid reimbursement rate in a manner consistent with our opinion and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b764-8\">French and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-12\">.
