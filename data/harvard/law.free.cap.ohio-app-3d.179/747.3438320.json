Kunkle, guilty of criminal contempt of court for lying under oath. The court sentenced him to 10 days\u2019 incarceration. Appellant now challenges that judgment through the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b787-16\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding appellant in criminal contempt of court for allegedly giving false testimony at a July, 2004 judgment debtor examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-17\">{\u00b6 3} This case was initiated in June 2003, when appellee, the Ohio Department of Taxation, filed a proceeding in aid of execution of judgment in the court below. That proceeding was filed after appellee obtained a judgment against appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>for $21,446.30 for past-due personal income taxes. The first debtor\u2019s examination occurred on August 22, 2003, at which appellant denied owning any interest in real property. That examination was transcribed but was not presided over by the lower court. Subsequently, on July 19, 2004, the case proceeded to a debtor\u2019s examination before Judge James Barber. Again, appellant denied owning any real estate or having any interest in real estate. Ultimately, Judge Barber recused himself from this case for a potential conflict of interest, and Judge Joseph Schmenk was assigned to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">{\u00b6 4} On May 3, 2007, appellee filed in the court below a motion to cite appellant for contempt of court for lying under oath during the July 19, 2004 proceeding in aid of execution. Appellee supported its motion with certified copies of various deeds reciting some of the real estate holdings of appellant and a photocopy of an answer to an amended complaint filed in a case in federal district court in which appellant claimed an interest in the same real estate. The case proceeded to a hearing before Judge Schmenk on the motion for contempt, at which Andrew Genter, an employee of Huntington National Bank (formerly Sky Bank), testified regarding the authenticity of various documents reflecting bank accounts at Huntington. The court also admitted into evidence the copies of the various deeds attached to appellee\u2019s motion as well as appellant\u2019s answer to the amended complaint referred to in appellee\u2019s motion. The court then heard the arguments of counsel. Appellee asserted that appellant was in contempt of court for lying under oath at the July 19, 2004 debtor\u2019s examination, and expressly referred to the following colloquy from that exam between appellee\u2019s counsel and appellant:</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cQ: Do you have any business interests or relationships?</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cA: I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re going to.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cQ: Do you own any interest in any business?</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cA: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cQ: You are not in partnership with any individual or individuals?</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cA: Not that I know of.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cQ: You do not own any stock in any companies?</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cA: You mean like stock market?</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cQ: I mean like stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-14\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA: No; I don\u2019t \u2014 no.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cQ: You don\u2019t have any interest in any corporations?</p>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA: No; I don\u2019t have any interest in any corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>{\u00b6 17} \u201cQ: Not acting as a share holder, as a officer in any company or business venture?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA: No. I\u2019m not an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ: And you\u2019re not involved in any business ventures currently?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA: No; I don\u2019t have any assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cQ: Do you own any interest in any real or personal property?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA: I don\u2019t know of any.

Fourteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-24\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cQ: Who drafted the deed?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-25\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cA: Fourteen years. Boy, I couldn\u2019t tell you. That\u2019s been ten, fourteen years ago. That\u2019s so long ago I can\u2019t remember. Fourteen years ago. I can\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t \u2014 you, records are only supposed to be kept seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-26\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cQ: What property did you sign off?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-27\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA: Can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>{\u00b6 42} Appellee asserted that the deeds and other bank records established that appellant was a partial owner of a number of tracts of land both before and after the debtor\u2019s exam and that he knew of his ownership interest because he signed promissory notes in 2000 and 2002 secured by mortgages on the properties. Then, in 2007, appellant accessed a line of credit secured by those mortgages. Appellant countered that because the properties were tied up in litigation, appellant was being truthful when he answered that he did not know whether he had an interest in a partnership and did not know whether he owned any real or personal property. That is, appellant asserted that because there was a genuine factual dispute about what ownership interest he did or did not have in the properties, appellee did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was lying at the debtor\u2019s exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">{\u00b6 43} Upon reviewing the evidence, the lower court concluded that appellee had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant lied under oath at the debtor\u2019s exam. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cI\u2019ve read the transcript in its entirety, and he continually denies any interest in that. Denies any assets. Denies that he has anything and says, I have no assets. He uses that phrase. He says, I transferred everything years ago. And it is demonstrably blatantly false. And it\u2019s inconceivable that somebody would mortgage his property over the course of a period, has the deeds recorded in his name, has \u2014 goes to the bank and takes the steps of mortgaging the property and establishing a line of credit, drawing down the line of credit, doesn\u2019t recognize that he has any interest. I treat this as contempt, and I believe the burden is, in fact, on the State Department of Taxation in this matter to establish contempt beyond a reasonable doubt. I\u2019m persuaded upon the evidence before the Court beyond a reasonable doubt that Alan Kunkle lied, blatantly, at his debtor\u2019s exam. The transcript taken as a whole demonstrates a repeated effort to evade. And when he wasn\u2019t able to prevent the questions from being asked, rather than being honest with the answers to the questions, he just lied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">{\u00b6 45} The court therefore found appellant guilty of criminal contempt for lying under oath and sentenced him to 10 days\u2019 incarceration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant now challenges that judgment on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cThe decision whether to find one in contempt of court rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Oakwood v. Brown, </em>8th Dist. Nos. 89135 and 89786, 2008-Ohio-3151, 2008 WL 2532796, \u00b6 8, citing <em>State v. Kilbane </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 201, 15 O.O.3d 221, 400 N.E.2d 386, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>{\u00b6 47} \u201cOffenses against the dignity or process of the court, where the primary purpose of the punishment imposed is to vindicate the authority of the court by punishing the contemnor for his disobediance [sic], are criminal con-tempts. Violations which are primarily offenses against the party for whose benefit the order was made, and where the primary purpose of the punishment is remedial or coercive and for the benefit of the complainant, are civil contempts, and the sanction must afford the contemnor the opportunity to purge himself of his contempt.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Tucker </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 251, 252, 10 OBR 364, 461 N.E.2d 1337. Unlike civil contempt, which may be proven by clear and convincing evidence, criminal contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>ConTex, Inc. v. Consol. Technologies, Inc. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio App.3d 94, 95, 531 N.E.2d 1353; <em>Brown v. Executive 200, Inc. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 250, 253, 18 O.O.3d 446, 416 N.E.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">{\u00b6 48} Additionally, in determining the rights afforded an alleged contemnor, we must determine whether the alleged contempt was direct or indirect. Direct contempt is misbehavior in the actual or constructive presence of the court while it is within its judicial function, which adversely affects or obstructs the orderly administration of justice. <em>Kilbane, </em>61 Ohio St.2d at 204, 15 O.O.3d 221, 400 N.E.2d 386. Indirect contempt is committed outside the presence of the court and may include disobedience of, or resistance to, a lawful order, judgment, or command of a court or an officer. R.C. 2705.02; <em>Dozer v. Dozer </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 296, 302, 623 N.E.2d 1272.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cThe giving of false testimony before a court constitutes a direct contempt and, subject to certain limitations, may be punished summarily. <em>Fawick Airflex Co. v. United Electrical Radio &amp; Machine Workers of America </em>(1950), 87 Ohio App. 371[, 43 O.O. 105, 92 N.E.2d 436]. Making a false statement under oath may constitute contempt even though it may also constitute perjury. <em>Hegelaw v. State </em>(1927), 24 Ohio App. 103, 155 N.E. 620; <em>Fawick Airflex. </em>In order to sustain a conviction for contempt for giving false testimony, it must be shown that the false testimony had an obstructive effect, that the court had judicial knowledge of the falsity of the testimony, and that the questions were pertinent to the issues in the case. <em>Fawick Airflex; Hegelaw, </em>supra. See, also, <em>Adkins v. Adkins </em>(Mar. 22, 1989), Jackson App. No. 571, [1989 WL 25708]; <em>Cleveland v. Young </em>(May 23, 1985), Cuyahoga App. No. 49101, [1985 WL 9032], A well-founded belief of the testimony\u2019s untruthfulness is not sufficient. <em>Fawick Airflex, </em>supra, at 382, 43 O.O. 105, 92 N.E.2d 436.\u201d <em>Daniels v. Adkins </em>(June 3, 1994), 4th Dist. No. 93CA1988, 1994 WL 268263.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">{\u00b6 50} A review of the record and proceedings below reveals that at the debtor\u2019s examination of July 19, 2004, appellant blatantly lied about his interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>real property, that his false testimony obstructed appellee\u2019s attempt to collect on the judgment owed to it, that the falsity of appellant\u2019s testimony became clear to the court at the hearing before Judge Schmenk, and that the questions were pertinent to the issues in the case. We, therefore, find that appellee established beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was in direct criminal contempt of court. Accordingly, the lower court did not abuse its discretion in finding appellant in contempt of court, and the sole assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">{\u00b6 51} On consideration whereof, the court finds that appellant was not prejudiced or prevented from having a fair trial, and the judgment of the Fulton County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Fulton County.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b792-6\">Handwork and Singer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-9\">.
