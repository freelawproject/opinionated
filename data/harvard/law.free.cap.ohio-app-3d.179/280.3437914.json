Stewart, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, FirstEnergy Corporation, and its affiliate, Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, appeal from a summary judgment issued to defendant-appellee city of Cleveland on their claims that the city\u2019s water department negligently caused damage to FirstEnergy\u2019s underground equipment and utility lines while performing repairs on water lines. The court held that the city\u2019s maintenance of water lines was a proprietary function under the sovereign-immunity statutes and that the actions of the city\u2019s workers in the course of making repairs were undertaken in the exercise of judgment or discretion. FirstEnergy contests those findings. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">{\u00b6 2} FirstEnergy\u2019s complaint set forth four separate incidents in which it alleged that the city\u2019s water department, while responding to water leaks, negligently excavated at those sites and damaged FirstEnergy\u2019s underground utilities and equipment. FirstEnergy also alleged that its underground equipment and facilities were fixtures to the land and that the city\u2019s construction work physically invaded FirstEnergy\u2019s real property, constituting a trespass. The first incident occurred on January 25, 2003 in the vicinity of East 18th Street and Euclid Avenue; the second incident occurred on September 2, 2003 in the vicinity of 3531 E. 142nd Street; the third incident occurred on September 16, 2003 in the vicinity of Berea Road and Madison Avenue; and the fourth incident occurred on October 30, 2003 in the vicinity of East 131st Street and Coit Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">{\u00b6 3} The city sought summary judgment on grounds that the damage alleged by FirstEnergy in the first and fourth incidents was not caused by any excavation or negligence by the city and that it did not excavate in the vicinity cited in the third incident. The city also argued that it was immune, as a matter of law, from FirstEnergy\u2019s trespass claims. FirstEnergy opposed the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment by citing evidence showing that the city had prior knowledge of water leaks at the location of the first incident, that the city took too long to shut the water off at the site of the third incident, and that the city failed to install the correct type of fire hydrant at the fourth location.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">{\u00b6 4} FirstEnergy settled with the city on its claims relating to the first and second incidents, leaving only the third and fourth incidents for adjudication.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The court heard oral argument on the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment and held that there were issues of material fact as to the city\u2019s negligence, but that regardless of whether these issues existed:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe City of Cleveland is entitled to summary judgment in that it is immune from liability pursuant to O.R.C. Section 2744.08(A)(5) as the alleged losses are based on behavior resulting from the exercise of judgment or discretion on the part of Defendant City of Cleveland \u2018in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment, supplies, material, personnel, facilities and other resources\u2019 and there is no allegation that such \u2018judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 6} The court went on to hold that to the extent that any of FirstEnergy\u2019s claims were based on a theory of trespass, the city was \u201centitled to summary judgment as to such claims in that they are barred pursuant to O.R.C. Section 2744.02.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 7} The courts address questions of immunity as a matter of law, so they are particularly apt for resolution by way of summary judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 56. We employ the three-tiered analysis set forth in <em>Colbert v. Cleveland, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 215, 2003-Ohio-3319, 790 N.E.2d 781, \u00b6 7-9, to determine whether a political subdivision enjoys immunity under the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, as codified in R.C. Chapter 2744:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe first tier is the general rule that a political subdivision is immune from liability incurred in performing either a governmental function or proprietary function. * * * However, that immunity is not absolute. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe second tier of the analysis requires a court to determine whether any of the five exceptions to immunity listed in R.C. 2744.02(B) apply to expose the political subdivision to liability. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIf any of the exceptions to immunity in R.C. 2744.02(B) do apply and no defense to that section protects the political subdivision from liability, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>third tier of the analysis requires a court to determine whether any of the defenses in R.C. 2744.03 apply, thereby providing the political subdivision a defense against liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 11} The parties agree that under the first and second tiers of this analysis, the city\u2019s operation of a municipal water-supply system is a proprietary function, see R.C. 2744.01(G)(2)(c), and that the city is \u201cliable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by the negligent performance of acts by their employees with respect to proprietary functions of the political subdivisions.\u201d R.C. 2744.02(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 12} The parties dispute the third tier of the analysis: whether any of the defenses in R.C. 2744.03 apply to provide the city with a defense against liability. The trial court found that the city had a defense against liability under R.C. 2744.03(A)(5), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(A) In a civil action brought against a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision to recover damages for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, the following defenses or immunities may be asserted to establish nonliability:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(5) The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury, death, or loss to person or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources unless the judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. DiGioliar-Suburban Excavating, L.L.C., </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 89708 and 89907, 2008-Ohio-1409, 2008 WL 802641, we considered a very similar fact pattern in which several utility companies brought suit against the city, claiming that its water department had acted negligently when stopping a water leak because it failed to shut off water to the correct water main and caused damage to the utilities\u2019 equipment. Noting that none of the complaints filed against the city alleged that the city\u2019s employees engaged in wanton or reckless conduct as required by R.C. 2744.03(A)(5), we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[T]he City maintained that the appellees\u2019 complaints failed to contain allegations sufficient to overcome the application of governmental immunity; specifically, the City asserted that none of the appellees had alleged that the City acted maliciously, in bad faith, recklessly, or wantonly. Although the appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>could have moved to amend their complaints or moved under Civ.R. 15(B) to have the pleadings conform to the evidence, they did not do so. Accordingly, * * * the trial court erred by denying the City the protections of qualified immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">{\u00b6 18} Given the absence of any allegations that set forth the required mental status required by' R.C. 2744.03(A)(5), we held that the city was entitled to governmental immunity as a matter of law. Id. at \u00b6 41-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 19} FirstEnergy\u2019s complaint made no allegation that the city\u2019s employees acted with \u201cmalicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d Moreover, at no point in its opposition to summary judgment did FirstEnergy offer any evidence of reckless or malicious conduct. Its expert could only state that \u201cthe City of Cleveland should have been more timely in shutting down the water leaks,\u201d that it \u201cshould have equipped its trucks with line valve maps and compressors,\u201d and that it \u201cshould have closed off the main beyond the seven valves * * * to shut-off as quickly as possible.\u201d None of these statements goes beyond the ordinary negligence standard of care, and thus fall outside the heightened care standards necessary to impose liability under R.C. 2744.03(A)(5). Consistent with <em>Ohio Bell, </em>we conclude that the city was entitled to sovereign immunity as a matter of law on the negligence claims for incidents three and four.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">{\u00b6 20} FirstEnergy also maintains that the court erred by granting summary judgment on its trespass claim. It maintains that principles of sovereign immunity do not apply to claims of alleged trespass in the political subdivision\u2019s course of engaging in a proprietary function.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">{\u00b6 21} The flaw in FirstEnergy\u2019s argument is that it maintains that the city\u2019s trespass on its equipment arose from the city\u2019s \u201cnegligent act or omission in performing a proprietary function.\u201d At no point, however, did FirstEnergy allege that the city carried out that proprietary function with \u201cmalicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner\u201d as required by R.C. 2744.03(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">{\u00b6 22} In reaching this decision, we distinguish <em>W. 11th St. Partnership v. Cleveland </em>(Feb. 8, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 77327, 2001 WL 112121, in which we held that sovereign immunity did not apply against the city for exfiltrations from its sewer systems. Noting that there had been competent, credible evidence to show that the exfiltrations occurred because of a lack of maintenance of a sewer system, we held that R.C. 2744.03(A)(5) did not apply. Id. at *5. This holding resulted because the city\u2019s decision of whether or not to engage in sewer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>maintenance did not involve the use of equipment, but merely a judgment on when such maintenance should occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">{\u00b6 23} In the present case, the alleged trespass to FirstEnergy\u2019s property occurred while the city\u2019s workers used excavating equipment to find the source of water leaks. This was not a question of whether maintenance should be performed, but a question of how the city used its equipment to make repairs to broken water lines. Unlike in <em>W. 11th St. Partnership, </em>the city\u2019s employees in this case were required to exercise judgment in the use of the equipment employed to stop the water leaks. We conclude that the court did not err by granting summary judgment on the trespass/nuisance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b323-7\">Rocco, P.J., and Blackmon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\">. Both parties agree that they dismissed the second incident, yet they continue to assert that the first incident is still a viable claim even though they filed a stipulation of dismissal with the court as to that claim. That stipulation states: \"We, the attorneys for FirstEnergy Corp., the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, and the City of Cleveland, stipulate under Rule 41 of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure that Incident 1 (alleged damage to underground facilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>in the vicinity of East 18 th and Euclid Avenue) and Incident 2 (alleged damage to above ground facilities in the vicinity of 3531 E. 142nd Street) be dismissed with prejudice. Defendant will bear the court costs. The Court may enter an order accordingly, notice by the Clerk being waived.\u201d The court signed this stipulation and had it filed with the clerk of the court on July 6, 2007. There being no other evidence in the record to contradict the contents of this dismissal, we deem the claims relating to the first and second incidents to be dismissed with prejudice and therefore disregard any argument relating to the first incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
