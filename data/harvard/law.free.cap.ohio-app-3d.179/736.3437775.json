The issue on appeal is whether the township is entitled to immunity. For the following reasons, the township has immunity from Bonace\u2019s claims, and the judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>\n<em>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">{\u00b6 2} On a clear morning in August 2005, Bonace was involved in a single-car accident on Rapp Road in Springfield Township. She was driving a four-door pick-up truck on a neighborhood road. When she encountered a portion of the road that tips to the right, her right front tire \u201cfell off\u2019 the road and into an immediately adjacent ditch. Upon losing steering capacity and hitting a driveway apron, the truck exited the ditch and rolled multiple times across the road and into a cornfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">{\u00b6 3} On December 29, 2005, Bonace filed a complaint against Springfield Township.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She alleged that the township had failed to provide adequate pitch, grade, berm, and width, had negligently maintained the road regarding these aspects, and had failed to warn of these problems. The complaint also stated that the township had failed to keep the road open, in repair, and free from nuisance, and these failures had directly and proximately caused an unsafe condition within the road that had caused Bonace to lose control.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">{\u00b6 4} According to Bonace\u2019s deposition testimony, the road \u201ctipped\u201d to the right at the place she \u201cfell\u201d into the ditch, and this slope pulled or \u201csucked\u201d her over to the edge line. She stated that she drove this route often and that the tipping sensation had seemed worse after the recent road repaving. Her husband measured the slope as dropping 11 inches from the crown in the center to the edge of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">{\u00b6 5} Bonace also testified that asphalt was missing from the white edge line, which appeared \u201cchewed up\u201d when she viewed it after the accident. Additionally, she complained that the ditch was immediately adjacent to the edge of the road and that the ditch was over 28 inches deep at its center. Her husband, an automotive mechanic, determined that the steering linkage had snapped while the vehicle was traveling in the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">{\u00b6 6} Bonace produced an affidavit of a Rapp Road resident who stated that his daughter had been involved in a single-car accident at this same spot in August 2004 and that his sister had been involved in an accident 15 years ago in the vicinity. This resident stated that he had complained to the township about the road and noted that the Springfield Township fire chief was at the scene of his daughter\u2019s accident. His daughter submitted an affidavit confirming that her right front tire had suddenly and unexpectedly dropped into a ditch causing her to lose steering ability and to hit the driveway apron. She further disclosed that the police had investigated the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>{\u00b6 7} In addition, Bonace submitted the report of an expert on accident investigations. He reviewed another accident report from August 2004, which indicated a possible road defect. The expert stated that at the site where Bonace left the road, the asphalt is deteriorated at the outside edge of the white edge line. He measured an edge drop of 12 inches from the pavement to the land. He concluded that a drop over three and one-half inches is a hazard. He opined that although it is not always attainable, there should be two feet of berm on rural roadways.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">{\u00b6 8} This expert also stated that the side slope was nearly five percent, which is in excess of the normal two percent slope for level straight roadways under national and state standards. He opined that the excessive side slope contributed to the hazard of the drop-off. He also noted that the lane was ten feet wide, which is sufficient but less than desirable considering the other defects. He concluded that the condition of the road should have been known to the township due to accident reports and from the Road Superintendent driving along the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">{\u00b6 9} The township\u2019s long-time road superintendent was deposed. He did not agree that there was road deterioration at the edge line, claiming that any broken asphalt dropped off during the repaving project. He denied that the natural berm had changed during the repaving projects in 1997 or 2004, stated that there had never been a constructed berm, and noted that the decision to build a berm was left to his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">{\u00b6 10} The road superintendent denied that he had ever received complaints about the condition of the road. As for prior accidents, he acknowledged hearing of only one that had occurred further south after Bonace\u2019s accident. He noted that the fire chief and his long-time assistant road crew member lived within a quarter mile of the accident scene. He also conceded that the crown was greater at the disputed site than elsewhere on the road, but he did not think it was too severe. He disclosed that if a crown is too high, his department can gradually lessen it in repaving projects, but that the road could be torn up to more quickly fix the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">{\u00b6 11} The Mahoning County chief deputy engineer testified that the county evaluates the condition of a road\u2019s edge line on a case-by-case basis and considers a deteriorated condition more important if there exists a large edge drop-off. She also stated that the slope of a road should drop one-quarter to three-eighths of an inch per foot from the center crown. She explained that the crown can get higher due to years of resurfacing. She agreed that if two similar accidents had occurred at the same spot within a year, she would have investigated the need for repair if the road were in her jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>{\u00b6 12} On June 13, 2006, the township filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it was entitled to immunity. The township urged that it is not liable for areas outside the regularly traveled portion of the road, which includes only the space between the edge lines. The township also claimed that the expert\u2019s belief that the road has an excessive side slope was subjective and unsupported by any standards. Bonace argued that the excessive slope, the lack of a berm, the proximity of the deep ditch to the road, and the asphalt missing from the edge line were all conditions that fell under the statutory exception to immunity for failing to keep a road in repair or free from obstructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">{\u00b6 13} On November 23, 2007, the trial court overruled the township\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The township filed timely notice of appeal, which is permissible under R.C. 2744.02(C). See also <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N:E.2d 878, \u00b6 12 (the political subdivision can file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of summary judgment regarding its immunity defense even if the trial court stated that genuine issues of material fact remain on the issue of immunity and thus did not finally determine the immunity issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">\n<em>GENERAL LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">{\u00b6 14} The evaluation of sovereign immunity entails a three-tiered analysis. We begin with the general premise that a political subdivision is not liable for damages caused by any act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). A governmental function includes the <em>maintenance and repair of roads, </em>highways, and streets. R.C. 2744.01(C)(1), (2)(e). See also R.C. 2744.01(C)(1), (2)(r) (government function includes flood-control measures, such as a ditch).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">{\u00b6 15} The second tier in the analysis involves a determination of whether any of the exceptions to immunity apply. For instance, there is an exception to immunity for negligent performance of a proprietary function. R.C. 2744.02(B)(2). However, as Bonace concedes, her allegations concern solely governmental functions, leaving only the third exception to immunity at issue. This exception provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[Pjolitical subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair and other negligent failure to remove obstructions from public roads * * R.C. 2744.02(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">{\u00b6 17} Finally, only if we find that an exception to immunity applies must we continue to the third tier of the analysis. This analysis involves the evaluation of whether sovereign immunity can be reinstated by statutorily listed specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>defenses or specific immunities, such as the discretionary defenses set forth in R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\n<em>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">{\u00b6 18} The township\u2019s sole assignment of error provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, as there were no genuine issues of material fact pertinent to the immunity defenses asserted by the appellants, Springfield Township, Ohio and Springfield Township Trustees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">{\u00b6 20} Prior to reaching the crux of the case, the township sets forth some peripheral arguments. For instance, the township seems to seek application of a former version of R.C 723.01. However, this statute refers only to municipal corporations, not townships. Regarding the applicable statute, the township argues that Bonace and the trial court improperly relied upon the wrong version of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). Although Bonace\u2019s complaint used the old statutory phrase, \u201copen, in repair and free from nuisance,\u201d it contained other contentions outlining her claim as well. In any event, \u201cin repair\u201d is still part of the statutory exception to immunity. Moreover, Bonace\u2019s response to summary judgment applied the proper statute. Finally, as the trial court gave no indication of applying the prior statute, we presume the court applied the proper version. In any event, we review a decision on summary judgment de novo and will be applying only the applicable version of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">{\u00b6 21} More substantively, the township argues that the conditions set forth by Bonace do not fall under the exception to immunity in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) regarding the \u201cnegligent failure to keep public roads in repair and other negligent failure to remove obstructions from public roads.\u201d It is important to recognize here that this language became effective on April 9, 2003, and that the prior version of this immunity exception provided governments liable for injury \u201ccaused by their failure to keep public roads * * * open, in repair, and free from nuisance.\u201d Former R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). Sub.S.B. No. 108,149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 382, 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">{\u00b6 22} Under the former version, the Supreme Court set forth a two-part test for analyzing the second tier, specifically for determining the existence of nuisance: (1) the condition alleged to constitute a nuisance creates a danger for ordinary traffic on the regularly traveled portion of the road and (2) the cause of the condition is something other than a decision regarding design or construction. <em>Haynes v. Franklin, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 344, 2002-Ohio-2334, 767 N.E.2d 1146, \u00b6 18. The court thus expressed that there could be liability for a drop between the road and the berm if this condition was the result of a failure to repair, but held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>there is no liability for such condition when it is the result of a design or construction decision made during the road\u2019s repaving. Id. at \u00b6 18-20 (the court did not reach the third-tier discretionary defense to the second-tier immunity exception). See also <em>Franks v. Lopez </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 345, 346-349, 632 N.E.2d 502 (distinguishing between initial decisions to forgo the creation of a road safety feature and subsequent decisions to forgo maintenance or repair of a safeguard already erected, and stating that design is not a nuisance and is also a discretionary defense). Thus, the failure to construct a guardrail or a sign at a dangerous curve that dropped into a river did not constitute an exception to immunity, but the failure to maintain a sign\u2019s reflectivity was previously actionable. <em>Franks, </em>69 Ohio St.3d. at 350, 632 N.E.2d 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">{\u00b6 23} As aforementioned, after these cases, the legislature acted to narrow the exception to immunity, thus providing more protection to political subdivisions. The legislature added that the political subdivision\u2019s failure had to be negligent; the new statute maintained \u201cin repair\u201d but changed \u201cnuisance\u201d to \u201cfailure to remove obstructions.\u201d See R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). Besides changing the language of the roads exception itself, the legislature added a definition of public roads to be used when applying that exception. This new definition specifies that a public road does not include berms, shoulders, rights-of-way, or any nonmandated traffic-control devices. See R.C. 2744.01(H) (effective April 9, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">{\u00b6 24} In analyzing the obstruction portion of the new statute, the Supreme Court recently explained that \u201cnuisance\u201d was substituted with \u201cobstruction\u201d in order to further limit government liability. <em>Howard v. Miami Twp. Fire Div., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 1, 2008-Ohio-2792, 891 N.E.2d 311, \u00b6 29. Thus, an obstruction was defined as an obstacle that blocks or clogs the roadway, as opposed to a mere condition that hinders or impedes the use of the roadway or that may have the potential to do so. Id. at \u00b6 30. Thus, an icy coating on a curved road that resulted from a fire department\u2019s controlled burn did not constitute an obstruction. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">{\u00b6 25} In applying the new statute, we begin with the allegedly excessive side slope. Initially, we dispose of the township\u2019s argument that the expert\u2019s opinion on the slope is without support. This argument is without merit for various reasons. The expert stated that the road\u2019s side slope was excessive because a cross slope on a relatively straight and flat road should be between 1.5 and 2 percent, but this road\u2019s slope fluctuated between 3.5 and 5 percent. The expert initially stated that his figures were pursuant to national and state standards and later specified in a revised affidavit the particular standards utilized. Additionally, the Mahoning County Deputy Chief Engineer stated that a slope should run about one-quarter of an inch per foot, and testimony provided that the drop from the crown to the edge of the road was 11 inches on a ten-foot wide lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>{\u00b6 26} This evidence would sufficiently establish an excessive side slope for purposes of avoiding summary judgment <em>only if the excessive side slope here were not a feature of the design or construction of the road as opposed to an obstruction or failure to repair. </em>Although the expert stated that the deterioration of the asphalt at the edge was the result of deterioration, no one alleged that the side slope was the result of that factor. Rather, Bonace claimed that the side slope existed as a construction feature in the past and worsened each time the township repaved the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">{\u00b6 27} Notably, the Supreme Court\u2019s prior second-tier analysis concerning the nuisance element required the dangerous condition to be related to a failure to maintain rather than a feature of the road\u2019s design or construction. <em>Haynes, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 344, 2002-Ohio-2334, 767 N.E.2d 1146, at \u00b6 18 (which also involved redesign, reconstruction, and repaving). Although nuisance no longer provides an exception to immunity, after the statutory amendment, the immunity exception only got harder for the plaintiff to establish. See <em>Howard, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 1, 2008-Ohio-2792, 891 N.E.2d 311, at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">{\u00b6 28} The \u201cin repair\u201d portion of the immunity exception in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) existed at the time of <em>Haynes, </em>and it still exists under the amended statute. Previously, both \u201cnuisance\u201d and \u201cin repair\u201d were part of the second tier. Just as the nuisance element did not include a claimed design or construction flaw, nor does the \u201cin repair\u201d element. Otherwise, <em>Haynes </em>would have discussed this element as well as nuisance. See <em>Haynes, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 344, 2002-Ohio-2334, 767 N.E.2d 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">{\u00b6 29} Even without resorting to what <em>Haynes </em>did not say, \u201cin repair\u201d in its ordinary sense refers to maintaining a road\u2019s condition after construction or reconstruction, for instance by fixing holes and crumbling pavement. It deals with repairs after deterioration of a road or disassembly of a bridge, for instance. <em>Heckert v. Patrick </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 402, 406, 15 OBR 516, 473 N.E.2d 1204 (interpreting \u201cin proper repair\u201d in county-immunity statute). Consequently, \u201cin repair\u201d does not create a duty to change allegedly absurd designs such as extreme and unnecessary side slopes that were constructed (and recently reconstructed) into a road.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Howard </em>decision, the side slope would not fit within the alternative exception to immunity. That is, the side slope does not fall under the definition of an obstruction, as it does not block or clog the roadway. <em>Howard, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 1, 2008-Ohio-2792, 891 N.E.2d 311 at \u00b6 30 (hindering or impeding use of road is insufficient). We thus conclude that the existence of the slope was not a failure to repair or a failure to remove an obstruction. Under the facts and circumstances presented in the summary judgment materials, the slope of the road is a design and construction feature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>that was incorporated into the road\u2019s original construction and that remained a design and construction feature during subsequent repaving projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">{\u00b6 31} We now turn to Bonace\u2019s complaints regarding the failure to make a berm and the failure to move the ditch. First, these conditions do not deal with the failure to make a repair, but rather constitute failures to construct or problems with design. Under the analysis set forth above, they would thus not fall under the exception to immunity regarding road care. Even under the prior, broader statute and <em>Haynes, </em>the exception to immunity would have been inapplicable due to the mere allegation of a failure to initially construct. In other words, there would be a nuisance under <em>Haynes </em>only if a previously constructed berm had not been kept in good repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">{\u00b6 32} Second and regardless, the conditions concern items that are no longer part of the public road. Clearly, under the new definition of public road, ditches and berms are not encompassed in the immunity exception in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). Finally, these conditions do not constitute obstructions, and they do not block or clog the roadway. See <em>Howard, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 1, 2008-Ohio-2792, 891 N.E.2d 311, at \u00b6 30. Therefore, Bonace has not established an exception to the township\u2019s general immunity under the second tier of the analysis regarding the failure to provide a berm and the proximity of the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">{\u00b6 33} This leads to Bonace\u2019s claim of crumbling of asphalt outside and into the white edge line. In order to determine the township\u2019s liability for this area, we must determine where the public road ends and where the berm, shoulder, or right of way begins on the road in question. The Supreme Court previously encompassed everything within the right-of-way as potentially destroying immunity. However, nuisance as an exception to immunity has been eliminated, and the public-roads definition specifically applicable to the immunity statutes has explicitly excluded berms, shoulders, and rights of way from the definition of public road. Thus, as used in Chapter 2744:</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c \u2018Public roads\u2019 means public roads, highways, streets, avenues, alleys, and bridges within a political subdivision. \u2018Public roads\u2019 does not include berms, shoulders, rights-of-way, or traffic control devices unless the traffic control devices are mandated by the Ohio manual of uniform traffic control devices.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">{\u00b6 35} We note that there is no longer an immunity exception for problems with traffic-control devices unless those devices are mandated. So, for instance, one could not complain about a faded or absent edge line unless it was mandatory. See R.C. 4511.01(QQ) (traffic-control device defined as including markings placed for the purpose of warning or guiding traffic). Here, there is no claim that the white edge line was mandated on this road. Thus, Bonace cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>complain, for instance, that a missing line misled her. Still, because we are speaking of paint, which can also exist as a warning within the lanes of travel, and because she is also complaining about a road condition that happens to exist within the paint, we continue to analyze whether the edge line carries the status of berm or shoulder. In doing so, we must also consider the status of the pavement to the right of the outside edge of the white edge line.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">{\u00b6 36} Unlike Bonace, we do not interpret <em>Seek v. Rogers, </em>as holding that the berm or shoulder is only the nonpaved area next to the pavement or that the pavement to the right of the edge line is not berm or shoulder. See <em>Seek v. Rogers </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 462, 6 OBR 515, 453 N.E.2d 705. Before reviewing the case, we initially emphasize that it did not deal with application of the immunity statutes; rather, it dealt with whether a bus stayed within its proper path of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">{\u00b6 37} As for the procedural background, we acknowledge that after properly defining the relevant statutory terms such as roadway as not including the berm or shoulder, the trial court in <em>Seek </em>then seemed to state that the bus had the right of way if it was operating on the hard surface of the highway. Upon objection, the court clarified that hard means paved, rather than gravel, grass, or the berm.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">{\u00b6 38} The Supreme Court noted that the trial court had originally defined the relevant terms in accordance with statute. Id. at 465, 6 OBR 515, 453 N.E.2d 705. The court continued to state that in its clarification, the trial court could have repeated the definition of laned highway. Id. The court concluded that the failure to do so was an omission but was not sufficiently confusing or ambiguous to mislead the jury and warrant reversal, noting that the additional instruction must be considered in conjunction with the original instruction, which contained proper definitions of roadway and laned highway. Id. We also note that the court had introduced the case by pointing out that reversible error does not consist of misstatements or ambiguity in a part of the instruction. Id. at 464, 6 OBR 515, 453 N.E.2d 705. The dissent merely disagreed with the majority\u2019s decision to find the misstatements nonprejudicial. Id. at 467-468, 6 OBR 515, 453 N.E.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">{\u00b6 39} From all of this, we conclude that <em>Seek </em>in fact held that the trial court\u2019s instruction contained a misstatement or ambiguity regarding the paved portion of the road, but decided that it was not prejudicial due to the original statutorily correct definitions. See <em>Siders v. Reynoldsburg School Dist. </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 173, 650 N.E.2d 150 (berm or shoulder includes paved portion to the right of white line). Cf. <em>Cupp v. Kudla, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 728, 2004-Ohio-5528, 822 N.E.2d 392, \u00b6 25 (a case not involving immunity that criticized <em>Siders </em>but found it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>unnecessary to decide whether jury instructions on the \u201croadway\u201d were legally correct).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">{\u00b6 40} We note that at the same time as <em>Seek, </em>the Supreme Court reversed a dismissal that had granted immunity to the government. In that case, a motorcyclist had been injured by an 18-foot-long pothole to the right of the travel lanes on Interstate 77 in Canton. <em>Dickerhoof v. Canton </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 128, 6 OBR 186, 451 N.E.2d 1193. The court specifically called this area the shoulder, regardless of whether it was paved or not. Id. at 130, 6 OBR 186, 451 N.E.2d 1193, fn. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">{\u00b6 41} Unfortunately, shoulder and berm are not defined in the statutes. However, the common definition of shoulder is the area adjacent to or along the edge of a more important part, or more specifically, the part of the roadway outside of the traveled way. See Merriam-Webster\u2019s Online Dictionary. In this same dictionary, berm is then defined as the shoulder of a road. The space between the lines is the traveled way. See R.C. 4511.01(GG) and 4511.33(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">{\u00b6 42} In addition, the manual regarding Uniform Traffic Control Devices contains definitions implying that the paved portion to the right of the edge line is considered berm or shoulder. For instance, the manual\u2019s definitions state that one of the places a rumble strip can exist is on the shoulder; however, if \u201cshoulder\u201d does not include the paved portion, this definition would make no sense, as a rumble strip is not placed in a grass or gravel shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">{\u00b6 43} Contrary to the suggestions of Bonace, we do not believe that the asphalt to the right of the white edge line is still part of the public road. Rather, that pavement is considered berm or shoulder. Under the new limited definition of \u201cpublic road,\u201d which excludes berm or shoulder, any asphalt missing from the space to the right of the edge line is covered by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">{\u00b6 44} We also hold that the edge line itself also falls under the berm or shoulder category. Notably, <em>Seek </em>also found a lack of prejudice from the erroneous jury instruction because there was no evidence that the bus had operated \u201con or over the white line.\u201d <em>Sech, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 465, 6 OBR 515, 453 N.E.2d 705 (noting that the competing testimony required a belief either that the driver had properly operated the bus within her lane of travel or that she had totally left the pavement). We add here the fact that motorists are expected to stay within the marked lanes to the extent practicable. See R.C. 4511.33(A). To dispute any contention that the motorist is permitted to leave the lane if it is practicable, we point out that even when it would not be practicable to stay within the lane and thus when a motorist would be permitted (without receiving a marked-lanes citation) to leave the lane and enter a surrounding area such as a gravel berm, liability would not then extend to flaws in said gravel. The same analysis applies to the edge line itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>{\u00b6 45} In conclusion, if there were no edge line on the road, then the public road could be considered to reach to the edge of the pavement. If said road is missing asphalt, it could be considered a failure to keep the public road in repair. However, by painting an edge line within which the public is to travel, the political subdivision can now limit its liability and provide itself guides within which its road repairs and obstruction removals must occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">{\u00b6 46} We recognize that the failure to keep a road in repair involves no discretion, policy-making, or engineering judgment. <em>Franks v. Lopez </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 345, 349, 632 N.E.2d 502 (mentioning potholes). See also <em>Huffman v. Bd. of Cty. Commrs., </em>7th Dist No. 05CO71, 2006-Ohio-3479, 2006 WL 1851715, \u00b6 59 (regarding decision whether to barricade bridge washed away by flood). However, because Bonace failed to overcome the second tier in the immunity analysis regarding a failure to keep the public road in repair or free from obstruction, the third tier regarding discretionary defenses does not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">{\u00b6 47} For all of the foregoing reasons, the township is immune from the claims of Bonace, which do not fall within the immunity exception provided in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), as they do not involve the negligent failure to keep a public road in repair or free from obstruction. The judgment of the trial court is hereby reversed, and summary judgment is granted in favor of the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b785-7\">Donofrio and Waite, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\">. Claims were also filed against various paving contractors and Mahoning County. The county was dismissed, as it was not responsible for this portion of Rapp Road, and the other claims were disposed of by settlement and/or dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
