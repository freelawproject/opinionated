Troisi, appeals from the judgment on conviction entered by the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, after trial by jury, on one count of trademark counterfeiting, a felony of the third degree, and one count of possession of criminal tools, a felony of the fifth degree. For the reasons set forth below, this court reverses and vacates appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">{\u00b6 2} On February 3, 2007, appellant hosted a \u201cpurse party\u201d at a budding known as the Kirtland Grange in Kirtland, Ohio. At this event, appellant offered for sale various items, such as purses, wallets, and jewelry. After receiving her invitation, Dina Halatek, one of the invitees, contacted the Kirtland Police Department about the event because she had been recently informed that the sale of items at such parties was \u201cvery criminal.\u201d Sergeant Jamie Tavano of the Kirtland Police Department initiated an investigation of the matter. During his investigation, Tavano contacted Tim Richissin, a sergeant with the Cleveland Police Department. Tavano sought Richissin\u2019s assistance because of his background as a well-known investigator of intellectual-property crimes. In addition to being a police officer, Richissin was employed as a regional director of the Professional Investigating Consulting Agency (\u201cPICA\u201d). According to Richissin, PICA is a private company specializing in the investigation of intellectual-property crimes such as trademark counterfeiting. With the assistance of Richissin, the investigation culminated in a raid of the premises on the day of the event. After the raid, appellant was arrested, and police seized over 1,700 purportedly counterfeit items, along with appellant\u2019s vehicle and a sum of cash from sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant was subsequently indicted on one count of criminal simulation, in violation of R.C. 2913.32(A)(4), a felony of the third degree; two counts of trademark counterfeiting, in violation of R.C. 2913.34(A)(4) and (5), felonies of the third degree; and one count of possessing criminal tools, in violation of R.C. 2923.24, a felony of the fifth degree. Three forfeiture specifications were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>attached to each count relating to the property seized, namely, the vehicle used to transport the property, the money seized from sales, and the purportedly counterfeit property itself. Prior to the commencement of trial, the trial court dismissed the criminal-simulation count and one count of trademark counterfeiting. At the close of the state\u2019s case, appellant moved for acquittal, which the trial court overruled. The jury subsequently returned verdicts of guilty on the remaining charges of trademark counterfeiting and possessing criminal tools. Appellant was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment for the trademark-counterfeiting conviction and one year for the possessing-criminal-tools conviction. The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently, for a total of three years\u2019 imprisonment. Appellant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 4} Because they are significantly related, we shall address appellant\u2019s first, second, and fourth assignments of error together. Under these assigned errors, appellant posits the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[1.] The trial court erred by permitting Richissin to testify concerning his \u2018expert\u2019 opinion that the items were \u2018counterfeit,\u2019 \u2018fake,\u2019 \u2018not original,\u2019 and/or \u2018not authentic.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[2.] The trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s [Criminal] Rule 29 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[4.] The verdict is not sustained by sufficient evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">{\u00b6 8} We first point out that appellant\u2019s second and fourth assignments of error assert the same legal theory. Defense counsel\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion acted to challenge the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence. Thus, these two separate assignments of error contest the very same issue; namely, whether the state presented adequate evidence at trial to meet its burden of proof on each element of the crimes charged. It is from this point that we shall begin our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">{\u00b6 9} An appellate court reviewing whether the evidence was sufficient to support a criminal conviction examines the evidence admitted at trial and determines whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the mind of the average juror of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492. A reviewing court may not reweigh or reinterpret the evidence; rather, the proper inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence most favorably to the prosecution, the jury could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2913.34, the statute governing the crime of \u201ctrademark counterfeiting\u201d provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(A) No person shall knowingly do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201c(4) Sell, offer for sale, or otherwise dispose of goods with the knowledge that a counterfeit mark is attached to, affixed to, or otherwise used in connection with the goods;</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(F) As used in this section:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(1)(a) * * * \u2018counterfeit mark\u2019 means a spurious trademark or a spurious service mark that satisfies both of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(i) It is identical with or substantially indistinguishable from a mark that is registered on the principal register in the United States patent and trademark office for the same goods or services as the goods or services to which or in connection with which the spurious trademark or spurious service mark is attached, affixed, or otherwise used * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(ii) Its use is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive other persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">{\u00b6 19} With the statutory definition in mind, the state was required to prove that appellant:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">{\u00b6 20} (1) Knowingly;</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">{\u00b6 21} (2) sold, offered for sale, or otherwise disposed of goods in her possession;</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">{\u00b6 22} (3) knowing that a spurious trademark was affixed to or otherwise used in connection with the goods; and that</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">{\u00b6 23} (4) the spurious trademark:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">{\u00b6 24} (a) is identical with or substantially indistinguishable from a mark that is registered on the principal register in the United States patent and trademark office for the particular purse, jewelry or item,</p>\n<p id=\"b368-16\">{\u00b6 25} <em>and</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-17\">{\u00b6 26} (b) is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-18\">{\u00b6 27} Although appellant does not concede that the state met its burden on elements (1) through (3), she does not take specific issue with the state\u2019s proof on these elements. Rather, appellant\u2019s challenge is directed at the manner in which the state attempted to prove element (4)(a). Appellant alleges that the testimony of Richissin, the state\u2019s intellectual-property counterfeiting expert, by itself, was inadequate to prove that the subject goods bore a \u201cspurious\u201d or \u201ccounterfeit\u201d mark as defined by statute. We agree with appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-19\">{\u00b6 28} At trial, Richissin testified as an intellectual-property-crime expert for the state. He testified that he is a sergeant with the Cleveland Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Department who principally investigates crimes involving intellectual property. Richissin testified that he first became involved in investigating intellectual-property crimes in 2002 and has attended \u201cmaybe thirty training sessions\u201d since that time. Richissin is a regional director for PICA, a private investigation firm retained by international fashion designers for the purpose of investigating trademark counterfeiting. Richissin testified that PICA investigates allegations of trademark counterfeiting (as well as other illicit activities related to intellectual property) and, once it completes an investigation, it submits its findings to law enforcement for purposes of prosecution. According to Richissin, PICA clients include Gucci, Prada, Coach, Dior, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Dooney and Bourke, Tiffany, Kate Spade, Liz Claiborne, Chanel, and Versace. Each of these companies provides PICA investigators with training regarding how to identify inauthentic items or \u201cknock-offs\u201d bearing their trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">{\u00b6 29} Over defense objection, Richissin defined \u201ctrademark counterfeiting\u201d as \u201c[cjopying the registered trademark of a property owner.\u201d He further testified, again over objection, that he is \u201cone of the more knowledgeable people in Northeast Ohio about trademark counterfeiting.\u201d According to Richissin, he is able to distinguish counterfeit goods from authentic goods due to his training and experience in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">{\u00b6 30} During direct examination, Richissin was provided with certain examples of goods seized from appellant and asked to identify whether the items were, in his estimation, counterfeit. He was also asked to explain how he arrived at his conclusions. After inspecting what was purported to be a Coach bag, a Prada purse, a Louis Vuitton purse, a Chanel purse, a Gucci purse, a Burberry purse, a Fendi purse, a Kate Spade purse, and a piece of Tiffany jewelry, Richissin concluded, over strenuous objections by defense counsel, that they all were knock-offs and therefore counterfeit. At the conclusion of direct examination, Richissin testified, again over objection, that the trademarks on the merchandise he inspected were \u201cidentical or substantially indistinguishable from the genuine trademark[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 31} During the defense\u2019s case-in-chief, defense counsel called Richissin as a witness. During defense counsel\u2019s direct examination of Richissin, the witness testified that he had never obtained a record from the United States patent and trademark office. He further testified that he had never personally viewed the trademarks from the principal register of any items that he testified were counterfeit. After the conclusion of Richissin\u2019s testimony, defense counsel rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 32} The state submitted neither certified copies of the authentic trademarks of the companies whose marks were at issue nor any other evidence of the actual trademarks registered in the principal register of the United States patent and trademark office. In essence, aside from Richissin\u2019s assurances that the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>were counterfeit (as defined by Richissin himself) the record is devoid of <em>any evidence </em>from which the jury could conclude that the items seized bore a trademark \u201cidentical with or substantially indistinguishable from a mark that is registered on the principal register in the United States patent and trademark office,\u201d as required by R.C. 2913.34(F)(1)(a)(i). R.C. 2913.34 specifically requires the state to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a \u201ccounterfeit mark\u201d was attached or affixed to the goods in question. The phrase \u201ccounterfeit mark\u201d is precisely defined in the statute and requires proof that the mark be \u201cidentical with or substantially indistinguishable from\u201d the marks registered with the United States patent and trademark office. Without evidence that the goods bore a counterfeit mark as defined in the law, there can be no violation of the trademark-counterfeiting statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 33} Although Richissin testified that the items he inspected, each of which was affixed with a recognizable trademark emblem of some kind, were inauthentic based upon multiple factors, it is merely from these observations that he was able to conclude that the items represented instances of \u201ctrademark counterfeiting.\u201d Given the statute, the supportive testimony for his conclusions is basically ins\u00fafficient to meet the statutory definition of the crime of trademark counterfeiting set forth under R.C. 2913.34.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 34} In particular, Richissin\u2019s definition of \u201ctrademark counterfeiting\u201d (i.e., \u201ccopying the registered trademark of a property owner\u201d) is overly broad and does not embrace the precise legal definition of \u201ctrademark counterfeiting.\u201d Moreover, it appears that the state, perhaps inadvertently, blurred the foregoing distinction by repeatedly asking Richissin, in light of <em>his </em>conception of trademark counterfeiting, whether a given item was \u201cauthentic or counterfeit.\u201d Such questions illustrate that the state was attempting to meet its burden by using an informal or colloquial understanding of \u201ctrademark counterfeiting,\u201d as opposed to the specific statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">{\u00b6 35} We recognize that Evid.R. 704 permits an expert to provide testimony by way of opinion or inference that embraces the ultimate issue for the jury. However, simply because Richissin could so testify does not imply that his testimony, by itself, was adequate to meet the state\u2019s burden. To the contrary, Richissin\u2019s testimony was premised upon an essentially subjective or, at best, a nonlegal definition of the phrase \u201ctrademark counterfeiting.\u201d We acknowledge that Richissin did, on direct examination, draw the blank conclusion that the items he inspected were \u201ceither identical or substantially indistinguishable from the genuine trademark.\u201d However, Richissin later testified that he had never seen the genuine trademarks as they appear on the principal register in the United States patent and trademark office. Because he had never viewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>genuine trademarks and the state failed to submit some evidence of those trademarks, Richissin\u2019s initial conclusion completely lacks evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">{\u00b6 36} Because there was no evidence presented that would allow the jury to conclude that the goods bore a counterfeit mark that was identical with or substantially indistinguishable from a registered trademark, the jury was allowed to render a verdict based only upon Richissin\u2019s nonlegal conception of this ultimate issue. Irrespective of the propriety of the jury instructions, the jury heard no evidence regarding the first prong of the definition of a \u201ccounterfeit mark.\u201d Hence, under these circumstances, Richissin\u2019s testimony was both misleading and legally insufficient to prove the ultimate issue that his testimony embraced.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">{\u00b6 37} Our review of the body of Ohio law in this area reveals that no court has addressed the basic elements of the crime of \u201ctrademark counterfeiting.\u201d Accordingly, our construction and analysis of this issue is a matter of first impression. In our view, the statutory elements of the crime of \u201ctrademark counterfeiting\u201d are unambiguously set forth under R.C. 2913.34. The statute <em>requires </em>the state to prove that the trademark affixed to the purported knock-off merchandise is identical with or substantially indistinguishable from that which is properly registered with the United States trademark and patent office. This is a specific, express element of the crime for which appellant was prosecuted. However, as outlined above, the state failed to offer any substantive evidence to prove this element of the crime. We therefore hold that this \u201cgap\u201d in the evidentiary chain necessitates a reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction for trademark counterfeiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">{\u00b6 38} While the foregoing analysis is dispositive of the instant case, we shall still address appellant\u2019s first assignment of error because it contemplates an issue that is capable of repetition yet evading review. Under her first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in allowing Richissin\u2019s testimony because it invaded the province of the jury, effectively denying her due process of law. Appellant contends that Richissin usurped the function of the jury when, without any evidence that the goods at issue possessed maiks that are \u201cidentical with or substantially indistinguishable from\u201d the mark on the principal registry of the United States patent and trademark office, he testified as an expert that the goods at issue were \u201ccounterfeit,\u201d \u201cfake,\u201d \u201cnot original,\u201d and/or \u201cnot authentic.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">{\u00b6 39} As discussed above, Richissin was allowed to testify that \u201ctrademark counterfeiting\u201d means \u201c[cjopying the registered trademark of a property owner.\u201d Although this definition may be sufficient in Richissin\u2019s business of intellectual-property-crime investigation, the statutory definition differs significantly from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>this open-ended conception. However, in light of this definition, Richissin was permitted to testify, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, that the items at issue were counterfeit, without any substantive evidence that the marks on the items were counterfeit pursuant to R.C. 2913.34(F)(1)(a)(1). Because the state introduced no evidence of the marks as they appear on the principal registry, the jury was unable to measure Richissin\u2019s testimony against the proper statutory definition set forth under R.C. 2913.34(F)(1)(a)(i). By allowing him to draw his conclusion without introducing evidence of the marks as they exist on the principal registry, the issue of whether the marks were counterfeit was taken from the jury. Therefore, Richissin\u2019s testimony, which carried with it an air of authority beyond that of general lay testimony, acted to usurp the jury\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 40} In light of this analysis, an ancillary, yet crucial point deserves clarification. Although the manner in which the state chose to prove its case is legally problematic, Riehissin\u2019s testimony was not necessarily improper. Rather, it is this court\u2019s position that given the course of <em>these </em>proceedings, Richissin\u2019s testimony was improper because it was introduced without a proper foundation and/or qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">{\u00b6 41} To explain, it is patent that Richissin\u2019s definition of \u201ctrademark counterfeiting\u201d differed significantly from the statutory elements requiring proof of \u201ctrademark counterfeiting\u201d under Ohio law. As these definitions differed, the testimony could have been properly introduced had the state laid a foundation to establish this distinction. Introducing this distinction to the jury might have benefitted the state because, in doing so, it might have triggered the introduction of evidence relating to the actual trademarks of the goods at issue as they appear in the principal registry of the United States patent and trademark office. In so doing, the jury would have had the opportunity to weigh Richissin\u2019s conclusions against the actual trademark emblems and determine, for itself, whether the marks were counterfeit pursuant to the statute. However, without laying this foundation, the jury was not only confused as to the proper standard, it was misled into believing that Richissin\u2019s testimony sufficed to establish that the marks at issue were counterfeit. This ultimate conclusion was a factual issue to be determined by the jury based upon evidence before it. As emphasized throughout our analysis, such defects in the state\u2019s strategy and proof are fatal and, as a result, the matter must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">{\u00b6 42} Finally, although appellant does not expressly challenge her conviction for possession of criminal tools in her brief, upholding the verdict due to such an omission would be plain error. Pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), \u201c[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d A defendant\u2019s substantial rights are affected when the error at issue has an impact on the outcome of the trial. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>v. Stanley, </em>11th Dist. No. 2007-P-0104, 2008-Ohio-3258, 2008 WL 2582641, at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">{\u00b6 43} Here, appellant\u2019s indictment alleged that she possessed criminal tools, namely, \u201ctotes/vehicles, with the purpose to use [them] criminally.\u201d The indictment further specified: \u201cThe circumstances indicate that the substance, device, instrument or article involved was intended for use in the commission of a felony, to-wit: * * * Trademark Counterfeiting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">{\u00b6 44} The specification charging appellant with possessing criminal tools \u201cintended for use in the commission of a felony\u201d raised the offense from a first-degree misdemeanor to a felony of the fifth degree. See R.C. 2923.24(C). Because appellant was charged with a felony specification for possession of criminal tools, the specification became an additional element of the offense that the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Davis, </em>6th Dist. No. WD-07-031, 2008-Ohio-3574, 2008 WL 2779293, at \u00b6 15; see also <em>State v. Brown </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 716, 723, 621 N.E.2d 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 45} A review of the evidence demonstrates that the state failed to prove that appellant possessed the \u201ctools\u201d at issue with the purpose of committing the felony of trademark counterfeiting. \u201cPurposely\u201d is defined in R.C. 2901.22(A) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cA person acts purposely when it is [her] specific intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">{\u00b6 47} The,Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that \u201c \u2018purpose\u2019 is the highest of the culpable mental states, placing on the prosecution the heaviest possible burden in estabhshing <em>mens rea. </em>By including this scienter requirement [in the statute governing the crime of possessing criminal tools], the General Assembly has required both control of the article and the specific intention to use the article to commit a crime.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. McDonald </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 47, 49, 31 OBR 155, 509 N.E.2d 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">{\u00b6 48} Because there was insufficient evidence of the crime of \u201ctrademark counterfeiting,\u201d there is likewise insufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction on the charge of possessing criminal tools. Because the state failed to submit evidence that the marks were counterfeit as defined by statute, it necessarily follows that it could not prove appellant knowingly sold goods affixed with counterfeit marks, i.e., it could not prove she engaged in \u201ctrademark counterfeiting.\u201d Without evidence that appellant committed or was aware she was committing the principal crime, one cannot reasonably infer that appellant acted with the specific intent to commit the principal crime. Put differently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>without evidence that the marks at issue were \u201cidentical to or substantially indistinguishable\u201d from the actual trademarks, it is not possible to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant acted with criminal purpose, i.e., the specific intent to commit the felony of trademark counterfeiting, in using the \u201ctools\u201d at issue. One cannot infer a criminal purpose without sufficient evidence that the defendant had the specific intent to commit an actual crime prohibited by the Ohio Revised Code. Although appellant used the \u201ctools\u201d to transport the suspect goods, there is insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that she did so with the specific intent to engage in trademark counterfeiting in violation of R.C. 2913.34. Appellant\u2019s conviction for possessing criminal tools was plain error and is accordingly reversed and vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 49} Appellant\u2019s first, second, and fourth assignments of error have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 50} Appellant\u2019s third and fifth assignments of error provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c[3.] The verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c[5.] The statute is void for vagueness and the trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial on this basis.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">{\u00b6 53} Because our analysis above is dispositive of the matter, appellant\u2019s third and fifth assigned errors are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">{\u00b6 54} For the reasons discussed herein, appellant\u2019s convictions for trademark counterfeiting and possession of criminal tools are reversed, and the judgment of conviction entered by the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is hereby vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b374-12\">O\u2019Toole, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b374-13\">Cannon, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-17\">. Moreover, it is well settled that a court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a legislative enactment unless or until it becomes necessary to do so in order to dispose of the case before it. See, e.g., <em>Am. Cancer Soc. v. Dayton </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 114, 121, 51 O.O. 32, 114 N.E.2d 219. Because our substantive analysis of appellant\u2019s first, second, and fourth assigned errors disposed of the case, addressing the constitutionality of the statute is clearly unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b374-14\">Timothy P. <em>Cannon, </em>Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AT\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">{\u00b6 55} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">{\u00b6 56} First, I believe that as an expert witness for the state, Sergeant Richissin was permitted to testify as to the identity of the companies\u2019 trademarks. He testified that he had been trained by representatives from Gucci, Prada, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Coach, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Dooney and Bourke, Tiffany, Burberry, Liz Claiborne, Kate Spade, Chanel, and Versace. Also, he testified that he was familiar with the trademarks of each of these companies and that those trademarks are registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 57} Further, I believe that the state submitted sufficient evidence to sustain Troisi\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 58} Courts have held \u201cthat \u2018the purpose of trademark law is not to guarantee genuine trademarks but to guarantee that every item sold under a trademark is the genuine trademarked product, not a substitute.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Petrosian </em>(C.A.9, 1997), 126 F.3d 1232, 1234, fn. 2, quoting <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Speicher </em>(C.A.7, 1989), 877 F.2d 531, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 59} There is a federal statute analogous to R.C. 2913.34. See Section 2320, Title 18, U.S.Code. This statute also defines a \u201ccounterfeit mark\u201d as a \u201cspurious mark * * * that is identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a mark registered on the principal register in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\u201d Section 2320(e)(1), Title 18, U.S.Code. Regarding this statute, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cThe statute does not specify the means by which the Government may establish that the marks were \u2018identical or substantially indistinguishable.\u2019 There is no support for the proposition that in all cases, the trier of fact must determine indistinguishability based on the marks as affixed to the actual goods. Nor is there a requirement that the actual trademark owner testify in a criminal trial, or that the agent who conducted the investigation and seizure of the counterfeit merchandise be qualified as an expert in the particular type of product. In this case, the jury had been shown registered designs of the trademarks for each cigar, as well as various cigar labels or bands produced by authorized licensees. The jury therefore had a valid basis for comparison in determining whether the designs were \u2018identical or substantially identical [sic].\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Guerra </em>(C.A.11, 2002), 293 F.3d 1279, 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">{\u00b6 61} Thus, in any given case, there are a variety of ways for the state to meet its burden of demonstrating that the marks used on the products were identical with or substantially indistinguishable from registered marks. I agree that one of the ways to do this is to actually introduce certified copies of the trademarks in question. This would be the paramount evidence to prove the state\u2019s case. However, another way to meet the state\u2019s burden would be to introduce authentic products and have a representative from the company identify the items as authentic, thus providing the jury with a comparison of the two marks. Finally, I believe that the state\u2019s evidence in this case, an expert opinion regarding the identity of the actual trademarks, combined with the defendant\u2019s confession, was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>{\u00b6 62} In the case sub judice, Sergeant Richissin testified that based on his education, training, and experience, he is able to identify trademarks. He identified certain marks on the counterfeit purses as being purported trademarks from certain companies, such as Louis Vuitton. He also testified that certain marks, such as the one appearing on a purported Coach bag, were \u201cregistered on the principal register in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\u201d Moreover, Sergeant Richissin testified that the marks on the merchandise seized from Troisi \u201cwere either identical or substantially indistinguishable from the genuine trademark[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 63} In addition to Sergeant Richissin\u2019s expert testimony, the state presented evidence that Troisi <em>admitted </em>that the merchandise was counterfeit. Troisi gave a written statement to the police, which was admitted at trial. In her statement, Troisi states that she \u201chad copy bags,\u201d that she knew \u201cit was error to sell them,\u201d and that she was \u201cwilling to give [the officers] the names of [her] suppliers in New York.\u201d In addition, the officer taking her statement asked: \u201cDid you know the merchandise you were selling (and brought) to 10350 Chillicothe Rd. was counterfeit designer merchandise?\u201d Troisi responded in her own handwriting: \u2018Tes. I knew that the purses and wallets were not authentic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 64} Also, Sergeant Richissin executed a controlled buy from Troisi. He testified that he had the following conversation with her:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cQ. Was there any discussion prior to your purchase?</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cA. We tried to get [Troisi] down on the price. We asked her if we could purchase the purse for forty dollars, rather than fifty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cQ. And did she have a response for you?</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cA. She said to me, Do you know [how] much it would cost to buy that purse if it was real.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">{\u00b6 69} In her written statement, Troisi admitted that the merchandise was counterfeit. In addition, during the controlled buy, she directly informed Sergeant Richissin that the merchandise was not real.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">{\u00b6 70} Through the testimony of Sergeant Richissin and Troisi\u2019s confession, the state presented evidence that when viewed in totality and in a light most favorable to the state was sufficient for a trier-of-fact to conclude that Troisi had committed the offense of trademark counterfeiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">{\u00b6 71} The judgment of the trial court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">{\u00b6 72} Finally, I disagree with the remedy imposed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">{\u00b6 73} When conducting a sufficiency-of-the-evidence analysis, this court is to look at the actual evidence admitted at trial, both admissible and inadmissible. See <em>State v. Jeffries, </em>11th Dist. No. 2005-L-057, 2007-Ohio-3366, 2007 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>1881314, at \u00b6 100, citing <em>Lockhart v. Nelson </em>(1988), 488 U.S. 33, 34, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265. <em>(State v. Jeffries </em>overruled on other grounds in <em>State v. Jeffries, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 265, 2008-Ohio-3865, 893 N.E.2d 487.) In her brief, Troisi asserts that \u201cwithout the testimony of Richissin on this issue, the verdict is not supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d As such, Troisi apparently concedes that <em>with Sergeant Richissin\u2019s testimony, </em>the state presented sufficient evidence to support her convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 74} If the majority concludes that Sergeant Richissin\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted because a proper foundation was not provided, then what occurred in this matter is an error in the admission of evidence. As such, the proper remedy is to reverse Troisi\u2019s convictions and remand the matter for a new trial. See, e.g., <em>State v. Papalevich </em>(Nov. 13, 2001), 10th Dist. No. 01AP-264, 2001 WL 1403110, at *10. However, the \u201cinadmissible\u201d evidence should still be considered when conducting a sufficiency-of-the-evidence analysis. <em>State v. Jeffries, </em>2007-Ohio-3366, 2007 WL 1881314, at \u00b6 100. This is because, had the trial court sustained Troisi\u2019s objections to Sergeant Richissin\u2019s testimony, the state would have had the opportunity to submit other evidence to demonstrate that the marks used on the products in this case were identical with or substantially indistinguishable from registered marks.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
