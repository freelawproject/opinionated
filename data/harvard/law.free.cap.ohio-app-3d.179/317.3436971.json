There were three passengers in his vehicle, including Kaitlin Lucchesi, age 14, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>sitting in the front passenger seat. Fisher did not have a driver\u2019s license and had never received any formal driver\u2019s training.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 3} As he was rounding a bend in the road, Fischer saw another vehicle coming toward him, which had crossed the center line by about the width of a tire. Fischer swerved to the right to avoid colliding with the other vehicle, causing his vehicle to go off the road and onto the shoulder and berm. When he maneuvered his vehicle back onto the road, his vehicle skidded sideways as it crossed the road, struck a telephone pole, and overturned. Kaitlin was killed as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 4} On October 27, 2004, Kaitlin\u2019s father, Anthony Lucchesi, administrator of the estate of Kaitlin Lucchesi, brought a negligence action against Fischer and a negligent entrustment action against Aida Galbreath, the owner of the vehicle Fischer was driving at the time of the accident. Lucchesi also brought a negligence action against the Clermont County Board of Commissioners, claiming that the board was negligent in failing to keep Round Bottom Road \u201copen, in repair and free from nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 5} In August 2005, the board moved for summary judgment on Lucchesi\u2019s negligence claim, arguing that it was entitled to immunity from liability under R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) because it had not failed to keep Round Bottom Road open, in repair, and free from nuisance. Lucchesi filed a memorandum in opposition, citing evidence showing that there was a significant drop-off from the road\u2019s paved portion to the berm, and asserting that when Fischer maneuvered his vehicle back on the road after having swerved onto the shoulder and berm to avoid hitting another vehicle, the drop-off edge or \u201cedge drop\u201d caused his vehicle to skid sideways and strike the telephone pole, resulting in Kaitlin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 6} On December 29, 2006, the trial court denied the board\u2019s motion after finding that the portion of Round Bottom Road where the accident occurred was part of the road\u2019s shoulder and berm, and therefore within the board\u2019s duty to maintain, and that genuine issues of material fact remained to be litigated as to the actual depth of the edge drop at the point where Fischer\u2019s vehicle first went off the road and the speed at which Fischer was driving at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 7} In August 2007, the board filed a second motion for summary judgment. On October 18, 2007, the trial court granted the board\u2019s second motion for summary judgment after finding that an edge drop is not part of the road\u2019s paved portion, but instead is part of the berm, and therefore, the accident at issue was not caused by the board\u2019s failure to keep the \u201croadway\u201d in repair, but instead was caused by a defect in the berm.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">{\u00b6 8} As a result, the trial court found inapplicable to this case the exception contained in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) to the general rule granting political subdivisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>immunity from liability for their performance of governmental functions contained in R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). The trial court concluded that because the board was entitled to immunity from liability, the board was entitled to summary judgment with respect to Lucchesi\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 9} In January 2008, Lucchesi voluntarily dismissed without prejudice his action against Galbreath. In February 2008, the trial court entered judgment against Fischer in Lucchesi\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 10} Lucchesi now appeals the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to the board on his negligence claim, assigning the following as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 11} Assignment of error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred in refusing to recognise [sic] res judicata \u2014 the thing had already been decided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">{\u00b6 13} Lucchesi contends that the trial court should have denied the board\u2019s second motion for summary judgment because \u201cthe thing had already been decided\u201d when the trial court overruled the board\u2019s first motion for summary judgment and the board did not present any new or different facts in support of its second motion. Therefore, he asserts, the trial court erred in granting the board\u2019s second motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">{\u00b6 14} The trial court found that the doctrine of res judicata did not preclude the court from ruling on the board\u2019s second motion for summary judgment because its previous decision denying the board\u2019s first motion for summary judgment was not a final, appealable order. Generally, the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not a final, appealable order and therefore, is not subject to immediate appeal. <em>Klein v. Portage Cty. </em>(2000), 139 Ohio App.3d 749, 751-752, 745 N.E.2d 532, citing <em>Celebrezze v. Netzley </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 89, 554 N.E.2d 1292. However, R.C. 2744.02(C) states, \u201cAn order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law <em>is </em>a final order.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">{\u00b6 15} Prior to October 2007, there was a conflict between appellate districts in this state as to whether a trial court\u2019s order denying a political subdivision\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on the existence of a genuine issue of material fact was \u201c[a]n order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability\u201d and therefore, a final, appealable order for purposes of R.C. 2744.02(C). The Second District Court of Appeals held that such an order was <em>not </em>a final, appealable order, see <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>167 Ohio App.3d 294, 2006-Ohio-3369, 854 N.E.2d 1133, while the Eighth Appellate District held that it was. See <em>Tomlin v. Pleban, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 87699, 2006-Ohio-6589, 2006 WL 3635173.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>{\u00b6 16} On October 3, 2007, the Ohio Supreme Court resolved this conflict in <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, syllabus, wherein the court held, \u201cWhen a trial court denies a motion in which a political subdivision or its employee seeks immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744, that order denies the benefit of an alleged immunity and is therefore a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).\u201d Thus, under <em>Hubbell, </em>the trial court\u2019s denial of the board\u2019s first motion for summary judgment <em>was </em>a final, appealable order, which <em>was </em>subject to an immediate appeal. Id. Nevertheless, <em>Hubbell </em>cannot be applied retroactively to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 17} Generally, a decision of the Ohio Supreme Court interpreting a statute is retroactive in its operation because it is a declaration of what is and always was the correct meaning or effect of the statute. <em>Anello v. Hufziger </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 28, 30, 547 N.E.2d 1220, citing <em>Peerless Elec. Co. v. Bowers </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 209, 57 O.O. 411, 129 N.E.2d 467. See also <em>Day v. Hissa </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 286, 287, 288, 646 N.E.2d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 18} However, the decision will not be given retroactive effect when (1) the decision is one of \u201cfirst impression\u201d and not \u201cclearly foreshadowed,\u201d (2) retroactive application will not retard the operation of the statute, considering its prior \u201chistory, purpose and effect,\u201d and (3) doing so would produce a \u201csubstantial inequitable result,\u201d i.e., an \u201cinjustice or hardship.\u201d See <em>Anello.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 19} Here, the decision in <em>Hubbell </em>qualifies as one of \u201cfirst impression,\u201d which was not \u201cclearly foreshadowed,\u201d because (1) it resolved a conflict between two appellate districts that had reached opposite conclusions on the issue of whether an order denying a political subdivision\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of the existence of a genuine issue of material fact was a \u201cfinal order\u201d under R.C. 2744.02(C) and (2) three justices dissented from the majority opinion in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b620} Furthermore, retroactive application of <em>Hubbell </em>to this case would retard the operation of R.C. 2744.02(C), considering its history, purpose, and effect, and produce a substantial, inequitable result. That provision was enacted to allow political subdivisions to obtain the early resolution of lawsuits brought against them, to aid in the preservation of their \u201cfiscal integrity.\u201d See <em>Hubbell, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, \u00b6 22-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 21} However, retroactively applying <em>Hubbell </em>to this case would prevent the board from appealing the trial court\u2019s decision overruling its first motion for summary judgment because the time for appealing that decision has long-since expired. See App.R. 4(A) (requiring party to file a notice of appeal within 30 days of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Furthermore, Lucehesi did not raise any argument in the trial court, nor has he raised any argument in this court, regarding R.C. 2744.02(C) or <em>Hubbell. </em>Therefore, he has waived any claim he may have had with respect to that statute and decision. See, e.g., <em>Palisades Collection, L.L.C. v. O\u2019Brien, </em>172 Ohio App.3d 186, 2007-Ohio-3460, 873 N.E.2d 923, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 23} The remaining issue before us, then, is whether the trial court should have denied the board\u2019s second motion for summary judgment on the basis of res judicata because \u201cthe thing had already been decided\u201d when the trial court denied the board\u2019s first motion for summary judgment and the board did not present any new or different facts in support of its second motion. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 24} The doctrine of res judicata provides that a \u201c \u2018valid, <em>final judgment </em>rendered <em>upon the merits </em>bars all subsequent actions based upon any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Portage Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Akron, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 106, 2006-Ohio-954, 846 N.E.2d 478, \u00b6 84, quoting <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 653 N.E.2d 226. The trial court\u2019s decision denying the board\u2019s first motion for summary judgment was not a final judgment rendered upon the merits of Lucchesi\u2019s negligence action against the board. Id. Therefore, we agree with the trial court\u2019s decision finding that it was not precluded under the doctrine of res judicata from ruling on the board\u2019s second motion for summary judgment, though we arrive at this conclusion for reasons different from those relied upon by the trial court. See <em>Goudlock v. Voorhies, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 398, 2008-Ohio-4787, 894 N.E.2d 692, \u00b6 12 (a reviewing court is not authorized to reverse a correct judgment simply because erroneous reasons have been assigned in support thereof).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 25} Lucchesi\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 26} Assignment of error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that there is no applicable exception to immunity and that Clermont County Bd. of Commissions [sic] is immune from liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">{\u00b6 28} Lucehesi argues that his daughter\u2019s fatal accident was caused by the board\u2019s negligent failure to keep in repair the edge drop on Round Bottom Road. He asserts that the edge drop is part of the public roadway and the board\u2019s failure to keep in repair this part of the roadway places this case within an exception to the general rule granting political subdivisions immunity from liability for their negligent failure to perform a governmental or proprietary function. Therefore, Lucehesi asserts, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the board on his negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Political subdivisions like counties or townships are not liable generally for injury or death to persons in connection with their performance of a governmental or proprietary function. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). Exceptions to this rule are listed in R.C. 2744.02(B). The exception that Lucchesi claims is applicable in this case is R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), which states, \u201c[Political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair and other negligent failure to remove obstructions from public roads.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u2018Public roads\u2019 means public roads, highways, streets, avenues, alleys, and bridges within a political subdivision. \u2018Public roads\u2019 does not include <em>berms, shoulders, </em>rights-of-way, or traffic control devices unless the traffic control devices are mandated by the Ohio manual of uniform traffic control devices.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> R.C. 2744.01(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c \u2018Street\u2019 or \u2018highway\u2019 means the entire width between the boundary lines of every way open to the use of the public as a thoroughfare for purposes of vehicular travel.\u201d R.C. 4511.01(BB). \u201c \u2018Roadway\u2019 means that portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel, <em>except the berm or shoulder.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 4511.01(EE).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 32} The terms \u201cberm,\u201d \u201cshoulder,\u201d and \u201cedge drop\u201d are not defined in R.C. 2744 or 4511. When a word or term in a statute is not defined by the statute itself, courts look to the plain and ordinary meaning of those words for guidance in determining its meaning. See <em>Brecksville v. Cook </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 53, 56, 661 N.E.2d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cBerm\u201d is commonly defined as \u201cthe shoulder of a road.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993) at 206. \u201cShoulder\u201d is commonly defined as \u201ceither edge of a roadway,\u201d and \u201cthe part of a roadway outside of the traveled way on which vehicles may be parked in an emergency.\u201d Id. at 2104.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">{\u00b6 34} In his deposition, Lucchesi\u2019s expert discussed the meaning of \u201cshoulder,\u201d \u201cberm,\u201d and \u201cedge drop\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe berm technically begins at the back of the edge line. The edge line is part of the road surface, part of the travel lane. I know you\u2019re not supposed to travel on it, but it\u2019s travelable. Anything beyond that is the recovery area, the berm area, the shoulder area. Berm and shoulder are kind of used back and forth, depending upon who you\u2019re talking to.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>{\u00b6 36} \u201cNormally a shoulder is paved, like on the interstate. A berm normally is gravel. It can be stabilized or not, it could be grass. If it\u2019s grass, obviously, there\u2019s dirt underneath it that at times may show up as dirt. It\u2019s all a recovery area. When I talk about edge drop, I\u2019m talking about the edge of the hard surface. If it happens to be beyond the edge line, sobeit [sic]. It\u2019s still a drop-off. It\u2019s a difference in elevation between two adjacent surfaces and in this case made of two different materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 37} Lucchesi contends that (1) the plain meaning of \u201cshoulder\u201d and \u201cberm\u201d does not include \u201cedge drop,\u201d (2) the plain meaning of \u201cedge drop\u201d makes it part of the paved roadway, and therefore, part of the \u201cpublic roadway,\u201d and (3) the plain meaning of \u201cpublic roadway\u201d includes portions of the roadway outside the white boundary lines, including the edge drop. He asserts that because the edge drop is part of the public roadway, the board\u2019s failure to keep the edge drop in repair causes this case to fall within the exception contained in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) to the general rule of political subdivision immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">{\u00b6 38} However, the authority Lucchesi cites in support of his arguments derives from the former version of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), which stated, \u201c[P]olitical subdivision are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their failure to keep public roads, highways, streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, bridges, aqueducts, viaducts, or public grounds within the political subdivisions open, in repair, <em>and free from nuisance.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 39} One of the cases on which Lucchesi relies is <em>Haynes v. Franklin, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 344, 2002-Ohio-2334, 767 N.E.2d 1146, \u00b6 19, in which the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cIn short, no bright-line test can be stated as to whether an edge drop on the berm of a county or city road constitutes a nuisance within the meaning of [former] R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). An edge drop may constitute a nuisance for purposes of that statute where the drop resulted from a failure to maintain a preexisting shoulder or berm; where the particular edge drop is found, in light of all the surrounding facts and circumstances, to render the regularly travelled portions of the highway unsafe for the usual and ordinary course of travel; and where the political subdivision has failed to correct the defect upon being charged with actual or constructive notice of its existence. If, however, a dangerous edge drop is the result of design or construction, it is under our precedent and, by definition, not a nuisance within the scope of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">{\u00b641} Another case on which Lucchesi relies is <em>Cupp v. Kudla, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 728, 2004-Ohio-5528, 822 N.E.2d 392, \u00b6 22. In that case, an appellate court interpreted <em>Seek v. Rogers </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 462, 6 OBR 515, 453 N.E.2d 705, as holding that \u201cany paved area directly adjacent to the outer white edge line must be viewed as part of the \u2018roadway,\u2019 \u201d and concluded that \u201cit must follow that the berm of a highway begins at that point where the pavement ends.\u201d Lucchesi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>asserts that in light of this language in <em>Seek </em>and <em>Cupp, </em>\u201c[c]learly, the [Ohio] Supreme Court has determined that the pavement is not the berm or shoulder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">{\u00b6 42} However, in the current version of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), which became effective in April 2003, the General Assembly deleted the \u201cfree from nuisance\u201d language from the statute and replaced it with \u201cnegligent failure to keep public roads in repair\u201d and \u201cother negligent failure to remove obstructions from public roads.\u201d The General Assembly also excluded \u201cberm\u201d and \u201cshoulder\u201d from the definition of \u201cpublic roads.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(H). The Ohio Supreme Court has characterized the General Assembly\u2019s amendments to R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) as \u201ca deliberate effort to limit political subdivisions\u2019 liability for injuries and deaths on their roadways.\u201d <em>Howard v. Miami Twp. Fire Div., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 1, 2008-Ohio-2792, 891 N.E.2d 311, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">{\u00b6 43} In its decision granting summary judgment to the board, the trial court stated that \u201c[w]hile it may be concluded that the paved area outside the white boundary lines could still be considered the \u2018roadway,\u2019 clearly the berm has been explicitly excluded from that definition.\u201d The trial court then found that \u201c[a]n edge-drop, by definition, exists off the paved portion of the road\u201d and \u201conly exists as a hazard as one leaves the roadway.\u201d The trial court concluded that the accident at issue was not caused by the board\u2019s failure to keep the roadway in repair, but rather, by a defect in the berm, i.e., the edge drop, and therefore, the exception contained in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) to the general rule of political subdivision immunity was inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 44} We conclude that the edge drop that Lucchesi asserts was the cause of the fatal accident does not fall within the term \u201cpublic roads\u201d for purposes of the exception to political subdivision immunity contained in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). The term \u201cpublic roads\u201d expressly includes \u201cpublic roads, highways, streets [and] avenues,\u201d but expressly excludes \u201cberms\u201d or \u201cshoulders.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(H). \u201cHighway\u201d is defined as \u201cthe entire width between the boundary lines of every way open to the use of the public as a thoroughfare for purposes of vehicular travel,\u201d R.C. 4511.01(BB), while \u201croadway\u201d is defined as \u201cthat portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel, <em>except the berm, or shoulder.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 4511.01(EE).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">{\u00b6 45} The edge drop between the paved shoulder and the unpaved berm is clearly part of either the shoulder or the berm. However, the question of whether the edge drop is actually part of the shoulder or actually part of the berm is immaterial, since both the shoulder and the berm are expressly excluded from the definition of \u201cpublic roads.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(H). Because the General Assembly expressly excluded the terms \u201cshoulder\u201d and \u201cberm\u201d from the definitions of \u201cpublic roads\u201d and \u201croadway,\u201d it is apparent that the legislature never intended for an edge drop to be considered part of the \u201cpublic roads, highways, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>streets, avenues,\u201d etc., id., for which a political subdivision could be held hable for failing to keep \u201cin repair.\u201d R.C. 2744.02(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 46} Consequently, the exception contained in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) to the general rule of political subdivision immunity does not apply in this case, and therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the board on Lucchesi\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 47} Lucchesi\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 48} The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-9\">Walsh, P.J., and Powell, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-12\">. Likewise, R.C. 4511.01(EE) defines \u201croadway\u201d as \"that portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel, <em>except the berm or shoulder.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
