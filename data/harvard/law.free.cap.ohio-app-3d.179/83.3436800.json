Ford (\u201cFord\u201d), brings this appeal from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allen County granting summary judgment on damages to defendant-appellee, Ford Motor Credit Company (\u201cFMCC\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">{\u00b6 2} Ford and FMCC entered into an agreement for the lease of a motor vehicle. FMCC, through its agent, contacted Ford and informed him that there had been a mistake as to some of the terms of the contract and insisted that the terms needed to be changed. Ford declined to change the terms of the contract and returned the vehicle to FMCC\u2019s agent. FMCC subsequently filed a claim against Ford in Lima Municipal Court, case No. 03 CVF 127, claiming that Ford had breached the contract and seeking damages. This complaint was voluntarily dismissed on October 3, 2007. FMCC later refiled the case, case No. 06 CVF 947, and sought damages in the amount of $13,178.36. On October 24, 2006, this case proceeded to a trial on the merits. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Ford, and FMCC\u2019s case was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">{\u00b6 3} After FMCC lost, they failed to enter the proper code to remove the debt from Ford\u2019s file. The result was that the account was returned to collections. Subsequently, Ford received letters from collections agencies and repeated phone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>calls from those agencies, and the \u201cbad debt\u201d was placed on his credit report by FMCC. In addition, the collection agencies placed phone calls to various family members, trying to \u201cencourage\u201d Ford to pay the debt. After repeated attempts to resolve the matter via phone calls and letters, Ford filed a complaint with the Court of Common Pleas of Allen County on February 12, 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The clerk of courts sent the summons and complaint to the address provided by FMCC to the Lima Municipal Court in the complaint filed in 2006. FMCC failed to file an answer. On June 14, 2007, Ford filed a motion for default judgment. A hearing on the motion was held on July 18, 2007. On July 19, 2007, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Ford and ordered compensatory damages in the amount of $500,000 and punitive damages in the amount of $100,000. Notice of the judgment was sent to the same address as the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 4} On October 9, 2007, FMCC filed a motion to vacate the default judgment. FMCC claimed that it did not receive notice of the suit and that it had a meritorious defense. The trial court on October 29, 2007, denied the motion to vacate the judgment, but granted the motion as to damages. A second damages hearing was set for December 19, 2007. On October 30, 2007, FMCC filed a motion to reschedule the hearing date, which was granted. The new hearing date was set for April 3, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">{\u00b6 5} The parties then began engaging in discovery. On January 10, 2008, FMCC filed a motion to compel discovery. The order to compel was filed on January 14, 2008. The order to compel warned that failure to comply with discovery \u201cshall subject [Ford] to sanctions authorized by law.\u201d On February 14, 2008, FMCC filed a motion for summary judgment. Ford failed to file an answer. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment on March 31, 2008. Ford appeals from this judgment and raises the following assignment of error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">The trial court erred in granting [FMCC\u2019s] motion for summary judgment filed and granted without leave of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">{\u00b6 6} The first issue raised by Ford\u2019s assignment of error is that FMCC failed to seek and receive leave of court prior to filing its motion for summary judgment. \u201cIf an action has been set for pretrial or trial, a motion for summary judgment may be made only with leave of court.\u201d Civ.R. 56(A). This court has previously held that the trial court has broad discretion to allow motions after the time for their filing has passed. <em>Boughan v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co., </em>3d Dist. Nos. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>1-02-42 and 1-02-44, 2002-Ohio-5421, 2002 WL 31251006, \u00b6 4. \u201cSince the acceptance of the motion is by the grace of the court, the decision to accept, therefore, is itself \u2018by leave of court.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Cochran v. Ohio Auto Club </em>(Oct. 3, 1996), Marion App. No. 9-96-33, 1996 WL 562055. Here, the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the motion did not prejudice Ford. Ford had ample time to respond to the motion, but failed to do so. Since Ford was not prejudiced by the acceptance, the acceptance of the motion is not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">{\u00b6 7} Having found that the motion was properly before the trial court, the next question is whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment. When reviewing a motion for summary judgment, courts must proceed cautiously and award summary judgment only when appropriate. <em>Franks v. Lima News </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 408, 672 N.E.2d 245. \u201cCiv.R. 56(C) provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined that (1) no genuine issues as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Ferreri </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 587, 589, 639 N.E.2d 1189. When reviewing the judgment of the trial court, an appellate court reviews the ease de novo. <em>Franks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">{\u00b6 8} In this case, FMCC moved for summary judgment on the basis that Ford had not presented any evidence to support his claim for lost profits. FMCC then focuses on the fact that Ohio law requires proof of lost profits that are reasonably certain. This court has held previously that \u201c[w]here conclusory evidence of lost profits is presented, without supporting information explaining how the profits were calculated, there is insufficient evidence of such lost profits.\u201d <em>Ott v. Marion Plaza, Inc. </em>(Aug. 31, 1987), Marion App. No. 9-85-27, 1987 WL 16265. This court continues to hold to that principle. This court notes that Ford did not properly support his claim of lost profits at the first damages hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 9} However, the complaint does not claim only lost profits as the damages. Ford is an individual, not a business, and he presented significant evidence of other types of damages.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">[Mr. White]: * * * [Subsequently [to the October 2003 dismissal], now are you getting phone calls and notices and everything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">A. Yeah, not only myself, my father-in-law, my mother-in-law, my parents, my wife, her eighty-year-old grandfather, are all getting phone calls from [FMCC] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>just absolutely harassing the daylights out of us. Saying they\u2019re going to fix me and they\u2019ll take care of me some way, some how, they\u2019ll get a hold of me. And you know, they want me to call them all the time. It\u2019s just a constant harassment. They were really being extremely nasty to my wife\u2019s grandpa which was a little uncalled for considering he\u2019s eighty years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">Q. So the [2006 case] is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">A. The case is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">Q. Now, what happens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">A. So, nothing \u2014 but two weeks to the date I start getting harassing phone calls. * * * The first time they called me, I answered. Didn\u2019t know who it was. It says no caller I.D. every time they call me. And he said, \u201cHey, you know you owe us money.\u201d And I said, \u201cWho is this?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t owe anybody any money. I\u2019m debt free. So, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d And he said, he goes, \u201cThis is \u2014 we\u2019re representing [FMCC].\u201d And I said, \u201cI won this case in a court of law, you know, two weeks ago.\u201d And he said, \u201cOh, no, you didn\u2019t, you son of a bitch.\u201d You know? And he goes, \u201cwe\u2019ll fix your ass. You\u2019ll see. We\u2019re going to 'be taking you to court again.\u201d * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">So, my wife\u2019s grandpa calls me and he goes, \u201cI just got a really, really nasty phone call.\u201d He goes, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on Here?\u201d He goes, \u201cI know your integrity and stuff like that, you know. What\u2019s happened here?\u201d * * * And so they\u2019re calling him and harassing him on a daily basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">Q. Let me ask you, Mr. Ford, as far as your credit report. Is this \u2014 has this gone on your credit report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">A. It has [gone] on my credit report as an involuntary repossession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">Q. When did that first go on your credit report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-14\">A. That went on approximately the first time we went to court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-15\">Q. Okay, and it hasn\u2019t been removed since that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-16\">A. I\u2019ve tried and tried and tried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-17\">The Court: Involuntary \u2014 what\u2019d they call it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-18\">Mr. Ford: Involuntary repossession. That basically states that they came to my house with a tow truck, like you see on T.V., and they came and got the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-19\">Q. And what else does it reflect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-20\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-21\">A. That\u2019s it, I mean, from Ford. I mean, my credit report is clean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Q. Okay, does that continue to be on your credit report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">A. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">Q. * * * Okay, let\u2019s talk about how you\u2019ve been hurt. Now, first of all, there\u2019s an exhibit in there that you are reported to have signed. It\u2019s your testimony that you did not sign that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">[Ford]: I did not sign that document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">Q. And Judge Lauber more or less found that to be the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">A. Yeah, they forged my document so they could get their numbers where they needed to be, what they told me that my car payment was going to be. I told them that I wanted a twenty-four (24) month lease, fifteen thousand (15,000) a year, and that I wanted to pay three hundred dollars ($300). That statement says that I\u2019m going to \u2014 it\u2019s like a forty-eight (48) month or thirty-six (36) month, I\u2019m not quite sure. It\u2019s been a while since\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">Q. So they\u2019ve\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-11\">A. \u2014It\u2019s\u2014It\u2019s a completely bizarre \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">Q. They used a forgery and the judge didn\u2019t buy it and he dismissed their case at this time with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">Q. This was the second filing anyway. So you did get a judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-15\">A. This was the second one. So, he \u2014 he basically blew up in court. He just had had enough of seeing the documents and everything. He had had enough of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-16\">The Court: That was in October of last year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-17\">Mr. White: Yes, sir. Okay, so they used forgery. They said that they got a judgment against you that they haven\u2019t had. You\u2019re constantly being harassed and so forth. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re asking for punitive damages in the amount of a hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-18\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-19\">Q. All right. Now let\u2019s talk about the compensatory damages. How has this affected you in \u2014 money wise, Mr. Ford?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-20\">A. I\u2019ve been unable to buy anything for the last six (6) years. The last six (6) years \u2014 I can\u2019t buy anything. A repossession on your credit report is basically like you\u2019ve filed for bankruptcy. And it really, really affects your credit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-21\">And I\u2019ve tried and tried and tried and there\u2019s a point where you know that you can\u2019t get a loan, so you just quit. So, we have had to meet with banks, meet with lenders and discuss what has happened and everything has to be put under my wife\u2019s name because they won\u2019t allow me to buy anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>I can\u2019t get a credit card, I couldn\u2019t finance a car if I tried. I can\u2019t get a house. I can\u2019t buy anything. For six (6) years. And I\u2019m thirty (30) years old, you know. I\u2019ve got responsibilities at home, two kids, a wife, you know. And it\u2019s\u2014 it gets a little old, you know?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Based upon this testimony, as well as the lost-profits testimony, the trial court originally awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $500,000. The trial court did not state that all of these damages were for lost profits, and the record indicates that other damages were present. Ford submitted a copy of his credit report from March 2007, which indicated that the only negative was FMCC\u2019s claim that he had not paid his debt. What is the value of damaged credit?</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">{\u00b6 10} Additionally, FMCC did nothing to remove the publication of the alleged debt even after it lost in court. Instead, FMCC continued to publish information that Ford still owed the money and that the debt was valid. FMCC\u2019s Recoveries Manager swore in his affidavit that as of November 14, 2006, FMCC decided to turn Ford\u2019s account over to a collections agency. This was 20 days after FMCC had lost its claim in Lima Municipal Court. The manager\u2019s affidavit states that if the debt was discharged by court order, then the wrong code was mistakenly entered into Ford\u2019s account. However, FMCC did nothing to rectify the situation. What is the value of Ford\u2019s reputation? This question as well as the one posed above is not an objective determination. They are subjective questions of fact that must be resolved by a jury. Thus, they are material issues of fact present in this case that make the granting of summary judgment improper. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment. The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">{\u00b6 11} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allen County is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b127-8\">Shaw, P.J., and Preston, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\">. Although the complaint did not specifically identify by name the claims upon which it was brought, a reading of it brings up claims of defamation, violations of fair debt-collection practices, and harassment, among others. Additionally, Ford claims that the acts of FMCC affected his credit, his ability to borrow money, and his ability to do business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-12\">. Even if the trial court failed to properly recall the testimony from the original hearing, a copy of the transcript was available for the trial court's review as it was attached by FMCC to its motion to vacate the default judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
