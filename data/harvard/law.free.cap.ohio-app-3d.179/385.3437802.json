For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>I. Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">A. The DiStefano Asbestos Bodily Injury Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 2} This case arose out of a bodily injury suit filed on March 7, 2002, by George DiStefano against Pennsylvania General\u2019s insured, Park-Ohio Industries, Inc., and a number of other defendants in California state court. DiStefano alleged mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure at various work sites in California between the 1960s and 1980s. During his deposition, DiStefano testified that he had worked with asbestos-containing coils manufactured by Ohio Crankshaft, the predecessor to Park-Ohio, from January 1961 through approximately June 1963, periods when Pennsylvania General insured Park-Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 3} Upon being served with the complaint, Park-Ohio\u2019s risk manager and its current insurance agent initiated a search for applicable liability policies. Park-Ohio also retained a San Francisco law firm to represent its interests. Upon locating the Pennsylvania General policies five months later, in late August 2002, Park-Ohio notified Pennsylvania General of the DiStefano claim. When Pennsylvania General received notice of the claim, the DiStefano trial was set for the beginning of October 2002-approximately six weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 4} Upon receipt of the notice, Pennsylvania General began its claim investigation. It retained Henry Rome, a California attorney with expertise in asbestos matters, to assist its review and evaluation. It also inquired of Park-Ohio regarding \u201cother insurance policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 5} In September 2002, prior to trial, Park-Ohio\u2019s lawyers gave Pennsylvania General an evaluation of the case regarding settlement values and strategy. Counsel advised that coordinated medical counsel had advised that they saw no viable medical defense and opined that the case had a conservative verdict value of $5-6 million. Counsel stated that the current settlement demand was $3 million and advised engaging DiStefano\u2019s counsel in \u201cmeaningful settlement negotiations immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 6} On October 6, 2002, Park-Ohio, without the knowledge of Pennsylvania General, negotiated a settlement of the DiStefano claim for $1 million in exchange for a full release and dismissal with prejudice of the action. After the settlement, in a letter dated October 15, 2002, Rome advised Pennsylvania General that the settlement amount appeared to be in line with other mesothelioma cases in the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly where there was no other viable co-defendant \u2014 as in the DiStefano matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 7} Rome further advised Pennsylvania General that, based on his experience, he believed Park-Ohio was well represented by the two law firms it had retained, both having excellent reputations in the defense of asbestos cases. Rome also advised Pennsylvania General that he agreed with the legal analysis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Park-Ohio\u2019s defense counsel, who had concluded that Park-Ohio would not likely mount a successful medical defense. Rome also agreed that Park-Ohio was the only viable defendant and conservatively faced multimillion-dollar exposure at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 8} Rome further advised Pennsylvania General that he did not believe Pennsylvania General would be able to deny the DiStefano claim based on Park-Ohio\u2019s five-month delay in notifying Pennsylvania General, as there was no evidence of prejudice in light of the excellent asbestos litigation reputations of the defense firms Park-Ohio had retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 9} Subsequently, in November 2002, Rome advised Pennsylvania General that under California law, there is a \u201ccontinuous\u201d trigger of coverage for asbestos personal-injury actions such that all policies of a manufacturer are triggered upon exposure. Rome explained that because there were four Pennsylvania General policies, each with a $250,000 limit, there was $1 million available from which to pay the $1 million settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 10} Nevertheless, in February 2003, Pennsylvania General informed Park-Ohio via a reservation of rights letter that it would pay $112,238.70 in post-tender defense costs and only $250,000 of the $1 million settlement. Pennsylvania General stated that its position was that \u201cunder prevailing law, plaintiffs claim qualifies as a single occurrence, and, even under a continuous trigger, the insured is entitled only to the limits of a single policy; i.e. $250,000 per person for bodily injury.\u201d Pennsylvania General reserved all of its rights under the potentially applicable policies and again requested \u201cother insurance\u201d information fronl Park-Ohio. Despite Pennsylvania General\u2019s request, Park-Ohio did not provide the requested information.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">B. Park-Ohio\u2019s Coverage Action Against Pennsylvania General</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">{\u00b6 11} In September 2003, Park-Ohio filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against Pennsylvania General in the matter captioned <em>Park-Ohio Industries Inc. v. Gen. Acc. Ins. Co., </em>Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, No. CV-03-511015 (\u201cPark-Ohio suit\u201d). Park-Ohio asserted claims for declaratory judgment, breach of contract, and bad faith, and sought defense costs and indemnification of the full settlement amount in the DiStefano action from Pennsylvania General. In October 2003, Pennsylvania General paid $112,238.70 to Park-Ohio as reimbursement of post-tender defense costs incurred by Park-Ohio in the DiStefano suit, and in December 2003, Pennsylvania General paid $250,000 to Park-Ohio as the full per-person bodily injury limit of one of the policies at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">{\u00b6 12} During litigation, Pennsylvania General, on numerous occasions, again requested information about Park-Ohio\u2019s \u201cother insurers\u201d from Park-Ohio. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Pennsylvania General was unable to obtain this information from Park-Ohio until, after motion practice, the trial court ordered Park-Ohio to produce the information. In July 2004, Pennsylvania General finally received copies of \u201cother insurance\u201d related documents from Park-Ohio. Approximately seven weeks later, on September 3, 2004, Pennsylvania General wrote to Nationwide, Continental, and St. Paul/Travelers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking equitable contribution for the DiStefano claim. None of these insurers agreed to contribute, although like Pennsylvania General, they were primary insurers of Park-Ohio, their policies were triggered by the DiStefano claim, and the essential terms, conditions, and exclusions of their policies are nearly identical to those of Park-Ohio\u2019s policies with Pennsylvania General.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">C. Pennsylvania General\u2019s Equitable Contribution Action</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 13} In October 2004, before the Park-Ohio suit against it was resolved, Pennsylvania General filed this action for declaratory judgment seeking equitable contribution from Nationwide, Continental, and St. Paul/Travelers<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for settlement and defense costs of the DiStefano claim. Specifically, Pennsylvania General sought $246,527 from Continental and $372,995 from Nationwide, plus prejudgment interest from an unspecified date.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 14} The action was subsequently stayed pending resolution of the Park-Ohio suit. In November 2005, Pennsylvania General settled the Park-Ohio suit by paying the remaining $750,000 of the DiStefano claim, for a total payment of $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 15} Pennsylvania General, Nationwide, and Continental subsequently agreed to a bench trial in this case, to be decided upon the briefs, joint stipulated facts, and joint exhibits. In a 15-page decision, the trial court found that Nationwide and Continental had no duty to indemnify or defend Park-Ohio because Park-Ohio had breached the notice provisions of their applicable policies and thus \u201cwaived\u201d Pennsylvania General\u2019s right to contribution. The trial court further found that Pennsylvania General did not take reasonable measures to preserve its contribution rights because \u201cit should have made certain the other insurers were notified before the DiStefano suit was settled\u201d to allow them to participate in the defense and settlement of the suit. The trial court found \u201cno equitable reasons for this court to endorse that failure,\u201d and therefore the trial court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Nationwide and Continental did not owe Pennsylvania General any contribution for the defense and settlement of the DiStefano action. Pennsylvania General appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">II. Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 16} The parties have made much over the appropriate standard of review in this case. Pennsylvania General argues that since the trial court reviewed this case upon stipulated facts and briefs, its decision is subject to review de novo as upon an error of law. See, e.g., <em>Mazza v. Am. Continental Ins. Co., </em>9th Dist. No. 21192, 2003-Ohio-360, 2003 WL 187580, affirmed <em>In re Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Cases, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 302, 2003-Ohio-5888, 798 N.E.2d 1077. Nationwide and Continental claim that since the cause of action is equitable and not legal in nature (equitable contribution), the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 17} We find that the outcome is the same, no matter the standard of review. As explained below, the trial court\u2019s resolution of the controversy upon the basis of Park-Ohio\u2019s lack of notice to Nationwide and Continental was an error of law, because the contractual provision requiring notice existed only in the contracts between Park-Ohio and its insurers and not between Pennsylvania General and Nationwide and Continental. Hence, Pennsylvania General\u2019s equitable claim of contribution cannot be invalidated as a result of alleged breaches of contracts to which Pennsylvania General was not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">{\u00b6 18} Reviewed on the basis of abuse of discretion, we likewise reverse and remand. The record is uncontroverted that the DiStefano settlement was equitable, the attorney fees were reasonable, counsel chosen by Park-Ohio was competent, Pennsylvania General adequately represented Nationwide and Continental\u2019s interests, and Nationwide and Continental received reasonable notice of Pennsylvania General\u2019s contribution claim. We discern no prejudice whatsoever to Nationwide and Continental. Under such circumstances, relieving them of the obligation of contribution, and leaving Pennsylvania General with the entire obligation, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">B. The \u201cAll Sums\u201d Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 512, 2002-Ohio-2842, 769 N.E.2d 835, \u00b6 6, the Ohio Supreme Court noted that Ohio follows the \u201call sums\u201d approach to allocation of insurance-coverage responsibility where a claimed loss involving long-term exposure and delayed-manifestation injury (such as an asbestos-related claim) implicates numerous insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>policies over multiple policy periods. The <em>Goodyear </em>court explained that in such situations, because the insured expected complete security from each policy that it purchased, \u201cthe insured is entitled to secure coverage from a single policy of its choice that covers \u2018all sums\u2019 incurred as damages \u2018during the policy period,\u2019 subject to that policy\u2019s limits of coverage. In such an instance, the insurers bear the burden of obtaining contribution from other applicable primary insurance policies as they deem necessary.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 20} In short, each insurer on the risk between the initial exposure and the manifestation of disease or death is fully liable to the insured for indemnification and defense costs. In order to afford the insured the coverage promised by the insurance policies, the insured is free to select the policy or polices under which it is to be indemnified. \u201cThis approach promotes economy for the insured while still permitting insurers to seek contribution from other responsible parties when possible.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">C. Equitable Contribution in General</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 21} Contribution is the right of a person who has been compelled to pay what another should have paid in part to require partial (usually proportionate) reimbursement. <em>Travelers Indemn. Co. v. Trowbridge </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 11, 70 O.O.2d 6, 321 N.E.2d 787, paragraph two of the syllabus, overruled on other grounds <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Huron Rd. Hosp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 391, 653 N.E.2d 235. The general rule of contribution is that \u201cone who is compelled to pay or satisfy the whole to bear more than his or her just share of a common burden or obligation, upon which several persons are equally liable * * * is entitled to contribution against the others to obtain from them payment of their respective shares.\u201d 18 American Jurisprudence 2d (2004), Contribution, Section 1. The doctrine \u201crests upon the broad principle of justice, that where one has discharged a debt or obligation which others were equally bound with him to discharge, and thus removed a common burden, the others who have received a benefit ought in conscience to refund to him a ratable proportion.\u201d <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR. Co. v. Walker </em>(1888), 45 Ohio St. 577, 588, 16 N.E. 475. Since the doctrine of contribution has its basis in the broad principles of equity, it should be liberally applied. Id. Equity \u201ccannot be determined by any [fixed] rule, but depends upon the peculiar facts and equitable considerations of each case.\u201d <em>Tiffin v. Shawhan </em>(1885), 43 Ohio St. 178, 1 N.E. 581, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">D. Application of These Principles to This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 22} Pennsylvania General asserts four assignments of error. Briefly summarized, Pennsylvania General argues that it should not be penalized because its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>insured, Park-Ohio, did not comply with contractual provisions of contracts to which Pennsylvania General was not a party. It argues further that the overwhelming equities favor Pennsylvania General\u2019s contribution claim, because Pennsylvania General resolved the DiStefano claim in accordance with the terms and conditions of its policies and applicable law: it honored its contractual obligations to its policyholder, complied with the letter and spirit of <em>Goodyear </em>by paying the entirety of the claim, and then timely pursued its equitable contribution claim against the nonselected insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 23} Nationwide and Continental respond that they owe no coverage to Park-Ohio because Park-Ohio failed to give them prompt notice of the DiStefano claim and settled without their approval in violation of their policy provisions. Therefore, they contend, they share no common liability with Pennsylvania General that would give rise to an equitable-contribution claim. They argue further that it is not equitable to allow Pennsylvania General to obtain contribution because Pennsylvania General did not give them reasonable notice of the DiStefano suit or its potential contribution claim, which prejudiced their ability to participate in the defense and settlement of the DiStefano suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 24} We begin by observing that despite the trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary, <em>Goodyear </em>is not the controlling authority in this matter. Although <em>Goodyear </em>indicates that Ohio follows the all-sums approach in apportioning available insurance coverage when multiple policies are triggered to cover the same long-term injury or loss, it does not address the issue presented by this ease: may one insurer, who was selected by the insured to indemnify its loss and who paid the entire settlement amount to the insured, recover by contribution from other insurers who were similarly liable on the claim but not selected by the insured, and who had no knowledge of the loss or payment until the demand for contribution was made? We hold, on these facts, that it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 25} At the outset, we recognize that \u201c[cjontribution rights, if any, between two or more insurance companies insuring the same event are not based on the law of contracts. This follows from basic common sense, because the contracts entered into are formed between the insurer and the insured, not between two insurance companies. Accordingly, whatever rights the insurers have against one another do not arise from contractual undertakings. * * * Instead, whatever obligations or rights to contribution may exist between two or more insurers of the same event flow from equitable principles.\u201d <em>Maryland Cas. Co. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>(2000), 218 F.3d 204, 210-211.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 26} Thus, we reject Nationwide and Continental\u2019s argument, and the trial court\u2019s finding, that Park-Ohio\u2019s policy breaches (specifically, its failure to give Nationwide and Continental timely notice of the DiStefano suit, failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>assist and cooperate with a defense, and voluntary payment) somehow preclude Pennsylvania General\u2019s contribution claim against them. This is not a contract action: Pennsylvania General\u2019s equitable-contribution claim does not arise out of the policies between Park-Ohio and Nationwide and Continental, so Park-Ohio\u2019s conduct with respect to those policies can not \u201cwaive\u201d any contribution rights that Pennsylvania General might have against those insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">{\u00b6 27} Further, under the all-sums approach adopted by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Goodyear, </em>Park-Ohio had no duty to notify Nationwide and Continental of the DiStefano claim. As set forth in <em>Goodyear, </em>Park-Ohio could, as it did, select one insurer from the triggered policies to pay the entire claim and then leave that insurer to pursue a contribution claim from Park-Ohio\u2019s other insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 28} Applying equitable principles, we are similarly unpersuaded by Nationwide and Continental\u2019s argument that Pennsylvania General is not entitled to contribution because it failed to timely notify them of the DiStefano matter and its potential contribution claim and failed to insist on compliance with its policy terms (which are nearly identical to the policies Park-Ohio had with Nationwide and Continental) to void coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 29} With respect to notice, the stipulated facts demonstrate that despite repeated requests for \u201cother insurance\u201d information from Park-Ohio, Pennsylvania General was unable to obtain information regarding other insurers from Park-Ohio until finally, after motion practice, the court ordered Park-Ohio to produce the information. Pennsylvania General then contacted the other insurers within weeks of learning of their existence and sought contribution for the DiStefano claim. On these facts, any argument that Pennsylvania General was not diligent in pursuing other insurance information and preserving its equitable contribution action is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 30} Further, applying equitable principles to these facts, we cannot discern, nor have Nationwide and Continental demonstrated, any prejudice arising from Pennsylvania General\u2019s notice. Nationwide and Continental argue, and the trial court agreed, that Pennsylvania General\u2019s failure to notify them of the DiStefano matter in the six weeks between Pennsylvania General\u2019s learning of the case and Park-Ohio\u2019s early settlement prejudiced them because they were unable to participate in the defense and settlement of the lawsuit. But the all-sums approach adopted by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Goodyear </em>anticipates exactly this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 31} Under the all-sums approach, only the insurer selected by the insured defends the insured and participates in the underlying tort-claim litigation. <em>Keene Corp. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(C.A.D.C.1981), 667 F.2d 1034, 1051 (cited with approval in Goodyear). The duty of that insurer is to defend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>insured, not to minimize its own liability. Id. Any disputes about insurance coverage are to be resolved separately from the underlying tort claim to minimize undue inconvenience to the victim and to avoid the possibility that the victim\u2019s tort suit becomes \u201can unwieldy spectacle\u201d in which groups of insurers pursue disputes with each other. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 32} In light of <em>Goodyear </em>and <em>Keene, </em>Nationwide and Continental, as nontargeted insurers, had no right to participate in the litigation and defense of the DiStefano matter, so they could not have been prejudiced by Pennsylvania General\u2019s failure to notify them of the suit and allow their participation in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 33} Likewise, Pennsylvania General had no obligation to notify Nationwide and Continental of its potential equitable-contribution claim prior to settlement of the DiStefano matter. A cause of action for equitable contribution arises only after one under a legal duty has been compelled to pay more than his or her share of a common burden. 18 American Jurisprudence 2d (2004), Contribution, Section 9. Thus, Pennsylvania General was not required to seek contribution from Nationwide and Continental until the DiStefano claim was fully and finally resolved in November 2005. Nevertheless, Pennsylvania General did more than what was required to preserve and pursue its equitable-contribution claim. Within weeks after learning of Park-Ohio\u2019s other insurers, it notified Nationwide and Continental of its intention to seek contribution for monies paid to Park-Ohio in September 2004, more than a year before it made its final payment to Park-Ohio. We fail to discern any prejudice to Nationwide and Continental by this timely notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 34} Likewise, we are not persuaded by Nationwide and Continental\u2019s argument that Pennsylvania General is not entitled to contribution because it failed to insist on compliance with the notice, cooperation, and voluntary payment provisions of its policies. In short, Nationwide and Continental argue that it is not equitable to allow Pennsylvania General to impose its coverage, litigation, and settlement decisions on them as nonselected insurers. But, as already discussed, the all-sums approach anticipates this very result.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 35} Further, the stipulated facts in the record demonstrate that Pennsylvania General exercised or reserved all of its policy rights. When Pennsylvania General was presented with Park-Ohio\u2019s claim in late August 2002, the DiStefano matter was set for trial approximately six weeks later. Pennsylvania General immediately begin its investigation of the claim and sought information about its own alleged policies; the policies of other potential insurers of Park-Ohio; the viability of any defenses of Park-Ohio to the plaintiffs claim; the range of monetary exposure of Park-Ohio; the competence of underlying defense counsel for Park-Ohio; whether and, if so, to what extent coverage might be owed to Park-Ohio; and the viability of any possible defenses to coverage. To assist in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>its evaluation of the DiStefano claim of Park-Ohio, Pennsylvania General hired Henry Rome, an attorney experienced in asbestos matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">{\u00b6 36} As a result of its investigation, Pennsylvania General determined that Park-Ohio\u2019s underlying defense counsel were experienced and well respected; Park-Ohio did not have strong defenses to the DiStefano claim; Park-Ohio was the sole remaining viable defendant; the case presented a \u201cdangerous multimillion dollar exposure\u201d to Park-Ohio; and the $1 million settlement amount was in line with similar cases in the jurisdiction. In addition, Rome counseled Pennsylvania General that there was not a strong basis upon which to assert a late-notice defense. Pennsylvania General heeded its counsel\u2019s advice regarding the futility of pursuing a late-notice defense and challenging the amount of the settlement, although prior to its issuance of any payment to Park-Ohio, Pennsylvania General reserved all of its rights under its policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 37} The stipulated facts demonstrate that Pennsylvania General appropriately investigated, handled, and resolved the DiStefano claim in accordance with the terms and conditions of its policies. We find nothing to indicate that the fact or amount of the settlement would have been any different if Nationwide or Continental, with policies nearly identical to Pennsylvania General\u2019s, had been selected by Park-Ohio and presented with the DiStefano claim, as there simply were not any viable defenses to coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 38} Neither Nationwide nor Continental has asserted any exclusion that would preclude coverage under their policies to Park-Ohio. Both have conceded that their policies were triggered by the DiStefano claim and that the essential terms, conditions, and exclusions of the Nationwide, Continental, and Pennsylvania General policies are nearly identical. Therefore, the equities demand that Nationwide and Continental, as co-insurers who shared a common liability with Pennsylvania General and who lost no rights nor suffered any prejudice by resolution of the DiStefano claim, pay Pennsylvania General their respective pro rata shares of defense costs and indemnity paid by Pennsylvania General on behalf of Park-Ohio in the DiStefano matter. To rule otherwise would allow Nationwide and Continental to be unjustly enriched at the expense of Pennsylvania General.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 39} Public policy also demands this result. To allow the insured to unilaterally extinguish all potential sources of contribution renders illusory the right of contribution established in <em>Goodyear. </em>We do not believe that it was the intention of <em>Goodyear </em>to condition a targeted insurer\u2019s right to contribution on the action or inaction of the insured and leave the targeted insurer without recourse. Further, we do not want to discourage the prompt settlement of insurance claims. To hold that Pennsylvania General should not have made any payments to Park-Ohio unless and until all other potentially triggered insurers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>had been identified and notified of the DiStefano claim would discourage the prompt resolution of these claims by the insurers. In future cases, the targeted insurer would be reluctant to resolve the claim until all other potentially triggered insurers had been identified and notified about the claim. This would delay or prevent settlements that would otherwise occur, contrary to the intent of <em>Goodyear </em>and the all-sums approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 40} The Ohio Supreme Court requires insurers to be vigilant in recognizing and fulfilling their contractual obligations. See, e.g., <em>Landis v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 339, 695 N.E.2d 1140. Pennsylvania General did just that. It investigated, handled, and resolved the DiStefano claim in accordance with the terms and conditions of its policies, and, in compliance with <em>Goodyear, </em>paid the entirety of the claim and timely pursued its equitable contribution claim against the nonselected insurers. It should not be penalized for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 41} Because the trial court did not agree that Pennsylvania General was entitled to equitable contribution, it did not reach the issue of what share of the DiStefano claim should be assigned to Nationwide and Continental.
