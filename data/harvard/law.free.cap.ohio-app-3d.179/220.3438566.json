Angela contends that the trial court erred in overruling her motion without a hearing, because the judgment from which she sought relief was predicated exclusively upon her in-court agreement, and she had presented affidavits from herself and a treating psychiatrist to the effect that she had not been mentally competent to enter into the agreement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b6 2} Angela further contends that the trial court should have granted her motion for relief from judgment, but we conclude that it is premature to determine that issue, since the affidavits she presented did not compel findings in her favor on the issue presented, but merely compelled a hearing on that issue. Accordingly, the order overruling Angela\u2019s motion for relief from judgment is reversed, and this cause is remanded for a hearing on the motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">{\u00b6 3} K.K. was born in 2002, the daughter of Angela and Brian G., who were not married. Initially, custody of K.K. was awarded to Angela. A subsequent order, with the agreement of both parties, adjusted parenting time to provide for equal time with each parent. In 2006, the parties filed opposing motions, with Brian seeking custody. Various proceedings were held, and various provisions for temporary custody were made during the pendency of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">{\u00b6 4} Ultimately, a hearing was held before a magistrate on December 15, 2006. At that hearing, after the identities of the parties, counsel, and the guardian ad litem for the child were established, the following ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. All right. We\u2019re here today continued \u2014 today was \u2014 we were set for trial on this matter. It appears that the parties, however, have reached an agreement with regard to some issues, other issues we\u2019re going to set over for a status conference in June. And let me see if I can articulate what that is.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cIf the parties will listen carefully at this time. It is my understanding that the parties have agreed that at this time legal custody of the child will be granted to the father; that mother is to have visitation with the child to be supervised by any family member that is approved by the father as follows: The mother shall have lunch with the child at * * * School three times per week. Also, shall have visitation with the child every Wednesday evening from 5:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., and also on Sunday \u2014 every Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cOther visitation, overnight visitation, or anything above and beyond what I have just mentioned will be as agreed between the parties, and will also be supervised by \u2014 by one or more family members as approved by the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe matter will be set for a status conference on June 15th of 2007 at 9:00 a.m., at which time the Court will address any additional parenting time issues that have arisen, and also child support issues. Prior to that review, counsel for the mother is to provide a report from Doctor Waite concerning the mother\u2019s current mental health status, as well as any progress that she\u2019s made, and to provide that to the Court within twenty days prior to the status.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cMr. Gump [representing the mother], does that cover everything, as far as you can tell?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cMR. GUMP: It is, prior to the June 15th hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cTHE COURT: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cMR. GUMP: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And Mr. Swift?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cMR. SWIFT [representing the father]: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And Mr. Southern, is that consistent with your\u2014 in view of what is in the child\u2019s best interest at this time?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cMR. SOUTHERN [the guardian ad litem for the child]: Your Honor, at this time I do feel that this arrangement would be in the best interest of the child. However, I would encourage the parties to move towards an expansion of the mother\u2019s parenting time with the child, if at all possible, prior to that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-15\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe child is very well bonded to both parents. The child speaks highly of both parents. The child loves both parents. From my interaction with the parents, I believe both parents have genuine love and affection for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-16\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cUnderstanding the \u2014 understanding the situation that has led to the hearing today, I would not want to see the contact between the child and particularly the mother in this case to somehow erode or deteriorate their relationship. And as such, I would recommend \u2014 I would strongly encourage the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>parties to move towards an agreed expansion of said visitation as it is deemed fit, safe and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And the Court would certainly concur with that and encourage that, as well. That would be the direction that the Court would want \u2014 would certainly want to move in. So, as that \u2014 those opportunities present themselves, that\u2019s what should \u2014 should happen. And that\u2019s why the Court is ordering any additional visitation as agreed between the parties. And hopefully that will be something that happens.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cOkay. [Angela], if you could raise your right hand for me, please. Do you swear or affirm the testimony you are about to give be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[ANGELA]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And you\u2019ve heard what I have indicated that is the agreement of the parties. Is that your agreement, ma\u2019am?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c[ANGELA]: Yeah, I \u2014 I will have to probably ask questions again, but yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cMR. GUMP: Let me interrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cTHE COURT: Uh-huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cMR. GUMP: Are there things about what he said that you didn\u2019t understand? This is the information I got from you.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c[ANGELA]: I just want to know when I\u2019m supposed to get my report from Doctor Waite to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cMR. GUMP: Okay. What he said, the sooner the better, because what the Guardian is recommending and what everybody here wants is, because Doctor Hanna suggested in her report that your \u2014 your visitation would be supervised until we have a report that indicated stability by a mental health professional. So, the sooner you get the report, I\u2019ll get it to the Court, I\u2019ll get it to the Magistrate, I\u2019ll get it to the Guardian, I\u2019ll get it to the lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c[ANGELA]: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTHE COURT: From Doctor Charlotte \u2014 or Christina Waite.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-18\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[ANGELA]: Yeah, I just didn\u2019t understand the twenty day thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-19\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cMR. GUMP: He wanted me to make sure that the lawyer and the Guardian and the Court had a report from Doctor Waite twenty days prior to June 15th.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-20\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c[ANGELA]: Okay. But, it can be before then?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>{\u00b6 35} \u201cMR. GUMP: Sure. It would be like May the 20th, if you want to know approximately that date. It would be about the 20th of May. But, it would be any time before that. It\u2019s \u2014 unlike today, we just got this report from the Guardian, we just got the psych report from Doctor Hanna, because she messed up everybody\u2019s name and who the attorneys were. So, we didn\u2019t have time to review them long enough with each other before we came in here today.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c[ANGELA]: Okay. And my mom was never supposed to be on any visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b637} \u201cMR. GUMP: Well, you corrected that name. It should have been</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c[ANGELA]: That\u2019s not really her name, either. It\u2019s * * *, but my mom definitely shouldn\u2019t be on there.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cMR. GUMP: We\u2019ve changed that.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c[ANGELA]: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cMR. GUMP: And Brian knows that.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c[BRIAN]: Yes, I completely agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cMR. GUMP: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. [Angela], did you have anything \u2014 any other questions regarding \u2014 regarding this?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c[ANGELA]: Not right now, no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">{\u00b6 46} Whereupon, the magistrate swore in the father, Brian, established his agreement to the proposed order, and the proceedings were adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">{\u00b6 47} On January 9, 2007, an order was entered awarding legal custody of K.K. to her father, Brian, \u201c[b]y agreement of the parties, the recommendation of the Guardian Ad Litem, and the Court finding it to be in said child\u2019s best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">{\u00b6 48} On August 9, 2007, Angela filed a motion for relief from judgment under the authority of Civ.R. 60(B)(1) and (2), alleging that she \u201cdid not have the mental capacity to understand the events and actions that took place during the * * * December 15, 2006 hearing.\u201d She requested a hearing on her motion, and attached the affidavits of herself and of Christina G. Waite, M.D., her treating psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">{\u00b6 49} In her affidavit, Angela averred, among other things:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-19\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c3. I have little to no personal recollection of the facts, circumstances, actions, and events that took place before the Court on December 15, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>{\u00b6 51} \u201c4. As of December 15, 2006, I was receiving psychiatric treatment and evaluation, which included, adjusting medications prescribed to me by my primary care physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c5. If I had the capacity to understand the facts, circumstances, actions, and events, taken before the Court on December 15, 2006, I would not have consented to the grant of legal custody of [K.K.] to Brian [G.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 53} Dr. Waite\u2019s affidavit included the following averments:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c7. [Angela\u2019s] primary care physician prescribed Topamax (an anticonvulsant) and Seroquel (an atypical antipsychotic medication), both of which were prescribed to stabilize [Angela\u2019s] mood.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c8. Both Topamaz and Seroquel can contribute to severe cognitive difficulties including memory changes, language problems, and a dementia-like process.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c9. During Angelafs] * * * ongoing treatment with me, I regulated [her] withdrawal from Topamax and Seroquel based upon my hypothesis that those medications contributed to and/or were the cause of [her] cognitive disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c10. As I took [Angela] off of Topomax and Seroquel, her cognitive disorder reversed rather dramatically. Additionally, [Angela\u2019s] condition actually improved radically without medications, and then further improved with appropriate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c11. It is my professional opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that Angela * * * suffers from attention deficit disorder and post traumatic stress disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c12. It is my professional opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that Angela[\u2019s] * * * cognitive disorder was the result of her treatment with Topamax and Seroquel.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c13. It is my professional opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that Angela * * * was mentally incompetent during the times she was experiencing the cognitive disorder, including December 15, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c14. It is my professional opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that Angela * * * did not possess the mental capacity to understand the facts, circumstances, events, and actions taken during the December 15, 2006 Court hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">{\u00b6 62} Dr. Waite\u2019s affidavit referred to, and attached, a letter from her opining that Angela\u2019s recovery from the cognitive difficulties induced by inappropriate medications had proceeded to the point that by the beginning of the school year 2007 she was able to parent her child appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>{\u00b6 63} The magistrate issued a decision denying Angela\u2019s motion for relief from judgment, without first holding a hearing. Angela objected, but her objection was overruled, and the trial court adopted the decision as its order. Angela appeals from the order denying her motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 64} Angela\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying [Angela\u2019s] motion for relief from judgment without a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 66} A judgment may be predicated upon the agreement of the parties, but an agreed judgment depends, for its efficacy, upon the capacity of the parties to enter into the agreement. <em>Sovak v. Spivey, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 479, 2003-Ohio-6717, 801 N.E.2d 896, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">{\u00b6 67} The issue whether a party was competent at the time of entering into an agreed entry may be raised by a motion for relief from judgment. <em>Bretzfelder v. Bretzfelder, </em>Summit App. No. 23674, 2008-Ohio-2669, 2008 WL 2267039, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">{\u00b6 68} The affidavits of Angela and her treating psychiatrist, Dr. Waite, raised the issue whether Angela was competent when she entered into the agreement regarding K.K.\u2019s custody and visitation, upon which the court\u2019s order depended.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">{\u00b6 69} Brian contends that Angela has failed to establish that she has a meritorious defense or claim to present if relief is granted, normally a requirement for a relief under Civ.R. 60(B). It is questionable whether this requirement applies to issues involving child custody and visitation, which are analyzed not in terms of claims and defenses of the parents, but in terms of the best interests of the child. In any event, we are satisfied that Angela has demonstrated a potentially meritorious position on the issue of child custody and visitation, based upon Dr. Waite\u2019s report that Angela\u2019s cognitive difficulties, which seem to have been the basis for Brian\u2019s motion, had abated by early 2007 to the extent that she would have had no difficulty in parenting K.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">{\u00b6 70} Angela\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained. The trial court should have held a hearing on the issue whether Angela was competent to have entered into the in-court agreement concerning custody and visitation that served as the basis for the order of January 9, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">{\u00b6 71} Angela\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>{\u00b6 72} \u201cThe trial court committed an abuse of discretion when it denied [Angela\u2019s] motion for relief from judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">{\u00b6 73} In this assignment of error, Angela appears to be arguing not merely that she should have had a hearing on her motion for relief from judgment, but that the trial court should have granted her motion, even without a hearing. We conclude that it would have been premature for the trial court to have granted the motion without a hearing. Although the trial court was presented with affidavits from Angela and her treating psychiatrist to the effect that she was incompetent to have entered into the in-court agreement, it was not required to accept those averments as true. At a hearing, after cross-examination, and any rebuttal evidence, the trial court may determine whether Angela was, in fact, incompetent when she entered into the in-court agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 74} Angela\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">. {\u00b6 75} Angela\u2019s first assignment of error having been sustained, and her second assignment of error having been overruled, the order of the trial court from which this appeal is taken is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, which should include a hearing on Angela\u2019s motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b265-9\">Wolff, P.J., and Walters, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b265-10\">Sumner E.
