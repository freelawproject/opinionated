Pimental and United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF&amp;G), appeal from the judgment of the trial court granting the defendants\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motion for summary judgment in this negligence case. On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly applied Connecticut law, which does not permit an injured employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier to bring a direct action to assert its subrogation rights, when it should have applied the law of Massachusetts, which would support such an action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are necessary for the disposition of this appeal. On August 30, 1990, Pimental sustained physical injuries when a sewer repair device<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> exploded during the course of his employment at a sewer repair project in the town of Groton. At the time of the explosion, Pimental, a resident of Massachusetts, was employed by Middlesex Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation having its principal place of business in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Pimental applied for workers\u2019 compensation benefits in Massachusetts and was paid in accordance with the provisions of the Massachusetts workers\u2019 compensation laws. Pimental, USF&amp;G<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Middlesex Corporation sued Cherne Industries, Inc.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the town of Groton, Groton\u2019s employee Anthony Nenna, and Miller Contracting Corporation (Miller), which was a subcontractor on the project. Middlesex Corporation subsequently withdrew its claims and Miller\u2019s motion for summary judgment was successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Pimental\u2019s claim against Cherne Industries, Inc., sounds in product liability. Pimental\u2019s claims against Nenna and Groton, however, are based on Nenna\u2019s alleged negligence and, therefore, the vicarious liability of Groton as Nenna\u2019s employer. USF&amp;G\u2019s claim against Groton and Nenna asserts subrogation rights that arose pursuant to Massachusetts law. Groton and Nenna subsequently moved for summary judgment against USF&amp;G only. These two defendants claimed that under Connecticut law, USF&amp;G had no right to bring a direct action to assert its subrogation or lien rights. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>court, applying Connecticut law, granted Nenna and Groton\u2019s motion for summary judgment against USF&amp;G. The trial court concluded that USF&amp;G had no right under Connecticut law to maintain its action against Nenna and Groton. Pimental and USF&amp;G now appeal from the decision of the trial court granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The proper choice of law rules that apply in determining whether the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment are those traditionally applied to workers\u2019 compensation conflicts cases. Our Supreme Court has set forth the applicable analysis in <em>Simaitis </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>182 Conn. 24, 437 A.2d 828 (1980), and, accordingly, we follow its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u201cIn <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Washington Gas Light Co., </em>448 U.S. 261, 100 S. Ct. 2647, 65 L. Ed. 2d 757 (1980), the United States Supreme Court adhered to an interests analysis approach to determine whether the District of Columbia could award supplemental benefits to an employee who had already received compensation in the state of Virginia without violating the full faith and credit clause of the United States constitution. The employee was a resident of the District and was hired by a company in the District. Although he worked primarily in the District of Columbia, he also worked in Virginia where he was injured. Virginia law excluded any other remedy \u2018at common law or otherwise\u2019 on account of the injury in Virginia. The court held that \u2018a State has no legitimate interest within the context of our federal system in preventing another State from granting a supplemental compensation award when that second State would have had the power to apply its workmen\u2019s compensation law in the first instance. The Full Faith and Credit Clause should not be construed to preclude successive workmen\u2019s compensation awards.\u2019 Id., 286.\u201d <em>Simaitis </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>In the present case, Pimental received workers\u2019 compensation under Massachusetts law. Massachusetts\u2019 interest in compensating the injured employee, a Massachusetts resident, to the fullest extent possible is clear and legitimate. Massachusetts\u2019 other articulable interest lies in permitting Pimentai\u2019s employer, a Massachusetts corporation, to recover from the defendants the amount of compensation already paid or to be paid in the future under Massachusetts law. Connecticut\u2019s interest in limiting the liability of employers doing business in Connecticut \u201cis not of controlling importance\u201d; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Washington Gas Light Co., </em>supra, 448 U.S. 280; particularly on the facts of this case. Just as Virginia had no legitimate interest in preventing the District of Columbia from awarding relief supplemental to that awarded in Virginia, Connecticut has no legitimate interest in preventing Massachusetts from providing employers with a right of action for damages against a third party, where both the employee and the employer are residents of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Just as our Supreme Court did in <em>Simaitis </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 24, we, too, look beyond an interest analysis and examine the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws and Professor Larson\u2019s treatise on workers\u2019 compensation; 1 Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws \u00a7 181 (1971); 4 A. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1997) \u00a7 87.40, pp. 16-84 through 16-95; which suggest approaches that lead to the same result. \u201cThe Restatement provides that: \u2018A State of the United States may consistently with the requirements of due process award relief [not merely compensation] to a person under its workmen\u2019s compensation statute, if (a) the person is injured in the State, or (b) the employment is principally located in the State, or (c) the employer supervised the employee\u2019s activities from a place of business in the State, or (d) the State is that of most significant relationship to the contract of employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>with respect to the issue of workmen\u2019s compensation under the rules of \u00a7\u00a7 187-188 and 196, or (e) the parties have agreed in the contract of employment or otherwise that their rights should be determined under the workmen\u2019s compensation act of the State, or (f) the State has some other reasonable relationship to the occurrence, the parties and the employment.\u2019 Restatement (Second), 1 Conflict of Laws 181.\u201d <em>Simaitis </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>supra, 33. On the facts of this case, the right of action provided by Massachusetts law is clearly available to the plaintiffs under (b), (c) or (d) of the Restatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Further, \u201c[according to Professor Larson, the applicable law in a workers\u2019 compensation case is the law of the place of the employment relation, because \u2018the existence of the employer-employee relation within the state gives the state an interest in controlling the incidents of that relation, one of which incidents is the right to receive and the obligation to pay compensation.\u2019 4 Larson, supra, \u00a7 87.40, p. 16-84.\u201d <em>Simaitis </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 34. Here, it is clear that the employment relation exists in Massachusetts, not in Connecticut. Although there are various widely accepted approaches, each one compels the conclusion that the trial court should have applied Massachusetts law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The defendants and the trial court, however, rely on <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 181, 588 A.2d 194 (1991), for the proposition that the law of Connecticut should have been applied in this case. This reliance is misplaced. <em>Cleveland </em>addressed the issue of whether an injured employee can receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits in Connecticut. Id., 192. <em>Cleveland </em>does not address the choice of law to be applied to workers\u2019 compensation issues in the context of third party tort actions, which is the issue in this appeal. <em>Simaitis, </em>however, does address these issues and is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>In sum, we conclude that the trial court should have applied the law of Massachusetts in this case, and since Massachusetts law specifically provides for a direct action by the workers\u2019 compensation carrier against a tortfeasor, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws c. 152, \u00a7 15 (1986), the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the motion for summary judgment and for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-10\"> There are three remaining defendants in this case: Anthony Nenna, the town of Groton and Cheme Industries, Inc. The plaintiffs are appealing from the trial court\u2019s judgment rendered on the granting of a motion for summary judgment filed by only two of the defendants, Nenna and Groton.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-11\"> Mass.
