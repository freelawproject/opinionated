The defendants contend that the trial court improperly failed to consider the issue of damages, after concluding that the plaintiffs mechanic\u2019s lien was invalid, because of a mistaken belief that a finding of bad faith was required before damages could be awarded. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">The record discloses the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff, a building contractor, sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien on the defendants\u2019 property in Avon and alleged that the defendants failed to pay the balance due pursuant to a construction contract between the parties. In their counterclaim, the defendants asserted that the plaintiff breached the contract by both overcharging the defendants and substantially failing to perform specified work under the contract. The trial court bifurcated the mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure from the breach of contract portion of the case. After determining that the plaintiff executed a valid mechanic\u2019s lien waiver and dismissing the plaintiffs claim that the defendants had procured such lien waiver fraudulently, the trial court, with amended pleadings, addressed the remaining contract dispute between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The trial court found that the contract, which contained no date for completion, was subject to various modifications at the defendants\u2019 direction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs performance under the contract was \u201cat all times in conformance with the design and direction of the defendants.\u201d Additionally, the court found that \u201c[u]nder the circumstances in this case, the plaintiff had just cause to believe the lien waiver was invalid.\u201d Accordingly, the court found for the plaintiff on its contract claim and awarded the plaintiff damages and counsel fees. The court did not award any damages to the defendants for the plaintiffs filing of an invalid mechanic\u2019s lien. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The defendants claim that the trial court improperly failed to consider the issue of damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-51.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>We recognize that the defendants are not claiming on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in not awarding damages pursuant to \u00a7 49-51. Rather, the defendants claim that the trial court never addressed the issue of damages at all. We must first construe the language of \u00a7 49-51 in order to address this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 49-51 (a) provides that a court <em>\u201cmay </em>award the plaintiff damages for the failure of the defendant to make discharge [of a lien] upon request. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is well established that \u201c[i]f . . . language ... is clear and unambiguous, we will interpret it in accordance with its plain meaning absent a compelling reason to the contrary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Angell, </em>237 Conn. 321, 327, 677 A.2d 912 (1996). Clearly, the legislature\u2019s inclusion in the statute of the word \u201cmay,\u201d as opposed to \u201cshall,\u201d indicates a discretionary power to award damages. Additionally, \u00a7 49-51 (a) provides that \u201c[i]f the court is of the opinion that such certificate of lien was filed without just cause, it <em>may </em>allow, <em>in its discretion, </em>damages to any person aggrieved . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Again, the plain language of the statute is clear. The language of the statute does not indicate that a finding of bad faith is required for an award of damages. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that \u201c[u]nder the circumstances in this case, the plaintiff had just cause to believe the hen waiver was invalid.\u201d We do not interpret that statement to mean that the court believed that it could not award damages without also finding that the mechanic\u2019s hen was filed in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The defendants assert in their brief that an issue of \u201cjust cause\u201d would \u201cin most cases\u201d require a party in the defendants\u2019 position to \u201cprove bad faith or malice.\u201d They cite to no authority to support this proposition. We conclude that in finding that \u201cthe plaintiff had just cause to believe the lien waiver was invalid,\u201d the trial court properly adhered to the plain language of \u00a7 49-51.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In considering the issue of whether a trial court properly reached and considered the damages issue within the context of \u00a7 49-51, our Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s statement[s] must be construed in the context of its opinion in its entirety, including its rejection of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.\u201d <em>Woronecki </em>v. <em>Trappe, </em>228 Conn. 574, 581, 637 A.2d 783 (1994). Here, the gravamen of the defendants\u2019 appeal is that, because the defendants were not awarded damages after the court found that the lien was invalid, the court could not have considered the damages issue. Our review of the record convinces us that the trial court did, in the proper exercise of its discretion, consider and reject the defendants\u2019 claim for damages. The trial court did not find that the invalid mechanic\u2019s lien caused the defendants\u2019 damage but, in fact, found that the defendants were not damaged at all by any acts of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Specifically, the trial court observed that \u201c[t]he contract contained no date for completion, therefore the court must consider whether under the facts and circumstances in this case time was of the essence. . . . The court expressly finds that time was not of the essence under the contract. The defendants never expressly complained to the plaintiff of the delays and, in fact, up to the time that the defendants discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the plaintiff, the defendants led the plaintiff to believe that the plaintiff could resume work in late winter. . . .\u201d Additionally, the court expressly found that \u201cthe excessive carrying costs being incurred by the defendants are not attributable to the plaintiff, but are the defendants\u2019 own choice. The defendants never put [their] Avon house on the market and the fact that [they have] greatly increased [their] cost is the product of market forces and conditions and the personal preference of the defendants.\u201d We conclude that the trial court did both reach and consider the issue of damages in permissibly exercising its discretion pursuant to \u00a7 49-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We also note that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award damages to the defendants. It is well settled in this state that appellate \u201creview of the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion is limited to questions of whether the court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have concluded as it did. . . . Every reasonable presumption will be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . It is only when an abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done that a reversal will result from the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasky, </em>43 Conn. App. 619, 635, 685 A.2d 336 (1996), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 959, 688 A.2d 328 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\"> Such modifications, all of which were drafted by the defendant Robert Galiette, were due to soil conditions, site relocation, and various design changes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-51 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person having an interest in any real or personal property described in any certificate of lien, which lien is invalid but not discharged of record, may give written notice to the lienor ... to discharge the lien. ...
