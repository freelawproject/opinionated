(defendant), appeals from the decision of the compensation review board (board) reversing the finding of the commissioner. The defendant claims that the board improperly refused to order transfer of a claim to the second injury fund. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The following facts are undisputed. The plaintiff, Donald Hall, suffered a compensable back injury on October 11, 1991. The defendant, which was uninsured on the date of injury, paid 104 weeks of benefits and notified the second injury fund of its intent to transfer liability pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-349.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fund acknowledged timely receipt of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>notice, but refused to accept a transfer of liability, claiming that the defendant\u2019s failure to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance on the date of injury deprived it of the benefit of transfer. On April 27, 1994, a hearing was held before the commissioner who found that there is no statutory impediment to transfer liability to the fund in this instance. The fund appealed to the board which reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision and held that the defendant\u2019s failure to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance on the date of injury deprived it of the benefit of transfer. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The issue raised in this appeal has been ruled on by the board in a case of first impression, <em>Champlain </em>v. <em>Parnes, </em>14 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 113 (1995). In <em>Champlain, </em>the employer paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to a previously injured employee and provided timely notice to the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-349, but was not insured for workers\u2019 compensation on the date of the second injury and, thus, was not in compliance with either General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-284 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-354.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issue was whether the second injury fund was liable for payment of a second injury pursuant to \u00a7 31-349 where the employer was uninsured for workers\u2019 compensation purposes at the time the second injury occurred. The board, after examining the statutes involved, concluded that the legislature intended to compel employers to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance or to self-insure. Accordingly, the board held that \u201cwhen an employer is uninsured at the time of a second injury, the employer does not acquire the complete relief afforded under'\u00a731-349 . . . .\u201d Id., 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Upon our review of <em>Champlain </em>and the board\u2019s decision in this case, we conclude that the board properly denied the defendant\u2019s attempted transfer of liability to the fund when it was uninsured at the time of the plaintiffs injury. We accord great deference to the construction given to \u00a7\u00a7 31-349, 31-284 and 31-355 by the board because it is charged with their enforcement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>See <em>Borent </em>v. <em>State, </em>33 Conn. App. 495, 499, 636 A.2d 392 (1994). In addition, we agree with the board that the legislature intended to compel employers to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance or to self-insure. To allow uninsured employers to take advantage of \u00a7 31-349 would weaken employers\u2019 incentive to obtain the required insurance. Moreover, it would provide a windfall to employers operating outside the system who would seek the benefit of the fund without obtaining insurance or a certificate of insurance pursuant to \u00a7 31-284 and without paying their assessments into the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-354. We conclude that the board properly reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision and denied transfer of liability to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The decision of the compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-349 provides in relevant part: \u201cCompensation for second disability. Payment for insurance coverage, (a) The fact that an employee has suffered previous disability, or received compensation therefor, shall not preclude him from compensation for a later injury, nor preclude compensation for death resulting therefrom. If an employee who has previously incurred, by accidental injury, disease or congenital causes, total or partial loss of, or loss of use of, one hand, one arm, one foot or one eye, or who has other permanent physical impairment, incurs a second disability by accident or disease arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in a permanent disability caused by both conditions which is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive compensation for the entire amount of disability, including total disability, less any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability, and necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>medical care, as elsewhere provided in this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that part of such disability was due to prior accidental injury, disease or congenital causes. The employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the injury, or his insurance carrier, shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first one hundred four weeks of disability. As a condition precedent to the liability of the second injury fund, the employer or his insurance carrier shall, ninety days prior to the expiration of the one-hundred-four-week period, notify the custodian of the second injury fund of the pending case and shall furnish to said custodian a copy of the agreement or award .... Thereafter all responsibility for compensation and medical treatment shall be with the custodian of the second injury fund. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-284 provides in relevant part: \u201cBasic rights and liabilities.
