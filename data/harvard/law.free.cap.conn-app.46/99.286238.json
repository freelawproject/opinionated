J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADq\">This case arose when the plaintiff, United Services Automobile Association (USAA), sought a declaratory judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that, under its contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>of homeowners insurance with the defendant Bonita L. C. Marburg, it had no duty either to defend or to indemnity Marburg for any judgment rendered against her in a lawsuit brought by a child and his mother, who are also defendants in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The child and his mother instituted an action against Marburg in August, 1993, alleging that in 1991, when the child was eleven and twelve years old, Marburg had sexually abused him on at least seventy-three occasions during tutoring sessions. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Stratford school system had referred the child to Marburg for such tutoiing. The child and his mother claimed that, as a result of the sexual abuse, which involved intercourse, sodomy and fellatio, the child suffered serious psychological and emotional injury. He and his mother also incurred substantial expenses for medical and psychological care as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Counts one, three and five of the amended complaint of the child and his mother against Marburg contained allegations by the child of sexual misconduct, sounding, respectively, in assault and battery, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Counts two, four and six mirrored one, three and five, but were brought by the child\u2019s mother and sought damages for expenses incurred. Count seven asked for punitive damages because of the egregious and unconscionable nature of the sexual misconduct. The eighth count alleged a fraudulent transfer of assets to Marburg\u2019s husband, John Marburg, also named as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">On November 28, 1995, the child and his mother filed a substitute complaint against Marburg. Although alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ing the same sexual misconduct, it eliminated counts one, two, seven and eight, leaving only the counts alleging negligent misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Within two weeks of filing the substitute complaint, the child and his mother and Marburg stipulated to judgment for the child and his mother. They also drafted a separate written covenant, in which the child and his mother agreed that if Marburg gave full cooperation to the child and his mother in both cases, the child and his mother would not seek to satisfy any judgment rendered against Marburg from any real, personal or other property owned by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">At the time of the alleged events, Marburg and her husband were the named insureds under a homeowners insurance policy issued by USAA. Although the policy provided coverage for \u201cdamages because of bodily injury or property damage,\u201d it excluded coverage for damages resulting from \u201cbodily injury . . . which is expected or intended by the insured [or] arising out of or in connection with a business engaged in by an insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">USAA sought summary judgment on the portion of its declaratory judgment claim in which it sought a declaration that it owed no duty to indemnify Marburg against the claims of the child and his mother.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It argued that no material issue of fact existed as to whether all of the damages of the child and his mother fell within the \u201cexpected-or-intended-injury\u201d exclusion and the \u201cbusiness-pursuits\u201d exclusion, and, thus, the damages would be excluded from coverage as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The child and his mother opposed the motion, stating that there were material issues of fact regarding Mar-burg\u2019s intent to harm the child and regarding the business pursuits exception. Specifically, they alleged that Marburg suffered from a mental disease or defect that prevented her from forming an intent to cause the child harm, and that at least some of Marburg\u2019s sexual misconduct did not occur during her tutoring sessions with the child. The plaintiff claims that there is no coverage because Marburg\u2019s acts were intentional and because the damages did arise out of or in connection with business pursuits. The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The standard of review for summary judgment is well established. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 384 mandates that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A material fact is a fact that will make a difference in the result of the case. . . . The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law . . . and the party opposing such a motion must provide an evi-dentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. . . . In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fernandez </em>v. <em>Standard Fire Ins. Co., </em>44 Conn. App. 220, 222, 688 A.2d 349 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Many cases from other jurisdictions have held, under a doctrine of presumption of intent, that acts of sexual molestation of minors are so heinous that intent to cause harm is presumed as a matter of law. See annot., 31 A.L.R.4th 957, \u00a7 5 (b) (1984). The trial court in this case limited the doctrine of presumption of intent to cause harm to minors to situations where the actor is aware of the minority of the victim. The court specifically found that Marburg possessed the requisite intent because Marburg was aware of the child\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The court reasoned that Marburg is presumed to know the law, and, therefore, she knew that the sexual acts were in violation of the criminal laws that prohibit such activities with minors. This presumption supports the conclusion that when Marburg engaged in the misconduct with knowledge of the victim\u2019s age, she intended to cause her victim injury, as a matter of law. The defendants claim that the presumption is rebutta-ble, and that they have sufficiently raised an issue of fact that could rebut the presumption that Marburg intended to cause harm. Marburg claims that she suffered from a mental illness that made her incapable of forming such intent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">An insured\u2019s conduct can be considered unintentional in situations such as those here only if the insured can produce evidence to show that she did not intend to cause the damage. See <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 205-206, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995). If the insured cannot show that her behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>was unintentional, the presumption of intent remains intact, and the exclusion of the homeowners policy precludes coverage. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u201cIt is axiomatic, in the tort lexicon, that intentional conduct and negligent conduct, although differing only by a matter of degree; <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 103, 491 A.2d 368 (1985); are separate and mutually exclusive. \u2018The distinction between intentional and unintentional invasions draws a bright line of separation among shadings of almost infinitely varied human experiences.\u2019 W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) p. 33. Although in a given case there may be doubt about whether one acted intentionally or negligently, the difference in meaning is clear. \u2018As Holmes observed, even a dog knows the difference between being tripped over and being kicked.\u2019 Id.\u201d <em>American National Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schuss, </em>221 Conn. 768, 775-76, 607 A.2d 418 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201cIn its most common usage, \u2018intent\u2019 involves \u2018(1) . . . a <em>state of mind </em>(2) about <em>consequences </em>of an act (or omission) and not about the act itself, and (3) it extends not only to having in the mind a purpose (or desire) to bring about given consequences but also to having in mind a belief (or knowledge) that given consequences are substantially certain to result from the act.\u2019 . . . [W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, p. 34.] Also, the intentional state of mind must exist when the act occurs. Id. Thus, intentional conduct \u2018extends not only to those consequences which are desired, but also to those which the actor believes are substantially certain to follow from what the actor does.\u2019 Id., p. 35. Furthermore, \u2018[i]t is not essential that the precise injury which was done be the one intended.\u2019 <em>Alteiri </em>v. <em>Colasso, </em>168 Conn. 329, 334, 362 A.2d 798 (1975). \u2018Rather, it is an intent to bring about a result which will invade the interests of another in a way that the law forbids.\u2019 W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, p. 36. Our case law accords <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>with these principles. See, e.g., <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra [196 Conn. 103]; <em>Alteiri </em>v. <em>Colasso, </em>supra [334].\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>American National Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schuss, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The defendants rely on the case of <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>35 Conn. App. 94, 644 A.2d 933 (1994), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 235 Conn. 185, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to support their claim that Marburg\u2019s mental disorder prevented her from controlling her actions and, therefore, made her incapable of forming an intent to injure. In <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>we held that in order to determine whether an insured\u2019s acts were intentional for purposes of a policy\u2019s intentional act exclusion clause, we must consider \u201cwhether, because of mental illness or defect, the insured did not understand the nature or wrongfulness of [her] conduct, or was deprived of the capacity to control [her] actions regardless of [her] understanding of the nature or wrongfulness of [her] action.\u201d Id., 106-107;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> see <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Wicka, </em>474 N.W.2d 324, 331 (Minn. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We now examine whether the defendants have produced any evidence to show that Marburg did not intend to cause harm. If they have produced any such evidence, a material issue of fact would be in dispute, but, if they have not, no material issue would be in dispute, and the defendants would be entitled to summary judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>In support of their opposition to the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, the defendants attached an affidavit of Irene R. Kitzman, Marburg\u2019s treating psychiatric physician (Kitzman affidavit), and a letter, dated October 27, 1995, from Ronald T. Markby, a physician, to one of Marburg\u2019s attorneys, Ralph L. Palmesi (Markby letter). We agree with the trial court that neither the Markby letter nor the Kitzman affidavit supports a finding of lack of intent of Marburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The Markby letter is not competent evidence to support an opposition to a motion for summary judgment. See Practice Book \u00a7 380;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> see also <em>Scinto </em>v. <em>Stamm, </em>224 Conn. 524, 533, 620 A.2d 99, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 861, 114 S. Ct. 176, 126 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1993) (stating \u201c[u]nswom assertions of fact, summary conclusions of law and unsupported allegations in an affidavit do not entitle a party to summary judgment\u201d); <em>Bartha </em>v. <em>Waterbury House Wrecking Co., </em>190 Conn. 8, 12, 459 A.2d 115 (1983); <em>2830 Whitney Avenue </em>v. <em>Heritage Canal Development Associates, </em>33 Conn. App. 563, 567, 636 A.2d 1377 (1994) (\u201c[t]he existence of the genuine issue of material fact must be demonstrated by counteraffidavits and concrete evidence\u201d). Practice Book \u00a7 380, although containing the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d contemplates that supporting documents to a motion for summary judgment be made under oath or be otherwise reliable. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 380 through 382 set forth detailed requirements to ensure that affidavits in support of summary judgment are proper. Those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>rules would be meaningless if they could be circumvented by filing unsworn letters written to an attorney for a party in support of or in opposition to summary judgment. The trial court acted properly when it did not consider the Markby letter in support of the defendants\u2019 position on the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The defendants\u2019 only other support of their opposition to summary judgment is the Kitzman affidavit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the trial court stated, \u201cKitzman\u2019s affidavit, though providing a definite diagnosis of Marburg\u2019s psychiatric condition in the relevant time frame, states no facts or opinions from which it might reasonably be inferred that because of that condition, Marburg was incapable of controlling her conduct toward [the child] or of forming an intent to cause him injury. On that score, it offers no functional description of major depressive disorder without melancholia; it does not state why Marburg was diagnosed as suffering therefrom; it makes no mention of any symptoms or results of the disorder experienced by Marburg in the course of her treatment; and it otherwise fails to give any reason for believing that the disorder, either typically or as suffered by Marburg, involves or causes behavior control problems of the sort here claimed by the defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>What the affidavit says about Marburg\u2019s sexual proclivities is that Marburg knew she had a problem predisposing her to impulsive sexual promiscuity but did not inform her physician of her involvement with the child. Those statements are important both for what they state and what they do not state. The statements reveal that Marburg was never treated by Kitzman for a psychiatric problem involving sexual attraction to young boys, such as the child involved here, because she never told Kitz-man about her sexual involvement with him. A logical assumption is that the psychiatric problem with which Marburg was diagnosed, major depressive disorder without melancholia, does not typically involve such sexual problems, or else Kitzman would have treated her for such a problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The affidavit also does not state, to a reasonable or to any degree of medical probability, that Marburg actually suffered from a problem involving sexual attraction to young boys. In fact, the one statement in the affidavit that seems to support that proposition, that Marburg knew that she had a problem predisposing her to impulsive sexual promiscuity, is not a diagnosis based on a reasonable medical probability but, rather, is hearsay. Finally, we agree with the trial court that even if \u201cKitzman\u2019s hearsay statement as to Marburg\u2019s self-described predisposition to impulsive sexual promiscuity could properly be considered on this summary judgment motion, it would not support an inference that that predisposition, if indeed she had one, made her incapable, because of mental illness, of controlling her actions or of forming an intent. That a person is predisposed to engage impulsively in particular conduct by no means suggests that she has lost the ability to prevent herself from engaging in that conduct.\u201d Any such predisposition, even if treatable by Kitzman had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>she been told about it, does not necessarily have anything to do with Marburg\u2019s alleged inability to form an intent to harm the child. This hearsay statement is substantively lacking to prove Marburg\u2019s capacity to control her actions or to prove an inability to intend to cause injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The defendants did not sustain their burden of providing an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact existed. They claim that it is not their burden to demonstrate the existence of an issue of material fact but, rather, the plaintiffs burden to show the lack of one. \u201cAlthough the party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact ... a party opposing summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue. ... It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact . . . are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court [in support of a motion for summary judgment]. . . . <em>Water &amp; Way Properties </em>v. <em>Colt\u2019s Mfg. Co., </em>230 Conn. 660, 664-65, 646 A.2d 143 (1994). Only evidence that would be admissible at trial may be used to support or oppose a motion for summary judgment. See Practice Book \u00a7 381.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 235 Conn. 202-203 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">USAA was entitled to rely on the doctrine of presumption of intent to show that Marburg intended to injure the child when she engaged in sexual acts with him, knowing that he was twelve years old or younger. Without a countervailing demonstration by the insured sufficient to rebut the presumption and to put a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>fact in issue, Marburg\u2019s acts were within the intentional act exclusion of her USAA policy. Summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In this opinion LANDAU, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\"> Although this is an action for declaratory judgment in which notice was not given to anyone other than the named parties; see <em>Serrani </em>v. <em>Board of Ethics, </em>225 Conn. 305, 622 A.2d 1009 (1993); we conclude that all parties having an interest in this case are parties, and that, therefore, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>jurisdictional obstacle to deciding this appeal. See <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 228, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L.

No party has briefed the exclusion from coverage based on a business exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\"> A presumption of law is one that arises from the force of the law of the jurisdiction and is founded on public policy, social convenience or safety.

I agree with the majority in affirming the summary judgment of the trial court declaring that the insurance policy issued by the plaintiff to the defendant Bonita L. C. Marburg does not apply to the claims against Marburg arising out of her sexual relationship with the defendant minor child. In this case, however, there is no need to decide whether this court should join those jurisdictions that have adopted the presumption that sexual molestation of a minor child raises a presumption of intent to harm the child as a matter of law and, therefore, falls within the policy exclusion of liability for damages resulting from the intentional conduct of an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The affidavits of the child and his mother supporting the motion for summary judgment, which have not been controverted, narrate the circumstances of the relationship between the child and Marburg. The facts recited in those documents plainly indicate that Marburg realized that the child had not reached the age necessary for consent to sexual intercourse. I agree with the majority that the two counteraffidavits filed in behalf of the defendants are insufficient to raise an issue of fact with respect to the mental condition of Marburg that would affect the conclusion to be drawn from the affidavits of the mother and the child that her conduct was intentional.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
