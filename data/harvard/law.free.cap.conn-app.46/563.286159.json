(TLA). On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the trial court\u2019s rejection of its claim that the commission lacked discretion to approve TLA\u2019s special exception application because TLA did not post a proper sign providing public notice of its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">TLA applied to the commission for a special exception to construct a solid waste transfer station and leaf composting facility on the real property it owns in Tor-rington. TLA\u2019s land abuts property owned by CRRA. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>public hearing and site visit was conducted concerning TLA\u2019s application, and the commission subsequently approved TLA\u2019s application for special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">CRRA appealed to the Superior Court, raising four separate issues concerning the commission\u2019s decision: TLA improperly posted a sign that was to provide public notice of its special exception application; TLA\u2019s proposed facility constituted an impermissible flag lot; TLA\u2019s proposed facility would hamper Torrington\u2019s traffic circulation; and leaf composting was not allowed in said area. The trial court sustained CRRA\u2019s appeal on the ground that the TLA parcel was a flag lot and that Torrington\u2019s regulations do not provide for the use of a flag lot in an industrial zone. TLA and the commission filed petitions for certification to appeal to this court, which were subsequently granted. CRRA\u2019s petition for certification to appeal on the ground that the trial court incorrectly decided the sign posting issue was also granted by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 4000 provides that \u201c[a]n aggrieved party may appeal from a final judgment, except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d The test for demonstrating aggrievement is well settled: \u201cFirst, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Winchester Woods Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 303, 307, 592 A.2d 953 (1991). \u201cMere status as a party or a participant in the proceedings below does not in and of itself constitute aggrievement for the purposes of appellate review.\u201d <em>Windham Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>234 Conn. 513, 523, 662 A.2d 1281 (1995).'</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>We conclude that CRRA is not aggrieved because it prevailed at trial and has not otherwise indicated how its interests were affected by the decision. The plaintiff does not have standing and we do not have jurisdiction to consider the issues raised in their appeal. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In this opinion FOTI, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b588-7\">HEIMAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlW\">concurring. While I agree that the appeal in this case must be dismissed, it appears to me that it should more properly be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted, since we were without jurisdiction to entertain this appeal in the first instance. See <em>Winchester Woods Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 303, 307, 592 A.2d 953 (1991), citing <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 65, 475 A.2d 283 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal on the ground that we improvidently granted certification. See <em>Sabel-lico </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>24 Conn. App. 809, 584 A.2d 488 (1991).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
