They appeal, challengingthe trial court\u2019s denial of their motion to suppress evidence seized during execution of a search warrant, contending that the warrant was not supported by probable cause and that the plain view exception to the warrant requirement did not apply. Sandy Evans also challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for judgment of acquittal, contending that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Without further discussion, we reject defendants\u2019 arguments regarding the ruling on their motion to suppress evidence. We therefore affirm Walter Evans\u2019s convictions. However, we agree that the evidence is insufficient to support Sandy Evans\u2019s convictions, and we reverse that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">On March 24, 1997, authorities searched the residence at 4011 Barview Boulevard, Coos Bay, Oregon, pursuant to a search warrant that named Walter Evans. Neither Walter Evans nor Sandy Evans was present when the search took place. During the search, officers seized an empty plastic bag containing white residue that later tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine. The bag was found in a dresser drawer in the master bedroom. One of the searching officers observed \u201cjewelry, earrings, that type of thing\u201d on top of the dresser. He also found clothing in the dresser. As part of their search, the officers looked for items suggesting \u201cdomicile and control\u201d of the residence. Despite an extensive search of the premises lasting from approximately 9:30 a.m. to 5:55 p.m., the only item seized suggesting that Sandy Evans resided at the location was an empty envelope found in the living room. The envelope was hand-addressed to \u201cWalter and Sandy Evans\u201d at the address of the searched residence and bore a return address from Farmers Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">After the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant Sandy Evans moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>evidence was insufficient to connect her either with the residence or to the drugs seized in the residence . The trial court denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\">\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have to agree it\u2019s really pretty skinny. I\u2019ve never seen one quite this skinny, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s up to the Court to make a judgment on this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\u201cI\u2019m going to let it go to the jury. I\u2019ll deny your motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Defendant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assigns error to that denial. In testing the evidence for sufficiency, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether any rational trier of fact, accepting reasonable inferences and reasonable credibility choices, could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den </em>514 US 1005 (1995); <em>State v. King, </em>307 Or 332, 339, 768 P2d 391 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Under ORS 475.992(4), \u201c[i]t is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance.\u201d Here, the state presented no evidence that defendant actually possessed the methamphetamine found in the dresser drawer. The issue, therefore, is whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant constructively possessed the controlled substance. To prove constructive possession, the state must prove that a defendant knowingly exercised control over, or had the right to control, the contraband. <em>State v. Garcia, </em>120 Or App 485, 487-88, 852 P2d 946 (1993). Evidence that contraband is found in quarters owned or occupied by a defendant can be sufficient to allow the inference that he or she has a right to control that contraband. <em>State v. Bauer, </em>128 Or App 598, 601, 876 P2d 802 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The evidence here is meager. The state relies on: (1) the officer\u2019s observation of jewelry, earrings, and similar items on top of the dresser in which the methamphetamine was found; (2) the character of the clothing in the dresser where the drugs were found; and (3) the envelope addressed to \u201cWalter and Sandy Evans\u201d at the address searched that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>was found on the premises. According to the state, because there was no evidence to suggest that anyone other than Walter and Sandy Evans lived at the searched premises, a rational juror could conclude from the envelope and the contents of the dresser that defendant was married to Walter Evans, that she lived with him at that address, that she shared the master bedroom with him, that she shared joint possession and control of the dresser where the methamphetamine was found, and that she knew about the presence of the residue-covered plastic bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The evidence that the state points to simply will not bear the weight of the inferences the state needs. The first two items that the state relies on are not even accurately described by the state, at least not on the record before us. Although the state characterizes the jewelry and similar items on top of the dresser as \u201cfeminine\u201d in nature, the officer who observed them did not describe them as such. Nor do the photographs of the top of the dresser that were admitted into evidence and examined by the jury permit that conclusion. Indeed, based on our review of the photographs, it is difficult to identify the objects on the dresser as jewelry at all, let alone as a woman\u2019s jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Similarly, the state contends that the officer searching the dresser described it as containing \u201cclothing that was consistent with what a female would wear.\u201d That is an overly generous description of the officer\u2019s testimony. What the officer actually said was that the clothing was of a kind that either a male or female would wear. When asked if the dresser contained \u201cwomen\u2019s clothing,\u201d the officer specifically replied \u201cI would not say that.\u201d Instead, he recalled that the dresser contained sweatshirts and \u201cclothing that would be either sex, male, female, anyone could wear * *</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In and of themselves, the nondescript items observed on and in the dresser where the drugs were found support no particular inference about the gender or identity of the person who used the dresser. They do not make it more likely than not that any woman used that dresser; they certainly do not tend to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a particular woman \u2014 defendant Sandy Evans \u2014 had control over the area, joint or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The state\u2019s only other evidence was the envelope hand-addressed to \u201cWalter and Sandy Evans\u201d at the address of the searched residence, postmarked six days before the search, with a return address from Farmers Insurance. When police found it, the envelope was empty; there was nothing inside to demonstrate that it was sent from Farmers Insurance in a business capacity. That solitary envelope falls far short of providing an adequate evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to conclude that defendant in fact resided at the searched residence and further had control over the area in which the methamphetamine was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Nor is the evidence sufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction for frequenting a place where controlled substances are kept.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The indictment charged defendant with committing that crime by \u201cknowingly remaining at a place while knowingly permitting persons to use said place to keep controlled substances.\u201d For the same reasons that a rational finder of fact, on this record, could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant occupied the premises and had constructive possession of the drugs in it, a rational finder of fact could not conclude that defendant stayed at the residence, had the authority to permit others to keep the drugs there, and consented to their doing so. <em>See generally State v. Pyritz, </em>90 Or App 601, 752 P2d 1310 (1988) (examining elements of frequenting a place where controlled substances are kept).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Judgment as to defendant Walter Evans affirmed; judgment as to defendant Sandy Evans reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\"> Because the only issue we discuss is the ruling on defendant Sandy Evans\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, our references to \u201cdefendant\u201d in the singular throughout the remainder of the opinion refer to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\"> ORS 167.222, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of frequenting a place where controlled substances are used if the person keeps, maintains, frequents, or remains at a place, while knowingly permitting persons to use controlled substances in such place or to keep or sell them <em>* </em>* *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">\u201c(4) As used in this section, \u2018frequents\u2019 means repeatedly or habitually visits, goes to or resorts to.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
