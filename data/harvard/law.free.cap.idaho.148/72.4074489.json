NATURE OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b108-30\">This case arises from the Idaho Department of Labor\u2019s (the Department\u2019s) determination that Vernon K. Smith (Smith) willfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>failed to file a fourth quarter 2007 Idaho Employer\u2019s Quarterly Unemployment Insurance Tax Report. Smith appealed the Department\u2019s determination to the Appeals Examiner and the Appeals Examiner affirmed the Department. Smith appealed to the Industrial Commission (the Commission). The Commission determined Smith\u2019s appeal to be untimely. Smith appeals that determination to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The Appeals Examiner affirmed the Department\u2019s decision assessing Smith\u2019s tax liability on May 1, 2008, and a written decision was issued to Smith stating that May 15, 2008, was the last day to appeal to the Commission. Smith sent a notice of appeal by mail and by facsimile. Smith sent the facsimile at 5:22 p.m. on May 15, 2008, and the Commission received Smith\u2019s appeal by mail on May 28, 2008. The envelope arrived with a private-postage-meter stamp dated May 15, 2008, but also bore a U.S. Postal Service (USPS) backstamp from Watsontown, Pennsylvania, dated May 20, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Smith concedes that the facsimile was sent after the May 15 time limit because facsimiles are deemed to be received the following day if they arrive after 5:00 p.m.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Smith argues that the private-postage-meter stamp on the mailed appeal demonstrates that it was timely filed on May 15, 2008. This contention is supported by an affidavit from John M. Gibson, Smith\u2019s office manager, who stated that he sent the appeal by facsimile on May 15 and then put the appeal in an envelope, applied postage to the envelope with the private postage meter, and deposited the appeal in the mail by taking the envelope to the post office that same day. In his brief, Smith noted the anomalous nature of the Watsontown backstamp, stating that \u201c[w]here such a mark came from on the reverse side of the envelope is both mystical and quite interesting, as the letter was being sent [from] Boise, Idaho, not Watsontown, PA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The Department, however, contends that the Watsontown stamp is a \u201cpostmark,\u201d indicating that the USPS did not take custody of Smith\u2019s mailpiece until May 20, 2008, five days after the appeal deadline. The Commission held that Smith\u2019s appeal was not timely filed, and therefore dismissed Smith\u2019s appeal. Smith appeals that determination to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">III. ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">1.

Under the Commission Appellate Rules, \u201cfiling\u201d occurs by mail when the appeal is mailed, and the date of mailing is \u201cdetermined by the postmark on the envelope containing the appeal.\u201d Comm\u2019n App. R. 2(D); <em>see also Dep\u2019t of Employment v. Drinkard, </em>98 Idaho 222, 225, 560 P.2d 1312, 1315 (1977) (\u201c[T]he date of the postmark on a claim for review is deemed to be the date of its filing with the Commission.\u201d); <em>In re Dominy, </em>116 Idaho 727, 729, 779 P.2d 402, 404 (1989) (same). A postmark is \u201c[a] stamp or mark put on letters or other mailable matter received at the post-office for transmission through the mails.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(6th ed.). The USPS defines a postmark as a \u201cpostal cancellation imprint on letters[,] flats[,] and parcels. The imprint shows [the] date and the name, state, and ZIP Code of the post office or sectional center facility that accepted custody of the mailpiece.\u201d USPS Pub. 32 at 90, (July 5, 2007) <em>available at </em>http://www.usps.com.</p>\n<p id=\"AYU\">The Commission incorrectly found that May 20, 2008, the date stamped on Smith\u2019s appeal envelope in Watsontown, Pennsylvania, was the date \u201con which the U.S. Postal Service took custody of Claimant\u2019s protest for the express purpose of delivering it to the Commission.\u201d The Watsontown mark was not a postmark but a backstamp. To \u201cback-stamp\u201d a mailpiece is merely \u201c[t]o mark the back of a mailpiece with a postmarking or cancelling device to show that the piece was received, dispatched, or missent.\u201d USPS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Pub. 32 at 12. The Watsontown stamp merely indicates that the piece had been missent to Pennsylvania and was being rerouted back to Idaho. Because the backstamp does not establish when the USPS actually received the piece, it cannot be a valid postmark to establish the date an appeal was filed with the Commission. Aside from Smith\u2019s postage-meter mark, the backstamp is the only mark that appears on the envelope, so the envelope never has been postmarked at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">In addition, the private postage-meter mark on Smith\u2019s appeal cannot substitute for a postmark to establish the date of the appeal filing to the Commission. The Commission Appellate Rules are clear that the date of filing is \u201cdetermined by the postmark on the envelope.\u201d Comm\u2019n App. R. 2(D). A postmark can only be applied by the USPS itself to indicate whether, when, and where the post office accepted the piece of mail or to show that there is a defect in the mailpiece or its affixed postage. USPS Pub. 32 at 12, 90. In contrast, the United States Postal Service Domestic Mail Manual<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defines a postage-meter machine as a \u201cdevice or system of components a customer uses to print evidence that postage required for mailing has been paid.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> USPS Dom. Mail Manual \u00a7 604.4.1.1. Thus, \u2018\u201cthe metered stamp [in private offices] has little, if any, probative force as evidence of the date of mailing.\u2019\u201d <em>Texas Beef Cattle Co. v. Green, </em>862 S.W.2d 812, 814 (Tex. Ct. App. 1993) (modification in original) (quoting <em>Albaugh v. State Bank, </em>586 S.W.2d 137, 138 n. 2 (Tex. Ct. App. 1979)). Like a backstamp, a postage-meter mark cannot be a postmark because it does not indicate if, when, or where the USPS accepted custody of the mailpiece. The user can easily print an inaccurate date or deliver the mail on a different date than that indicated by the postage meter on the envelope. The sender can also simply omit part or all of the date from the mailpiece and send the letter at any time. USPS Dom. Mail Manual \u00a7 604.4.5.2.C.</p>\n<p id=\"AM7\">It is true that even though the mark is simply evidence that the customer paid postage, metered mailpieces bearing a date \u201cmust be deposited or presented\u201d to the USPS on the meter-stamp date according to the rules that the USPS imposes on meter users. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 604.4.5.2.a. If the mailpiece is not deposited on the meter-stamp date, a date correction must be applied to the piece. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 604.4.4.1.a. Nonetheless, despite the USPS policy against accepting a mailpiece with an incorrect postage-meter date, the USPS cannot closely scrutinize all of the millions of meter-marked dates on the mail it processes. <em>See Lin v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review, </em>558 Pa. 94, 735 A.2d 697, 700 (1999) (\u201c[A meter mark] lacks the inherent reliability of the official United States postmark.\u201d). In short, the meter mark is merely evidence of whether postage was paid \u2014 not when it was placed in USPS custody. Accordingly, Smith\u2019s appeal was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"AAM\">Finding that Smith\u2019s appeal was not timely filed is consistent with this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Moore v. Melaleuca, </em>137 Idaho 23, 43 P.3d 782 (2002), and <em>In re Dominy, </em>116 Idaho 727, 779 P.2d 402 (1989), both of which interpreted similar provisions designating the postmark date as the date of filing an appeal. In <em>Moore, </em>the appellant in an unemployment claim delivered her appeal to the U.S. Post Office in Idaho Falls around 5:30 on the final day of filing, but when the notice arrived at the Commission, it was postmarked for the following day in a different city. <em>Id. </em>This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Court nonetheless upheld the Commission\u2019s ruling that the delivery was timely because the appellant had obtained a letter from the USPS claiming fault for the untimely postmark. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, in <em>Dominy, </em>the appellant, his lawyer, and his lawyer\u2019s secretary all submitted affidavits attesting that the notice of appeal had been timely sent from Weiser, Idaho. <em>Dominy, </em>116 Idaho at 728, 779 P.2d at 403 However, the appellant only submitted an affidavit from the USPS stating that a mailpiece sent from Weiser would not be postmarked until it was received in Boise, leaving uncertainty as to when it was actually sent. <em>Id. </em>This Court held that, despite the affidavits, there was simply not enough evidence to overcome the presumption that a piece of mail is sent on the date of its postmark. <em>Id., </em>at 729, 779 P.2d at 404. Read together, these cases require that, in the absence of a USPS postmark, an appellant must provide evidence from the USPS to verify that the mailpiece was sent on a particular day. The USPS routinely postmarks stamped mail but does not ordinarily postmark metered mail. Thus, to ensure that a mailed notice is timely filed, parties should always either use an ordinary postage stamp to ensure that the mailpiece is postmarked or specifically request a postmark on metered mail to verify when the USPS took custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Here, Smith\u2019s appeal bears a postage-meter mark but no postmark. The meter mark is an inherently unreliable means of demonstrating when a mailpiece is sent and cannot substitute for an actual postmark. Smith has no other evidence from the USPS to indicate when the USPS took custody of the appeal mailpiece, only an affidavit from his office manager attesting that the mark is accurate. Thus, there is substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that the appeal was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">B. The Idaho Department of Labor Is Not Entitled to Recover Attorney\u2019s Fees on Appeal Pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs are available to the prevailing party under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117 \u201cif the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.\u201d The issue of whether a postage-meter mark can substitute as a postmark when determining the filing date of an appeal is an issue of first impression in Idaho and one on which other state courts disagree. <em>Compare Bennett, </em>42 S.W.3d at 590 (holding that the postmark presumptively indicates the date of mailing), <em>Texas Beef Cattle Co., </em>862 S.W.2d at 814 (same), <em>Konfirst v. Willow CSN Inc., </em>No. 1737-N, 2006 WL 3803469, *1 (Del. Ch. Dec. 14, 2006) (unpublished opinion) (same), <em>and Corona v. Boeing Co., </em>No. 47792-7-1, 2002 WL 339353, *3 (Wash. Ct. App. Mar. 4, 2002) (unpublished opinion) (same), <em>with Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>154 P.3d 331, 337 (Wyo.2007) (holding that the state\u2019s private postage meter stamp constitutes a \u201cpostmark\u201d), <em>1000 Friends of Oregon v. Columbia County, </em>141 Or.App. 271, 917 P.2d 543, 544 (1996) (stating that the date of filing can run from the date a mailpiece is metered), <em>and Frandrup v. Pine Bend Warehouse, </em>531 N.W.2d 886, 890 (Minn.Ct.App.1995) (holding that metered mail can be timely even if the postmark is not).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Accordingly, Smith acted with a reasonable basis in law and the Department is not entitled to attorney fees. Costs on appeal to Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">VI.
