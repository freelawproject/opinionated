JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b789-25\">Tungsten Holding, Inc. (Tungsten) owns a parcel of land in Boundary County, Idaho that is zoned agriculture/forestry under Boundary County, Idaho, Zoning and Subdivision Ordinance 99-06 (the Zoning Ordinance). In order to operate a commercial gravel pit on its premises, on March 22, 2005, Tungsten filed an application to obtain a special use permit. The Boundary County Planning and Zoning Commission held a public hearing on the application on May 19, 2005, and made a recommendation to deny the special use permit. The Boundary County Board of Commissioners (the Board) subsequently held public hearings on July 26, 2005, and August 8, 2005, and the Board thereafter granted a special use permit on September 6, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-26\">The respondents, Patrick and Ada Gardiner, own real property located a quarter mile from the commercial gravel pit on which they operate a registered Angus cattle breeding ranch. Following the grant of the permit, the Gardiners filed a petition for judicial review.- Before review could occur, however, the parties agreed to remand the proceeding to the Board for consideration without the participation of Commissioner Dan Dinning, the brother of Rick Dinning, the principal owner of Tungsten. Commissioner Dan Dinning had participated in the public hearings and deliberations that led to the Board\u2019s initial decision, but' refrained from voting on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>On remand, the Board held an additional public hearing on July 26, 2005, without Dan Dinning, and the Board ultimately granted the special use permit on September 7, 2006. Following the grant of the special use permit, the Gardiners again filed a petition for judicial review. In a Memorandum Opinion and Order, the district court overturned the Board\u2019s ruling and declared the special use permit void. The Board timely filed this appeal. Tungsten was subsequently given leave to intervene in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">1. Whether the special use permit was granted unlawfully because Chapter 7, Section 1(E) of the Zoning Ordinance conflicts with I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a), and because operation of a gravel pit does not qualify as a conditional use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">2. Whether the grant of the special use permit amounted to unlawful spot zoning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-7\">3. Whether the Gardiners were deprived of an impartial tribunal by the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-8\">4. Whether operation of a gravel pit conforms to Boundary County\u2019s Comprehensive Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-9\">5. Whether the justification of the Board for the grant of the special use permit is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-10\">6. Whether the Board held Tungsten to the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-11\">7. Whether the Board\u2019s \u201cFindings and Decision\u201d contains information sufficient to comply with I.C. \u00a7 67-6535.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-12\">8. Whether the Gardiners needed to show a violation of their substantial rights in order to overturn the ruling of the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-13\">9. Whether this Court should affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees and costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-14\">10.Whether this Court should award attorney fees and costs on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-15\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b790-16\">The Local Land Use Planning Act allows an affected person to seek judicial review of an approval or denial of a land use application. I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(l)(d); <em>Neighbors for a Healthy Gold Fork v. Valley County, </em>145 Idaho 121, 126, 176 P.3d 126, 131 (2007) (citing <em>Evans v. Teton County, </em>139 Idaho 71, 74, 73 P.3d 84, 87 (2003)). Where the district court acted in an appellate capacity, this Court reviews the Board\u2019s record independent of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Neighbors, </em>145 Idaho at 126, 176 P.3d at 131. As a matter of procedure, this Court affirms or reverses the decision of the district court. <em>Losser v. Bradstreet, </em>145 Idaho 670, 673, 183 P.3d 758, 761 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-18\">When reviewing questions of fact, the Board\u2019s \u201cdecisions are entitled to a strong presumption of validity, including the [Board\u2019s] application and interpretation of its own zoning ordinances.\u201d <em>Neighbors, </em>145 Idaho at 126, 176 P.3d at 131. The party attacking the decision of the Board must first demonstrate that the Board erred in a manner specified in I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3). <em>Id. </em>Under I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3), the attacking party must show that the Board\u2019s conclusions or decisions were: \u201c(a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; (d) not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; or (e) arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the attacking party must show that one of their substantial rights was prejudiced. I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-19\">Like construction of a statute, interpretation of an ordinance is an issue over which this court exercises free review. <em>Friends of Farm to Mkt. v. Valley County, </em>137 Idaho 192, 196, 46 P.3d 9, 13 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-20\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b790-21\">I. This Court affirms the ruling of the district court that the special use permit was not lawfully issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-22\">When granting Tungsten the special use permit, the Board applied Chapter 7 of the Zoning Ordinance. Chapter 7 prescribes three categories of uses within an agriculture/forestry zone, the location of Tungsten\u2019s property. The categories include \u201cuses by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>right,\u201d \u201cpermitted uses,\u201d and \u201cconditional uses.\u201d In addition, Chapter 7, Section 1(E) states, \u201cAny use not specified in this section as a use by right or conditional use is eligible for consideration as a special use, subject to the provisions of Chapter 13.\u201d The Board found the gravel pit to be a conditional use as defined by Chapter 7, Section (D)(1): \u201cCommercial businesses supplying products and services for agricultural and forestry activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">The district court held that Chapter 7, Section 1(E) of the Zoning Ordinance conflicts with I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a), and consequently, Section 1(E) is void. The court also held that a gravel pit is not a prescribed conditional use because it does not fit within Chapter 7, Section (D)(1), the conditional use relied upon by the Board. This Court affirms the rulings of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">A. This Court affirms the ruling of the district court that Chapter 7, Section 1(E) of the Zoning Ordinance conflicts with I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Tungsten and the Board claim I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a) and Chapter 7, Section 1(E) are in alignment. They argue that the unambiguous meaning of I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a) allows for the grant of a special use permit so long as certain conditions are satisfied. Tungsten and the Board assert that Section 1(E) is in alignment with I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a) because it conditionally permits the grant of special use permits subject to compliance with specified conditions, as specified in Chapter 13 of the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6512(a) is clear and unambiguous, and accordingly, the statute is to be given its plain meaning. <em>Hamilton v. Reeder Flying Serv., </em>135 Idaho 568, 573, 21 P.3d 890, 895 (2001). Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6512(a) provides: \u201cA special use permit may be granted to an applicant if the proposed use is conditionally permitted by the terms of the ordinance.\u201d Specifically, the wording within the statute, \u201cconditionally permitted,\u201d is unambiguous. The statute requires the use, not the permit, to be \u201cconditionally permitted.\u201d Thus, under I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a), a special use permit may be granted for uses prescribed within the Zoning Ordinance, and because operation of a gravel pit was not prescribed in the Ordinance, the grant of the special use permit was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">Moreover, the plain meaning of Chapter 7, Section 1(E) cannot be reconciled with I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a), and as a result, Section 1(E) is void. <em>See Boise v. Bench Sewer Dist., </em>116 Idaho 25, 33, 773 P.2d 642, 650 (1989) (holding that a county ordinance may not conflict with a state statute). Tungsten and the Board assert that both provisions I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a) and Chapter 7, Section 1(E) allow the grant of a special use permit so long as particular conditions are met, as are specified in Chapter 13 of the Ordinance. They claim the district court\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a), requiring the specific use to be set out in the Zoning Ordinance in order for a special use permit to be granted, would defeat the need for special use permits. Conditionally permitted uses necessary to obtain a special use permit will be synonymous with prescribed uses to obtain a conditional use permit, eradicating the need for special use permits, Tungsten and the Board claim. Although the language of I.C. \u00a7 67-6512 is not particularly ideal, a careful reading of the statute discloses that a special use permit and a conditional use permit are essentially one and the same. Chapter 7, Section 1(E) of the Zoning Ordinance is void since it conflicts with I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a) because it purports to authorize practically any type of land use or development not otherwise allowed under the ordinance, simply by complying with the rather generic provisions of Chapter 13 of the ordinance. Section 1(E), states: \u201cAny use not specified in this section as a use by right or conditional use is eligible for consideration as a special use, subject to the provisions of Chapter 13.\u201d In other words, if a particular use is not specified for a specific piece of property as either a use of right or a use permissible under conditions, the owner has carte blanche to seek and possibly obtain any use available under the sun. This is an \u201canything goes\u201d provision. Chapter 13 contains no provisions either limiting or allowing proposed uses of land located in the County. Section 1(E) is obviously inconsistent with I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a), which states in pertinent part: \u201c[a] special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>use permit may be granted to an applicant if the proposed use is conditionally permitted by the terms of the ordinance.... \u201d That is, a special use may only be allowed if conditionally permitted. Other than the word \u201cspecial,\u201d this is exactly the same as a conditional use permit. If the ordinance does not conditionally permit a proposed use, it is not eligible for a conditional/special use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">B. This Court affirms the finding of the district court that the operation of a gravel pit is not a conditional use under the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The Board ruled that the gravel pit qualified as a conditional use, and consequently, the Board granted Tungsten a special use permit. The Board held that operation of the gravel pit was in accordance with Chapter 7, Section 1(D)(1), one of the prescribed conditional uses. Section 1(D)(1) provides that \u201c[commercial businesses supplying products and services for agricultural and forestry activities,\u201d constitute a conditional use. The Board justified its ruling by writing: \u201cThe finding is based on an argument that construction of roads and protecting against flood are two critical factors necessary to promote the continuing and continued productivity of agriculture and forest use in Boundary County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The district court held that the proposed use, operation of a gravel pit, did not constitute a conditional use. In doing so, the court interpreted the definition of \u201ccommercial,\u201d and ruled that \u201cit is not reasonable to conclude that a gravel pit or surface mining operation with its aspects of excavation, crushing and blasting can be deemed a commercial activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">On appeal, the Board claims that given Boundary County\u2019s rural character, the ruling of the Board that operation of a gravel pit constitutes a commercial business is reasonable. The Board asserts that \u201ccommercial\u201d in Boundary County is not the same as \u201ccommercial\u201d in Ada County. The Board argues that \u201c[w]hile a commercial enterprise might be associated with a strip mall in Kootenai County, in Boundary County it is a gravel pit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The Gardiners argue that the ruling of the Board was arbitrary and capricious because operation of a gravel pit falls outside the definition of \u201ccommercial use,\u201d which is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as a use \u201cintended primarily for the conduct of retail trade in goods and services.\u201d In addition, the Gardiners assert that rock extracted from the gravel pit will be used for road construction, not to \u201csupply products and services for agricultural and forestry activities,\u201d as also required in order to qualify as a \u201cconditional use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">This Court reviews the record of the Board independent of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Neighbors, </em>145 Idaho at 126, 176 P.3d at 131. In order to overturn the ruling of the Board, the party attacking the decision of the Board must demonstrate that it was arbitrary or capricious. I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3); <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">This Court affirms the holding of the district court that operation of a gravel pit does not constitute a conditional use. Chapter 7, Section 1(D)(1) provides that the following is a conditional use: \u201cCommercial businesses supplying products and services for agricultural and forestry activities.\u201d \u201cCommercial\u201d is defined within the Ordinance as \u201c[a] use or structure intended primarily for the conduct of retail trade in goods and services.\u201d Operation of the gravel pit will entail excavation, crushing and blasting, which is a long way from an activity intended for the retail trade of goods. Accordingly, the finding of the Board that operation of a gravel pit fits within Chapter 7, Section (1)(D)(1), while disregarding the definition of \u201ccommercial,\u201d amounted to an arbitrary decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">Our decision that the grant of the special use permit was invalid disposes with the case; therefore, we will not address the remaining issues other than attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">II. This Court affirms the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees and costs and awards attorney fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">The district court required the Board to pay attorney fees to the Gardiners under I.C. \u00a7 12-117(1). Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Unless otherwise provided by statute, in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency, a city, a county or other taxing district and a person, the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and reasonable expenses, if the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">The Board claims that the award of attorney fees was unwarranted. The Board cites <em>Ralph Naylor Farms v. Latah County, </em>144 Idaho 806, 172 P.3d 1081 (2007), <em>Payette River Prop. Owners Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Com\u2019rs of Valley Cty., </em>132 Idaho 551, 976 P.2d 477 (1999), and <em>Idaho Potato Comm\u2019n v. Russet Valley Produce, </em>127 Idaho 654, 904 P.2d 566 (1995), to demonstrate that even if it was improper for the Board to grant a special use permit, the ruling of the Board was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The Gardiners argue that Chapter 7, Section 1(E) conflicts with the unambiguous meaning of I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a), and in light of its clear meaning, the Board\u2019s interpretation was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">This Court exercises free review over a district court\u2019s application of I.C. \u00a7 12-117. <em>Fischer v. City of Ketchum, </em>141 Idaho 349, 352, 109 P.3d 1091, 1094 (2005). \u201cThe prevailing party is entitled to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117 if they show that the state agency \u2018acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reardon v. Magic Valley Sand &amp; Gravel, </em>140 Idaho 115, 118, 90 P.3d 340, 343 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">This Court affirms the award of attorney fees by the district court. This case is similar to <em>Lane Ranch P\u2019ship v. City of Sun Valley, </em>145 Idaho 87, 88-91, 175 P.3d 776, 778-80 (2007), and <em>Fischer, </em>141 Idaho at 356, 109 P.3d at 1098, because in both eases an agency ignored the plain and unambiguous language of a statute or ordinance, which led to the award of attorney fees. Likewise, the grant of attorney fees to the Gardiners is affirmed because the Board acted contrary to an unambiguous state statute and a local ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">In addition, the cases cited by the Board can be differentiated. In each ease cited by the Board, this Court held that even though the respective boards\u2019 application of a state statute or local ordinance was erroneous, the board did not act without a reasonable basis in fact or law. <em>Idaho Potato Comm\u2019n, </em>127 Idaho at 661, 904 P.2d at 573; <em>Payette River Prop. Owners Ass\u2019n, </em>132 Idaho at 556-7, 976 P.2d at 482-83; <em>Ralph Naylor Farms, </em>144 Idaho at 810-11, 172 P.3d at 1085-86. Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6512(a), however, is clear on its face \u2014 a special use permit may only be granted if the use is prescribed in advance by the ordinance under which the special use permit was granted. Furthermore, when considering whether the operation of a gravel pit qualifies as a conditional use, as discussed in.Section I[B], the definition of \u201ccommercial\u201d is clearly expressed, leaving no room for ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">For the foregoing reasons, this Court affirms the decision of the district court, including attorney fees and costs, and awards the Gardiners attorney fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b793-13\">Chief Justice EISMANN, Justices BURDICK, J. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
