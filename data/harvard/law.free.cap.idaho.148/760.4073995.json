JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b784-33\">Quinton Bunn appeals the Industrial Commission\u2019s denial of his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits because it was not timely filed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-34\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-35\">Quinton Bunn was hired by Heritage Safe Company (Heritage) on March 14, 2005. On April 25, 2005, Bunn began working as a lock installer, a job that required the frequent twisting of his wrist as he inserted screws to fasten locks onto safes. On May 2, 2005, Bunn visited physician\u2019s assistant Brett Smith at the Lakeview Clinic after notifying Heritage that he was suffering from wrist pain. Bunn was diagnosed with carpal tun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>nel syndrome. Heritage sent a workers\u2019 compensation report to its surety, Liberty Northwest (Liberty), who in turn sent Bunn a letter on May 4, 2005, denying the claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After receiving further medical treatment, Bunn sent Liberty a letter on May 30, 2005, indicating that his injury was not carpal tunnel and asking Liberty to review its decision. Bunn received no response. During the next two years, Bunn received further treatment and surgery for his wrist problems, and on May 31, 2007, he filed a complaint with the Industrial Commission. Bunn argued that his complaint was timely filed because he was misled by Liberty within the meaning of Idaho Code section 72-706(1) and because Heritage furnished medical treatment under Idaho Code section 72-706(2). On October 10, 2008, the Industrial Commission' issued its Order denying Bunn\u2019s coverage on the basis that his complaint was not timely filed. Bunn appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Bunn presented two issues on appeal: (1) whether a medical misdiagnosis invokes the tolling provisions of Idaho Code section 72-706(1); and (2) whether an employer\u2019s act of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment constitutes \u201cpayments of compensation,\u201d invoking the five-year statute of limitations in Idaho Code section 72-706(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">When reviewing <em>a </em>decision of the Industrial Commission, the Court exercises free review over questions of law. <em>Smith v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>148 Idaho 72, 73, 218 P.3d 1133, 1134 (2009). This Court will not disturb findings of fact unless the findings are clearly erroneous. I.C. \u00a7 72-732; <em>Smith, </em>148 Idaho at 73, 218 P.3d at 1134. Findings of fact are not clearly erroneous if they are supported by substantial and competent evidence. I.C. \u00a7 72-732; <em>Smith, </em>148 Idaho at 73, 218 P.3d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"AEX\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"Alg\">Bunn first argues that the one-year statute of limitations in Idaho Code section 72-706(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does not apply because Liberty misled him to his prejudice. Bunn\u2019s argument boils down to a single legal question: whether Liberty\u2019s denial of Bunn\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, which was based upon the Lakeview Clinic\u2019s misdiagnosis of Bunn\u2019s injury, misled Bunn, therefore tolling the statute of limitations in Idaho Code section 72-706(1).</p>\n<p id=\"AcG\">Bunn\u2019s argument suffers from one fatal flaw \u2014 the tolling provision of Idaho Code section 72-706(1) is only invoked upon a finding that the claimant was \u201cmisled to his prejudice <em>by the employer or surety.\u201d </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-706(1) (emphasis added). In this case, Bunn was misled by his medical provider. The tardiness of Bunn\u2019s complaint was not the result of his reliance on information provided by Liberty, who denied Bunn\u2019s claim based upon the information it was provided by the Lakeview Clinic. Both Bunn and Liberty were initially provided the same information from the clinic that resulted in the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap0\">Our prior decision in <em>Smith v. IML Freight, Inc. </em>is instructive here. 101 Idaho 600, 619 P.2d 118 (1980). In <em>Smith, </em>an employee suffered an injury to his back and shoulder in the course of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 619 P.2d at 118. A few months later, the employee visited two doctors who misdiagnosed the injury as osteoarthritis. <em>Id. </em>One of the doctors told the employee that the injury was likely non-compensable, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>thus the employee did not submit a claim for workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 601, 619 P.2d at 119. Nearly two years later, the employee discovered that his injury should have been diagnosed as a torn rotator cuff. <em>Id. </em>At that point, the employee submitted a claim for workers\u2019 compensation, and the employer asserted the one-year statute of limitations in Idaho Code section 72-701 as a defense. <em>Id. </em>The employee argued on appeal that \u201cthe Commission erred in denying his claim because due to the fact that his condition was initially diagnosed by both doctors as osteoarthritis and treated accordingly, he did not know he had a compensable claim until long past the time for filing his claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 619 P.2d at 120. In holding that the employee\u2019s claim was barred, the Court stated that \u201cthe date of the accident is the moment from which to measure the one year statute of limitation for filing a claim from [sic] compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Though the Court recognized the harshness of the result, it affirmed that the employee\u2019s claim was untimely. <em>Id. </em>at 603, 619 P.2d at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The <em>Smith </em>holding is significant because, although it dealt with the one-year statute of limitations in Idaho Code section 72-701, the Court declined to toll the statute based upon the medical providers\u2019 misdiagnosis. Unlike Idaho Code section 72-701, the statute of limitations here, Idaho Code section 72-706(1), contains an exception where the employee has been misled to his prejudice by the employer or surety. As noted above, that is not the case here. In this case, as in <em>Smith, </em>the misleading information that resulted in the untimely pursuit of the claim was occasioned by the medical provider. Since neither statute allows for tolling where an untimely claim results from a medical provider misdiagnosis, we are required to reach the same harsh result as the Court reached in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANj\">Bunn\u2019s counterargument is that he was unintentionally misled by Liberty\u2019s denial of his claim, and that his failure to file the complaint was a reasonable reaction to the denial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He contends Liberty should be equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations. \u201cAn employer may by his conduct estop himself from asserting what would under other circumstances constitute a perfect defense to the claim for compensation.\u201d William R. Schneider, Schneider\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 2472 (3d ed.1959). \u201cA familiar defense to assertion of the bar of late claim is the plea that the lateness was the result of the employer\u2019s assurances, misrepresentations, negligence, or even deliberate deceptions.\u201d 2B Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 78.45 (1993). The Idaho Legislature has expressly incorporated this principle of equitable estoppel into its statute by providing a tolling provision in circumstances where an employee is \u201cmisled to his prejudice by the employer or surety.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-706(1).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqej\">Bunn cites a number of decisions where other courts have interpreted similar statutes to allow the tolling of the statute of limitations even if the employer\u2019s or surety\u2019s act of misleading was unintentional. For example, in <em>Bauer v. State ex rel. Wyoming Worker\u2019s Compensation Division, </em>an employer, the City of Saratoga, mistakenly told an employee that she was not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits because she was a part-time employee. 695 P.2d 1048, 1049 (Wyo.1985). Relying on that information, the employee did not timely file a claim for benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 1049-50. The Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Wyoming held that \u201cthe employer\u2019s misleading statements, although unintentional, were sufficient to constitute estoppel and prevent the employer and the state of Wyoming from invoking the statute of limitations as a defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1053. Similarly, in <em>Levo v. Generab-Shea-Morrison, </em>an employee suffered a heart attack and was mistakenly told by both the surety and the employer that the injury was not covered under workers\u2019 compensation. 128 Mont. 570, 280 P.2d 1086, 1089 (1955), <em>overruled on other grounds by Greger v. United Prestress, Inc., </em>180 Mont. 348, 590 P.2d 1121 (1979). The Montana Supreme Court determined that the object of equitable estoppel \u201cis to prevent a party from taking an unconscionable advantage of his own wrong while asserting his strict legal rights,\u201d and in applying that analysis, held that the employer was barred from invoking the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 1090; <em>accord Cohen v. Indus. Comm\u2019n of Ariz., </em>133 Ariz. 24, 648 P.2d 139, 142 (Ct.App.1982) (holding that an employer was estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense because it mistakenly sent the wrong forms to the detriment of the employee\u2019s widow); <em>Robertson v. Brissey\u2019s Garage, Inc., </em>270 S.C. 58, 240 S.E.2d 810, 811 (1978) (\u201cThe conduct of defendant and its insurance carrier may be such as to estop them from presenting the statutory limitation as a defense in bar of the claim for compensation, if the effect of such conduct was to mislead or deceive claimant, whether intentionally or not, and induce him to withhold or postpone filing his claim petition until more- than a year had elapsed from the occurrence of the accident.\u201d (quoting <em>Young v. Sonoco Products Co., </em>210 S.C. 146, 41 S.E.2d 860, 864 (1947))).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The common theme running through each of these cases is that the denial of the employee\u2019s claim was premised upon some unintentional mistake of the employer or surety <em>other </em>than the mere rejection of the workers\u2019 compensation claim. The principle of equitable estoppel applies <em>only </em>if there is some conduct by the employer or the surety, other than the mere denial of the claim, resulting in some prejudice to the employee \u2014 otherwise, there is -no inequitable conduct by the employer or surety to justify the application of the equitable remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"AMRP\">Accordingly, neither Heritage nor Liberty engaged in any inequitable conduct sufficient to justify the application of equitable estoppel. Consequentially, the tolling provision of Idaho Code section 72-706(1) is inapplicable in this case, and the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision that Bunn\u2019s complaint was not timely filed under Idaho Code section 72-706(1) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AWN5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"AyC\">Bunn next argues that even if his complaint is barred under Idaho Code section 72-706(1), it was timely under Idaho Code section 72-706(2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because \u201cpayments of compensation\u201d had been made by Heritage to Bunn and were thereafter discontinued. The record in this case establishes that Bunn asked his employer to schedule a doctor\u2019s appointment to examine his wrist. Heritage acquiesced, and scheduled an appointment with the Lakeview Clinic. From this, Bunn argues that the employer\u2019s act of calling the medical provider to set up a doctors\u2019 appointment constitutes \u201cpayments of compensation\u201d under Idaho Code section 72-706(2), invoking that provision\u2019s five-year statute of limitations. The Industrial Commission held that Heritage\u2019s actions did not amount to \u201cpayments of compensation,\u201d rendering the five-year limitation provision inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad56\">An employer\u2019s mere act of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment, without more, is insufficient to constitute the payment of compensation under Idaho Code section 72-706(2). A contrary holding would provide a disincentive for an employer to schedule doctor\u2019s appointments for its employees in fear that the call, in and of itself, might automatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>subject the employer to liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We decline to subject an employer to the risk of making the legal and medical determinations of whether an injury is compensable under workers\u2019 compensation laws when scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">In this case, there is substantial and competent evidence to support the Industrial Commission\u2019s finding that Heritage\u2019s act of scheduling the doctor\u2019s appointment did not constitute payments of compensation, but rather constituted a routine courtesy offered to its employee. Consequently, we affirm the Industrial Commission\u2019s finding that Idaho Code section 72-706(2) does not apply to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Because Bunn did not file his claim for compensation within one year of the date of his injury, we affirm the Industrial Commission\u2019s order barring his complaint as untimely. Costs are awarded to Liberty.</p>\n<judges id=\"b788-7\">Chief Justice EISMANN, and Justices BURDICK, W. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-9\">. The denial was based on the ground that carpal tunnel syndrome is, categorized as a nonacute occupational disease and is not compensable unless the employee was exposed to the hazard of the disease for sixty days with the same employer. I.C. \u00a7 72-439. Bunn performed his lock installation duties for less than sixty days at the time of his injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AN3\">. Idaho Code section 72-706(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-17\">When no compensation paid. When a, claim for compensation has been made and no compensation has been paid thereon, the claimant, unless misled to his prejudice by the employer or surety, shall have one (1) year from the date of making claim within which to make and file with the commission an application requesting a hearing and an award under such claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afn1\">I.C. \u00a7 72-706(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b786-5\">. There is also some insinuation in Bunn\u2019s briefing that Liberty engaged in inequitable conduct when it did not respond to his May 30, 2005 letter, indicating tire doctor did not think the injury was carpal tunnel syndrome. The burden of establishing equitable estoppel is on the party asserting it. <em>Tom Nakamura, Inc. v. G &amp; G Produce Co., Inc., </em>95 Idaho 645, 646, 516 P.2d 702, 703 (1973). Bunn\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. There is no evidence in the record to establish inequitable conduct on the part of Heritage or Liberty or that would lead a reasonable person to believe that Bunn should not have pursued his claim once he learned of the misdiagnosis. He was aware of the misdiagnosis within thirty days of his injury and was incurring ongoing medical care and expense to determine the nature of the injury and to properly treat it. The denial letter was unequivocal, leaving no doubt as to Liberty\u2019s position. A reasonably diligent person would be expected to pursue efforts to obtain compensation within the ensuing eleven months. Further, the record does not disclose that Liberty was provided a correct diagnosis showing a compensable injury during that one-year period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b787-6\">.
