JONES, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">This-case arises from the 2001 shooting death of Tonya Hart in Moscow, Idaho. David Meister was charged with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder; it was alleged that Meister shot Tonya in exchange for $1000. A jury convicted Meister on both counts, and Meister appealed. The court of appeals remanded the case for further proceedings and re-sentencing. The state petitioned this Court for review. This Court accepted review on the following issues: (1) whether this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Larsen, </em>91 Idaho 42, 415 P.2d 685 (1966) or I.R.E. 403 is the controlling authority for the. admissibility of alternate perpetrator evidence, (2) whether I.R.E. 804(b)(3) contains a corroboration requirement for the admission of confessions of an alternate perpetrator, and (3) whether the district court violated Meister\u2019s right to due process, right of appeal, and Fifth Amendment rights by threatening a harsher sentence if Meister refused to admit guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">On December 11, 2001 Tonya Hart was shot twice in her home in Moscow, Idaho, which she shared with her boyfriend Jesse Linderman. The shooter approached the front entrance of Tonya\u2019s trailer and then proceeded to the back entrance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When Tonya opened the back entrance of the trailer she was shot twice, once in the chest and once in the face. The shooter then retreated behind the trailer, running through a snow covered field and eventually exiting the field on a nearby road. A neighbor heard the gun shots and went to Tonya and Jesse\u2019s trailer. He then called 911 and proceeded unsuccessfully with resuscitation efforts. Tonya was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"A2X\">In August of 2002 the police interrogated David Meister in connection with Tonya\u2019s death and Meister confessed that he shot Tonya in exchange for a $1000 payment from Jesse Linderman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Meister was charged with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Charges were initially filed against Linderman for conspiracy to commit murder but those charges were later dismissed because the only evidence tying Linderman to the crime was Meister\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"Am7\">At trial Meister attempted to admit evidence that another individual, Lane Thomas, was responsible for Tonya\u2019s shooting. The district court refused any evidence which showed Thomas was an alternate perpetrator of the crime, including several confessions. A jury convicted Meister on both counts and the district court sentenced him to a fixed term of life for the murder conviction and a unified sentence of life with 40 years fixed for the conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"AGU\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As5\">1.

Oliver, </em>144 Idaho 722, 724, 170 P.3d 387, 389 (2007). This Court freely reviews questions of law. Questions of relevancy are reviewed <em>de novo. State v. Zichko, </em>129 Idaho 259, 264, 923 P.2d 966, 971 (1996). \u201cWhether evidence is relevant is an issue of law.\u201d <em>State v. Atkinson, </em>124 Idaho 816, 819, 864 P.2d 654, 657 (Ct.App.1993). \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in the admission of evidence, and its judgment will only be reversed when there has been an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Zichko, </em>129 Idaho at 264, 923 P.2d at 971. Thus, the inquiry is two-fold; we must first freely review and determine whether the proffered evidence is relevant, and secondly we evaluate whether the district court abused its discretion in determining whether the probative value was outweighed by unfair prejudice. <em>Atkinson, </em>124 Idaho at 819, 864 P.2d at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The alternate perpetrator evidence that Meister attempted to admit at trial consists of Lane Thomas\u2019 confessions and evidence which tends to suggest that Lane Thomas was the actual perpetrator of the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thomas\u2019 confessions and evidence which tends to implicate him in the shooting of Tonya are governed by two standards under Idaho law. This Court must first determine the standard for admission of alternate perpetrator evidence. Although Thomas\u2019 confessions are included under the umbrella of alternate perpetrator evidence, the confessions also constitute hearsay. Therefore, the confessions must then be analyzed for admission pursuant to the hearsay rules. The State argues that all of the evidence in Meister\u2019s offer of proof is inadmissible pursuant to various evidentiary rules. The State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>seeking exclusion of all alternate perpetrator evidence was granted; therefore, Meister\u2019s counsel was never afforded the opportunity to lay the foundation properly for any of the evidence. This Court will refrain from acting as a fact-finder and makes no determination as to whether the evidence is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"AM2\">The right to present a defense is protected by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019, 1023 (1967). \u201cThis right is a fundamental element of due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The right to present a defense includes the right to offer testimony of witnesses, compel their attendance, and to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts \u201cto the jury so it may decide where the truth lies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, this right must be balanced against any interest the state has in the criminal trial process; \u201cthe Sixth Amendment \u2018does not confer the right to present testimony free from the legitimate demands of the adversarial system.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Albert, </em>138 Idaho 284, 287, 62 P.3d 208, 211 (Ct.App.2002) (quoting <em>Taylor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 412-13, 108 S.Ct. 646, 655, 98 L.Ed.2d 798, 812-13 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In the present case, Meister was not afforded the opportunity to provide a full and complete defense for the crimes of which he was accused. The district court applied the wrong standard for the admission of the alternate perpetrator evidence; therefore, this Court vacates Meister\u2019s conviction and remands this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">I.R.E. 403 is the controlling authority for the admissibility of alternate perpetrator evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">This Court addressed the issue of whether a defendant is entitled to present evidence of an alternate perpetrator in <em>Larsen, </em>91 Idaho 42, 415 P.2d 685. The Court held that a defendant must produce a \u201ctrain of facts or circumstances, as tend clearly to point out some one besides the [defendant] as the guilty party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47-48, 415 P.2d at 690-91. It requires more than just \u201cconjectural inferences\u201d that a party other than the defendant committed the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 415 P.2d at 691. In 1985, the Idaho Rules of Evidence were adopted which established that all relevant evidence is admissible, unless otherwise provided by the Idaho Rules of Evidence or other rules for the courts of Idaho.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I.R.E. 402. \u201cThese rules govern all actions, cases and proceedings in the courts of the State of Idaho.\u201d I.R.E. 101(b). This Court is presented with the inquiry of whether alternate perpetrator evidence is subjected to a different standard for admission than all other evidence; that is, whether <em>Larsen </em>or I.R.E. 403 governs the admission of alternate perpetrator evidence. This Court finds that <em>Larsen </em>was implicitly overruled when the Idaho Rules of Evidence were adopted in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The court of appeals addressed a similar issue in <em>State v. Kerchusky, </em>138 Idaho 671, 67 P.3d 1283 (Ct.App.2003). There the court stated that a review of excluded evidence requires an inquiry as to whether the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the evidence pursuant to I.R.E. 403. <em>Kerchusky, </em>138 Idaho at 675, 67 P.3d at 1287. However, the court ultimately concluded that the evidence offered by the defendant was properly excluded because it \u201cwas of negligible probative value, and ... the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the evidence pursuant to the \u2018direct connection doctrine\u2019 and I.R.E. 403.\u201d Id. at 676, 67 P.3d at 1288. The Ninth Circuit has interpreted <em>Kerehusky </em>as standing for the proposition that \u201c[I.R.E.] 403 thus embodies a concern, reflected in the cases from other states ... and articulated by the Idaho Supreme Court in <em>[Larsen], </em>that evidence of third party guilt <em>should not be admitted </em>unless there is some evidence directly connecting the third party to the crime in question.\u201d <em>Gray v. Klauser, </em>86 Fed.Appx. 279, 283 (9th Cir.2004) (unpublished opinion) (emphasis added). But, the Ninth Circuit also stated that \u201cIdaho courts do not apply a specialized rule in [the admission of alternate perpetrator evidence], <em>but deem third party evidence inadmissible\u201d </em>if it does not meet the requirements of I.R.E. 403. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, it remains unclear whether the court of appeals of this state applies <em>Larsen, </em>I.R.E. 403, or a combination thereof when reviewing the admissibility of alternate perpetrator evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AIh\">As previously stated, this Court adopts an approach which holds that the Rules of Evidence generally govern the admission of <em>all evidence </em>in the courts of this State. The Rules of Evidence generally include all relevant evidence, whereas <em>Larsen </em>generally excluded alternate perpetrator evidence regardless of relevance. The Rules of Evidence embody the balancing test which safeguards a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense along with protection of the state\u2019s interest in the integrity of the criminal trial process. For instance, I.R.E. 412 employs a two-part test to evaluate whether a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a defense is violated in light of I.R.E. 412.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State v. Self, </em>139 Idaho 718, 722, 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>P.3d 1117, 1121 (Ct.App.2003). \u201cFirst, the trial court must consider whether the evidence proffered is relevant. If it is not relevant, the defendant has no constitutional right to present it. If the evidence is relevant, the trial court must ask whether other legitimate interests outweigh the defendant\u2019s interest in presenting the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Due to the highly sensitive nature of sex crimes in general, this standard has been found to effectively balance the state\u2019s interest in protecting victims of sex crimes from disclosing their past sexual behavior except in limited circumstances and the defendant\u2019s interest in presenting a defense for the crimes of which s/he is accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The Rules of Evidence properly protect the trial court\u2019s discretion to limit relevant evidence if the probative value is \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d I.R.E. 403. The Rules effectively address the concerns from <em>Larsen. </em>The Larsen Court was concerned that a defendant will attempt to admit evidence where the sole purpose is to infer that an individual other than the accused committed the crime. If the defendant proffers evidence which merely tends to mislead the jury that another person committed the crime, or the evidence is not relevant because it does not tend to make the defendant\u2019s involvement more probable or less probable, then it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to find the evidence inadmissible. Mere inferences that another person <em>could </em>have committed the crime will most likely not be relevant, and if relevant will still be subject to the limitation provisions of I.R.E. 403. \u201cA defendant has no right to present irrelevant evidence and even if evidence is relevant, it may be excluded in certain cases.\u201d <em>Self, </em>139 Idaho at 722, 85 P.3d at 1121. The Idaho Rules of Evidence effectively safeguard against the admission of \u201cconjectural inferences\u201d without the lower courts needing to apply the <em>Larsen </em>direct connection doctrine. This Court finds that <em>Larsen </em>was implicitly overruled by the adoption of the Idaho Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In the present ease, the court\u2019s ruling does not address whether the evidence is relevant and admissible pursuant to I.R.E. 401, 402 or 403. Instead, the court ruled that any evidence relating to Lane Thomas as an alternate perpetrator was inadmissible pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Larsen. </em>This finding was in error. The court refused the request of the defense to call Lane Thomas as a witness and any witness which may impeach Lane Thomas\u2019 testimony, or to present any evidence which would tend to show that a person other than Meister committed the crime. By excluding all this evidence from being presented in any context throughout the course of trial the district court prevented Meister from presenting potentially relevant facts that may have developed throughout the course of the trial. Meister should be afforded the opportunity to present his complete and full defense, which includes the presentation of all relevant evidence in the context of trial pursuant to any limitations of the Idaho Rules of Evidence. The district court erred by applying the wrong standard for admissibility of alternate perpetrator evidence, and therefore, abused its discretion. Therefore, this Court grants Meister a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Lane Thomas\u2019 confessions must meet the standards of I.R.E. 804(b)(3) in order to be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Trial counsel and the district court applied this Court\u2019s standard in <em>Larsen </em>for a determination of whether Thomas\u2019 confessions were admissible. The application of <em>Larsen </em>is incorrect because it was implicitly overruled by this Court\u2019s adoption of the Idaho Rules of Evidence. Therefore, whether Thomas\u2019 confessions should have been admitted is dictated by I.R.E. 401, 402, 403 and 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Hearsay \u201cis a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d I.R.E. 801(c). Hearsay is not admissible unless it falls under an exception in the Idaho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Rules of Evidence or another rule formulated by the Idaho Supreme Court. I.R.E. 802. A statement is not hearsay if the declarant is unavailable as a witness and it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbC\">[a] statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by declarant against another, that a reasonable man in declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless declarant believed it to be true. <em>A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">I.R.E. 804(b)(3) (emphasis added). These corroborating circumstances are necessary and must \u201cclearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d <em>State v. Priest, </em>128 Idaho 6, 16-17, 909 P.2d 624, 634-35 (Ct.App.1995). Several confessions may act to corroborate each other. <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 300, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297, 311-12 (1973) (listing several factors that would provide considerable assurance that hearsay statements are reliable, including \u201c[t]he sheer number of independent confessions provided additional corroboration for each.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The court of appeals dealt with the present issue in <em>State v. Meister, </em>2007 WL 2821981 (Ct.App.2007) (unpublished opinion) by adopting Arizona\u2019s standard in <em>State v. LaGrand, </em>153 Ariz. 21, 28, 734 P.2d 563, 570 (1987). In <em>LaGrand, </em>the Arizona supreme court established seven factors<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for determining the reliability and corroboration of a statement subjected to the hearsay exception established in 804(b)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 27-28, 734 P.2d at 569-70. The court ultimately held that \u201ca judge\u2019s inquiry, made to assure himself [or herself] that the corroboration requirement of Rule 804(b)(3) has been satisfied, should be limited to asking <em>whether evidence in the record corroborating and contradicting the declarant\u2019s statement would permit a reasonable person to believe that the statement could be true.\u201d Id. </em>at 28, 734 P.2d at 570 (emphasis added). This will protect the province of the jury as the fact-finder and prevent the judge from \u201cbe[ing] able to bootstrap himself [or herself] into the jury box via evidentiary rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court adopts Arizona\u2019s standard and seven factor test for the corroboration requirement pursuant to I.R.E. 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"AGu\">The offer of proof and the record contain two reports from people who heard Lane Thomas confess to the Tonya Hart shooting. One is a police report taken from an inmate in Spokane County.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The other is a handwritten statement taken by the Latah County Sheriffs Office along with the officer\u2019s notes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, Thomas made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>third inculpatory statement after Meister\u2019s conviction which is contained in Meister\u2019s motion for a new trial. The first two confessions were made by Thomas to fellow inmates at the Whitman County Jail. The inculpatory statement was made as a threat to a woman who was owed money by Thomas.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> All three of the statements tend to implicate that Thomas was the person or one of the people responsible for the shooting death of Tonya.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The district court ruled <em>in limine </em>that the defense would not be allowed to call Lane Thomas to testify or be allowed to call the persons who heard the confessions potentially to impeach any testimony provided by Lane Thomas. When defense counsel asked for the basis of the court\u2019s ruling the court replied \u201cI think I\u2019ve given it.\u201d The court did not issue a written order memorializing the basis of its decision. The only authority discussed during the motion hearing was this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Larsen. </em>Although the district court applied the wrong standard to determine whether the statements were admissible, the district court did make a finding that the evidence presented in the offer of proof did not sufficiently corroborate the evidence. Therefore, the district court correctly found that some corroboration is necessary in order for the statements to be admissible. The governing standard of whether a third-party\u2019s statements tending to inculpate the declarant and exculpate the accused is governed by I.R.E. 804(b)(3). Further, this Court adopts Arizona\u2019s test for a trial court to determine whether the third-party confessions are sufficiently corroborated in accordance with I.R.E. 804(b)(3); that test being, whether evidence in the record corroborating and contradicting the declarant\u2019s statement would permit a reasonable person to believe that the statement could be true. This test is desirable because it prevents the trial judge from substituting himself or herself as the ultimate fact-finder. If the statements clearly establish trustworthiness through corroborating evidence it is within the province of the jury to weigh the testimony and determine where the truth lies. The district court applied the wrong standard to determine whether Lane Thomas\u2019 confessions should be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">Whether the district court violated Meister\u2019s right to due process, right of appeal, and Fifth Amendment rights by threatening a harsher sentence if Meister refused to admit guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">We decline to address this issue because Meister\u2019s sentence has been vacated and this ease is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">For the foregoing reasons this Court vacates Meister\u2019s conviction and sentence and remands this case for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-15\">Chief Justice EISMANN, Justices BURDICK, J.
