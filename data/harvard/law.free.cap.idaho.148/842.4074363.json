The Idaho State Tax Commission (the Commission) determined that the Parkers\u2019 tax payments were deficient for those years. David and Kathy sought review by the district court. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The Parkers were married at all times during 2003 and 2004 (\u201cthe relevant years\u201d). Kathy was domiciled in Idaho and David was domiciled in Nevada throughout this time. The Parkers filed income tax returns with both the Internal Revenue Service and the Commission declaring their status as \u201cmarried filing joint\u201d for the relevant years. Nevada does not impose an individual income tax, so the Parkers did not file tax returns with that state. On their Idaho returns for the relevant years, the Parkers reported only the income earned by Kathy while she was domiciled in Idaho and did not report the income earned by David.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">The Commission conducted an audit of the Parkers\u2019 returns for the relevant years and determined that one-half of the income earned by David was subject to Idaho income tax because Kathy was entitled to one-half of the Nevada income as community property. On April 2, 2007, the Commission issued a notice of deficiency to the Parkers, and on May 3, the Parkers\u2019 accountant filed a petition for redetermination and asked the Commission for a hearing. Following the hearing, the Commission issued a decision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upholding the determination that the Parkers owed income tax on one-half of the income earned by David while domiciled in Nevada for the relevant years.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">The Parkers timely filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s amended decision on February 22, 2008 and made the security deposit required by I.C. \u00a7 63-3049. The Parkers alleged that the Commission\u2019s determination was \u201ccapricious, without a basis in law or fact, arbitrary and otherwise erroneous.\u201d The Commission responded on March 14, 2008, pointing out that the action should proceed as a <em>de novo </em>proceeding pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 63-3049, rather than as a petition for review, and therefore filed an answer to what it termed the Parkers\u2019 \u201ccomplaint.\u201d On June 24, 2008, the parties filed a statement of \u201cStipulated Facts\u201d which specified, among other things, that the sole issue before the district court was whether the Commission erred when it determined that one-half of the income earned by David while he was domiciled in Nevada is subject to Idaho income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">On July 1, 2008, the Parkers filed a motion for summary judgment requesting the court to require the Commission to recalculate the Parkers\u2019 income tax without the inclusion of David\u2019s income. The Parkers also filed an affidavit from David in which he stated that he did not receive any financial assistance from Kathy or have any Idaho-sourced income during the years in question. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Commission filed a responsive \u201cAffidavit of Jim Gunter Regarding Summary Judgment\u201d on July 18, 2008. Gunter is the tax specialist with the Commission who conducted the re-determination in the Parkers\u2019 case. Although styled as an \u201caffidavit,\u201d this document is something between an affidavit and a legal brief in which Gunter expresses his opinions as to questions of tax and community property law. In the affidavit, Gunter asserted that David would have been required to file an Idaho income tax return even if he and Kathy had filed separate returns due to David\u2019s share of the taxable income from certain Idaho real estate income pass-through entities. The Parkers moved to strike this opinion on the basis that it was a legal conclusion that was for the court to make and as speculative and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">On October 23, 2008, the district court issued its combined \u201cOrder Denying [the Parkers\u2019] Motion to Strike,\u201d \u201cOrder Denying [the Commission\u2019s] Motion to Strike,\u201d \u201cOrder Granting [the Commission\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d and \u201cOrder Denying [the Parkers\u2019] Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d The court found that the Parkers were not entitled to equitable relief under Idaho law. The court also rejected the Parker\u2019s claim that the Commission\u2019s determination violated the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause. The Parkers timely appealed from the district court\u2019s final judgment in which the Commission was awarded $36,709.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">A taxpayer may appeal a determination by the Commission by filing a complaint against the Commission in district court. I.C. \u00a7 63-3049. The ease is to proceed as a <em>de novo </em>bench trial. I.C. \u00a7 63-3049; c<em>f. </em>I.C. \u00a7 63-3812(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A deficiency determination issued by the Commission is presumed to be correct, and the burden is on the taxpayer to show that the Commission\u2019s decision is erroneous. <em>Albertson\u2019s Inc. v. State Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>106 Idaho 810, 814, 683 P.2d 846, 850 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">When this Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on summary judgment, it employs the same standard as that properly employed by the trial court when originally ruling on the motion. Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-11\"><em>Kolln v. Saint Luke\u2019s Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>130 Idaho 323, 327, 940 P.2d 1142, 1146 (1997) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">The district court upheld the Commission\u2019s decision that one-half of David\u2019s Nevada earnings were taxable because, by operation of Idaho community property law, those earnings are income attributable to Kathy. The Parkers urge on appeal that the district court erred in not applying Nevada community property law, in not concluding that taxing one-half of David\u2019s earnings would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>violate due process, and in not striking the portions of Gunter\u2019s affidavit that asserted that David received income generated in Idaho. The Parkers also allege that the district court erred in not holding that taxing one-half of David\u2019s Nevada earnings would violate the Commerce Clause. Finally, the Parkers contend that the district court erred in not reading federal provisions for equitable relief into Idaho tax law. The Commission seeks attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">A. We decline to address whether the district court erred in applying Idaho rather than Nevada community property law.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The Parkers argue that the district court erred in applying Idaho rather than Nevada community property law and that under Nevada law, David\u2019s earnings during the years in question might be considered separate property. Specifically, the Parkers allege that the district court erred in only discussing Idaho community property law when the Commission, in its amended decision, discussed both Idaho and Nevada community property law. The Parkers, however, stipulated before the district court that \u201c[t]he Audit Division determined that one-half of the income earned by Mr. Parker while he was domiciled in Nevada was subject to Idaho income tax because under the community property laws of Idaho, Ms. Parker was entitled to one-half of the Nevada income.\u201d There is no indication in the record that the Parkers said anything more regarding the choice of law to the district court, and the district court did not address the issue or mention Nevada community property law in its decision. Accordingly, we decline to address the choice of law issue for the first time on appeal. <em>Dunn v. Baugh, </em>95 Idaho 236, 238, 506 P.2d 463, 465 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">B. We affirm the district court\u2019s holding that the taxation of Kathy\u2019s one-half interest in David\u2019s Nevada earnings does not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The Parkers assert that the State of Idaho (the State), through the Commission, violates due process when it taxes income earned outside of its borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">It is undisputed that during the relevant years, Kathy was an Idaho resident and that she and David were married. Idaho Code \u00a7 32-906 provides that property acquired after marriage is community property, subject to exceptions not present in this case. This includes a spouse\u2019s earnings. <em>Suter v. Suter, </em>97 Idaho 461, 466, 546 P.2d 1169, 1174 (1976). As David\u2019s earnings during the relevant years were community property, Kathy\u2019s one-half interest in those earnings were subject to federal taxation. <em>Forbush v. Commissioner, </em>T.C. Memo.1979-214, 38 T.C.M. (CCH) 871, 1979 WL 3279 (U.S.Tax Ct.) (citing <em>Hopkins v. Bacon, </em>282 U.S. 122, 51 S.Ct. 62, 75 L.Ed. 249 (1930); <em>Goodell v. Koch, </em>282 U.S. 118, 51 S.Ct. 62, 75 L.Ed. 247 (1930); <em>Poe v. Seaborn, </em>282 U.S. 101, 51 S.Ct. 58, 75 L.Ed. 239 (1930)). <em>See also Babcock v. Commissioner, </em>T.C. Memo.1979-372, 39 T.C.M. 139(CCH), 1979 WL 3424 (U.S.Tax Ct.).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Idaho\u2019s taxation scheme mirrors that of federal law. \u201cIt is the intent of the [Idaho] legislature ... insofar as possible to make the provisions of the [Idaho Income Tax Act] identical to the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code relating to the measurement of taxable income....\u201d I.C. \u00a7 63-2002. Therefore, for purposes of computing Idaho taxable income, just as in computing federal taxable income, one-half of David\u2019s earnings are included in determining Kathy\u2019s gross income. The question is whether the fact that this income derived from Nevada somehow precludes the State from taxing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">This Court answered the question whether the State may tax income earned outside of its borders in <em>Herndon v. West, </em>87 Idaho 335, 393 P.2d 35 (1964). In that case, the taxpayer was a resident of Idaho and was also a general partner in an Oklahoma business from which she derived income, <em>Herndon, </em>87 Idaho at 338, 393 P.2d at 36. The taxpayer argued that the State\u2019s attempt to tax her Oklahoma income violated her rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 393 P.2d at 37. This Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-11\">The Supreme Court of the United States has made it clear that a state has the power to tax in relation to a resident\u2019s income derived from sources outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>State and that there is nothing in the Federal Constitution to prevent the exercise of such power. The rationale for allowing a state to compute a tax on income earned elsewhere is based on the premise that inhabitants are supplied many services by their state of residence and should contribute toward the support of the state, no matter where their income is earned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA8O\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">During the relevant years, Kathy was a resident of Idaho and derived income from her one-half interest in David\u2019s earnings in Nevada. Kathy was supplied many services by the State, and there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent the State from taxing her income in return \u2014 regardless of the fact that the income was derived from a source outside of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The Parkers argue, however, that taxing one-half of David\u2019s Nevada income violates David\u2019s due process rights because the only contacts he has with Idaho are his marriage to Kathy. With respect to the earnings that the Commission seeks to tax, however, David\u2019s contacts with the State are irrelevant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In taxing one-half of David\u2019s Nevada earnings, the Commission is not seeking to impose a tax on David, but rather on Kathy. As stated, one-half of David\u2019s earnings were income attributable to Kathy for purposes of taxation. Kathy was a resident of Idaho. There is nothing in the Commission\u2019s act of taxing Kathy\u2019s income, even though derived from David\u2019s earnings in Nevada, that offends due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">C. We affirm the district court\u2019s holding that taxing of one-half of David\u2019s Nevada earnings does not violate the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The Parkers also argue that taxing one-half of David\u2019s Nevada earnings violates the Commerce Clause. The Commission argues that because it is only seeking to tax Kathy\u2019s income, albeit income derived from David\u2019s Nevada earnings, the Commerce Clause is not implicated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">\u201cTo show that the Commerce Clause is implicated by a tax statute, [a taxpayer] must demonstrate that the state\u2019s taxation of [her] entire income has a substantial effect on an identifiable interstate economic activity or market.\u201d 71 Am.Jur.2d State and Local Taxation \u00a7 391 (2009) (citing <em>Stelmer v. Comm\u2019r of Revenue, </em>621 N.W.2d 736, 740 (Minn.2001)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-15\">\u201cThe dormant Commerce Clause protects markets and participants in markets, not taxpayers as such.\u201d <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Tracy, </em>519 U.S. 278, 300 [117 S.Ct. 811, 825, 136 L.Ed.2d 761, 781] (1997). Therefore, the dormant Commerce Clause will not apply unless there is actual or prospective competition between entities in an identifiable market <em>and </em>state action that either expressly discriminates against or places an undue burden on interstate commerce. <em>Tracy, </em>519 U.S. at 300 [117 S.Ct. at 825, 136 L.Ed.2d at 780-81]. Furthermore, this impact must be more than merely incidental. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 559 [115 S.Ct. 1624, 1630, 131 L.Ed.2d 626, 637-38] (1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-16\"><em>Stelzner, </em>621 N.W.2d at 740-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-17\">In order to show that the Commerce Clause is implicated in this case, the Parkers would need to show that the State\u2019s taxation of Kathy\u2019s entire income has a substantial effect on an identifiable interstate economic activity or market. They have failed to identify any interstate economic activity or mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>ket that is burdened by the taxation of Kathy\u2019s Nevada income.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The Commerce Clause is not implicated in this case. Although the district court did not reach this same conclusion, it did ultimately hold that the Commerce Clause would not be violated by the Commission taxing Kathy\u2019s Nevada income. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the Commission on this issue, albeit for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">D. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision not to read the federal provisions for equitable relief urged by the Parkers into Idaho tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The Parkers argue that the district court erred in not reading into Idaho law two federal provisions that they claim would offer them equitable relief from paying income tax on one-half of David\u2019s Nevada earnings. The Parkers first argue that Idaho law should include the equivalent of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 66, entitled \u201cTreatment of Community Income,\u201d specifically section (c), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-7\">(c) Spouse relieved of liability in certain other cases</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-8\">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-9\">(1) an individual does not file a joint return for any taxable year,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-10\">(2) such individual does not include in gross income for such taxable year an item of community income properly includible therein which, in accordance with the rules contained in section 879(a), would be treated as the income of the other spouse,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-11\">(3) the individual establishes that he or she did not know of, and had no reason to know of, such item of community income, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-12\">(4) taking into account all facts and circumstances, it is inequitable to include such item of community income in such individual\u2019s gross income, then, for purposes of this title, such item of community income .shall be included in the gross income of the other spouse (and not in the gross income of the individual). Under procedures prescribed by the Secretary, if, taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it is inequitable to hold the individual liable for any unpaid tax or any deficiency (or any portion of either) attributable to any item for which relief is not available under the preceding sentence, the Secretary may relieve such individual of such liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">The Parkers further urge that Idaho law should include the equivalent of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6015, entitled \u201cRelief from joint and several liability on joint return,\u201d section (f) of which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-15\">(f) Equitable relief</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-16\">Under procedures prescribed by the Secretary, if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-17\">(1) taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it is inequitable to hold the individual liable for any unpaid tax or any deficiency (or any portion of either); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-18\">(2) relief is not available to such individual under subsection (b) or (c), the Secretary may relieve such individual of such liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-19\">The Parkers point to I.C. \u00a7 63-3002 to support their claim that the above provisions should be read into Idaho law and applied in this case in order to afford them relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-20\">Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3002 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-21\">It is the intent of the legislature by the adoption of this act, insofar as possible to make the provisions of the Idaho act identical to the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code relating to the measurement of taxable income, to the end that the taxable income reported each taxable year by a taxpayer to the internal revenue service shall be the identical sum reported to this state, subject only to modifications contained in the Idaho law; to achieve this result by the application of the various provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code relating to the definition of income, exceptions therefrom, deductions (personal and otherwise), accounting methods, taxation of trusts, estates, partnerships and corporations, basis and other pertinent provisions to gross income as defined therein, resulting in an amount called \u201ctaxable income\u201d in the Internal Revenue Code, and then to impose the provisions of this act thereon to derive a sum called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>\u201cIdaho taxable income\u201d; to impose a tax on residents of this state measured by-Idaho taxable income wherever derived and on the Idaho taxable income of nonresidents which is the result of activity within or derived from sources within this state. All of the foregoing is subject to modifications in Idaho law including, without limitation, modifications applicable to unitary groups of corporations, which include corporations incorporated outside the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">This statute says nothing about the application of federal provisions for equitable relief. Further, we have made clear that the statute \u201cdoes not incorporate by reference all provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code into Idaho tax law.\u201d <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>142 Idaho 790, 796, 134 P.3d 641, 647 (2006). Instead, as the district court properly observed, this Court has relied upon I.C. \u00a7 63-3002 to adopt federal tax provisions where Idaho law is silent, but has declined to adopt the federal tax code when it conflicts with Idaho law. <em>See, e.g., Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n v. Hautzinger, </em>137 Idaho 401, 403, 49 P.3d 406, 408 (2002) (adopting federal elements of tax fraud because Idaho law did not provide those elements); <em>Lockheed, </em>142 Idaho at 797, 134 P.3d at 648 (declining to adopt federal requirement that taxpayers receiving payments under long term contracts report property under construction in computing income because under I.C. \u00a7 63-3027 property under construction is excluded). Idaho law does have its own provisions for equitable relief: I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 63-3047 and 63-3048. The district court declined to read the above federal provisions into Idaho law because it found that I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 63-3047 and 63-3048 conflict with those provisions for the reason that, while not explicitly aimed at offering equitable relief to a non-resident facing taxation due to operation of Idaho community property law, they do \u201cprovide for a method by which the taxpayer and the Commission may compromise a dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">More than conflicting with the Idaho Code, the federal provisions urged by the Parkers do not apply to the Parkers\u2019 situation. The federal provisions are designed to offer an individual spouse equitable relief from tax liability attributable to the other spouse. That is, as between spouses, these regulations permit the Internal Revenue Service to allocate responsibility for payment of federal taxes. <em>Christensen v. C.I.R., </em>523 F.3d 957, 960 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe Commissioner has the authority to relieve one spouse from tax liability attributable to the other. <em>See, e.g., </em>[26 U.S.C.] \u00a7\u00a7 66(c), 6015(b), (c), (f).\u201d) Rev. Proc.2003-61, 2003 I.R.B. 296 \u00a7 4.02(l)(b) (\u201c[T]he Service ordinarily will grant equitable relief under section 6015(f) ... [if] the requesting spouse had no knowledge or reason to know that the nonrequesting spouse would not pay the income tax liability.\u201d) If one spouse is granted equitable relief, the other spouse is liable; the amount to which the federal treasury is entitled is not reduced. In this case, the Parkers ask us to grant Kathy relief from tax liability on one-half of David\u2019s Nevada earnings and attribute that liability to David instead. If the Court were to do this, however, unlike under the federal scheme, the State would lose out on that revenue altogether, since David is a Nevada resident and any state tax liability on his Nevada-sourced income would be owed to Nevada.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Furthermore, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 66(c) allows income attributable to one spouse to be attributed to the other spouse if the first spouse \u201cdoes not file a joint return for any taxable year.\u201d <em>Christensen, </em>523 F.3d at 962 (\u201cTaken together, the similar and separate equitable provisions indicate that Congress intended spouses facing joint liability from community property laws to seek equitable relief under \u00a7 66(e) and spouses facing joint liability from joint tax returns to seek equitable relief under \u00a7 6015(f).\u201d) Kathy would be ineligible for relief under \u00a7 66(e) because she and David filed joint returns for the relevant years. Kathy has further failed to establish \u201cthat ... she did not know of, and had no reason to know of\u2019 the fact that David was earning income in Nevada. Again, for this reason she would not be eligible for relief under \u00a7 66(c). <em>Hardy v. C.I.R., </em>181 F.3d 1002, 1007-08 (1999) (\u201cBecause Hardy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>aware that Mr. Hardy was employed and earning income, she had reason to know of the taxable income.... Thus, the Tax Court properly concluded that she did not qualify for innocent spouse treatment under \u00a7 66(c).\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3002 does not explicitly state that the State should adopt federal provisions for equitable relief from tax liability. That statute has been read as not requiring adoption of every federal tax procedure, and this Court has declined to adopt federal procedures when those procedures conflict with prescriptions in Idaho law. Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 63-3047 and 63-3048 provide a mechanism by which the Commission can grant equitable relief, and thus we decline to read federal provisions as preempting them, in particular when those provisions are not applicable to the case at hand. Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision not to adopt the federal provisions urged by the Parkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">E. We award the Commission attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">It should first be noted that although the Commission does not specify whether it seeks attorney fees for the proceedings below as well as on appeal, there is no indication that it raised any request for attorney fees with the district court. Thus, we only consider whether to award attorney fees on appeal. The Commission asks for an award of attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 63-3049, which states in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-7\">(a) Redetermination by the state tax commission may be reviewed in the district court for Ada county or the county in which the taxpayer resides or has his principal office or place of business by a complaint filed by the taxpayer against the state tax commission....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-8\">(d) Whenever it appears to the court that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-9\">(1) Proceedings before it have been instituted or maintained by a party primarily for delay; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-10\">(2) A party\u2019s position in such proceeding is frivolous or groundless; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-11\">(3)A party unreasonably failed to pursue available administrative remedies; the court, in its discretion, may require the party which did not prevail to pay to the prevailing party costs, expenses and attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">The Commission argues that not only is the holding in <em>Herndon v. West, </em>87 Idaho at 340, 393 P.2d at 37, (that the State may tax the income of a resident regardless of where it derives from) well-settled law, the Parkers failed to disclose the case in their opening brief, thereby taking a frivolous position.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">We agree. Despite the fact that <em>Herndon </em>is dispositive of the due process issue in this case, the Parkers fail to address it in their opening brief other than to mention that the district court relied on it in making its decision. Additionally, the Parkers urged this Court to consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal, despite long-standing precedent that we will not do so. Finally, the Parkers urged a violation of the Commerce Clause without showing how it applies to this case. Therefore, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 63-3049(d)(2), we award the Commission attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">We decline to consider whether the district court erred in applying Idaho community property law. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision that taxing Kathy\u2019s income does not violate due process; decline to address whether the court erred in refusing to strike portions of Gunter\u2019s affidavit; affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Commerce Clause is not violated in this case; and affirm the court\u2019s decision not to read federal equitable relief provisions into Idaho law. Attorney fees and costs on appeal to the Commission.</p>\n<judges id=\"b874-16\">Chief Justice EISMANN and Justices BURDICK, J. JONES and W. JONES concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-11\">. The decision was later amended to correct a clerical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">. Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3049 does not explicitly state that an application for review of a decision by the Commission, filed directly with the district court is to be heard <em>de novo. </em>Rather, I.C. \u00a7 63-3049(a) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AblD\">Redetermination by the state tax commission may be reviewed ... by a complaint filed by the taxpayer against the state tax commission within ninety-one (91) days after the receipt of notice of the decision of the state tax commission denying, in whole or in part, any protest of the taxpayer or, within the same period, by filing an appeal with the board of tax appeals. Upon the serving of summons upon the state tax commission <em>the case shall proceed as other civil cases </em>but may be heard by the judge in chambers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APb\">In the event that the taxpayer appeals to the board of tax appeals, subsequent proceedings before the district court are governed by I.C. \u00a7 63-3812(c). That statute provides that appeals to the district court \"shall be heard and determined by the court without a jury in a trial de novo on the issues in the same manner as though it were an original proceeding in that court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aji3H\">As these statutes are <em>in pari materia, </em>we conclude that the emphasized language of I.C. \u00a7 63-3049 directs that the district court proceedings are to be conducted <em>de novo </em>without the right to a jury trial.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\">. The district court rejected the Parkers\u2019 argument by pointing out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-9\">[t]here is evidence in the record sufficient to conclude that during the years at issue, Mr. Parker had an interest in income producing property located in Idaho. Further, half of the marital community was domiciled in Idaho. Mr. Parker has sufficient minimum contacts with the state of Idaho to subject him to income tax in the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Presumably, the evidence that the district court was referring to is the information in Gunter's affidavit, contained in paragraph 24, which indicates that David had taxable income derived from Idaho sources during the years in question. Accordingly, even if the district court erred in refusing to strike paragraph 24 of Gunter\u2019s affidavit as the Parkers now urge, such error would be harmless, and we therefore need not address the issue.
