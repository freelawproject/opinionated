At the suggestion of the equipment owner, the customer agreed to enter into a lease-purchase agreement if the equipment owner could find an entity that would finance the transaction. The equipment owner contacted a leasing broker, who contacted a financing entity that agreed to purchase the equipment and lease it to the customer under a lease-purchase agreement. The customer defaulted, the financing entity repossessed and sold the equipment, and it then sued the customer for the deficiency. The customer counterclaimed against the financing entity and filed a third-party claim against the original equipment owner. The customer appeals from judgments in favor of those parties. We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b541-17\">G. Alan McRae (Seller) was doing business in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Idaho Falls, Idaho, under the name of Lund Machinery. In 2003, he had leased a forklift to Rocky Mountain Rogues, Inc., a business located in Alpine, Wyoming, which was operated by James Blittersdorf and Glenna Blittersdorf-Christofferson (all collectively called Lessees). Lessees dealt with Keith Webb, an employee of Seller, in that transaction. During that lease, Lessees purchased a 1.5-yard bucket to use on the forklift.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-18\">In January 2006, Keith Webb approached Lessees and asked if they would be interested in converting the lease into a lease-purchase agreement. Lessees indicated they would, on the condition that they did not have to pay any money up front. Lessees had an option to purchase the forklift, and if they exercised that option a portion of the lease payments would be applied to the purchase price. Lessees contend that Webb assured them that with the \u201cequity\u201d they had in the forklift and by using the bucket as a down payment, Lessees would not have to pay any money up front to purchase the forklift.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-19\">Webb agreed to contact someone who could arrange the lease-purchase transaction. A short time later, Lessees received a call from Joe Leslie (Broker), an independent lease broker working for FCI Financial Services, Inc., in Denver, Colorado. Broker said he had been contacted by Webb and would send Lessees an application, and he did so. Broker worked out the terms of the lease-purchase agreement with Lessees and with Triad Leasing &amp; Financial, Inc., (Lessor) located in Boise, Idaho, the party that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>finance the transaction. In February, Broker notified Lessor that Lessees also wanted to finance the purchase of a jib boom, and Lessor agreed to add it to the lease-purchase agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">On March 15, 2006, Bennett Coffman, an employee of Seller, arrived at Lessees\u2019 place of business with three proposed contracts: an \u201cEquipment Lease Contract,\u201d an \u201cEquipment Purchase Agreement,\u201d and a \u201cLease Addendum.\u201d (Collectively called Agreement). Prior to that date, Lessees had not had any contact with Lessor. Under the Agreement, Lessees would lease from Lessor the forklift, the bucket, and the jib boom, and at the end of the lease they would have an option to purchase that equipment for $5,000. The Agreement also provided for a $5,000 security deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">After Lessees signed the Agreement, Coffman requested a cheek. When Lessees said that it was their understanding that they would not have to pay any money up front, Coffman said he knew nothing about the transaction and would get Broker on the telephone. He did so, and Lessees talked with Broker about the requested check. After that conversation, Lessees gave Coffman a check payable to \u201cTriad Leasing Financial\u201d for $5,600, which represented the $5,000 security deposit, $250 for Wyoming sales tax, and $350 for a document fee. Lessees assert that after their conversation with Broker, they understood that the check would be held and not cashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Lessor had agreed to purchase the forklift, bucket, and jib boom from Seller in order to lease them to Lessees. Therefore, the Agreement included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AumY\">Lessee hereby acknowledges that, although Lessee has signed the Lease Agreement on the above described Equipment, the Equipment has <em>not </em>been delivered or installed, or is being used on a test period. Lessee understands and agrees that Lessor shall have no obligation to pay for the Equipment until Lessee has \u201caccepted\u201d the Equipment and Lessor has accepted the Lease at their office. By signing below, Lessee specifically authorizes Lessor to accept an Oral Acceptance from Lessee. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">On March 20, 2006, Vickie Turner, an employee of Lessor, closed the transaction. Before releasing the funds to Seller, she needed the Lessees\u2019 verbal acceptance of the leased equipment. Broker had informed her to contact him so that he could have Lessees contact her due to Lessees\u2019 busy schedule. She called Broker, and later that day Jim Blittersdorf called her and orally accepted the leased equipment. She then released $56,465.68 to Seller to purchase the leased equipment and $2,500.00 to Broker for his commission and deposited Lessees\u2019 $5,600 check.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">On March 31, 2006, Lessor was notified that Lessees\u2019 check was dishonored due to insufficient funds. Lessor made several telephone calls to Blittersdorf leaving messages to call about the dishonored check, but he did not return the calls. Lessor also called Broker, who on April 5, 2006, stated that Blittersdorf claimed to have mailed Lessor a check on March 31, 2006, but that check never arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">By letter dated April 11, 2006, Lessor notified Lessees that it had exercised its right under the Agreement to declare all future lease payments due and demanded that Lessees pay the sum of $92,701.70 within ten days. On April 13, 2006, Blittersdorf called an employee of Lessor and stated that he was trying to get refinancing for a commercial property. Lessor\u2019s employee stated that Lessor needed a cashier\u2019s check by April 14, 2006. The employee asked Blittersdorf why this happened, and he responded that he did not know about the \u201cupfront money\u201d until the last minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Lessees did not make any payment, and Lessor hired someone to repossess the equipment. That person reported that he had to hot wire the forklift because Blittersdorf would not give him the key. The forklift and bucket were sold at a public auction on July 12, 2006. The jib boom was not repossessed, apparently because Seller had not delivered it to Lessees.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">On July 26, 2006, Lessor sent Lessees a letter demanding payment of $58,754.80 within ten days, the balance owing after deducting the net proceeds from the auction. Les<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>sees did not pay that amount, and on August 8, 2006, Lessor filed this action to recover that sum. Lessees answered and filed a counterclaim against Lessor and a third-party claim against Seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Seller moved for summary judgment. After argument on the motion, the district court granted the motion on November 7, 2007. The claims between Lessor and Lessees were tried to the district court, and on February 14, 2008, it entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law finding in favor of Lessor on all claims. On February 28, 2008, the court entered a judgment in favor of Lessor against Lessees which awarded Lessor damages in the sum of $72,334.40, including prejudgment interest, and dismissed Lessees\u2019 counterclaim. On March 31, 2008, the court entered a judgment in favor of Seller on all claims asserted against it by Lessees. The court later awarded Seller costs totaling $17,131.82, which included attorney fees pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3). Lessees timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">II. ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">1. Did the district court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Seller?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">2. Did the district court err in finding that Lessor had not breached the Agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">3. Did the district court err in finding that Lessees had breached the Agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">4. Is any party entitled to an award of attorney fees on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">A. Did the District Court Err in Granting Summary Judgment in Favor of Seller?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">In its third-party complaint, Lessees asserted claims against Seller for breach of contract, fraud, and violation of the Idaho Consumer Protection Act. The district court granted summary judgment dismissing those claims. Lessees contend on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing the breach of contract and fraud claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">1. Breach of contract claim based upon Seller being an agent of Lessor. Lessees contend on appeal, \u201cThe basis for the claim of a breach of contract against Lund is founded on Lund\u2019s creation of a contract with Rocky Mountain directly and/or being an agent of Triad.\u201d With respect to the claim that Seller was an agent of Lessor, Lessees argue: \u201cIn considering a breach of contract the District Court relied upon paragraph 4(b) of the contract wherein Triad attempts to disclaim any connection to an individual or entity as an agent. Despite this disclaimer language, every action of Lund indicated an agency relationship.\u201d Paragraph 4(b) of the Agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-17\">4. NO RIGHT TO CANCEL AND OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS OF THE LEASE. You agree as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-18\">(b) <em>THE LESSOR IS NOT RELATED TO </em>MANUFACTURER(S) OR <em>VENDOR </em>(S); NO CLAIMS TO BE MADE AGAINST LESSOR. <em>WE ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE VENDOR (S) </em>OR MANUFACTURER(S). <em>NEITHER THE VENDOR </em>(S) <em>NOR ANYONE ELSE IS AN AGENT OF OURS </em>AND NO STATEMENT, REPRESENTATION, GUARANTEE, OR WARRANTY MADE BY THE VENDOR(S) OR OTHER PERSON(S) IS BINDING ON US OR WILL AFFECT YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO US.....(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-20\">In granting Seller\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court correctly ruled that there was no genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether Seller was an agent of Lessor. The undisputed facts showed it was not. We need not examine Lessees\u2019 arguments regarding the existence of such alleged agency, however, because Seller would not be a party to the Agreement even if it were an agent of Lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-21\">\u201cA person making a contract with another as an agent for a disclosed principal does not become a party to the contract.\u201d <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Turner Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>96 Idaho 691, 696-97, 535 P.2d 664, 669-70 (1975). In this case, Lessor was expressly named as a party to the contract. The Agreement states on its face that \u201cLessor (\u2018Us\u2019)\u201d is \u201cTriad Leasing &amp; Finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>cial, Inc.\u201d and that \u201cLessee (You\u2019)\u201d is \u201cRocky Mountain Rogues, Inc.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The face of the contract also states that \u201cVendor\u201d is \u201cAs Detailed On \u2018Exhibit A,\u2019 Attached,\u201d and the attached Exhibit A identifies the Vendor as \u201cLund Machinery Company.\u201d The Agreement also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">1. REQUEST FOR US TO ACQUIRE EQUIPMENT FOR YOU. You (the Lessee identified above) wish to acquire certain equipment from the Vendor(s) identified above. Rather than purchasing it yourself, you have come to us and asked us to purchase it and then lease it to you. In exchange for our agreement to do this, you have agreed to all of the terms in this Lease Agreement (\u201cLease\u201d).....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Thus, because Lessor was disclosed as the contracting party in the Agreement, Seller would not be liable on the contract even if he had been an agent of Lessor. Because Seller was not a party to the Agreement, it could not be liable for breach of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Lessees claim that Seller was a party to the Agreement because \u201c[t]he contract itself states that Rocky Mountain has rights against the vendor.\u201d In making this argument, Lessees misstate the applicable provision of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Paragraph 3(d) of the Agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">3. YOUR SELECTION OF THE VENDOR(S) AND THE EQUIPMENT. You hereby acknowledge and agree:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">(d) PRIOR TO EXECUTING THE LEASE, YOU RECEIVED AND APPROVED THE SUPPLY CONTRACT (IF ANY) BETWEEN U.S. AND THE VENDOR(S), AND YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED IN WRITING (OR ARE NOW ADVISED HEREBY) THAT YOU MAY HAVE RIGHTS AGAINST THE VENDOR\u00a9 UNDER THE SUPPLY CONTRACT (IF ANY) AND THAT YOU MAY CONTACT THE VENDOR(S) FOR INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOUR RIGHTS AGAINST THE VENDOR\u00a9 ARE (IF ANY).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">This provision states that Lessees <em>may </em>have rights against Seller under the <em>supply contract, </em>if there is a supply contract, and that Lessees should contact Seller to determine what rights, if any, they may have under that contract. It does not state that Lessees have any rights against Seller under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">Lessees also claim that \u201c[t]he final box on the document states that there is no obligation to pay for the equipment on the lease until it has been delivered.\u201d The \u201cfinal box\u201d in the Agreement includes a provision stating, \u201cLessee understands and agrees that Lessor shall have no obligation to pay for the Equipment until Lessee has \u2018accepted\u2019 the Equipment and Lessor has accepted the Lease at their office. By signing below, Lessee specifically authorizes Lessor to accept an Oral Acceptance from Lessee.\u201d Under this provision, Lessor did not have to pay for the equipment until Lessees orally stated that they had accepted it. Although in this case it would be Seller who was obligated to deliver the equipment to Lessees, this provision does not in any way make Seller a party to the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">In granting Seller\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court stated, \u201cThe contract between Rocky Mountain and Triad is clear and unambiguous. Lund is not a party to it, and assumed no obligations under it.\u201d The district court did not err in holding that Seller was not a party to the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">2. Breach of contract claim based upon a separate oral agreement with Seller. Lessees next contend, \u201cEven if Lund was not an agent for Triad, the District Court committed error in determining that there was no issue of material fact as to Rocky Mountain proving a claim of breach of contract against Lund.\u201d According to Lessees, \u201can agreement was reached between rocky [sic] Mountain and Lund before the Triad contract came into existence.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) This alleged oral contract was that Seller would sell to Lessees the forklift and jib boom, the bucket would be a security deposit for the sale, and Seller would service the equipment and find an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>entity to finance Lessees\u2019 purchase. Lessees assert that Seller performed this oral contract \u201cby taking the equipment back and servicing it for the purchase\u201d and that Lessees performed the contract \u201cby providing financial information to process the purchase.\u201d Lessees do not explain why they would contract to lease the forklift and jib boom from Lessor if they already had entered into a binding contract to purchase those same items from Seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Lessees argue that the district court failed to address this oral contract in granting Seller\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court undoubtedly did not do so because Lessees did not allege it as one of their claims against Seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In their answer, Lessees admitted that \u201c[o]n or about March 15, 2006, [Lessees] entered into a Lease Agreement with [Lessor] for the lease of certain equipment for business purposes\u201d and that \u201c[a] true and correct copy of the Lease Agreement is attached hereto [to the complaint] as Exhibit A.\u201d A copy of the Agreement was attached as Exhibit A to Lessor\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In their counterclaim against Lessor, Lessees first stated that they \u201chereby re-allege all admissions, denials and affirmative defenses as set forth above [in Lessees\u2019 answer to Lessor\u2019s complaint] as if set forth in full hereinafter.\u201d They then alleged that Lessor: \u201cbreached the contract by failing to deliver the jib boom to the [Lessees]\u201d; \u201cbreached the contract by demanding payments from the [Lessees] before they were due under the terms of the contract\u201d; \u201cbreached the contract by declaring the [Lessees] to be in default before any obligation was due\u201d; and \u201cbreached the contract by repossessing the forklift when the [Lessees] were not in default under the terms of the contract.\u201d The references to \u201cthe contract\u201d in the counterclaim could only mean the Agreement because that was the only contract mentioned between Lessor and Lessees.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In their third-party claim against Seller, Lessees first stated that they \u201crestate the allegations set forth in [Lessee\u2019s counterclaim against Lessor] as if fully set forth herein.\u201d Thus, Lessees began their third-party claim by re-alleging all admissions, denials, affirmative defenses, and allegations they had made against Lessor in their answer and counterclaim. Their breach-of-contract allegations were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">\n<em>COUNT ONE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">\n<em>BREACH OF CONTRACT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">54. The Defendants/Third Party Plaintiffs purchased the equipment described herein, based upon the representations of Lund/McRae; Lund/ McRae arranged for financing, and said purchase was exclusively based upon the representations and agreements made by Lund/McRae. Lund/ McRae individually and in concert with the Plaintiff breached the contract by failing to deliver the jib boom to Defendants/Third Party Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">55. McRae/Lund individually and in concert with the Plaintiff caused breached [sic] the contract by demanding payments before they were due under the terms of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\">56. McRae/Lund individually and in concern [sic] with Plaintiffs caused the breach of the contract by declaring the Defendants/Third Party Plaintiffs to be in default before the obligation was due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-15\">57. McRae/Lund caused the notification of breach of the contract and repossession of the forklift when the Defendants/Third Party Plaintiffs were not in default under the terms of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-16\">58. Because of the McRae/Lund\u2019s breaches outlined above the Defendants/Third Party Plaintiffs have suffered damages in an amount to be determined at trial including, the loss of use of the forklift, the loss of the down payment accrued through the two years of lease payments and the attorney\u2019s fees and costs accrued in the defense of this action. The third-party defendants are liable and responsible to the Defendants/Third Party Plaintiffs for any damages awarded the Plaintiff herein on their claim against the Defendants/Third Party Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">In their third-party claim against Seller, Lessees alleged that Seller had breached \u201cthe contract\u201d by taking certain actions \u201cindi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>vidually and in concert with\u201d Lessor. The actions by Seller that allegedly breached \u201cthe contract\u201d were the same alleged actions by which Lessor breached the Agreement. Lessees alleged that Seller \u201cindividually and in concert with\u201d Lessor: \u201cbreached the contract by failing to deliver the jib boom\u201d; \u201cbreached the contract by demanding payments before they were due under the terms of the contract\u201d; and \u201ccaused the breach of the contract by declaring the [Lessees] to be in default before the obligation was due.\u201d They also alleged that Seller \u201ccaused the notification of breach of the contract and repossession of the forklift when the [Lessees] were not in default under the terms of the contract.\u201d The breach-of-contract allegations in Lessees\u2019 third-party claim clearly only referred to an alleged breach of the Agreement. There is no reference to any other contract that Seller could have breached by taking actions \u201cindividually and in concert with\u201d Lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In addition, when defending against Seller\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Lessees did not argue that their third-party claim alleged that Seller had breached an oral contract. The basis of their defense to summary judgment on their breach-of-contract claim was the argument that \u201cit\u2019s our belief that there is an agency relationship by implication between [Seller] and [Lessor]\u201d and that \u201c[Lessees] assumed they were one and the same entity. ... an interrelated company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Lessees third-party claim against Seller could not reasonably be construed as alleging the breach of an oral contract with Seller entered into before Lessees entered into the Agreement. The district court did not err in failing to address a claim that was not alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">3. Fraud. In its third-party claim against Seller, Lessees alleged that \u201c[Seller] in conjunction with [Lessor] represented that it would need a $5,600.00 check from the [Lessees] though it was never to be negotiated (cashed) and was only required as documentation for the purchase transaction and that the inclusion of the already purchased bucket as part of the sale would serve as the security.\u201d Lessees had made the same allegation in its counterclaim against Lessor, although they alleged that Seller made the misrepresentation \u201cas agent and representative of\u2019 Lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The $5,600 check was made payable to Lessor. Lessees do not contend that Seller agreed to hold that check for five years until the end of the lease term. They allege that Seller misrepresented that Lessor would hold the check and never cash it. Relying upon <em>First Security Bank of Idaho, N.A. v. Gaige, </em>115 Idaho 172, 175, 765 P.2d 683, 686 (1988), the district court held that Seller\u2019s alleged misrepresentation regarding Lessor not cashing the check was not sufficient to show fraud because it was a promise of a future event, not a representation of existing facts. An action for fraud cannot be based upon a statement of a future event unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the person making the representation knew, at the time the representation was made, that the future event could not occur. <em>Thomas v. Med. Ctr. Physicians, P.A., </em>138 Idaho 200, 207, 61 P.3d 557, 564 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">On appeal, Lessees contend that Seller\u2019s alleged misrepresentation that Lessor would never cash the check was not a promise of future conduct. It was a misrepresentation that the check was only a \u201cpaper trail\u201d rather than a check for payment of the deposit and closing costs. A paper trail is \u201c[d]oeumentary evidence of one\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, </em>http://dictionary.reference.com/ browse/paper trail.htm (accessed: Dee. 11, 2009). Lessees offer no explanation as to what action the check was supposed to document. Obviously, it would not document the payment of the security deposit because if the check was never to be cashed, there would be no payment of the security deposit. The only action the check could document is that Blittersdorf had made a check dated \u201c3-15-06\u201d payable to \u201cTriad Leasing Financial\u201d in the sum of \u201c$5,600.00.\u201d Lessees offer no explanation as to why Seller would want to document that action when the check was never to be negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">In their briefs on appeal, Lessees do not cite to any evidence in the record supporting their fraud allegation against Sell<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>er. During argument on the motion for summary judgment, Seller\u2019s counsel referred to two affidavits filed by Lessees in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, but those affidavits are not in the record on appeal. \u201cError will not be presumed on appeal but must be affirmatively shown on the record by appellant. Where an incomplete record is presented to this Court, the missing portions of that record are to be presumed to support the action of the trial court.\u201d <em>Rutter v. McLaughlin, </em>101 Idaho 292, 293, 612 P.2d 135, 136 (1980) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">In their third-party claim, Lessees alleged that Seller represented that the check would not be negotiated, but they did not identify the person who allegedly made that representation on behalf of Seller. In his trial testimony, Blittersdorf testified that it was actually Broker who allegedly made that representation. According to Blittersdorf, \u201cwe never discussed giving an actual check\u201d until Coffman asked for one on March 15, 2006, when he obtained Lessees\u2019 signatures on the Agreement. When Coffman asked for the check, Blittersdorf testified that he responded by telling Coffman \u201cthat that was not the agreement\u201d and that Coffman then called Broker and had Blittersdorf discuss the check with him. After discussing the check with Broker, Blittersdorf testified that he gave Coffman the check for $5,600 because \u201cI was told the check would never be cashed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AsO\">It is clear from Blittersdorfs testimony that any representation allegedly made that Lessor would never cash the check would have been made by Broker. Although Lessees argued in opposition to the motion for summary judgment that Blittersdorf \u201cdealt with a guy on the phone named Joe Leslie [Broker], but he assumed that Joe Leslie was part of Triad or part of Lund,\u201d Lessees do not cite to any evidence establishing an agency relationship between Broker and either Seller or Lessor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lessees have not shown that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their fraud claim against Seller.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATv8\">B. Did the District Court Err in Finding that Lessor Had Not Breached the Agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"AUG\">In their counterclaim against Lessor, Lessees alleged that Lessor \u201cbreached the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>contract by declaring the Defendants to be in default before any obligation was due.\u201d The district court found that Lessor had not breached the Agreement, and Lessees contend that such finding is erroneous for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">First, Lessees state, \u201cThe contract states that payments are not due until acceptance of the delivery of the equipment.\u201d Referring to a table on the first page of the Agreement entitled \u201cRental Payment Schedule,\u201d Lessees then state that \u201cat best, a one time payment of $5,000.00 is stated to be due \u2018Upon Acceptance of Equipment Delivery.\u2019 \u201d If that interpretation is correct, then the security deposit would have been due on March 20, 2006, when Blittersdorf told Turner that he accepted delivery of the equipment. However, Lessees then state, \u201cAs noted in the section above, the clear language of the contract would state that the one time payment upon acceptance of equipment delivery was $.00.\u201d In their reply brief, Lessees refer to this \u201conetime payment of zero\u201d as support for stating, \u201cAt the time of signing the contract, or at the time of accepting the contract, there was no payment due.\u201d Thus, they seem to argue that the Agreement only provided for one, one-time payment, and it was \u201c$.00,\u201d not the $5,000 security deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Lessees\u2019 arguments in another portion of their brief undermine this argument. The table to which Lessees refer consists of seven columns. The first column is entitled \u201cTerm (months),\u201d and the number \u201c60\u201d is entered in that column. The second through fifth columns are divided into two rows. Those columns are entitled \u201cTotal # of Payments,\u201d \u201cAmount of Each Payment,\u201d \u201cPayment Due Dates,\u201d and \u201cPayment Frequency.\u201d The entries in the first row state that there is \u201c1\u201d payment in the amount of \u201c$.00\u201d that is due \u201cUpon Acceptance of Equipment Delivery,\u201d and that it is a \u201cOne Time\u201d payment. The entries in the second row state that there are \u201c59\u201d payments in the amount of \u201c$1,406.00\u201d each that are due \u201cMonthly Beginning: April 20, 2006\u201d and that are to be paid \u201cMonthly.\u201d The sixth column in the table is entitled \u201cInterim Rent Paid,\u201d and \u201c$.00\u201d is entered in that column. The seventh column is entitled \u201cSecurity Deposit,\u201d and \u201c$5,000.00\u201d is entered in that column. There is no entry in the table expressly stating when the security deposit is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The reference to a one-time payment of $0.00 due upon acceptance of equipment delivery is contained on the first row of the second through fifth columns. In another part of their brief, Lessees explained the problem of construing the information on that row as applying to the seventh column listing the security deposit. They wrote: \u201cThe final section [in the table] is the Security Deposit that indicates $5,000.00. <em>This section is not logically connected to the column to the left or any other columns. </em>The horizontal line is not extended through the previous column.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The \u201chorizontal line\u201d to which Lessees refer is the line dividing the second through fifth columns into two rows. That line does not extend to the right through the sixth column entitled \u201cInterim Rent Paid\u201d or the seventh column entitled \u201cSecurity Deposit.\u201d It also does not extend to the left through the first column entitled \u201cTerm (months).\u201d Thus, if as Lessees argue in the other portion of their brief, the entries stating there is a one-time payment of $0.00 due upon acceptance of equipment delivery are \u201cnot logically connected\u201d to the column stating the security deposit, those entries could not be construed as excluding any requirement to pay the security deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The Agreement is ambiguous as to when the security deposit was to be paid. Paragraph 7 of the Agreement indicates that the security deposit would be paid before the Agreement became effective. That paragraph states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">7. ADVANCE PAYMENT(S) AND/OR SECURITY DEPOSIT. <em>You have paid us one or more advance payments and/or a security deposit in the amount(s) indicated above. If the Lease does not commence </em>for reasons other than our negligence, we may retain such monies to compensate us for our credit analysis and other administrative costs. Any security deposit collected can be used at Lessor\u2019s discretion to pay any of your Obligations due on this Lease or otherwise. If any part of a security deposit remains at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the end of the Term of the Lease, we will return the remainder to you, without interest, provided, however, you are not then in default under the Lease. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">There are no \u201cadvance payments\u201d that are \u201cindicated above\u201d in the lease-purchase agreement, but there is a $5,000 security deposit indicated above. The above-quoted provision states that with respect to the security deposit, Lessor could retain such monies if the lease does not commence for reasons other than Lessor\u2019s negligence. Lessor would not be able to retain the security deposit if the lease does not commence only if the security deposit was paid before Lessor signed the Agreement. In addition, the conduct of the parties shows that the security deposit was due upon the signing of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The interpretation of an ambiguous contract is a question of fact which focuses upon the intent of the parties. <em>Bream v. Benscoter, </em>139 Idaho 364, 367, 79 P.3d 723, 726 (2003). \u201cA trial court\u2019s findings of fact will not be set aside on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When determining the parties\u2019 intent, the court considers \u201cthe contract as a whole, the language used in the document, the circumstances under which it was made, the objective and purpose of the particular provision, and any construction placed upon it by the contracting parties as shown by their conduct or dealings.\u201d <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. Bosen, </em>144 Idaho 611, 614, 167 P.3d 748, 751 (2006). The district court determined that Lessees did not pay the security deposit when it was due, and Lessees have not shown that such finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Lessees next assert, \u201cAgain on the bottom of the contract in the last boxed section, the document states there is no obligation to pay until acceptance of the delivery.\u201d As stated above, Lessees misstate the contract language. The Agreement actually states in that box, \u201cLessee understands and agrees that <em>Lessor </em>shall have no obligation to pay for the Equipment until Lessee has \u2018accepted\u2019 the Equipment____\u201d (Emphasis added.) Lessees apparently misread \u201cLessor\u201d as being \u201cLessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Next, Lessees state, \u201cThe contract states that the acceptance of delivery did not occur until March 20, 2006. By claiming a breach in the contract from the March 17, 2006 payment, Triad breached the contract.\u201d Lessor\u2019s letter dated April 11, 2006, stated, \u201cThe account is presently past due for the March 17, 2006 payment.\u201d During the trial, Lessor\u2019s collection manager testified that the date was in error. It should have been March 15, 2006, representing the date of the Lessees\u2019 check. That error is meaningless. The Agreement does not require Lessor to give Lessees notice of default and an opportunity to cure. It states that a default occurs when \u201cYou, or any guarantor of this lease fail to make any rental or other payment within a period of ten (10) days after the due date.\u201d It also provides the Lessor can take action to collect \u201c[i]n the event you default under this Lease.\u201d Thus, the notice of acceleration was valid if, on April 11, 2006, Lessees were more than ten days past due in paying the security deposit. A dishonored check is not a payment. <em>Western Idaho Prod. Credit Ass\u2019n v. Simplot Feed Lots, Inc., </em>106 Idaho 260, 262, 678 P.2d 52, 54 (1984). The district court did not err in holding that Lessees were more than ten days past due in paying the security deposit by April 11, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Next, Lessees state, \u201cThe District Court also committed error in finding that the delivery of the equipment did not matter based on paragraph 8 of the contract.\u201d Paragraph 8 of the Agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">8. EQUIPMENT DELIVERY. You understand and agree that we are not responsible for packaging, delivery, installation, or testing of the Equipment. You (and/or the Vendor(s), if you have made such arrangements with the Vendor(s)) are responsible for all such matters. You agree that you will not have any complaint against us if the Vendor(s) or any other person(s) improperly packages the Equipment or delays in delivering or installing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbS7\">Lessees assert, \u201cWhile Triad may not have been responsible for the delivery of the equipment, they cannot have an enforceable contract without the equipment being delivered.\u201d They neither cite authority nor provide argument supporting this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Lessor does not provide any equipment. It only finances lease transactions. As happened in this case, its lessees select the vendor and the equipment, and the vendors are responsible for delivering the equipment to the lessees. In this case, once Blittersdorf gave Lessor oral acceptance of delivery of the equipment, Lessor paid the vendor (Seller). At that time, Seller had not delivered the jib boom to Lessees, but Blittersdorf was apparently willing to trust Seller to do so. If he was not, then he should not have given Lessor oral acceptance of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Next, Lessees contend that the district court erred in finding that Blittersdorf had given Turner, Lessor\u2019s employee, oral acceptance of delivery because \u201cshe testified that she had no way to ensure that the person who called her and claimed to be Mr. Blittersdorf was in fact Mr. Blittersdorf.\u201d Turner testified several times, without objection, that Blittersdorf contacted her by telephone on March 20, 2006. She stated that Broker had instructed her to contact him so he could have Blittersdorf call, due to Blittersdorfs busy schedule. When she was ready to obtain the verbal acceptance of the equipment, she called Broker, and she was later contacted by Blittersdorf. He told her about his bar and website, and she asked for the website address and looked up the website. She asked for Blittersdorfs address and the physical address of the equipment, and his answers matched the mailing address and equipment location on the Agreement. She also asked if he had the equipment, if he was ready to accept it, and if he was ready for her to release funds, and he answered \u201cYes\u201d to all of those questions. On cross-examination, she admitted that it was possible that Broker\u2019s assistant could have been impersonating Blittersdorf, but she also stated that she had no reason to doubt she was talking to Blittersdorf.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Blittersdorf testified during that trial that he was positive he had never called Lessor and that he did not call Lessor and confirm that he had all of the equipment. However, he was impeached with his pretrial deposition testimony in which he stated several times that he did not know whether he had talked to anyone from Lessor about accepting delivery of the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u201cA trial court\u2019s findings of fact will not be set aside on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous. When deciding whether findings of fact are clearly erroneous, this Court does not substitute its view of the facts for that of the trial court.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Madsen, </em>142 Idaho 635, 637, 132 P.3d 392, 394 (2006). \u201cIt is the province of the trial court to determine the credibility of witnesses, the weight to be given their testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>KMST, LLC v. County of Ada, </em>138 Idaho 577, 581, 67 P.3d 56, 60 (2003). The district court found that Turner\u2019s testimony was more credible than Blittersdorfs. The court\u2019s finding that he orally accepted delivery of the equipment is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">C. Did the District Court Err in Finding that Lessees Had Breached the Agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The district court found that Lessees had breached the Agreement by failing to pay the $5,000 deposit when due. Lessees make several arguments in challenging that finding, each of which will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">1. Finding that the Agreement was clear and unambiguous. In granting Seller\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court wrote: \u201cThe contract between Rocky Mountain and Triad is clear and unambiguous. Lund is not a party to it, and assumed no obligations under it.\u201d Lessees argue that this was error because \u201cthere are numerous inconsistencies and ambiguities in the contract that require additional information to ascertain the meaning of the provisions and the intent of the parties.\u201d The asserted inconsistencies or ambiguities are: (a) the Agreement has an inconsistency because it gives Lessees\u2019 address as the \u201cEquipment Location,\u201d but also provides that Lessees must accept the equipment, indicating it has not yet been delivered; (b) the Agreement is ambiguous as to when the $5,000 security deposit was to be paid; and (c) various provisions of the Agreement, when taken together, create an inconsistency and ambiguity because \u201cthe contract cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>be completed and enforced until delivery of the equipment is completed but even if there is no delivery, it is not Triad\u2019s responsibility so there is no possible claim against them.\u201d According to Lessees, \u201cThe inconsistencies require outside information and corroboration to ascertain their meaning and reconcile the differences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">When read in context, the district court\u2019s finding that the Agreement was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d was in connection with the fact that Seller was not a party to the contract. The Agreement was clear and unambiguous with respect to that issue. The court did not state that every single provision in the contract was clear and unambiguous. If Lessees contended that any relevant provisions in the Agreement were ambiguous, they could have offered parol evidence during the trial to clarify such provisions. They do not contend that they attempted to do so and that the district court wrongly excluded such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">2. Ambiguity as to when $5, 000 deposit was due. Lessees state that the Agreement is ambiguous as to when the security deposit was due. They are correct that the Agreement does not expressly state when the security deposit was due. But, as discussed above, the district court found that Lessees had failed to pay the security deposit when due, and that finding is supported by substantial and competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">D. Is Any Party Entitled to an Award of Attorney Fees on Appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Lessees seek an award of attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 12-120 and 12-121. Because those statutes only provide for the award of attorney fees to a prevailing party, Lessees are not entitled to an award of attorney fees. <em>Costa v. Borges, </em>145 Idaho 353, 359, 179 P.3d 316, 322 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Lessor seeks an award of attorney fees on appeal pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3), which provides for the awarding of attorney fees in an action to recover on a guaranty and in a commercial transaction. The Agreement provides that in the event of default, Lessor could file a lawsuit and recover \u201call of our reasonable legal costs, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Lessor has prevailed in this appeal and is entitled to an award of attorney fees under the Agreement and under section 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">Seller seeks an award of attorney fees under Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 12-120(3) and 12-121. Lessees alleged that Seller breached a contract (the Agreement) that was a commercial transaction and committed fraud in inducing Lessees to enter into that contract. Because Seller is the prevailing party, he is entitled to an award of attorney fees on appeal under section 12-120(3). <em>Farmers Nat\u2019l Bank v. Shirey, </em>126 Idaho 63, 73, 878 P.2d 762, 772 (1994) (\u2018Where a party alleges the existence of a contractual relationship of a type embraced by section 12-120(3), ... that claim triggers the application of the statute and a prevailing party may recover fees even though no liability under a contract was established.\u201d); <em>Blimka v. My Web Wholesaler, LLC, </em>143 Idaho 723, 728-29, 152 P.3d 594, 599-600 (2007) (attorney fees are awardable under section 12-120(3) on a claim alleging that fraud induced the prevailing party to enter into a commercial transaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">We affirm the judgments of the district court. We award respondents costs on appeal, including attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b551-16\">Justices BURDICK, J.
