We reverse the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-23\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b969-24\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. Between the late evening of September 15, 2006, and the early morning of September 16, 2006, two undercover Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC) officers, Corporal Tim Davidson and Sergeant Greg Harris, who are trained to identify intoxicated people, arrived at the Shot Glass bar in Orofino, Idaho. Boyd is the owner and operator of the Shot Glass. Davidson and Harris observed an individual at the Shot Glass who was getting too close to people and being so loud and boisterous that people were moving away from him. The individual smelled of alcohol and had a flushed face, bloodshot eyes, and slurred speech, and was swaying, staggering, and stumbling into people and furniture and knocking things off the bar. After witnessing this behavior, Davidson and Harris further observed Dawn Moler, one of the Shot Glass bartenders, serve alcohol to the individual. Davidson and Harris identified the customer as Justin Anderson. Harris made contact with Anderson, who was argumentative and unable to comprehend Harris\u2019 ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>tions. Davidson cited Moler for a misdemeanor violation of I.C. \u00a7 23-615 for serving an obviously intoxicated person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Based upon the events described above, ABC filed administrative violation notice 06ABC-COM077, along with a complaint seeking suspension of Boyd\u2019s license under authority of I.C. \u00a7 23-933, alleging that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 was violated when Moler served alcohol to Anderson, who was obviously intoxicated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Boyd moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. The hearing officer declined to rule on the motion to dismiss because the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act (IDAPA) 04.11.01.415 precludes a hearing officer from determining the constitutionality of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">A hearing was held on November 15, 2007, at which Moler testified that from her bar-tending experience she was very familiar with the way Anderson would act whenever he was intoxicated, including his taking on a \u201ccocky attitude\u201d and his failure to \u201cwalk normal.\u201d The hearing officer noted that although Moler testified that she did not believe Anderson to be intoxicated at the time she admittedly served him two beers, Harris and Davidson testified that they observed Anderson at the time Moler served him exhibiting the very characteristics that Moler described. The hearing officer also considered the testimony of Orofino Sheriff Deputy Carson, who observed that Anderson had bloodshot eyes and was belligerent towards Harris. The hearing officer concluded, based on the testimony of Moler, Davidson, Hams, and Carson, that Anderson was apparently or obviously intoxicated when Moler served him, and thus issued a preliminary order suspending Boyd\u2019s retail alcohol beverage license. Boyd did not seek agency review, and the order became final on December 18, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Boyd appealed to the district court and moved for a stay of the suspension, which the district court granted. The district court concluded that the hearing officer did not err in concluding that Anderson was obviously intoxicated when Moler served him, yet ultimately concluded that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is facially unconstitutional for overbreadth and vagueness. The court reversed the hearing officer\u2019s decision and remanded the case. ABC timely appeals the district court\u2019s decision regarding the statute\u2019s constitutionality. Boyd does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that substantial competent evidence supported the hearing officer\u2019s determination that Moler served alcohol to an obviously intoxicated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">Generally, \u201c[w]here a district court acts in its appellate capacity pursuant to the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act (IDA-PA), this Court reviews the agency record independently of the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Bd. of Prof'l Discipline of Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>134 Idaho 449, 454, 4 P.3d 561, 566 (2000) (citations omitted). In this case, however, the agency was unable to consider the constitutionality of the statute in question, because \u201c[p]assing on the constitutionality of statutory enactments, even enactments with political overtones, is a fundamental responsibility of the judiciary, and has been so since <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 [2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)].\u201d <em>Miles v. Idaho Power Co., </em>116 Idaho 635, 640, 778 P.2d 757, 762 (1989) (citations omitted). Therefore, we directly review the district court\u2019s decision regarding the constitutionality of I.C. \u00a7 23-615.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-12\">The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law. The party challenging a statute on constitutional grounds bears the burden of establishing the statute is unconstitutional and \u201cmust overcome a strong presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Olsen v. J.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number><em>Freeman Co., </em>117 Idaho 706, 709, 791 P.2d 1285, 1288 (1990).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-4\">This Court exercises free review over the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if the trial court correctly stated the principles of law and if the legal conclusions are supported by the facts as found. The Court is \u201cfree to draw its own conclusions from the facts presented.\u201d <em>Kootenai Elec. Coop. v. Washington Water Power Co., </em>127 Idaho 432, 435, 901 P.2d 1333, 1336 (1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-5\"><em>BHA Invs., Inc. v. State, </em>138 Idaho 348, 351, 63 P.3d 474, 477 (2003) (citations omitted). Appellate courts are obligated to seek an interpretation of a statute that upholds its constitutionality. <em>State v. Newman, </em>108 Idaho 5, 13, n. 12, 696 P.2d 856, 864 n. 12 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">\u201cThe Court will defer to the agency\u2019s findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous and unsupported by evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>134 Idaho at 454, 4 P.3d at 566. \u201cThis Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on factual matters. I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(1).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-7\">A strong presumption of validity favors an agency\u2019s actions. The agency\u2019s action may be set aside, however, if the agency\u2019s findings, conclusions, or decisions (a) violate constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) exceed the agency\u2019s statutory authority; (c) are made upon unlawful procedure; (d) are not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; or (e) are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3). In addition, this Court will affirm an agency action unless a substantial right of the appellant has been prejudiced. I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">The district court held that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is facially unconstitutional because it is both overbroad and vague. We consider each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">A. The district court erred in holding that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">In considering whether I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is constitutionally overbroad, the district court stated that \u201cIdaho Code section 23-615 directly affects the constitutionally protected property right to continue to operate a business. The statute is, therefore, overbroad.\u201d Boyd makes the same assertion on appeal. This conclusion, however, represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that the business of retailing alcohol is a \u201cconstitutionally protected property right\u201d is incorrect. The United States Constitution states in relevant part that \u201c[t]he transportation or importation into any state, territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XXI, \u00a7 2. In turn, the Idaho Constitution states in relevant part that \u201cthe legislature of the state of Idaho shall have full power and authority to permit, control and regulate or prohibit the manufacture, sale, keeping for sale, and transportation for sale, of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes.\u201d Idaho Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 26. Since this section in Idaho\u2019s constitution gives the Legislature full power and authority to regulate intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes, the judicial department of the State may not deprive it of such power. <em>Taylor v. State, </em>62 Idaho 212, 219, 109 P.2d 879, 881 (1941). The district court\u2019s statement that there is a protected property right in the business of selling alcohol attempts just such a deprivation and would, if given effect, violate both the United States and Idaho constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">Instead of a protected property right,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-16\">[a] liquor license is simply the grant or permission under governmental authority to the licensee to engage in the business of selling liquor. Such a license is a temporary permit to do that which would otherwise be unlawful; it is a privilege rather than a natural right and is personal to the licensee; it is neither a right of property nor a contract, or a contract right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-17\"><em>BHA Invs., Inc., </em>138 Idaho at 354-55, 63 P.3d at 480-81 (quoting <em>Nampa Lodge No. 1389, Benev. and P.O. of E. of U.S. v. Smylie, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>71 Idaho 212, 215-16, 229'P.2d 991, 993 (1951)). \u201c[T]hus one who procures a state ... license takes it subject to the provisions of the statute under which the license is granted.\u201d <em>Nampa Lodge, </em>71 Idaho at 216, 229 P.2d at 993. Idaho Code \u00a7 23-102 explains the reason for such regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-4\">This act is passed in the exercise of the police power of the state. It is not designed to abridge the personal privilege of a responsible adult to consume alcoholic liquor as a beverage, except in cases of the abuse of that privilege to the detriment of others. The public interest requires that traffic in alcoholic liquor be regulated and controlled by the state, through the medium of a state liquor division vested with exclusive authority to import and sell such liquor, with certain exceptions, which are subject to its regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">I.C. \u00a7 23-102. This Court has similarly recognized that \u201cthe selling of intoxicating liquor is a proper subject for control and regulation under the police power.\u201d <em>Gartland v. Talbott, </em>72 Idaho 125, 131, 237 P.2d 1067, 1070 (1951). Put another way, \u201c[i]t is ... universally accepted that no one has an inherent or constitutional right to engage in the business of selling or dealing in intoxicating liquors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court failed to understand the constitutional parameters of a license to sell alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The district court further misunderstood Idaho\u2019s statutory regulations. Contrary to the district court\u2019s statement, it is not I.C. \u00a7 23-615 that directly affects whether a licensee may or may not continue to operate as a retail seller of alcohol. Rather, this provision places restrictions upon how the licensee may operate his retail alcohol business, stating in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-7\">No person licensed pursuant to title 23, Idaho Code, or his or its employed agents, servants or bartenders shall sell, deliver or give away, or cause or permit to be sold, delivered, or given away, or allowed to be consumed, any alcohol beverage, including any distilled spirits, beer or wine, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-8\">(2) Any person actually, apparently or obviously intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">The statute that does directly affect whether a licensee may or may not continue to operate as a retail seller of alcohol is I.C. \u00a7 23-933, which states in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-10\">(1) The director may suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew a license issued pursuant to the terms of this chapter for any violation of or failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or rules and regulations promulgated by the director or the state tax commission pursuant to the terms and conditions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">In other words, when the State grants a licensee the privilege of selling alcohol, the licensee must accept the limitations on that privilege as set out in I.C. \u00a7 23-615. If the seller abuses the privilege by violating the limitations, the director may suspend his license pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 23-933. In any case, such regulation does not infringe upon any constitutionally protected activity. Consequently, neither of these statutes may be considered facially unconstitutional for over-breadth, because \u201c[i]n a facial challenge to the overbreadth ... of a law, a court\u2019s first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. If it does not, then the overbreadth challenge must fail.\u201d <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 494, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d 362, 369 (1982) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">In sum, selling alcohol is not constitutionally protected conduct, and thus, statutes that regulate the sale of alcohol, such as I.C. \u00a7 23-615 and I.C. \u00a7 23-933, cannot be challenged as unconstitutionally overbroad. The district court therefore erred in determining that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is facially unconstitutional for overbreadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">B. The district court erred in concluding that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">Boyd argues that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is impermissibly vague on its face. He argues that when examining the physiological effects of alcohol consumption, there is no standard by which to measure when a person is \u201cactually,\u201d \u201cobviously,\u201d or \u201capparently\u201d intoxicated, because the common person is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>trained to recognize symptoms that a police officer or ABC investigator might notice. Despite determining that substantial evidence supported the hearing officer\u2019s determination that Moler served alcohol to an apparently or obviously intoxicated person, the district court embraced Boyd\u2019s legal reasoning and determined that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">Although the district court repeatedly cited <em>Hoffman </em>in support of its legal conclusion, the district court either ignored or misunderstood the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 analysis regarding vagueness. \u201cA law that does not reach constitutionally protected conduct and therefore satisfies the overbreadth test may nevertheless be challenged on its face as unduly vague, in violation of due process. To succeed, however, the complainant must demonstrate that the law is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>455 U.S. at 497, 102 S.Ct. at 1193, 71 L.Ed.2d at 371. \u201c[T]he challenger must show that the enactment is invalid <em>in toto.\u201d State v. Korsen, </em>138 Idaho 706, 712, 69 P.3d 126, 132 (2003) (citing <em>Hoffman, </em>455 U.S. at 497, 102 S.Ct. at 1193, 71 L.Ed.2d at 370-71). <em>Hoffman </em>explicitly cautioned that one \u201cwho engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d 455 U.S. at 495, 102 S.Ct. at 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d at 369. <em>Hoffman </em>then reiterated this proposition in an accompanying footnote: \u201c \u2018One to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495 n. 7, 102 S.Ct. at 1191 n. 7, 71 L.Ed.2d at 369 n. 7 (quoting <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 756, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 2562, 41 L.Ed.2d 439, 457-58 (1974)). Simply put, \u201cthe traditional rule of standing for facial attacks provides that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional may not attack the statute on grounds that it might be unconstitutional when applied to other people or situations.\u201d 16 Am.Jur.2d Constitutional Law \u00a7 137 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">In this case, the hearing officer found that \u201c[Moler] thought that she was familiar enough with [Anderson] that she knew when he was under the influence.... [Moler] indicated that when [Anderson] had too much to drink he became belligerent, cocky, and talked with an attitude.\u201d The hearing officer also stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-10\">[Harris] observed [Anderson] to resent his efforts to identify [Anderson] with [Anderson] being belligerent, obnoxious, and confrontational.... [Harris\u2019] observation is consistent with how [Moler] described she had seen [Anderson] when he was under the influence. Orofino Sheriff Deputy Carson, who at the time worked for the City of Orofino, also observed [Anderson] outside the bar and observed blood shot eyes, and [Anderson] being belligerent and appearing unwilling to follow [Harris\u2019] directions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-11\"><em>Id. </em>The hearing officer continued that Davidson \u201cobserved [Anderson] approach the bar, push items off of the bar and reach across the bar to shake someone\u2019s hand who did not appear to want to shake [Anderson\u2019s] hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1Mi\">Finally, the hearing officer concluded that Moler\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-12\">observations of what [Anderson] looks like when he is intoxicated are consistent with the observations of [Harris], [Davidson], and Deputy Carson. Even though it was a busy evening [Moler] had sufficient opportunity to determine whether it was appropriate to serve beer to [Anderson].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-13\">[Boyd\u2019s] bartender sold an alcoholic beverage to an apparently intoxicated [Anderson] in violation of Idaho Code \u00a7 23-615.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">The district court upheld the hearing officer\u2019s factual determination on this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>The district court\u2019s decision that there was substantial evidence supporting the factual finding that Moler violated I.C. \u00a7 23-615 simply cannot be reconciled with the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that the statute is unconstitutionally vague. Indeed, during oral argument, Boyd\u2019s attorney acknowledged that the district court\u2019s resolution of this constitutional question was \u201cutterly inconsistent\u201d with its decision on the factual question of whether Moler served alcohol to an apparently or obviously intoxicated person. As Boyd\u2019s bartender engaged in \u201cconduct that is clearly proscribed,\u201d the statute is not vague as applied in this case, and Boyd \u201ccannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>455 U.S. at 495, 102 S.Ct. at 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d at 369. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in its determination that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The district court erred in concluding that I.C. \u00a7 23-615 is unconstitutional. The decision of the district court is reversed, this ease is remanded, and the district court is instructed to vacate its order staying the suspension of Boyd\u2019s license. Costs are awarded to ABC.</p>\n<judges id=\"b974-6\">Chief Justice EISMANN, Justices J. JONES, W. JONES and Justice Pro Tern TROUT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-7\">. ABC referred the case to the city attorney, who in turn referred it to the county prosecutor. The prosecutor dismissed the charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b970-8\">. ABC filed a second notice of violation and complaint for suspension based upon events observed by the same officers at the Shot Glass on the evening of September 16, 2006; however, the hearing officer found that there was an insufficient showing of the state of intoxication of the patron who was allegedly overserved. Accordingly, this second alleged violation did not come before the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b973-5\">. The district court upheld the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion on this issue, albeit upon a mischaracterization of the hearing officer\u2019s memorandum decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The district court stated that \u201c[i]n rendering his decision, the Hearing Officer concluded that the observations of 'Ms. Molar [sic], Corporal Davidson, Sergeant Harris and Deputy Carson' indicated that Mr. Anderson was apparently or obviously intoxicated.\u201d The court then included the following footnote: \"Presumably, the inclusion of Ms. Moler\u2019s name was inadvertent, as the Hearing Officer referred earlier in the decision to Ms. Moler's belief that Mr. Anderson was <em>not </em>intoxicated.\u201d The district court continued that:</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Although Ms. Moler did not testify that she observed [Anderson] exhibiting behavior consistent with intoxication, the Hearing Officer determined that the observations of the officers were consistent with Ms. Moler's testimony of Mr. Anderson\u2019s behavior when he was intoxicated before this particular episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">In any event, the Hearing Officer was apparently persuaded by the weight of the officer\u2019s testimony. The testimony of the three law enforcement agents trained to recognize signs of intoxication was substantial enough to support the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision that the police officers concluded Mr. Anderson was obviously intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-25\">This characterization of the hearing officer\u2019s decision makes it seem as though it was the testimony of law enforcement and law enforcement alone that persuaded the hearing officer that Anderson was apparently or obviously intoxicated. In fact, as discussed above, it was this testimony <em>combined </em>with Moler\u2019s testimony that she was familiar with Anderson\u2019s behavior when he is intoxicated that persuaded the hearing officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
