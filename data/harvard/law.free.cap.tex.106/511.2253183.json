The railway company paid the $3.50. The justice gave judgment for the plaintiff for $10 attorney\u2019s fees, and the judge of the District Court of that county granted an injunction against said judgment, but subsequently dissolved the injunction and dismissed the case. The railroad company appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the District Court, and this court granted a writ of error on the 2nd day of February, 1912. From the entry made on our docket, the writer concludes that the writ was granted upon the assump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>tion that the statute authorizing the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees was unconstituti onal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">On November 12, 1912, this court filed an opinion in Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Mahaffey, 105 Texas, 394, 150 S. W., 881, in which the same statute was sustained, as being constitutional. That opinion was subsequently followed by the Supreme Court of the United States in Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Cade, 232 U. S., 647, 58 L. Ed., 1135, 34 Sup. Ct., 678. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
