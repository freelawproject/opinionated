It has delegated to them the right\" or privilege of maintaining and repairing the property upon their own plans, provided they pay for it, but the Act by no means inhibits the State from repairing and preserving the property upon its own plans. The exclusive right claimed by the Daughters of the Bepublic can not arise in its favor by implication, because the exercise of an exclusive right, that is to say, one exclusive of the State\u2019s authority is not necessary for its enjoyment of the privileges named in this Act, and, under the strict rules of construction applicable to corporate rights, that which is not necessary to the enjoyment of the direct privilege granted will not be implied.

App., 665; 22 Cyc., p. 881, and exhaustive note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">The purpose of an appropriation bill is to- make appropriations for the support of the government and its institutions and such a bill can not be held to repeal any Act of the Legislature by implication, and there is no express repeal in said appropriation bill of the Act of 1905. There can be no repeal by implication unless there is something in the alleged repealing Act from which a repeal must he necessar\u00fcy implied. The portion of the appropriation bill alleged to repeal the Act of 1905 merely makes an appropriation of money to be expended on the Alamo and read in connection with the Act of 1905, is a mere provision authorizing the expenditure of money upon plans to be prepared and adopted by plaintiff. There is nothing in the title of the appropriation bill to show that it is anything else than what it purports to be, viz: an Act for the appropriation of money. The Constitution of the State, article 3, section 35, provides that \u201cNo bill (except general appropriation bills, which may embrace the various subjects and accounts for and on account of which moneys are appropriated) 'shall contain more than one subject which shall be expressed in its title.\u201d If, therefore, said appropriation bill embraced a clause repealing the'Act of 1905, such clause would be unconstitutional.

The provision that the title of an Act should contain but one subject was intended to prevent the embracing in one Act, having one ostensible object, irrelevant provisions designed to conceal its object.

San Angelo, etc., 86 Texas, 485.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-6\">An appropriation bill is not a law having for its purpose legislation permanent in its character. It is a mere legislative provision for the \u25a0distribution of the State\u2019s revenues. With the expenditure of the appropriations made of with the lapse of time within which the expenditures should be made, the bill ceases to be of any effect, except to justify the expenditures made thereunder by the various officers of the State. The single subject of the bill is the appropriation of money and the subjects to which the respective appropriations may be applied are but divisions of the single subject of appropriation. A subject foreign to the subject of appropriation can not be constitutionally embraced in an appropriation bill. The constitutional provision that no bill shall contain more than one subject which shall be expressed in its title excepts appropriation bills from the inhibition so far only as they may embrace the subjects and accounts and on account of which moneys are appropriated. A repeal therefore of an existing statute can not be implied from a provision in an appropriation bill making an appropriation for a particular purpose, or if a repeal could be so implied, it would only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>be in a case where it was the evident purpose of the Legislature to effect a repeal by such provision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-3\">The plaintiff under its charter had the power to acquire, possess and care for historic spots and property.

B. Conley, is the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds of the State of Texas. The defend\u00e1nt in error is a private corporation created under the second subdivision of article 1121 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\u201c1121. The purposes for which private corporations may be formed are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">\u201c2. The support of any benevolent, charitable, educational or mis-\u2019 \u25a0sionary undertaking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The charter of the corporation was prepared and filed in accord with the requirements of the law and expressed the purposes of the corporation thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">\u201c1. To perpetuate the memory and spirit of the men and women who have achieved and maintained the independence of Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">\u201c2. To encourage historical research into the earliest records of Texas, especially those relating to the revolution of. 1835 and the events which followed; to foster the preservation of documents and relies and to encourage the publication of records of individual service of soldiers \u25a0and patriots of the Republic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-13\">\u201c3. To promote the celebration of March 2nd (Independence day) \u25a0and April 21st (San Jacinto day); to secure and hallow historic spots by erecting monuments thereon, and to cherish and preserve unity of Texas as achieved and established by the fathers and mothers of the Texas Revolution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-14\">\u201cThis Association may have and hold by purchase, grant, gift or otherwise, real estate on whicli battles for the independence of Texas were fought; such monument or monuments as may be erected thereon and burial grounds where the dead who fought and died for Texas independence are buried; and personal property consisting of books, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>manuscripts and other historical records relating to the early history of Texas, and relics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">A statute enacted by the Legislature of the State became a law in full force January 36, 1905. The first section of that Act provided for the purchase of certain property in the City of San Antonio described thus: \u201cAll the land in the City of San Antonio, Texas, known as the Hugo &amp; Schmeltzer Company property, formerly a part of the old Alamo Mission and adjoining the Alamo Church property now owned by the State\u201d; giving the metes and bounds of that to be purchased. The second section of the Act limited the price to be paid, and provided for payment, and appropriated $65,000 to pay the same.. The third section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">\u201cUpon the receipt of the title to said land, the Governor shall deliver the property thus acquired, together with the Alamo Church property, already owned by the State, to the custody and care of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, to be maintained by them in good order and repair, without charge to the State, as a sacred memorial to the heroes who immolated themselves upon the hallowed ground; and by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas to be maintained or remodeled upon plans-adopted by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, and approved by the Governor of Texas; provided, that no changes or alterations shall be made in the Alamo Church proper, as it now stands, except such as are absolutely necessary for its preservation. All of said property being subject to future legislation by the Legislature of the State of Texas.\u201d1 The ground was purchased and the entire property was delivered into the possession of the corporation, \u201cThe Daughters of the Republic,\u201d1 which held the exclusive possession and control thereof until plaintiff in error, by direction of the Governor of the State, entered upon said property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The corporation \u201cmaintained the property in good order,\u201d but did not remodel it nor prepare any plans therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">At the regular session of the Legislature in 1911 the general appropriation bill was enacted and contained this provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">\u201cFor the Years Ending Aug. 31,1913. Aug. 31,1913.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APH\">For the improvement of the Alamo property \u2022 belonging to the State of Texas, in the City of San Antonio, to be expended under the direc- ' tion of the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, upon the approval of the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aim\">Governor ...............................$5,000 00 ..........</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Acting under the direction of the Governor, Conley entered upon the property to 'make improvement without a plan having been prepared' by the Daughters, of the Republic, and the corporation applied to the Hon. J. L. Camp, judge of the District Court of the Forty-fifth Judicial District, for a writ of injunction upon the allegations stated in the find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ings of the court, as hereinafter copied, and embraced in the charter of the corporation. The judge granted the writ and upon a hearing perpetuated the injunction, which was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\">The judge of the District Court filed the following findings of fact, which were adopted by the Court of Civil Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">\"1. The Daughters of the Republic of Texas is a private corporation, duly incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas, for the purpose set forth and alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Under the Act of the Legislature of the State of Texas, approved January 26, 1905, as averred in plaintiff\u2019s petition herein, the State of Texas through its Governor, purchased the property known as the old Hugo &amp; Sehmeltzer building in plaintiff\u2019s petition fully described, and being a part of what is commonly known as the \u2018Alamo property,\u2019 and previous to such purchase, the State of Texas had acquired what is known as the \u2018Alamo Mission\u2019 property proper in said City of San Antonio, the two properties together constituting what is commonly known as the Alamo property in the City of San Antonio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\u201c3. In accordance with the provisions of said Act of the Legislature, said two properties were delivered by the State of Texas into the custody and care of plaintiff prior to any of the trespasses alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition and at the time of the said alleged trespasses said plaintiff was in possession of said property, holding the care and custody of same under the terms of the Act of the Legislature above referred to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201c4. Ho plan for any changes or alterations or remodeling of any of the buildings upon said property has been made or adopted by plaintiff and approved by the Governor of the State of Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201c5. Ho plan for any alteration or changes or remodeling of any of said buildings had been prepared by the Governor of the State of Texas and submitted to plaintiff for consideration by plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201c6. Plaintiff has never surrendered said property nor the care or custody of same to anyone but has retained such possession, care and custody ever since the delivery of the property to.plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">\u201c7. The defendants in their official capacities as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition entered upon the said property prior to the filing of plaintiff\u2019s petition, and without the consent of' plaintiff were at the time of the filing of said petition engaged in tearing down certain of the improvements upon said property, making excavations thereon for rebuilding certain of the improvements thereon and for the erection of new improvements thereon and were rebuilding certain of the improvements thereon and remodeling certain of the improvements thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">\u201c8. This work was being done without any plan as to what future improvements would be made upon the property or what remodeling of the property would be done, the evidence showing that the work was being done without any fixed or definite plan and the defendants were unable to inform the court what remodeling of any improvements was contemplated nor what improvements were contemplated nor what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>changes in the present buildings were contemplated by them or by the Governor of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-3\">It is well established that the State Legislature is clothed with all governmental power which resides in the people, subject to such limitations as may be expressed in the Constitution of the State and any limitation embraced in the Constitution of the United States. Brown v. Galveston, 97 Texas, 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Article 3, section 1, of the State Constitution provides: \u201cThe legislative power of this State shall be vested in a Senate and House of Representatives, which together shall be styled \u2018The Legislature of the State of Texas.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The power of the Legislature of this State, with reference to\" the property in question, is not limited by - any provision of the Constitution, therefore it has in general \u201cthe same rights and powers in respect to property as an individual. It may acquire property, real or personal, by conveyance, will,' or otherwise, and hold or dispose of the same or apply it to any purpose, public or private, as it sees fit. The power of the State in respect to its property rights is vested in the Legislature, and the Legislature .alone can exercise the power necessary to the enjoyment and protection of those rights, by the enactment of statutes for that purpose.\u201d . . . \u201cThe State has, in general, the same power to contract as a corporation or an individual.\u201d 36 Cyc., pp. 869, 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">We are of opinion that the State, acting by its Legislature, had the authority to acquire title to the Alamo property and to place that property in the custody of the corporation, the Daughters of the Republic. But it is said that the care of the property was the act of an officer. An officer is one who exercises some functions of the government. No such authority is vested in that corporation. We do not care to discuss this question further than to say, that the preparation of plans for improvement is not a function of the government, but of an architect. The service to be performed by the corporation was such as could have been committed to any person. We are of opinion that by the acceptance of the terms of the 'statute the corporation became a trustee for -the State. But the question arises, can a corporation act as trustee ? \u201cThe power of a corporation to act as trustee for any purpose within the scope of its charter or governing statute ... is entirely free from doubt.\u201d 10 Cyc., p. 1140. \u201cTo constitute a direct trust there must be a conveyance or transfer to a person capable of holding it; there must also be an object or fund transferred, and there must be a <em>cestid que </em>trust or, purpose to which the fund is to be applied.\u201d Commissioners v. Walker, 6 Howard (Miss.), 142, 38 Am. Dec., 433. In the case cited the trustees were appointed by the State and it was held that the action by the State was valid and created a trust in favor of the State. The State had the power by its Legislature to create the corporation and to convey the property to it; the corporation had the power to perform the duties, and there was a purpose that was public. None of the elements of an office are present; but each element of a trust exists. This constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the corporation a trustee of the State with power to maintain the property \u201cin good order and repair.\u201d Ho title passed to the corporation, nor did any authority vest except that expressed or implied by the terms of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">Plaintiff in error insists that the Act under which the corporation claims is void because it does not comply with section 35 of article 3 of the Constitution, which reads: \u201cHo bill (except general appropriation bills, which may embrace the various subjects and accounts, for and on account of which moneys are appropriated) shall contain more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The caption of the Act in question reads: \u201cAn Act to provide for the purchase and conveyance to the State of Texas of the land in the City of San Antonio known as the Hugo &amp; Schmeltzer Company property, which was a part of the Alamo Mission; and for the care and preservation of said property, and of the Alamo Church property now owned by the State; and appropriating the sum of sixty-five thousand dollars ($65,000) to carry out the provisions of this Act.\u201d The purpose was the acquisition of the Alamo property and to provide for the care of it and the appropriation of a sum to purchase the property. Everything provided for in the bill is included in the subject of the bill, as expressed in the caption. The objection is not sound. Murphy v. Menard, 11 Texas, 673; Barnes v. Hardeman, 15 Texas, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The Attorney General asserts that the corporation was not lawfully created under the statute of this State, because the law does not authorize the creation of such corporation for the purposes named in its charter. The second subdivision of article 1121, Revised Statutes, reads: \u201cThe purposes for which private corporations may be formed are: . . . 2. The support of any benevolent, charitable, educational or missionary undertaking.\u201d The purpose of this corporation is clearly \u201ceducational.\u201d Whatever educates is within the meaning of \u201ceducational undertaking.\u201d Education in the sense as used in the statutes includes: \u201cIn its broadest sense, . . . not merely the instruction received at school or college, but the whole course of training, moral, intellectual and physical; is not limited to the ordinary instruction of the child in the pursuits of literature. It comprehends a proper attention to the moral and religious sentiments of the child. And it is sometimes used as synonymous with learning.\u2019 \u201d 14 Cyc., p. 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The sentiment of regard for the memory of those who gave their lives for the blessings of this great State stimulates patriotism and is in the highest sense educational. The facts to be preserved furnish the means of the best education for the young men and women of this State. The purpose is laudable in its influence upon the present generation; it is .laudable, educational and benevolent for-the future citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">This question is asked, \u201cshould a State commit its interests to corporations?\u201d This court has naught to do with the policy of the State on that question. All litigants \u201clook alike\u201d here. However, we will say, that this is not such a soulless corporation as needs to have a watch upon its actions. The heart, the soul and spirit of patriotism are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>capital employed by those women which would not detract from the authority and power of the State. On the contrary, those ladies, with no hope of gain to themselves undertook to substitute for the State\u2019s fund, which would have been created by taxation, the voluntary offerings of the people\u2014a tribute of patriotism, sanctified by love for the State and reverence for the memory of her heroic dead. Can there be danger from such a corporation? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\">It is also urged that the Act which committed the Alamo property to the care of the Daughters of the Republic was repealed by the appropriation bill of 1911, which we again copy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u201cFor the Years Ending Aug. 31,1912. Aug. 31,1913.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alf\">For the improvement of the Alamo property belonging to the State of Texas, in the City of San Antonio, to be expended under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, upon the approval of the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARI\">Governor ...............................$5,000 00 .........\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">There is no express repeal of the former law, hence, if repealed, it must be by implication, which is not favored. The two laws relate to the same subject and should be considered as if incorporated into one act. If being so considered the two can be harmonized and effect given to each, there can be no repeal, Neill v. Keese, 5 Texas, 23. \u201cThese statutes, being <em>im, pari materia, </em>and relating to the same subject, are to be taken together and so construed, in reference to each other, as that, if practicable, effect may be given to the entire provisions of each.\u201d . . . \u201cThus considered, there is no repugnancy between the provisions of these statutes. They may stand together, and effect may be given to the entire provisions of each. And thus to construe and give effect to them is in accordance with the established rule of construction.\u201d Brown v. Chancellor, 61 Texas, 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The first Act directed the Governor to purchase the Hugo &amp; Schmeltzer company property and deliver it to the corporation, to be maintained in good order at its own expense. The corporation was authorized to remodel and improve the property (except the church) at its own expense, upon plans to be provided by the corporation, and to be approved by the Governor. This conferred upon the corporation the initiative as to improvements, with the power in the Governor to disapprove the plans. His authority was limited and negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">In 1911 the Legislature evidently believed that there was need for some improvement of the property. The members of the corporation had been at war among themselves which doubtless caused the appropriation to be made in these terms: \u201cFor the improvement of the Alamo property belonging to the State of Texas in the City of San Antonio, to be expended under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, upon the approval of the Governor.\u201d The Legislature intended that the funds of the State should be expended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>by its officer, that is, under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, which implies that the Superintendent should have the right to enter the buildings and grounds for the purpose of improvement. The limitations were (1) it must be done with the approval of the Governor, and (2) he could not interfere with the \u201cold church,\u201d except to make repairs necessary to its preservation, which limitation of the statute was general and bound the Governor as well as the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The entry by the plaintiff in error did not dispossess the corporation, but the duties of each might be performed at the same time, for neither the corporation nor the Superintendent could improve the property without the consent of the Governor. When the $5000 had been expended the right of the Superintendent would have expired. The execution of both laws could have been accomplished in harmony. The provision that the plans to be provided by the Daughters of the Republic for improvement should be approved by the Governor and that the expenditure of the $5000 should be under his direction and control rendered a conflict altogether improbable, if not impossible. There was no repeal of the first Act by the item in the appropriation bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">To the argument that the direction as to expenditure of the $5000 is unconstitutional, it is sufficient to say that from this language\u2014\u201cno bill (except general appropriation bills, which may embrace the various subjects and accounts, for and on account of which moneys are appropriated) shall contain more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title,\u201d the exception relieves that bill from the limitation and permits the same treatment of each subject of the appropriation bill that would apply if it were embraced in a separate bill. It can not be that a separate and independent law would be necessary to direct and control the expenditure of every item of appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">It has been'insisted that this is a suit against the State, therefore not maintainable. This is not an action against the State, but\" against plaintiff in error, charging him with a violation of a law of the State and an invasion of plaintiff\u2019s rights. Stanley v. Schwalby, 85 Texas, 348; 36 Cyc., 917. The subject is treated exhaustively in the text and notes at the place cited. If the decision should be against plaintiff in error, it would not affect the State, but simply establish that he entered upon the premises and proceeded contrary to law, or without lawful authority. The petition for injunction alleged no act done by the plaintiff in error which he was not authorized by law to do under the instruction of the Governor. His entry did not interfere with the corporation in its possession, nor hinder the performance of any duty. The injunction was improperly granted. It is ordered that the injunction be dissolved and that judgment be entered that the plaintiff, the corporation, take nothing by this suit, and that plaintiff in error go hence. without day and recover of the corporation, the Daughters of the Republic, all costs of the several courts.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ON MOTION EOR REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">We do not deem it necessary to discuss at length the objection of the plaintiff in error\u2019s counsel to the jurisdiction of the District Court. It is sufficient to say that the facts do not bring the case within the terms of this article of the Revised Statutes of 1911:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u201cArt, 5732 (4861). No court of this State (except the Supreme Court, as approved by article 1526) shall have power, authority or jurisdiction to issue the writ of mandamus or injunction or any other mandamus or compulsory writ of process against any of the officers of the executive departments of the government of this State to order or compel the performance of any act or duty which, by the laws of this State, they, or either of them, are authorized to perform, whether such act or duty be judicial, ministerial or discretionary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">No mandatory or compulsory writ is sought. Nor is it the purpose of the proceeding to compel the performance of any duty enjoined by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">We can add nothing to the reasons given for holding, in our opinion, that the two Acts involved are not in conflict. It is the duty of this court to so construe the laws that both can stand, if fairly susceptible of such construction. This court will presume that the Governor of Texas will seek the public good in discharging his official duties and that the Daughters of the Republic will be equally patriotic, so that by co-operation the rights of each party may be preserved. If under the two statutes this may be done there can be no destructive conflict between the two enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The defendant in error is confronted with this indisputable condition. By necessary implication the Act of 1911 conferred authority upon the Governor to do what he might find necessary in making the authorized improvements, and it being the last expression of the legislative will, that Act must prevail over the former law to the extent that the conflict is irreconcilable. The result would not be to limit the authority of the Governor, but to that extent it would abridge the rights of the Daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">Opinion filed June 4, 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">\n<em>Reversed and rendered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
