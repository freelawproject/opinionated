The grant of such right of way could not be provided for until the railway located its line as required by the statute and the Constitution; and where it located its line not in compliance therewith the failure of the citizens to provide or tender a right of way as required, being made impossible by its disregard of the law, afforded no defense to it for such violation.

That .the citizens of said town are now and have at all times since the location of said defendant\u2019s railroad in said county, been ready, able and willing to grant to the defendant railway company a right of way through the limits of said town and sufficient grounds for ordinary depot purposes in said town, free of any cost to the defendant on whatever route through said town defendant might select.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201c5. That defendant can survey and locate a reasonable and feasible and practicable route for its right of way and roadbed through the limits of said town and sufficient grounds for ordinary depot purposes in said town, and can do so within thirty days, and which is a reasonable time therefor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\"6. That after defendant shall have surveyed and located its said, right of way through said town and depot grounds therein, the citizens of said town of Sherwood can secure a grant of the said right of way and depot grounds within ninety days thereafter, and which is a reasonable time therefor, unless the same or some part thereof shall have to he secured by condemnation proceedings, and in such case said citizens can ascertain that fact and execute an obligation to the defendant to hold it harmless from any cost or expense incident to such condemnation proceedings, and that they can do so within said period of ninety days aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\"><em>\u201c7. </em>That after said grant of said right of way and depot grounds shall have been secured, as aforesaid, defendant can construct and build and put in operation its said railroad through said town, and said depot in said town, and can do so within ninety days after said right of way and depot grounds shall have been granted and secured by voluntary conveyances or by condemnation proceedings as hereinbefore provided for, and said time is reasonably sufficient therefor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">\u201c8. That defendant has heretofore surveyed, located, established and constructed its railroad within three miles of said town of Sherwood, the county seat of Irion County, without passing through said town, and without establishing and maintaining a depot therein, and that defendant made no efforts to survej', locate, establish or construct its railroad through said town or a depot in said town, although it could have done so at a reasonable cost, but defendant purposely and inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>tionally constructed its railroad passing said town and within the distance of less than three miles therefrom, and established a station at Mertzon, a new rival town, about three miles away from said town of Sherwood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\">\u201c9. That had defendant surveyed, located, established and constructed its railroad through said town of Sherwood, instead of where it did construct the same, its said line of railroad would have been about seven-tenths of one mile shorter than its present line, and the cost of expense and maintenance and saving in operation of the line through Sherwood will substantially offset any difference in the cost of construction between said line through Sherwood and defendant\u2019s present line, and the difference, if any, between the cost of construction, maintenance and operation of the two lines, is so slight and inappreciable as to be not unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\u201c10. That defendant has never surveyed or located any route for its railroad through said town of Sherwood, or any point for a depot in said town, and never gave the citizens of said town, or said town, an opportunity to grant it a right of way through the limits of said town, and sufficient grounds for ordinary depot purposes, although said town and said citizens were ready, able and willing to do so at all times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals and the case is before this court on writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Article 10, section 9 of our Constitution reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">\u201cHo railroad hereafter constructed in this State shall pass within a distance of three miles of any county seat without passing through the same, and establishing and maintaining a depot therein, unless prevented by natural obstacles, such as streams', hills or mountains; provided, such town or its citizens shall grant the right of way through its limits and sufficient ground for ordinary depot purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The Legislature enacted a statute to enforce that provision, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">\u201cArticle 6549 (4491). Road shall pass through county seat, when.\u2014 Ho railroad hereafter constructed in this State shall pass within a distance of three miles of any county seat without passing through the same, and establishing and maintaining a depot therein, unless prevented by natural obstacles, such as streams, hills or mountains; provided, such town or its citizens shall grant the right of way through its limits and sufficient ground for ordinary depot purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The constitutional provision was intended to subserve the interests of the public who desired or were required to visit the county seat, and was not intended to benefit the owners of property in the town\u2014that might or might not be the result. The Constitution is mandatory and the duty imposed could not be excused or waived by the citizens of the town. The railroad company must have surveyed its line and designated its depot site before it could demand of the citizens to procure the right of way and depot grounds. Miller v. Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 65 Texas, 667: \u201cIn order to put the citizens at default, the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>pellee should have selected the most practicable route, and surveyed and established it into the town, to within half a mile of the courthouse, and have selected, surveyed, and marked off the grounds necessary for depot purposes, and then have notified the citizens composing the citizens\u2019 committee appointed to secure the right of way and depot grounds, and made, in the language of the right of way bond, \u2018demand\u2019 of the same, for the purposes stated. Rot until this was done could the citizens have proceeded to secure, by purchase or condemnation, the titles to the land. Until this was done they could not have known what ground to secure, bv purchase or legal process; nor had the citizens the power to have instituted proceedings in their own names, to condemn the land. It was alone by the railway company that these proceedings could be instituted.\u201d The duty to pay for the right of way and depot grounds did not devolve upon the citizens until the survey was made by the company, hence the failure of the citizens to take action in that matter is no defense to this action by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">From the facts as stated by the Court of Civil Appeals it appears that the railroad company has complied with neither the statutory nor the constitutional requirements. There is no question of law to be discussed. Ro error is shown. We see no ground for reversing the judgment unless it be that the writ of mandatory injunction was improperly granted\u2014which we will now examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The facts of this case justify the judgment awarding the writ of mandamus. The railroad company had failed and refused to perform an rinquestionable duty to the public, and the District Court had authority to compel the performance of that duty. The appointment of a receiver by the Federal Court did not interfere with the jurisdiction of the State court over the corporation, and would not prevent the enforcement of any judgment against the corporation which would not interfere with the receiver\u2019s possession and control of the property. Palestine Water &amp; P. Co. v. City of Palestine, 91 Texas, 540, 44 S. W., 814, 40 L. R. A., 203; Calhoun v. Lanaux, 127 U. S., 634, 8 Sup. Ct., 1345, 33 L. Ed., 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\"What effect has the appointment of the receiver for the railroad property in this-case? When the receiver was appointed, right of possession of the property of the corporation vested in the receiver and the State court had no power to require the corporation to do any act which would interfere with the possession by the receiver of its railroad track or other property. But the State court had jurisdiction to determine the issues between the State and the corporation. See authorities cited above. The proceeding in the United States District Court furnishes no obstacle to granting the mandatory process against the corporation, but is to be considered in the enforcement of the command. Of the granting of the writ of mandamus, Merrill on Mandamus, section 78, states the rule thus: \u201cThis writ wall be denied when, for any cause, it becomes legally impossible, or rather ceases to be a legal duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The District- Court having granted the writ and conditions having arisen which renders it legally impossible for the corporation to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>we believe its enforcement should be suspended until conditions shall so change as to put it in the power of the corporation to obey. We find no reversible error in the judgment. It is therefore ordered that' said judgment be so reformed as to suspend the issuing of the mandatory writ until the railroad shall be restored to the corporation, or it be otherwise enabled legally to obey the mandate of the court, and as thus reformed the judgment is affirmed with costs against the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\">\n<em>Reformed and affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
