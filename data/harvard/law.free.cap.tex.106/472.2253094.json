Where the older law is particular and expressed in negative terms, a later one, in general terms, though broad enough to cover the particular case, will be construed as subject to the exception of the former particular statute.

State v. Thompson, 88 Texas, 228, 30 S. W., 1046. There has been no express repeal of the article, and it accordingly is now in effect unless the Act of th.e Thirty-third Legislature (Laws of 1913, p. 107), amending the statute defining the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, worked its repeal by necessary implication. Whether such was the result of the Act is the question which arises upon the motion to dismiss the petition, filed by the defendant in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Article 1591 provides that \u201cthe judgments of the Courts of Civil Appeals shall he conclusive on the law and fact, nor shall a writ of error be allowed thereto from the Supreme Court in the following cases, towit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">\u201c1.

Laws are enacted with a view to their permanence, and it is to be supposed that a purpose on the part of the law-making body to abrogate them will be given unequivocal expression. Knowledge of an existing law relating to the same subject is likewise attributed to the Legislature in the enactment of a subsequent statute; and when the later Act is silent as to the older law, the presumption is that its .continued operation was intended, unless they present a contradiction so positive that the purpose to repeal is manifest. To avoid a state of conflict an\u2019 implied repeal results where the two acts are in such opposition. But the antagonism must be absolute,\u2014so pronounced that both can not stand. Though they may seem to be repugnant, if it is possible to fairly reconcile them, such is the duty of the court. A construction will be sought which harmonizes them and leaves both in concurrent operation, rather than destroys one of them. If the later statute reasonably admits of a construction which will allow effect to the older law and 'still leave an ample field for its own operation, a total repugnance can not be said to exist, and, therefore, an implied repeal does not result, since in such case both may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>stand and perforin a distinct office. Especially will this construction be adopted where the older law is particular and expressed in negative terms, and the later statute is general in its nature. In such instances that to which the older law distinctly applied its negative provisions, will be regarded as excepted from the operation of the more general statute. These are but the familiar rules of construction to be applied where the implied repeal of a law is involved. They are so well understood as not to require the citation of authority, but reference may be made to the following: Lewis\u2019 Sutherland Stat. Cons., vol. 1, sec. 247; Endlieh Interp. of Stat., secs. 210, 216, at pp. 288-289; Hanrick v. Hanrick, 54 Texas, 101; Brown &amp; Co. v. Chancellor, 61 Texas, 437; Herndon v. Reed, 82 Texas, 647, 18 S. W., 665; Wilmot v. Mudge, 103 U. S., 217, 26 L. Ed., 536; Frost v. Wenie, 157 U. S., 46, 15 Sup. Ct., 532, 39 L. Ed., 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">It may be well doubted whether any question of an implied repeal of article 1591 really arises upon the Act of 1913. One statute is not repugnant to another unless they relate to the same subject. It is not sufficient that there be a discrepancy between different parts of a system of legislation upon the same general subject; there must be a conflict between different statutes upon the same specific subject. 1 Suth. Stat. Cons., sec. 247. The subject matter of the Act of 1913 is the original and appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the regulation of its practice. It does not propose to deal with or affect the jurisdiction of the Courts of Civil Appeals. It contains no reference to that subject or any existing provision of law upon it. It distinctly takes no note of 'article 1591, in the caption or elsewhere. As not without some bearing on the question of its intended scope and effect upon any law relating to the jurisdiction of those courts, it may be remarked that it is even without a general repealing clause. The subject matter of article 1591 is the final jurisdiction of the Courts of Civil Appeals, recognized in our judiciary articles as a different subject from that of the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. In those articles, as they stood at the time of the adoption of this Act, the definition of the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court did not include that of the final jurisdiction of the Courts of Civil Appeals, nor was the former declared in the terms of the latter. They constituted distinct subjects in that legislation, and this Act must be regarded as having been proposed and passed under that recognition. An Act limited in its scope to the revision of the jurisdiction of one court evidences no general intention to revise, as well, important features of the jurisdiction of another independent court, or that its provisions shall operate as a new system for the government of both. It will be presumed, on the contrary, that the impairment of the other jurisdiction was no part of its purpose. A seeming conflict between two statutes dealing, as do these, with different specific subjects, is a very narrow basis upon which to construct an implied repeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">But leaving this phase of the question and assuming that the statutes relate to the same subject, an absolute and total conflict between them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>is not disclosed. Taken in <em>pari materia, </em>as they may he if regarded as relating to the same subject, they are to be construed as one Act; but whether construed as one Act or as distinct Acts it is possible to fairly reconcile them and give each its intended operation. Whatever inconsistency exists between them arises from the jurisdiction conferred upon the Supreme Court by section 6 of amended article 1521, -wherein it is given authority to review questions of law arising in civil causes in which, in its opinion, \u201cthe Court of Civil Appeals has erroneously declared the substantive law of the case.\u201d This section presents an apparent conflict with article 1591, but not such a total repugnance that the latter article can not stand if the sifttion be given effect, or as to render the section inoperative if the article be held as still in force. It may have its appropriate sphere of operation, though article 1591 be allowed full effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\">It is in certain <em>\"cases\u201d </em>that the jurisdiction of the Courts of Civil Appeals is made final under article 1591, and clearly because of tbe nature of such .cases. It is a particular statute, and is expressed in negative terms, the language being <em>\"nor shall a writ of error be allowed thereto from the Supreme Court.\" </em>This is a very clear and emphatic declaration. It is a definite exemption from the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of all cases of the classes named, as applicable to any subsequent adjustment of that jurisdiction which did not distinctly remove it, as to the law by which such jurisdiction was then defined. Having regard for its character as an exemption provision, it would seem to necessarily provide an exception to a revision of' that jurisdiction which is silent as to it and is expressed in such general terms as to include, if taken literally, all classes of cases of which the Courts of Civil Appeals have. appellate jurisdiction. In making the jurisdiction of the Courts of Civil Appeals final as to cases of the classes named, article 1591 presents no interference with the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, as conferred by section 6 of amended article 1521, over all other cases to which the appellate jurisdiction of the Courts of Civil Appeals extends. The terms of that section are not such as to positively include any of the classes of cases named in article 1591, and are, therefore, not inconsistent with their exclusion. Ho violence is done its language by restraining its operation to cases not by law declared exempt from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. With one statute negative in character, and relating to particular classes of eases over which a certain jurisdiction is directly denied, and another statute, affirmative, and defining that jurisdiction in general terms, no doubt can be indulged as to the construction to be applied. In such a case the question of an implied repeal of the particular statute is not to be seriously considered. It will be construed as constituting an exception to the general statute, under the settled rule, though the language of the latter is, literally, broad enough to include that to which its negative provisions apply. In this manner both statutes will be given effect and each allowed its appropriate field of operation. We ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>cordingly hold that the Act of 1913 did not by implication repeal article 1591, and that article is now in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">It should be said that during the last term, in applying the Act of 1913 we acted under the view that its effect was to confer upon this court jurisdiction over questions of substantive law in cases made final in the Courts of Civil Appeals by the terms of this article; and in a few instances, doubtless, writs of error have been granted in such .cases, which under this ruling will be dismissed. This is a consideration of no weight, however, as opposed to a correct decision. A full examination of the question had not then been undertaken. It has since receiv\u00e9d a careful consideration, with the conclusion here announced as the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Opinion delivered November 18, 1914.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b495-7\">Mr. Chief Justice BE OWN,</author>\n<p id=\"AOC\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Upon a full and thorough examination of the questions involved in the foregoing opinion I fully concur with the reasoning and the conclusions expressed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Associate Justice Hawkins absent, and will later announce his position.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
