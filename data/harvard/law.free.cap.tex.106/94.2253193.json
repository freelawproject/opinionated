M. Guffey Petroleum Company, as plaintiffs, against the Right of Way Oil Company, Texas &amp; Hew Orleans Railroad Company, the Gulf Pipe Line Company, and Oswald S.

Parker, trustee, from drilling oil wells on said land and taking oil therefrom, and from asserting any right or claim thereto, and against the Gulf Pipe Line Company for the oil taken from said land by the other defendants and by them run into its pipe line. Pleadings of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>are voluminous, and are contained in transcript, pages <em>2 </em>to 40, inclusive, but it was alleged by both plaintiffs and defendants below, and admitted, that defendants below, plaintiffs in error here, held under a deed from S. H. Veatch to the East Texas Eailway Company, the Texas &amp; ISTew Orleans Eailroad Company having succeeded to the title conveyed by said deed to the East Texas Eailway Company, and having made an operating contract for the developing of oil on the tract of land conveyed by said deed with Oswald S. Parker, trustee, and the Eight of Way Oil Company having developed oil upon said land under the assignment of said operating contract. The effect of said deed is controlling in the case, plaintiffs in error contending that, under said deed, they have the right to develop, take and use oil from the strip of land described in said deed, and defendants in error contending that no such right exists, but that the title and right to said oil is in them. The facts, as well as the pleadings, are quite fully stated in the opinion filed herein by the Court of Civil Appeals, and will not be restated here; however, the case depending upon the meaning of the deed from S.

If any railroad corporation shall' at any time be unable to agree with the owner for the purchase of any real estate or the material thereon required for the purposes of its incorporation or the transaction of its business, for its depots, station buildings, machine and repair shops, or for the right of way, or any other lawful purpose connected with or necessary to the building, operating or running its road, such corporation may acquire such property in the maimer provided in this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201cArt. 4446. 3STo railroad company shall enter upon, except for a lineal survey, any real estate whatever, the same being private property, for the purpose of taking and condemning the,same or any material thereon, for any pm-pose whatever, until the said company shall agree with and pay the owner thereof all damages that may be caused to the lands and property of said owner by the condemnation of said real estate and property, and by the construction of such road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Article 4447 provides the procedure for condemnation. It will be seen, however, that the initiative is placed upon the corporation and the manner prescribed by law is an agreement with the owner, which necessarily means that the law requires the corporation to proceed by offer to agree upon and pay the damages, and if the parties can not agree, then condemnation may be resorted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">We copy article 4473.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\u201cThe right of way secured or to be secured to any railroad company in this State, in the manner provided by law, shall not be so construed as to include the fee simple estate in lands, either public or private, nor shall the same be lost by the forfeiture or expiration of the charter, but shall remain subject to an extension of the charter or the grant of a new charter over the same way witbqut a new condemnation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">\u201cThe manner provided by law\u201d is either by agreement with the owner or condemnation, therefore, if the owner by agreement conveys the <em>\u201cright of way/\u2019 </em>it is secured to the railroad company in the manner provided by law and will be governed by the statute, and can not be construed to confei1 a fee simple title to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">There are but these questions presented: (1) Did the deed convey to the railroad company the oil beneath the surface? (2) If plaintiff is entitled to recover for the oil taken from the ground, did the court err in giving judgment for the value of the oil after it was delivered from the well, or should the cost of producing it have been deducted ?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The granting clause of the deed reads, \u201chave and do hereby grant, sell and convey unto the East Texas Railway Company, for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining its railroad, the right of way, two hundred feet in width, over and upon the above described tract of land.\u201d The interest granted in the land is the <em>right of way. </em>What right did the railroad company acquire? As we have seen, by the use of the terms, right of way, a grant of the right of way, the company did not acquire the fee in the land. It got but an easement, which would have been the effect of the deed independently of article 4473, copied above. In Calcasieu Lumber Co. v. Harris, 77 Texas, 23, 13 S. W., 455, this court said: \u201cWhen, therefore, the railroad company under its charter and the promoter of the private railroad under the Act of 1832 were authorized to take private property for the use of their roads, the rights they acquired were a right of way and facilities necessary to the efficient use of that right. They were not empowered to use the exclusive right of way granted to each for any other independent purpose than that for which it was granted. The fee remained in the private owner, and outside of the authorized use, which must be public or incidental to the public use, the proprietary right is in the original owner.\u201d . . . \u201cThe words bright of way,\u2019 if not defined, are expressive of the very nature of the right ordinarily held by railway companies in the lands over which their roads run\u2014a right to use the land only for railway purposes'\u2014an easement.\u201d The extract clearly defines the term <em>right of way, </em>which is but an easement in the land. The authorities are unanimous on this proposition. 3 Elliott on R. R., sec. 938; Stuyvesant v. Woodruff, 21 N. J. L., 133; 57 Am. Dec., 156; Olive v. Sabine &amp; E. T. Ry. Co., 11 Texas Civ. App., 208, 33 S. W., 139. All authorities agree that the grant of a \u201cright of way\u201d confers only an easement in the land. But land to be used as a right of way may be conveyed in. fee, therefore the character of the title conveyed must be determined by the words used and the attending facts and cireumstanc\u00e9s.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Under article 6484, Revised Statutes, 1911 (art. 4425, Rev: Stats., 1895), a railroad company might appropriate for right of way not exceeding two hundred feet in width, of any tract of land, and might appropriate the timber, earth, stone or other materials on adjoining lands. The same effect is given by the statute whether the land be condemned or conveyed by deed and in neither case is the \u201cright of way\u201d over the land to be so construed as to secure the fee simple estate in the lands either \u201cpublic or private.\u201d Art. 6532, Rev. Stats., 1911. Thus it is by statute declared that the railroad company by condemnation could have acquired all that this deed expresses, except what might be derived from the word \u201cmineral.\u201d It is significant and tends to show that the deed was intended to take the place and have the effect of condemnation conferring the same rights under like limitations. The term \u201cright of way\u201d has a definite meaning which is clearly expressed by Chief Justice Stayton in Calcasieu Lumber Co. v. Harris, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">If the word \u201cmineral\u201d be omitted from the deed, there could be no doubt that it vested in the railroad company only an easement which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>would not include the mineral oil beneath the surface. We must, therefore, inquire as to the proper construction of the clause with that word in its connection with the other language. The intention of the grantor must prevail, for which we must seek in the language used by him, with any light which may be shed upon the terms used by a full consideration of the entire transaction as shown by the attending facts, giving to the language the construction most favorable to the grantee. We concede this in the present case for the sake of this argument, but we are doubtful of the correctness of its application under the facts in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">The rule of construction, \u201cejusdem generis,\u201d is thus stated: \u201cGeneral words following particular words will not include things of a superior class.\u201d There is this further restriction of general words following particular words, that the general words will not include any of a class superior to that to which the particular words belong.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The sole reliance of the railroad company and the defendant in error for title to the oil is in the use of the words, \u201cand mineral.\u201d The particular words, \u201ctimber, earth, stone,\u201d designate the most common minerals, and are followed by the general word, \u201cmineral,\u201d and the latter word should be applied to the same class, that is,'such as may be found upon or near the surface, as gravel and the like. It is contrary to all precedent to give it the effect to include the superior class, \u201cmineral oil,\u201d which is to be found at great depth and is of much greater value.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">That construction is made more certain by the purpose for which the grant was made, which is thus expressed: \u201cFor the purpose of constructing. operating and maintaining its railroad, the right of way, two hundred feet in width, over and upon the above described tract of land; together with the right to take and use all the timber, earth, stone and mineral existing or that may be found within the right of way hereby granted.\u201d The \u201ctimber, earth and stone\u201d would be useful in constructing, operating and maintaining the railroad, and the \u201cmineral\u201d being given for the same purpose, must be construed to include only the same class, and can not possibly mean petroleum oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">We conclude that the Court of Civil Appeals properly rendered judgment for the Gladys City Oil, Gas &amp; Manufacturing Company.</p>\n<p id=\"ASb\">It is claimed by the plaintiffs in error that the burden was upon the plaintiffs to prove the cost of bringing the oil to the surface in order to establish the sum for which they were entitled to judgment. This is an ingenious argument, but not sound. If it were the law that the plaintiff in such case was entitled to recover only the value of the oil less the cost of producing it there would be more force in the contention. But the law is that the owner of the soil owned the oil beneath the surface as a part of the land and his title was made more definite when the oil was lifted to the surface. Bender v. Brooks, 103 Texas, 327, 127 S. W., 168; Ann. Cases, 1913 A., 559.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad4\">If, however, the person who produced the oil acted in good faith, he would be entitled to have deducted the cost of bringing it to the surface and to the market. The contention of plaintiff in error is in effect that the owner must concede the good faith of the trespasser and prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>that which is known only to his adversary, the cost of producing the oil. The contention is unsound. In the case cited above this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-3\">\"The law will determine the rights of the parties, but equity will adjust the account between them upon the doctrine which applies to innocent purchasers in good faith who make improvements upon land which adds to its value. The owner gets his property and the innocent occupant is remunerated for'his labor and money expended in making the improvements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">There was neither. pleading nor evidence to authorize the court to deduct the cost of bringing the oil to market, therefore the Court of Civil Appeals did not err in rendering judgment for the sum that defendant received by the sale of the oil, and the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
