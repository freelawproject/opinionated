The amount is based upon the net earnings of defendant in 1947 calculated in accordance with the property settlement agreement which was made a part of the decree, and has been construed in <em>Kohn </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>Civ. No. 14017, <em>ante, </em>p. 708 [214 P.2d 71], this day filed. Two items of income included by the court are questioned: 1. a sum paid to defendant as salary by Federated Investment Company which the court treated as a dividend; and 2. income received from property acquired from the estate of George Kohn, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Appellant\u2019s similar contentions in <em>Kohn </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>Civ. N. 14017, <em>ante, </em>p. 708 [214 P.2d 71], were disposed of adversely to him and no purpose would be served by repeating the discussion of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">Nourse, P. J., and Goodell, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 25, 1950, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 23, 1950. Schauer, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
