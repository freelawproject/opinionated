DOMENICK COLLOSI et al., Appellants.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b844-10\">Barry Sullivan for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b844-11\">Sidney Fischgrund for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b844-12\">DORAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGu\">On June 1, 1947, the appellant Collosi, owner, of two houses described as 3843 and 3843% Whittier Boulevard, in Los Angeles, leased said property to respondent Rizzo for a three-year term, at a rental of $85 per month. Respondent tenant paid $230 as rental for the first' month and the last two months of said term. There was a memorandum in the form of a rent receipt evidencing the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">The respondent\u2019s complaint seeks a declaration of rights and \u201ca determination that the plaintiff has a good, valid and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>existing lease for the term of three years\u201d; treble damages for alleged rent overcharge, and attorney fees. It is alleged that plaintiff paid to defendant the sum of $330 over and above the lawful rental for said housing accommodations. The complaint also alleges that \u201cas additional consideration for the leasing,\u201d plaintiff painted the outside and inside of the houses, the reasonable value of labor and materials being $750.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The answer of Domeniek Collosi denies all allegations; an answer by Mary Collosi sets up joint ownership with Domeniek Collosi, and alleges that No. 3843 Whittier Boulevard was decontrolled by the O.P.A. on March 2, 1948. It is further alleged that on March 15, 1948, defendants served a month\u2019s notice to quit on the plaintiffs but that the latter have not vacated said premises. As to No. 3843% Whittier Boulevard, it is alleged that plaintiff does not occupy same and that same had been sublet by plaintiff to one Llewellyn P. Card. Said answer prays that plaintiff be adjudged to have no interest in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The trial court found, as stated in appellants\u2019 brief, that the property was leased as alleged for three years; the front premises known as 3843 Whittier Boulevard, renting for $55 per month, and the rental for the back premises known as No. 3843%, being $30; that defendant was paid $230 for the first and last two months, and was allowed $25 because 3843% was not completed and ready for occupancy. It is further found that plaintiff painted No. 3843 at a cost of $200; that 3843% was voluntarily painted by plaintiff without obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">The court also found that the defendant received $15 over and above the lawful rental for No. 3843, and that the reasonable cost of the painting, namely $200, was in the nature of a bonus, making the total rental overcharge $215. The trial court concluded \u201cThat the plaintiff has a valid lease . . . for a term of three years, \u2019 \u2019 as alleged, denied treble damages and gave judgment for plaintiff \u201cin the sum of $215.00 as excess rent and bonus charged and collected over and above the legal maximum rent for the premises at 3843 Whittier Boulevard,\u201d together with $75 for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Appellants\u2019 brief frames the question involved as follows: \u201cmay the Court declare a lease for a period of three years, and at the same time hold that the lease is in violation of the Emergency Price Control Act?\u201d In the respondent\u2019s brief the question is thus stated: \u201cWhether or not the owner . . . who, . . . offers to lease the premises for a term of three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>years upon the condition that the tenant pays the first and last two months rent . . . and provided the tenant furnish all work and labor for painting . . . and who extracts the first and last two months\u2019 rent . . . and permits the tenant to take possession and make said improvements, can deny the existence of a valid lease on the ground that it is in violation of the Emergency Price Control Act . . . where the tenant did not know that the premises were subject to rent control and the landlord did not disclose that fact . . . until after suit was brought by the landlord to evict the tenant?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">In paragraph VI of plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action, among other things it is alleged \u201cThat the defendant should be es-topped from claiming that the plaintiff does not have a valid lease for the term of three (3) years from June 1,1947.\u201d This allegation the trial court found to be true. There is no transcript of the testimony but from the briefs of the respective parties it appears that there is no material conflict in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In the language of respondent\u2019s brief, it may be said that \u201cThe Court properly enforced a contract against the defendants, who, as landlords, attempted to take advantage of their own illegal act, and in favor of the plaintiff for whose protection the particular statute was enacted.\u201d Having secured the first and last two months\u2019 rent and the benefits of painting improvements furnished by the plaintiff in the reasonable belief that occupancy was assured for the stipulated term of three years, the defendants then sought to eject plaintiffs and to avoid the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Illegality of the lease by reason of violation of section 206 (a) of the Rent Control Law [61 Stats. 199, 50 U.S.C.A.App. \u00a7 1896], making it unlawful1 \u2018to offer, solicit, demand, accept or receive any rent for the use or occupancy of any controlled housing accommodation in excess of the maximum rent,\u201d is offered as a reason for reversal of the judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor. That the Rent Control Law was not designed to accomplish such result at the hands of a landlord who has exacted excessive rent, seems obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">In respect to the fundamental principle involved the present situation is not unlike that of <em>Beverly Hills Nat. Bank &amp; Tr. Co. </em>v. <em>Seres, </em>76 Cal.App.2d 255, 261 [172 P.2d 894], where it appeared that a tenant had paid money to a former occupant in order to secure earlier possession and had made substantial improvements in reliance on a representation of plaintiff\u2019s grantor that the premises would be leased for a five-year term. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>The appellate court there held that such facts \u201cwould warrant application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel so as to foreclose . . . [reliance] upon the statute of frauds to support a claim that no valid 5-year lease had been entered into.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Appellants\u2019 complaint that the trial court did not make findings in respect to material issues is specious and not supported by the record. The contention that the court did not find that the property in question was used as \u201cresidence\u201d property is, as respondent points out, answered by the fact that both pleadings and findings refer to the premises as \u2018 \u2018 housing accommodations, \u2019 \u2019 which is the term used in the Rent Control Law. Appellants\u2019 briefs present no meritorious cause for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
