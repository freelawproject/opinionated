From the order fixing inheritance tax, the executor appealed. Thereupon, respondent moved to augment the record on appeal by adding a copy of the will of George Owen Knapp. Appellant contends that the will was never offered to the trial court and that the matter was submitted solely upon a written stipulation of facts. The judge who tried the case states that the will was not considered in fixing the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-20\">The file has been gone over, with reference to the motion to augment the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-21\">The stipulation is controlling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-22\">\u201cThe following facts are stipulated to be true and proof thereof is hereby waived <em>and the same shall constitute the entire evidence and proof for the purpose of determining the issues </em>raised by the report of the Inheritance Tax Appraiser and the objection of said Executor thereto.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-23\">Therefore, the motion to augment the record by bringing up the will of the decedent is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
