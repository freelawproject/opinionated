Moran, attorney for Jo Ann Ulmer, for fifing for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in violation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(g)(2). Moran appealed to federal district court, which affirmed. Moran again appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-27\">The debtor, Jo Ann Ulmer, filed for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. She thereby triggered an automatic stay, barring Dr. Dan C. Frisard, a creditor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Ulmer, from collecting money owed him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Frisar\u00e1 subsequently filed a motion seeking relief from the stay. The bankruptcy court deferred addressing Frisard\u2019s motion until it resolved another issue, an objection to Ul-mer\u2019s claimed homestead exemption. After the bankruptcy court resolved the issue of the homestead exemption and before the court ruled on the relief Frisar\u00e1 requested, on December 15, 1989 Ulmer voluntarily dismissed her case under Chapter 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Frisar\u00e1 subsequently took various legal actions to secure the money Ulmer owed him. Michael J. Moran, who represented Ulmer, filed a petition on February 9,1980 for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in part, as he acknowledges on appeal, to stave off Frisard\u2019s attempts at collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Frisar\u00e1 responded with a motion for relief from the stay, which the bankruptcy court granted. Ulmer moved to have the stay partially reinstated. Frisar\u00e1 then filed a motion for dismissal of Ulmer\u2019s case with prejudice alleging a violation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Section 109(g)(2) prohibits a debtor from seeking relief under Title 11 a second time within 180 days of an earlier bankruptcy case if the debtor \u201crequested and obtained the voluntary dismissal of the [earlier] case following the filing of a request for relief from the automatic stay provided\u201d by the Bankruptcy Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Congress enacted section 109(g)(2) to prevent debtors from frustrating creditors\u2019 efforts to recover funds owed them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The section denies a debtor the opportunity to invoke repeatedly the automatic stay of Title 11. Without the section, a debtor could move in and out of bankruptcy, forcing a creditor to pursue time and again the right to collect a debt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">Ulmer filed for relief under Chapter 7 within 180 days of her voluntary dismissal of her case under Chapter 18. The bankruptcy court therefore dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">Arguing that Ulmer\u2019s attempt to seek relief under Chapter 7 constituted a clear violation of the Bankruptcy Code, Frisar\u00e1 seeks sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure ll.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He wishes to recover the money he expended in attorney\u2019s fees and costs as a result of Ulmer\u2019s second effort to secure relief under the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court sanctioned Moran, Ulmer\u2019s attorney, for filing the second petition. The district court affirmed. Moran appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">We review the imposition of sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">Moran argues on appeal that section 109(g)(2) did not prohibit Ulmer from seeking protection under Title 11 a second time and, if it did, that the law was not sufficiently clear to warrant sanctions. Sanctions are appropriate if the position a lawyer adopts is \u201cunreasonable from the point of view both of existing law and of its possible extension, modification, or reversal.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-19\">Section 109(g)(2) appears on its face to proscribe Ulmer\u2019s second filing for bankruptcy. The statute provides that \u201cno individual or family farmer may be a debtor under this title who has been a debtor in a case pending under this title at any time in the preceding 180 days if ... the debtor requested and obtained the voluntary dismissal of the ease following the filing of a request for relief from the automatic stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>provided\u201d by Title ll.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ulmer sought protection under Title 11. Frisard requested relief from the automatic stay provided by Title 11. Ulmer then voluntarily dismissed her case under Title 11. Ulmer, acting through Moran as her attorney, filed again for relief before 180 days had elapsed. The impropriety of this act is obvious. Moran\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Moran claims that Frisard\u2019s motion for relief from the stay was no longer before the court when Ulmer voluntarily dismissed the case. Moran bases this claim on his observations that the bankruptcy court did not act on Frisard\u2019s request for relief, and that Fri-sard did not urge the court to pursue the request, within the time frame that Moran alleges the Bankruptcy Code required. Moran infers that Frisard withdrew his request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In the alternative, Moran argues that the bankruptcy court ruled against Frisard on his request for relief. When Frisard first requested relief, the court postponed addressing the issue until it resolved a question involving Ulmer\u2019s claimed homestead exemption. Moran interprets this delay as a denial of Frisard\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Underlying both of these claims is the premise that had Frisard withdrawn the request for relief or the court denied that request, then Ulmer would have been free to petition for bankruptcy within the 180 day period. We need not address the validity of this premise,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because the request was still pending before the bankruptcy court when Ulmer voluntarily requested a withdrawal of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Moran\u2019s arguments to the contrary lack merit. Perhaps Frisard could have successfully urged the court to address his motion more quickly. His failure to do so and the court\u2019s failure, if any, to act promptly provide no basis, however, to conclude that Frisard no longer wished to recover the money Ul-mer owed him or that the court would not allow Frisard to recover the money. In any case, Frisard did not withdraw his motion to lift the stay and the court did not rule on the motion. When Ulmer voluntarily dismissed her ease, Frisard could not pursue the motion. When she sought relief under Chapter 13, he had to begin again his efforts to recover the money owed him. Section 109(g)(2) bars a debtor from thwarting a creditor\u2019s efforts in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Moran next argues that implicit in section 109(g)(2) is the qualification that the rule does not apply to debtors who act in good f\u00e1ith. Although the section seems to establish a clear rule, Moran contends that it should only apply where a debtor abuses the protection afforded by the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Moran correctly notes that two lines of cases have developed interpreting section 109(g)(2). One line rejects the notion that courts should look to the spirit rather than the letter of the section. These cases require a court to apply section 109(g)(2) strictly regardless of the reasons for a debtor\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A second line of cases, on which Moran relies, acknowledges a good faith exception. The latter line of cases does not, however, support Moran\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The decision of the United States Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit in <em>In re </em>Luna,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is representative. The debt- or in <em>In re Luna </em>filed for protection under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code. A creditor then filed for relief from the automatic stay, which the debtor\u2019s action had triggered. The court granted the creditor\u2019s requested relief, provided that the creditor met certain conditions in pursuing the money owed. When the creditor did not abide by these conditions, the debtor once again filed for protection under Chapter 13. The creditor moved to dismiss the second petition under section 109(g)(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court noted that applying 109(g)(2) under these circumstances would \u201creward [the creditor] for acting in bad faith and punish [the debtor] for acting in good faith.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court refused to dismiss the debtor\u2019s ease.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moran\u2019s actions are not analogous to <em>In re Luna </em>or to the other cases reading an exception into section 109(g)(2).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The bankruptcy court found that, even if an exception to section 109(g)(2) protects a debtor who violates its terms but acts in good faith, the exception would not extend to Moran\u2019s litigation strategy. Moran offered no evidence that he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 for a purpose other than delaying Frisard\u2019s recovery of the money owed him. Indeed, Moran acknowledges that Frisard\u2019s aggressive efforts to recover from Ulmer, and in particular Frisard\u2019s attempt to garnish Ulmer\u2019s wages, prompted Moran to file a petition for relief under Chapter 7 on Ul-mer\u2019s behalf. Moran took this step to ward off Frisard. In other words, Moran had Ulmer act in the very manner that Congress proscribed through section 109(g)(2). No interpretation of section 109(g)(2) can provide a satisfactory justification for this action, nor could any plausible interpretation have led Moran to believe that a court would approve his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">Moran also argues that the bankruptcy court adopted the wrong standard in imposing sanctions. The bankruptcy court noted that Moran provided no evidence that he had a motive other than delay when Moran filed a petition under Chapter 7 on Ulmer\u2019s behalf. Moran contends, however, that the burden lay on Frisard, as the movant, to prove that Moran intended to delay Frisard\u2019s efforts. This argument confuses the legal issues before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">The bankruptcy court found, among other things, that Moran had not performed a reasonable inquiry into the law such that his request on Ulmer\u2019s behalf under Chapter 7 embodied existing legal principles or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. The failure to perform such a legal inquiry provides a basis for liability under Rule 11 independent from any claim that Moran\u2019s intent was to delay legal proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moran\u2019s intentions are relevant only because Moran claims that there is a good faith exception to Section 109(g)(2). The bankruptcy court was addressing the requirements of section 109(g)(2), not of Rule 11, when it noted that Moran provided no rationale for the second filing other than to hinder Frisard\u2019s efforts to recover funds owed him. In the context of section 109(g)(2), the bankruptcy court\u2019s observation was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The district court\u2019s review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision gives rise to a final issue. Moran claims that the district court applied the wrong standard on appeal. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court but, in doing so, hesitated to criticize Moran\u2019s actions. Moran confuses the delicacy of the district court for a misunderstanding of the law. The district court in essence adopted the position of the bankruptcy court. We find that the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to impose a sanction under Rule 11 was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(g)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\">. <em>See </em>Harry Wright, <em>Must Courts Apply Section 109(g)(2) When Debtors Intend Mo Abuse in an Earlier Dismissal of Their Case?, </em>7 Bank.Dev.J. 103, 106-07 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-13\">. <em>See </em>Wright, supra note 3, at 103-05.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b365-20\">. <em>See </em>Bankruptcy Rule 9011 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-21\">. <em>Elliott v.
