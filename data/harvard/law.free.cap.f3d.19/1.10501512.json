The court subsequently sentenced him to a term of twenty years pursuant to the enhancement sentencing provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. Thereafter, he filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-23\">James subsequently filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion. In it, he contended that his conviction and sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon were invalid because Florida had restored his civil rights. The district court denied James\u2019 motion on the merits, and this appeal involves that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-24\">On appeal, James argues two grounds for relief. First, he claims his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, is barred pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20), which voids felon status for those individuals who receive a restoration of civil rights that does not preclude gun possession. James claims that because his certificate of restoration does not contain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>precise language regarding guns that is in \u00a7 921(a)(20), he is entitled to the nullification of felon status provided by that section. Second, he argues that the sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 924(e) is barred. He contends that because a restoration voids his past crimes, it thereby eliminates their consideration in determining whether he is a career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The government responds that the specific language regarding guns in \u00a7 921(a)(20) need not be included in a certificate of restoration to bar nullification of felon status. It argues the felon need only be put on notice that he cannot own or possess a firearm. Accordingly, because James\u2019 certificate of restoration explicitly bars gun possession, he was properly convicted and sentenced for his possession of a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The determination of whether \u00a7 921(a)(20) should have barred appellant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1) or his sentencing under \u00a7 924(e) is a question of statutory interpretation, a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Hooshmand, </em>931 F.2d 725, 737 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\n<em>The Issue Involving the Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person ... who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport ... or possess ... any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition.\u201d However, according to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20), the crimes which can be considered do not include \u201c[a]ny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored ... unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that <em>the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">James\u2019 Certificate of Restoration of Civil Rights expressly grants the restoration of civil rights \u201cexcept the specific authority to possess or own a firearm.\u201d The Certificate does not specifically say that James \u201cmay not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms,\u201d as precisely stated in \u00a7 921(a)(20). Nonetheless, no statutory authority or case law supports the contention that the instrument evidencing the restoration of rights must use the precise language of \u00a7 921(a)(20) before it can exempt the defendant from prosecution under \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">James mainly relies on <em>United States v. Swanson, </em>947 F.2d 914 (11th Cir.1991), to support this appeal. In <em>Swanson, </em>however, this Court dismissed the defendant\u2019s indictment under \u00a7 922(g)(1) <em>only </em>because the defendant was in no way informed that this restoration of civil rights excepted gun possession. <em>Id. </em>at 918-19. James, on the contrary, was informed of such a restriction. Moreover, case law supports the commonsense conclusion that the limitation on gun possession need not duplicate the precise language set out in \u00a7 921(a)(20). <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>911 F.2d 219, 220 (9th Cir.1990) (holding that the whole of a state\u2019s law should be considered in determining whether a felon\u2019s civil rights have been restored within the meaning of \u00a7 921(a)(20)); <em>see also United States v. Erwin, </em>902 F.2d 510, 512 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 859, 111 S.Ct. 161, 112 L.Ed.2d. 127 (1990) (same); <em>United States v. Cassidy, </em>899 F.2d 543, 546 (6th Cir.1990) (same). All of these decisions turn on notice of the restriction, not the language of the restriction. Consequently, James was properly convicted under \u00a7 922(g)(1), and the district court properly denied \u00a7 2255 relief on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">\n<em>The Sentence Enhancement Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), a defendant convicted under \u00a7 922(g)(1) who has three previous convictions, as defined by \u00a7 924(e), receives an enhancement of his sentence. As with \u00a7 922(g)(1), the convictions referred to in \u00a7 924(e) are subject to the definition in \u00a7 921(a)(20). James had more than three convictions prior to his conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1), thereby meeting the conviction requirement of \u00a7 924(e). Moreover, as discussed above, the \u00a7 921(a)(20) nullification of convictions does not apply to James, as his restoration of civil rights excluded the right to possess firearms. Consequently, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>was proper to enhance James\u2019 sentence under \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
