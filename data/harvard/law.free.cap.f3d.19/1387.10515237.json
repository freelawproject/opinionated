The charges stem from a 1991 crime spree during which Gordon and another man, Roger McQueen, robbed a Pizza Hut, beat up a police officer who caught up to them, stole the officer\u2019s pistol, hid out in the woods to avoid a manhunt, stole a ear at gunpoint and then .abandoned it, broke into the home of Johnnie Mae and Vestor Turner, held Mrs. Turner at gunpoint until Mr. Turner returned, and then forced Mr. Turner to drive them across the state line to Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah6i\">Gordon makes two distinct challenges to his sentence. First, he argues that the government in bad faith refused to move for a reduction in his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Gordon\u2019s plea agreement required the government to make such a motion if Gordon provided truthful \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the government in its criminal investigations. The government denies that bad faith motivated its decision not to make a \u00a7 5K1.\u00cd motion. Instead, it offers two other reasons for the decision: <em>first, </em>Gordon never provided substantial assistance to the government, and <em>second, </em>the government offered its plea deal based on a discussion with Gordon during which Gordon lied. At sentencing, the district court specifically found that the government acted in good faith and that Gordon failed to provide substantial assistance. The district court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-6\">Gordon\u2019s second challenge to his sentence involves a two-level increase to his base offense level that was made, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(3) (1991), because \u201ca dangerous weapon was used\u201d during the course of the kidnapping. Gordon correctly argues that mere \u201cbrandishing\u201d of a gun does not constitute use of a-weapon for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, cmt. 1(g). Here, however, Gordon\u2019s partner-in-crime (for whose actions Gordon is held responsible, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)) did not merely \u201cbrandish\u201d a gun; instead, he leveled a gun at Mrs. Turner\u2019s head and told her he would kill her if she did not do as she was told. According to the district court, the weapon \u201cwas used as the instrument to effect the kidnapping.\u201d When a dangerous weapon is pointed at specific persons in order to intimidate those persons into following specific orders, such activity is more than mere \u201cbrandishing\u201d and constitutes use of the weapon for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(3). <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>931 F.2d 238, 240 (3d Cir.1991); <em>United States v. De La Rosa, </em>911 F.2d 985, 993 (5th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Townley, </em>799 F.Supp. 646, 649 (W.D.La.1992); <em>cf. United States v. Roberts, </em>898 F.2d 1465, 1469-70 (10th Cir.1990) (ruling that a defendant who held a knife to a victim\u2019s face during a robbery did more than \u201cbrandish\u201d the knife for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-8\">Because the district court\u2019s findings on the government\u2019s good faith are not clearly erroneous, and because Gordon\u2019s partner did more than \u201cbrandish\u201d a pistol, Gordon\u2019s sen- . tence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
