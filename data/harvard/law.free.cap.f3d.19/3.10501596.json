(Appellants previously had pled guilty, and had been sentenced, pursuant to a plea agreement that required them to cooperate with the Government and required the Government, in turn, to advise the court of such cooperation.) The district court \u2014 without holding an evidentia-ry hearing \u2014 granted the first motion and reduced defendants\u2019 sentences by <em>five weeks; </em>defendants\u2019 motion to reconsider was summarily denied. On the second motion, defendants specifically requested an opportunity to present to the court the facts constituting appellants\u2019 cooperation. The district court, again without holding an evidentiary hearing, summarily denied the Rule 35(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-24\">Appellants now appeal, contending that the district court\u2019s action amounted to an abuse of discretion. In its answer brief, the Government agrees: \u201cThe district court\u2019s refusal to entertain the full facts of the defendants\u2019 cooperation operated to deny them the full benefits of their Plea Agreements and constituted a gross abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-25\">We fully agree, <em>see United States v. Yesil, </em>991 F.2d 1527 (11th Cir.1992). Appellants have proffered facts amply warranting an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-26\">We VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
