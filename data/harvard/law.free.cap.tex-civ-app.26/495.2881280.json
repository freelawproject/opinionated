Miller, a sum of money alleged to be due as taxes for the support of the public free schools in said district for the year 1898, and foreclose tax lien on certain lands described in the plaintiff\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The defendant answered by general and special exceptions and general denial. There was a nonjury trial resulting in favor of the plaintiff, and the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">On account of the public interest involved, the case has been recently advanced and submitted in this court, and we have given it such attention as the limited time before adjournment would permit. It involves a constitutional question, and for that reason may, and doubtless will, be carried to the Supreme Court for final decision. Hence, we content ourselves with merely stating our reasons for reversing the judgment, overruling without further comment the assignments raising other questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The suit is to recover a special tax assessed for a special purpose within a given territory comprising a portion only of a county. It is alleged that the tax was assessed upon certain real estate, and in order to show that such assessment was legal and liability for the payment-of the tax existed, it was necessary for the plaintiff to allege that the \"real estate involved was within the limits of the territory referred to. This the petition wholly fails to do, and for this reason, appellant\u2019s general demurrer should have been sustained. Cooley on Tax., p. 159. It is true, the petition alleges that the taxes sued for were legally and duly levied and assessed, but that is merely the averment of the pleader\u2019s conclusion, and not an allegation of facts showing the correctness of such conclusions. Millican v. McNeil, 92 Texas, 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">We are also disposed to sustain appellant\u2019s third special exception to the plaintiff\u2019s petition. To be qualified to vote at an election held for the purpose of determining whether or not a special school tax shall be levied, the person voting must not only be qualified to vote in general elections, but must also be a property taxpayer within the district. The petition alleges that an election was held for the purpose referred to, and that no one was allowed to vote \u201cexcept qualified voters under the law, .and those who, in addition to said qualification, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>property taxpayers, as shown by the last assessment rolls.\u201d But it does not allege that they were property taxpayers within the district. Cooley on Tax, 357, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
