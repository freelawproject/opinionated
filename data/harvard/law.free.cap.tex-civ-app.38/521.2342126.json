The proposition is thus put in the case of McIntire v. Cagley (37 Iowa, 679): \u201cThe measure of damages is uncertain. What would be a reasonable amount to reimburse the plaintiff .for the fees of an attorney in prosecuting a suit upon the note, and collecting the amount due thereon, is not certain, and, in the absence of an agreement of the parties, would have to be ascertained by the court, or a jury upon evidence. In cases like this the parties may agree beforehand what the injury shall be valued at, or what shall be taken as a compensation; for if the court should set it aside, it can only do what the parties had a right to, and have done, and that is, arrive at a general probability by a consideration of all the circumstances of the case. The court would have to hear testimony and determine therefrom the measure of the injury. It being impossible to define with certainty, beforehand, by reference to a money standard, the measure of the injury, it was competent for the parties to agree thereon, which they- have done. The collection of a note of the amount of the one sued on in this case might, under some circumstances, involve labor and expense much greater than under others. There being this uncertainty, the sum agreed upon by the parties will not be treated as a penalty, unless for such obvious excess and disproportion to rational expectation of injury as to make it clear that the principle of compensation was wholly disregarded, which does not appear in this case.\u201d Citing 3 Pars. on Cont., 159, 160, 161, and notes.

The notes sued on contained a stipulation for the payment of ten percent attorney\u2019s fees in case they were placed in the hands of an attorney for collection. Appellant sought to recover the ten percent attorney\u2019s fees stipulated in the notes. The administrators of the estate resisted the claim for the full amount of attorney\u2019s fees on the ground that the contract for the payment of said fees was a contract of indemnity, and appellant, not having agreed with its attorneys upon the amount to be paid them for their services in collecting the notes, would only be liable to them for the reasonable value of such services, and therefore could only recover of appellees that amount as attorney\u2019s fees. The evidence shows that $1,500 was a reasonable compensation for the services rendered and to be rendered by appellant\u2019s attorneys in the prosecution of the claim, and that there had been no agreement between appellant and its attorneys as to their compensation for collecting the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Judgment was rendered by the court below in fayor of appellant for the principal and interest due on the notes, and for the further sum of $1,500 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The only question involved in the appeal is the correctness of the judgment for attorney\u2019s fees. This court held, in the case of Dunovant\u2019s Estate v. Stafford (81 S. W. Rep., 101), that the stipulation in a note for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees in event it was placed in the hands of an attorney for collection was a contract of indemnity, or, rather, that the amount named as attorney\u2019s fees should be regarded as a penalty, and not as agreed or liquidated damages. In that case a recovery for the whole amount of the attorney\u2019s fees was upheld on the ground that the holder of the note had contracted with his attorneys to pay them the full amount of the attorney\u2019s fees authorized to be paid by the note, and the maker having agreed that said amount could be paid as attorney\u2019s fees, was estopped from setting up the unreasonableness of the contract in the absence of fraud or mistake. A writ of error was refused by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">While the refusal of the writ of error does not necessarily indicate that the Supreme. Court approved the grounds upon which our opinion in the case was based, as stated in that opinion, we think the rule that the stipulation in a note for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees is a contract for indemnity, and not one for the payment of agreed damages, is settled by the decisions in this State. (Luzenberg v. Building &amp; L. Assn., 29 S. W. Rep., 237; Hammond v. Atlee, 39 S. W. Rep., 600.)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u2022 In both the eases cited it was held that the \"holder of a note was only entitled to recover as attorney\u2019s fees the amount he had agreed to pay his attorneys for collecting the note. We think it logically and necessarily follows, from this rule, that, where no agreement has been made between the holder of the note and the attorneys employed by him to collect, the holder could only recover on the note such amount for attorney\u2019s fees as his attorney could recover from him for his services. In such case the attorney could only recover the reasonable value of his services, and that should be the measure of the recovery which the holder of the note could obtain against' the maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">There is no issue raised by appellant on the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the judgment of the court below that $1,500 was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>reasonable value of the services of his attorneys in the collection of the notes sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
