The jury will be presumed to have acted reasonably, and were not misled simply because the items constituting the permanent damage were not detailed in said clause.

This was followed by the paragraph complained of and quoted above, which merely stated in detail what the jury would take into consideration, if warranted by the evidence, in estimating the damages, enumerating, first, the items of loss which the evidence tended to show had already been sustained, and then directing their attention to the issue, raised both by the pleadings and evidence, of loss thereafter to result from existing or permanent injuries. We fail to see how any sensible jury could reasonably have been misled by this charge into giving double damages. Read in connection with the next preceding paragraph, it submitted the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of damages in a logical and reasonably perspicuous manner. The last clause, so much objected to, might have gone a little further, and explained more fully how the damages for permanent injuries were to be measured, but, as no further instruction on that subject was requested, and as the court had already stated the rule in general terms, we must overrule the contention of appellant that this clause of the charge gave the jury a \u201croving commission.\u201d The clause \u201cor, if she has not recovered therefrom,\u201d merely suggested in another form the idea of future loss, for which compensation was to be made if warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">The cases cited and relied on by appellant have all been examined, and, while we think some of them went quite far enough in overturning verdicts for the supposed influence of charges construed to authorize a double recovery, the conclusions above reached are not believed to be in conflict with any of them; but, on the contrary, seem to be sanctioned by some of the cases cited by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
