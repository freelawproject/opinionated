I have lost the application which you so kindly sent me the other day, and I wish you would send me one-half dozen applications as there might be other sections I might wish to buy. Kindly let me hear from you and let me know if section number 2, H. E. &amp; W. T. Ry., certificate number 1219, is for sale as well as the other about which you wrote me. Your .usual promptness will be appreciated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-16\">\u201c \u2018Yours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-17\">\u201c \u2018J. D. Labrie.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-18\">Section 8 of the Act of the Legislature of April 19, 1901, relating to the sale and lease of public free school and asylum lands, etc., insofar as it applies to the question involved in this action, is as follows: \u201cThe Commissioner of the General Land Office shall adopt such regulations for the sale of timber on the timbered lands as may be deemed necessary and judicious. Such timber shall not be sold for less than $5 per acre, cash, except in such eases as the Commissioner may ascertain by definite examination by an approved agent appointed by him for that purpose, to be paid by the purchaser, to be sparsely timbered, or containing timber of but little value, in which case he may sell the timber on such sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>or part of sections at its proper value, provided such timber is sold at not less than $2 per acre.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">This provision of law evidently authorizes the Commissioner of the General Land Office to adopt a rule requiring as a prerequisite to the purchase of timber on the timbered lands referred to, that the person desiring to purchase same should make and file in the General Land Office a-' written application therefor of a certain prescribed form in substance. A manifest reason for such requirement is that it would materially aid in the proper and orderly conduct of the business relating to the sale of such timber. It would furnish a convenient and plain record of the fact of the application\u2019s being made and the particular timber to which it relates, so that persons subsequently desiring to purchase same could readily obtain information that there was a previous application therefor; and thus confusion and conflicting claims in reference to the same timber be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The testimony of J. T. Bobinson, chief clerk of the General Land Office, showed that in making sales of timber under the law herein-before referred to, it was the uniform rule of the Commissioner of the General Land Office to require written applications to. be made by persons desiring to purchase the same; that he adopted the printed form of application which had been invariably in use since 1887, and that no sale had been made of such timber by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, except in pursuance of and based upon a written application upon the prescribed form. The evidence in the record shows that the appellants knew of this rule and failed to comply with it. The Supreme Court in the cases of Tolleson v. Rogan, 96 Texas, 424, 73 S. R. Rep., 524, and McGee v. Corbin, 96 Texas, 35, 70 S. W. Rep., 80, practically hold that where the Commissioner of the General Land Office, in the conduct of the business of his office, has adopted a rule and for a considerable length of time has invariably observed it, persons dealing with him in reference to the business to which the rule relates, would be held to have assented to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">We are of opinion that the telegrams and other correspondence between the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the appellants, upon which they, appellants, rely as constituting a sale of the timber in controversy, do not show a sale thereof; and, therefore, there was no error in the judgment of the court below in so holding and in dissolving the temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">This disposition of the case renders it unnecessary for us to pass upon the other question presented by appellants\u2019 assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">There being no reversible error pointed out in the record, the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
