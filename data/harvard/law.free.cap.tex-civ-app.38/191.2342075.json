It is unnecessary for us to undertake to state what is the authority of an <em>amicus curiae, </em>or what office or function he may perform in appearing before the court and offering such suggestions as he may see proper to make, as we are clearly of the opinion that he has no power to represent a party in, giving notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The motion is sustained and the appeal dismissed at the cost of the Choctaw, Oklahoma &amp; Gulf Bailroad Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
