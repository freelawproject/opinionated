Vogel, is sentenced to serve on Count I: Attempt (Deliberate Homicide), a Felony, One Hundred Years (100) in the Montana State Prison, at Deer Lodge, Montana.

It is also ordered that the defendant serve forty (40) years in the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge, Montana for the offense of Count II: Robbery, a Felony. All Sentences are to run consecutively, which means the Court intends a total Sentence herein of 150 years in the Montana State Prison.

The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoe\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division provides: \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (Section 45-18-904(3), MCA.) The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"A4MF\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"A5Z\">Chairman, Hon.
