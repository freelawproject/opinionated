This period of incarceration is suspended in its entirety and is to be served consecutive to the sentences imposed for Count I and in Cause No. DC 97-005(a). The Defendant is hereby designated a Persistent Felony Offender, as such it is further ordered that the Defendant be incarcerated at the Montana State Prison for ten (10) years. This period of incarceration is suspended in its entirety and is to be served consecutive to the sentences imposed for Counts I and II and in Cause No. DC 97-005(a).

The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AiS\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"AagP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Done in open Court this 14th day of August, 1998.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate id=\"AHze\">DATED this 1st day of September, 1998.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"ALE\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division provides: \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (Section 45-18-904(3), MCA.) The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"AsA\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed with the modification that one (1) year be suspended on Count I of DC-97-261(b).</p>\n<p id=\"AIfd\">The reason for the modification is made on the recommendation of Ed Corrigan, of the Flathead County Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<judges id=\"A7i\">Chairman, Hon.
