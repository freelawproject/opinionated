The decedent\u2019s three children, as well as the personal representative who had been appointed prior to the discovery of the will, contested the will and asserted, among other things, that the decedent\u2019s estate was entitled to a share of the partnership that they claim Hal had formed with Bud. The District Court concluded that a partnership existed and awarded the estate half of the value of the partnership assets. Hal and his spouse appeal and the estate cross-appeals.

He was survived by his three adult children, as well as his father and stepmother. Intestacy proceedings were initiated, and in April 1995 Deborah Reichman became personal representative of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-21\">\u00b6 15 On July 13,1995, H.A. Bolinger (Hal), Bud\u2019s father, submitted a will for probate and petitioned the District Court for appointment as personal representative. The will, which was prepared in 1984, left all of Bud\u2019s estate to Hal and nominated him as the personal representative. In the event that Hal failed to survive Bud, the will named Marian Bolinger, Hal\u2019s wife, as the sole beneficiary. On November 1,1995, Hal withdrew his request to be appointed personal representative and suggested that Marian, who was also nominated by the will, be named personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u00b616 This Court discussed the terms of the will in <em>In re Estate of Bolinger </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 114, 943 P.2d 981. In dispute was whether the language of the will created an express trust for the benefit of Bud\u2019s three children. We ultimately held that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b6 17 Pursuant to the will contest, the estate filed discovery requests and moved for partial summary judgment. Hal and Marian objected to some of the requests that related to taxes and assets of the ranch, and the existence of a partnership between Hal and Bud on the basis that they were not relevant to the issue of the will\u2019s validity. In December 1996, the District Court overruled their objections and ordered that they answer the requests and allow an inspection of the ranch by the end of January 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b618 After a hearing, and based on all the evidence before it, on December 18,1996, the District Court made findings of fact and conclusions of law in response to the summary judgment motion. It stated that \u201c[i]n the interest of judicial economy, the Court feels it advisable to make detailed findings at this time, to assist in determining other issues which may hereafter need to be determined.\u201d Most of the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions pertained to the terms of the will, but in addition, the District Court found that Hal and Bud had entered into a written partnership agreement in 1968. It found that despite the express ten-year term of the agreement, Hal and Bud operated the ranch as a partnership until Bud\u2019s death. In addition, it found that Hal had filed a $49,000 claim against the estate, based on an agister\u2019s lien claim, to recover for his expenses incurred to feed Bud\u2019s cattle from January 1,1994, to May 15,1995; Reichman denied the claim in June 1995 prior to the discovery of the will. It went on to find that there were no written documents regarding the terms of the alleged agreement, and that Marian, the only witness to Hal and Bud\u2019s agreement, had described the extent of the agreement as a statement by Hal and subsequent acknowledgment by Bud that he would \u201chave to pay his share.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b619 Based on the District Court\u2019s findings, the estate made a second motion for partial summary judgment in January 1997. It contended that the findings established the existence of a partnership and that the District Court should order an accounting of the partnership. Furthermore, it contended that the agister\u2019s lien should be denied in its entirety as a matter of law, based on a lack of specificity in the alleged agreement between Hal and Bud. In response, Hal and Marian contended that their affidavits established genuine issues of fact re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>garding the hen which precluded summary judgment, and that summary judgment regarding the existence of a partnership must be denied for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b620 On February 25,1997, the District Court concluded that the alleged agreement between Hal and Bud, which was the basis of Hal\u2019s claimed agister\u2019s hen, was not specific and, therefore, was unenforceable as a matter of law. The District Court also concluded, based on Hal\u2019s testimony, that a partnership existed. Accordingly, it granted the motion for partial summary judgment and ordered that an accounting be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b621 The accounting was eventually performed and considered by the District Court at a hearing in May 1997. On September 3,1997, the District Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment pursuant to the accounting, in which it determined the amount of ranch property that should be credited to the estate. Based on its interpretation of the partnership agreement, the District Court concluded that the land on which the partnership operation was conducted was never intended to be an asset of the partnership and excluded its value from the determination of the estate\u2019s interest. The division and valuation of the remaining partnership assets relied, in large part, on the fact that Hal and Marian had refused to respond to Reichman\u2019s discovery requests and the District Court\u2019s subsequent orders to compel, so that they were estopped from contesting the values or division arrived at by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b622 The judgment awarded Bud\u2019s estate included one-half the market value of the partnership cattle and equipment, and compensation for lost use of pasture land and hay taken from Bud\u2019s land, for a total of approximately $225,000. Finally, the District Court held that the judgment constituted a hen against all personal property of the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">\u00b623 Did the District Court err when it ordered the appellants to comply with the estate\u2019s discovery requests?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">\u00b624  We review a district court\u2019s ruling on discovery matters to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>See McKamey v. State </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 137, 145, 885 P.2d 515, 520; <em>In re Marriage of Caras </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 377, 384, 868 P.2d 615, 619. We stated in <em>Massaro v. Dunham </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 400, 404-05, 603 P.2d 249, 251-52, that a district court has inherent discretionary power to control discovery, and that we will reverse its discovery decisions only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>when the substantial rights of a party have been materially affected such that there exists the possibility of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b625 Appellants concede that the District Court has discretionary authority to control discovery, but rely solely on their assertion that \u201csuch discretionary power is not unfettered.\u201d They imply that the District Court abused its discretion when it did not hold a hearing to address their objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b626 We note from our review of the record that the discovery about which appellants now complain had been the subject of a previous order by the District Court and that prior to the order complained of on appeal, appellants did in fact have an opportunity to raise their objections at a hearing before the District Court. For these reasons, we conclude that the appellants\u2019 substantial rights have not been affected by the District Court\u2019s order to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b627 Did the District Court err when it made findings of fact and granted summary judgment regarding the existence of a partnership between Hal and Bud?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b628  The question of whether a partnership exists constitutes a mixed question of fact and law. <em>See Blocker Exploration Co. v. Frontier Exploration, Inc. </em>(Colo. 1987), 740 P.2d 983, 988. Courts must decide as a matter of law what constitutes a partnership, but the determination of whether the evidence in a given case supports the existence of a partnership is a question of fact. <em>See Simons v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co. </em>(1933), 94 Mont. 355, 369, 22 P.2d 609, 614; <em>see also Blocker Exploration, </em>740 P.2d at <em>988; Pruitt v. Fetty </em>(W. Va. 1964), 134 S.E.2d 713, 716. \u201cHowever, where the facts are undisputed, or susceptible of only one inference, the question as to whether a partnership exists between particular persons is one of law for the court.\u201d <em>Pruitt, </em>134 S.E.2d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">\u00b629 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Daines v. Knight </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 320, 324, 888 P.2d 904, 906. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation is correct. <em>See Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">\u00b630 Appellants contend first that the District Court erred when it even addressed the existence of a partnership pursuant to the will contest and without requiring Reichman to initiate a separate action against Hal to determine his rights. Among other claims, they con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>tend that the absence of a separate action denied Hal a fair opportunity to contest the claimed partnership. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b631 We have held that it is entirely appropriate and necessary for a district court to make findings of fact on those matters for which there is evidence in the record and to determine the issues as raised by the parties\u2019 pleadings. <em>See Watkins v. Williams </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 306, 314-15, 877 P.2d 19, 24; <em>Heller v. Osburnsen </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 182, 188-89, 510 P.2d 13, 16-17; <em>see also In re LaBelle </em>(Wash. 1986), 728 P.2d 138, 152. Here, the children\u2019s and estate\u2019s objection to probate of Hal\u2019s proffered will expressly raised the existence of a partnership between Hal and Bud as a potential barrier and put the matter before the District Court. Furthermore, the District Court\u2019s fundamental authority in this matter pertains to the administration of the estate and, as such, a determination of the property interests that Bud owned was essential to a final resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b632 The District Court noted in its order that its December 18,1996, findings were motivated in part by judicial economy, and the question of a partnership, even if not the single focus of the particular hearing to which appellants refer, was ultimately a necessary part of this case. Appellants\u2019 claim that they were denied the opportunity to contest the claim of a partnership is contradicted by the subsequent occasion they had to brief and argue at the February 1997 hearing regarding partnership issues. Moreover, they present no authority for their position that a separate action was required. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it addressed the existence of a partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b633 Appellants also contend that the District Court erred in substance when it found that the ranch operation constituted a partnership, and eventually ordered an accounting pursuant to the estate\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b634  We most recently discussed the elements of a partnership in <em>MacArthur Co. v. Stein </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 85, 934 P.2d 214. Section 35-10-202(2), MCA, generally defines a partnership as \u201cthe association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit... whether or not the persons intend to create a partnership.\u201d A partnership exists where: (1) the parties clearly manifest their intent to form a partnership; (2) each party contributes something to promote the partnership; (3) each party has a right of mutual control over the subject of the partnership; and (4) there is an agreement among the parties to share the profits of the enterprise. <em>See Bender v. Bender </em>(1965), 144 Mont. 470, 480, 397 P.2d 957, 962. All four requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>must be established to prove the existence of a partnership. <em>See MacArthur, </em>282 Mont. at 89, 934 P.2d at 217; <em>Weingart v. C &amp; W Taylor Partnership </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 76, 79-80, 809 P.2d 576, 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b635 Here, Hal and Bud executed a written partnership agreement in 1968. The agreement set forth the parties\u2019 relationship and their rights and duties in satisfaction of each of the four elements. Most importantly, the terms and title of the agreement as a whole clearly establish that they intended to operate the ranch as a partnership. Appellants apparently contend that in spite of the agreement, Hal and Bud were never formal partners, even during the ten-year duration of the agreement. They rely on tax records and testimony that referred to the ranch as Hal\u2019s and to Bud as Hal\u2019s \u201chired man.\u201d Their position, however, ignores the effect of Hal\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b636 The following excerpt from Hal\u2019s deposition established his intent with regard to his and Bud\u2019s relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">Q. [Y]ou and Bud sort of worked together on the ranch. Am I correct in that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">A. Yeah. As long as he was there, why, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">Q. And did you make the decisions together, in terms of what you do on the ranch, what kind of cattle you\u2019d run, that sort of thing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE0\">A. Everything was agreeable, anything between the two of us, I think. I don\u2019t recall any \u2014 anything else to it. We have cattle, and that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">Q. And that sounds like a partnership. Is that how you would characterize it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">A. A partnership?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">A. I think that would be right. Whatever \u2014 whatever is done, we probably talked to each other as to why we were doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-13\">Q. And is that pretty much the way it was from the time Bud started living there on the ranch to the time that he died?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-14\">A. I think that would be correct. Things changed some. I guess that\u2019s about as close as we can come.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-15\">Q. This partnership agreement was for the running of your ranch, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-16\">A. I think that\u2019s \u2014 yes. That\u2019s what we were trying to do, is operate with it that way, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Q. Now, this was for a partnership for a term. It was for ten years, according to the document. Do you \u2014 did you just go on after that ten years and keep kind of doing the same thing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">A. I don\u2019t remember any ten years looking at it or working with it or talking with each other about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">Q. You just sort of did the same thing from beginning to end?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u00b637  We conclude, based on the record before us and the law applicable to partnerships, that there was no material issue of fact regarding the ranch\u2019s operation as a partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">\u00b638 The District Court aptly characterized the nature and full extent of the evidence that appellants offered in response to the summary judgment motion as mere statements \u201cthat none of the affiants heard that Buddy Bolinger was a partner with H.A. Bolinger in the operation of the ranch.\u201d Regardless of how Hal referred to the ranch operation in his tax returns, the partnership agreement, together with the unchallenged fact that Hal and Bud did not change their relationship or operation after the expiration of the agreement, permit only one conclusion. Accordingly, we conclude that a partnership existed, and we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision granting judgment to the estate as a matter of law on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">\u00b639 Did the District Court err when it refused to admit a number of appellants\u2019 exhibits?</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">\u00b640 We review the evidentiary rulings of a district court to determine whether it abused its discretion. A district court has broad discretion to determine if evidence will be admitted and absent an abuse of that discretion we will not overturn a district court\u2019s determination. <em>See In re Marriage of Meeks </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 237, 249, 915 P.2d 831, 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">\u00b641 Appellants attempted at the accounting hearing, after the District Court had already conclusively determined that the ranch constituted a partnership, to offer a number of exhibits as evidence that the ranch was in fact not operated as a partnership. The District Court refused to admit those exhibits and appellants assert here that it erred by doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">\u00b642  With the exception of one exhibit, appellants make no claim that their failure to present the evidence prior to summary judgment was for any legitimate reason. They made no request for an extension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>of time when the District Court was considering the issue of whether the ranch constituted a partnership, nor do they suggest now that the exhibits became available only after the District Court\u2019s initial decision. We have held that when a party has had sufficient opportunity to present evidence during the summary judgment process, a district court does not necessarily have to consider the evidence and revisit the merits of the claim. <em>See State Med. Oxygen &amp; Supply, Inc. v. American Med. Oxygen Co. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 340, 883 P.2d 1241. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to admit evidence related to the partnership issue after it had been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b643 Did the District Court err when it denied by summary judgment the existence of an agister\u2019s lien?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b644  When the facts are not in dispute, whether an oral contract exists constitutes a question of law which shall be reviewed to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>See Reese v. Forsythe Mergers Group, Inc. </em>(Ill. Ct. App. 1997), 682 N.E.2d 208, 213; <em>see also Employee Benefits Plus, Inc. v. Des Moines Gen. Hosp. </em>(Iowa Ct. App. 1995), 535 N.W.2d 149; <em>Herm Hughes &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Quintek </em>(Utah Ct. App. 1992), 834 P.2d 582. The parties\u2019 only dispute here is whether the alleged language of the agreement created an enforceable contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b645 The agister\u2019s hen at issue is based on an agreement allegedly made by Hal and Bud during a conversation in January 1994. Marian, who was present during their conversation regarding the cattle that Hal had just gifted to Bud, testified in her deposition that the entire oral agreement was the statement from Hal \u2014 \"Buddy, you understand you have to pay your share\" \u2014 and Bud\u2019s response \u2014 \"Of course.\" The District Court relied on the lack of a specific response from Bud, the uncertainty of the agreement, and on the lack of any specific terms by which to interpret the agreement as the basis for summary judgment in favor of the estate on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\u00b646 On appeal, appellants point out that pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-201(1), MCA, an agister\u2019s lien can be founded on an express or implied contract. They also assert that based on <em>Heckman &amp; Shell v. Wilson </em>(1971), 158 Mont. 47, 57, 487 P.2d 1141, 1146, the lien is valid despite the lack of a specific, agreed-upon price, and can be enforced for a \u201creasonable value of the services rendered.\u201d The estate contends that the agreement here is indistinguishable from the agreement that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>held too uncertain to constitute a contract in <em>Bishop v. Hendrickson </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 158, 695 P.2d 1313. <em>InBishop, </em>one lawyer in a partnership tried to enforce against his partner their agreement that \u201cthere would be a place... in the law firm\u201d for any of their children who became lawyers and wanted to practice with the firm. We held that the agreement left too many details unaddressed, and that it was too uncertain to be enforceable as a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b647 While we acknowledge appellants\u2019 contention that pursuant to <em>Wilson </em>an agister\u2019s hen may be enforceable without further specification in the underlying agreement regarding the price for the services, we conclude here that the conversation between Hal and Bud is too vague as a matter of law to establish an enforceable contract. For example, we effectively held in <em>Somont Oil Co. v. Nutter </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 467, 472, 743 P.2d 1016, 1019, that, at a minimum, the material elements of a contract must be present in general terms. Not only are those material terms missing here, but as we also discussed in <em>Bishop, </em>the agreement between Hal and Bud creates even more questions about the parties\u2019 expectations than it does purported certainties about their alleged obligations to perform. Accordingly, we conclude that the agreement on which appellants rely for their claim of an agister\u2019s lien against the estate is unenforceable, and we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of the lien by summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b648 Did the District Court err when it awarded one-half of the market value of the ranch equipment and cattle to the estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u00b649 Appellants contend that the 1968 partnership agreement established the value of the partnership and that the terms of the agreement should govern the amount to which the estate is entitled. They assert that the District Court erred when it did not follow the terms of the agreement but instead awarded the estate one-half of the market value of the partnership property.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\u00b650 Montana law provides that when a partnership agreement exists, it controls the rights and duties of partners. <em>See </em>\u00a7 35-10-106, MCA. Moreover, when partners continue a partnership beyond the expiration of the partnership agreement, their rights and duties remain the same as they were at the expiration of the agreement, effectively extending the force of the agreement to the partnership for as long as the partners continue the business or until they modify the agreement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 35-10-406, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u00b651 The partners\u2019 right to control their relationship via the agreement, and in particular to restrict the value of their respective shares upon death or dissolution, is so well-established that courts will enforce a value in the agreement even if the value to which a partner is entitled is substantially lower than the actual market or book value of his <em>share.See G &amp; S Investments v. Belman </em>(Ariz. Ct. App. 1984), 700 P.2d 1358, 1367; <em>In re Estate of Johnson </em>(Ill. Ct. App. 1984), 472 N.E.2d 72, 74-75. For such a limitation to be valid, however, the partners must have explicitly agreed to a value of their potential share at something other than fair market value. <em>See Anderson v. Wadena Silo Co. </em>(Minn. 1976), 246 N.W.2d <em>45, 46-48; Bohn v. Johnson </em>(N.D. 1985), 371 N.W.2d <em>781, 788-89; Bohn v. Bohn Implement Co. </em>(N.D. 1982), 325 N.W.2d 281, 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b652 Here, the agreement establishes a value ($47,790.30) for the partnership and states that that value shall control in the event of a sale or dissolution of the partnership. The terms also state that the partners shall, for the duration of the agreement, arrive annually at a new and updated value, which will serve for the following year as the value of the partnership. In the event of Hal\u2019s or Bud\u2019s death, the agreement gives the surviving partner the right to purchase the deceased partner\u2019s interest at the value established in the agreement, with one-fourth of the purchase price due within six months of the death. However, the terms set forth were not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b653 First, Hal and Bud did not reestablish a different value for the partnership as contemplated in the agreement. Therefore, the only value established by the partnership is the original 1968 amount of $47,790.30, an amount which neither of the parties suggests reflects its present value. Second, Hal has made no effort to purchase Bud\u2019s interest in the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b654 A partnership agreement is essentially a contract between the partners and, therefore, is to be interpreted and applied in accordance with principles of contract law. <em>See Argianas v. Chestler </em>(Ill. Ct. App. 1994), 631 N.E.2d <em>1359, 1368; Klein v. Weiss </em>(Md. 1978), 395 A.2d 126, 141. Where language in a contract is clear and unambiguous, it is a court\u2019s duty to simply apply the language. <em>See Molerway Freight Lines, Inc. v. Rite-Line Transp. Serv., Inc. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 95, 100, 902 P.2d 9, 12; <em>Carbon County v. Dain Bosworth, Inc. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 75, 87, 874 P.2d 718, 726. On the one hand, the contract is absolutely clear and unambiguous as to what the parties intended regarding the partnership\u2019s valuation and, likewise, as to what that value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>was at the time that they entered the agreement. This issue turns, however, on the fact that the parties\u2019 failure to comply with the agreement and to reassess the value of the partnership conflicts with their expression of intent and creates now a manifest ambiguity as to the value of the partnership thirty years after its creation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b655 Other courts have had to interpret and apply ambiguous partnership agreements similar to the one here when partners failed to establish a value for partnership property. In each case, the court held that fair market value at the time of the partner\u2019s death should apply. <em>See Curtis v. Campbell </em>(Ky. Ct. App. 1960), 336 S.W.2d <em>355, Anderson, </em>246 N.W.2d 45; <em>Chapman v. Dunnegan </em>(Mo. Ct. App. 1984), 665 S.W.2d 643; <em>Bohn Implement Co., </em>325 N.W.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b656 <em>Chapman </em>involved facts very similar to this case. The partnership agreement called for the partners to value the real estate owned by the partnership on an annual basis; additional language which is not present in Hal\u2019s and Bud\u2019s agreement stated that if in a given year the partners failed to value the property, the previous year\u2019s value stood. Like here, however, the partners failed to follow the terms of the agreement and never established a value for the property. The estate urged that a fair market value should be assigned to the property, while the remaining partners contended that its book value should control. The court provided the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">The partners\u2019 failure to comply with the expressed method for valuing partnership real estate was, in effect, an abandonment of that method and left the partnership agreement without a provision for valuing partnership real estate. In the absence of a provision in the partnership agreement, the relevant provisions of the [statute]... are persuasive. [The statute] provides that the legal representatives of a deceased partner shall receive \u201can amount equal to the value of his interest in the dissolved partnership\u201d at the time of dissolution. ... The prevailing view among [other] courts is that, upon the dissolution of a partnership by death, fair market value must be used to evaluate the deceased partner\u2019s interest if the partnership agreement does not specify the method of valuing partnership assets or the method provided was not complied with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">The rationale for this view is not difficult to understand.... [A] fair market value represents the real value of the partnership holdings \u2014 the value that the partners would receive if they sold the business. At common law, when a partner died or retired, surviving partners were required to liquidate the business and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>distribute the proceeds. The Uniform Partnership Act permits the surviving partners to continue the business, but requires them to pay to the decedent\u2019s legal representatives the value of the decedent\u2019s interest. ... Measuring \u201cthe value of his interest\u201d at its actual fair market value, when no other method is expressed, is the only sensible method to preserve the estate\u2019s right to the decedent\u2019s fair share.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ali\"><em>Chapman, </em>665 S.W.2d at 649-50 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b657  Appellants contend that insofar as the agreement here establishes a value, it has more force and is thus distinguishable from the agreements in the cases above which either did not establish a value or referred only to an imprecise valuation term. As in <em>Chapman, </em>however, Hal and Bud essentially abandoned their method of valuation, the effect of which was to abandon whatever explicit agreement they reached regarding the 1968 valuation and its potential ability to serve as (i.e., limit) the value for the partnership in subsequent years. It was clearly not their intent that the 1968 figure would serve as the value in future years, nor should we now default to that value simply because they failed to establish a new one. Rather, like in <em>Chapman, </em>we are guided by the statute, which suggests that upon dissociation a partner is entitled to the greater of either the liquidation value or the fair market value at the date of dissociation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 35-10-619(2), MCA. While the statute is not directly applicable here, we note the policy reflected therein and we agree with the court\u2019s rationale in <em>Chapman </em>and its conclusion that fair market value at the time of a partner\u2019s death should apply when partners have failed to comply with the terms of their agreement and are thus left without an explicitly agreed upon value for the partnership. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s award to the estate of fair market value for the partnership assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">ISSUE 6</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b658 Did the District Court err when it refused to hold the estate accountable for the value of any of the losses from the ranch?</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u00b659 Appellants contend that for purposes of a final settlement, half of the losses suffered by the partnership should be assigned to the estate. They contend that because the losses for which the estate is allegedly responsible are greater than the assets to which it is entitled, nothing is owed to the estate from the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u00b660 The District Court found that \u201cHal took the tax benefit of all the [partnership] losses and... cannot now claim that any loss should be attributed to Bud.\u201d It concluded that in addition to the benefit from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the losses \u201che must also bear the burden,\u201d and, therefore, that he is effectively precluded from trying to assign a share of the losses to the estate. In response to the District Court\u2019s conclusion, appellants distinguish between Hal having claimed the losses on his income tax returns and having assumed total responsibility for the losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b661 It is well-established that partners can agree to the precise division of partnership profits and losses. <em>See </em>\u00a7 35-10-106, MCA; <em>see also Walsh v. Chestnut Hill Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(Mass. 1993), 607 N.E.2d 737, 743; <em>Smith v. Daub </em>(Neb. 1985), 365 N.W.2d 816, 820; <em>Bucholtz, P.C. v. Computer Based Sys., Inc. </em>(Va. 1998), 498 S.E.2d 231, 233. An agreement not to share losses (or profits) equally need not be made expressly, but may be implied from the partners\u2019 conduct. <em>See Daub, </em>365 N.W.2d at 820. We may also infer in part from the nature of the partnership whether the partners intended to share losses. <em>See Devereaux v. Cockerline </em>(Or. 1946), 170 P.2d 727. For example, in <em>Devereaux, </em>the court found it \u201cimprobable\u201d that either party would have contemplated that they would share losses as a result of their investment, based on the fact that the more affluent partner contributed the capital and the other partner\u2019s contribution consisted of his time and energy toward the business. <em>See Devereaux, </em>170 P.2d at 733-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b662 It is not disputed that Hal claimed all of the partnership\u2019s losses on his personal taxes for the purpose of receiving a tax benefit, or that Hal and Bud were equal partners. The only contested issue is what effect, if any, Hal\u2019s acceptance of the annual losses has on Hal\u2019s and Bud\u2019s capital interests during an accounting of the partnership. Neither party provides any authority for their position, and the extent of the District Court\u2019s support for its conclusion is the principle that he who receives the benefit of an act must also bear its burden. We conclude that under the circumstances in this case, the District Court was correct when it held that a partner is bound, at least in part, by his treatment of partnership liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b663 Section 704(a) of the Internal Revenue Code permits partners to allocate amongst themselves their respective share of partnership income and losses. Section 704(b) also provides that the IRS will respect an allocation for tax purposes only if the allocation meets certain conditions, including that the allocation have \u201csubstantial economic effect.\u201d Generally, that means that an allocation must be consistent with the partners\u2019 basic economic interests in the partnership in order to be recognized by the IRS. <em>See Orrisch v. Commissioner </em>(T.C. 1970), 55 T.C. 395, <em>aff\u2019dper curiam </em>(9th Cir. 1973) (unpublished deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>sion). \u201c[I]n the event there is an economic benefit or economic burden that corresponds to an allocation, the partner to whom the allocation is made must receive such economic benefit or bear such economic burden.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.704-l(b)(2)(ii). Consequently, an allocation will have substantial economic effect, and thus be respected by the IRS, only if the partners\u2019 ultimate equity interests in the partnership, regardless of tax consequences, are affected. <em>See </em>Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.704- l(b)(2)(iii)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b664 Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 704(b) compels that we rely on Hal\u2019s conduct throughout the fife of the partnership and on the fact that the IRS recognized Hal\u2019s personal tax claims to 100% of the partnership losses, from which it follows that Hal\u2019s returns conclusively establish his responsibility for 100% of the losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b665 We conclude that the intent of the parties was evidenced by both the fact that Hal did not attempt to assign any of the losses to Bud and by the general nature of their relationship, to which Bud contributed primarily his energy and Hal his capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b666  More generally, we hold that where partners have exercised their right to allot partnership losses in some fashion other than in equal proportion to their division of profits, that division of losses shall control for purposes of determining responsibility for the losses during settlement. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it refused to allocate any of the partnership losses to the estate and thus refused to diminish the value of its interest in the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">ISSUE 7</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">\u00b667 Did the District Court err when it awarded the estate a $9000 credit based on Hal\u2019s denial of Reichman\u2019s attempts to cut and remove hay from the deceased\u2019s land?</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">\u00b668 Appellants assert here that the District Court should not have considered the estate\u2019s claim against appellants for the alleged removal of hay from Bud\u2019s land. They contend that the issue was beyond the scope of the accounting hearing because the estate\u2019s interference claim was not specifically listed in the pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">\u00b669 The funds in dispute involve hay grown on Bud\u2019s land. Due to a misplaced fence that separated their land from Bud\u2019s, appellants used the land and received two hay crops which the District Court found to have a value of $4500 each. Appellants do not contest any of the following findings, all of which are supported by our review of the record: (1) that the fence is not on the boundary; (2) that they were on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>notice from Reichman in July 1995 regarding the misplacement of the fence; and (3) that the hay had a value of $9000. Their only allegation is that the District Court erred when it considered the claim at the accounting hearing and made subsequent findings and an award as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b670 As we stated above, the District Court has the authority and the responsibility to address matters raised by the pleadings. Here, the pretrial order lists among the estate\u2019s contentions the misplaced fence. As such, appellants should have been aware that the hay proceeds were an issue, and that it was within the District Court\u2019s authority to resolve it and all other matters regarding the estate\u2019s financial interest in all income derived from both Bud\u2019s property and the partnership land. Their only objection to the matter came in closing argument at the end of the hearing when they alleged that the estate\u2019s claim \u201cgoes way beyond\u201d the contentions in the pretrial order. Although the appellants claim lack of notice, they made no request for an extension of time in which to address the claim. In addition, they have not challenged the merits of the District Court\u2019s findings. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">ISSUE 8</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b671 Did the District Court err when it awarded the estate a $40,500 credit based on Hal\u2019s denial of the estate\u2019s attempts to use certain pasture land?</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b672 Appellants make the same argument that they made regarding the hay proceeds. The facts involve a pasture lease which Reichman alleges appellants wrongfully prevented the estate from using in 1995. Due to its inability to use the pasture, the estate was forced to sell cattle prematurely, which the District Court found resulted in a loss of $40,500. Once again, there is evidence in the record to support the District Court\u2019s findings, no challenge has been made to the findings, and appellants apparently claim only that this matter should have been decided at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">\u00b673 Our review shows that the pasture lease was specifically mentioned in the pretrial order, albeit as an ancillary issue. We further recognize that, like their response to the hay proceeds claim, appellants made only a vague objection at closing argument to the estate\u2019s claim regarding the pasture lease. Accordingly, for the reasons stated previously, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ISSUE 9</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b674 Did the District Court err when it determined that the judgment constituted a hen against all the personal property of the partnership?</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b675 The District Court stated that its judgment \u201cconstitutes a lien against all personal property of the Partnership.\u201d Appellants assert that based on \u00a7 25-9-301(2), MCA, the District Court lacked authority to create a lien against personal property. Rather, they contend that a judgment cannot become a hen against personal property until there has been an execution to enforce the judgment. The estate\u2019s only response is that the District Court has equitable power to control the partnership\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b676  Contrary to the estate\u2019s position, however, there is no authority for a district court to summarily convert a judgment to a hen against personal property. Section 25-9-301(2), MCA, states that \u201c[f]rom the time the judgment is docketed, it becomes a hen upon ah real property of the judgment debtor.\u201d With regard to personal property, which, unlike real property, is not referred to in the statute as subject to a hen immediately when a judgment is docketed, a hen does not arise prior to execution on that property. For these reasons, we reverse the District Court\u2019s creation of a hen against the personal property of the ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">ISSUE 10</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">\u00b677 Did the District Court err when it refused to recognize the real property of the ranch as an asset of the partnership?</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">\u00b678 The District Court concluded that \u201c[i]t was never intended by the [partners] that the land referred to in the Agreement should become an asset of the partnership to be distributed or taken into account on the dissolution of the partnership or death of a partner.\u201d On that basis, it concluded that the partnership did not own the land and consequently made no award to the estate based upon its interest in the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">\u00b679 On cross-appeal, the estate contends that it is entitled to a share of the value of the real property. In reliance on \u00a7 35-10-203, MCA, it asserts that the land was acquired with partnership assets and therefore became partnership property. In the alternative, it asserts that because equitable principles require the inclusion of the land among the partnership assets, a resulting trust is created for the estate\u2019s benefit. Appellants contend in response that the partnership agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ment clearly reflects the partners\u2019 intent to preserve the real property as solely Hal\u2019s property and not to transfer ownership to the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b680  Section 35-10-203(4), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">Property is presumed to be partnership property if purchased with partnership assets even if not acquired in the name of the partnership or of one or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person\u2019s capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">As reflected in the statute, property is merely presumed to become property of the partnership if it is acquired with partnership assets. The presumption is rebuttable and may be overcome. <em>See Mehl v. Mehl </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 310, 314, 786 P.2d 1173, 1176;In <em>re Perry\u2019s Estate </em>(1948), 121 Mont. 280, 287-88,192 P.2d 532, 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b681  Whether property belongs to the partnership depends primarily on the intent of the partners. <em>See Mehl, </em>241 Mont. at 314, 786 P.2d at 1175; <em>Perry\u2019s Estate, </em>121 Mont. at 287, 192 P.2d 532, 536; <em>see also Norman v.

The partners\u2019 intent may be inferred from a variety of sources, such as their agreement and their conduct, although no single factor is determinative. <em>See Stafford, </em>825 S.W.2d at 656-57; <em>Perry\u2019s Estate, </em>121 Mont. at 287-88, 192 P.2d 532, 536; <em>Bachand v. Walker </em>(S.D. 1990), 455 N.W.2d 851, 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\u00b682 Here, the District Court relied primarily on the partnership agreement when it concluded that the partners did not intend that the land become partnership property. The agreement stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">[Hal] will contribute said lands for the use of said partnership and that in consideration thereof said partnership will make the annual payments due on a mortgage indebtedness owing against said lands ... and will pay the cost of any necessary repairs or improvements in connection with said lands and all taxes levied against said lands during the term of this agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The agreement also stated that Hal, in whose name title has always been held, reserved \u201cthe right to sell any or all of said lands,\u201d as well as the right to live in the home on the ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b683 The language of the agreement states that Hal contributed the land for use, and not outright as an asset of the partnership, as evidenced further by his reservation of the right to sell the land. His reserved right to live on the land also indicates that the parties had no intention of turning ownership of the land over to the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"AtW\">\u00b684 The District Court found that over $700,000 had been paid by the partnership for the use of the land, and it is that payment of funds on which the estate relies for its alleged interest in the land. As suggested above, payment of partnership funds does not by itself cause property to become an asset of the partnership. Nor is use by the partnership sufficient in and of itself to convert a partner\u2019s property into property of the partnership. <em>See Norman, </em>605 So. 2d at 1213; <em>Gertz v. Fonteechio </em>(Mich. 1951), 49 N.W.2d 121, 124-24; <em>Mischke, </em>530 N.W.2d at 240. In fact, it is not unusual for property to be used for partnership purposes although it does not belong to the partnership. <em>See Ellis v. Mihelis </em>(Cal. 1963), 384 P.2d 7, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b685 The estate offers no authority by which we might conclude that payments made by the partnership in consideration for use of land necessarily establish an intent on behalf of the partners that the property become a partnership asset, or that such payments necessarily alter the nature of ownership in the property. We look instead to the partners\u2019 intent, which in this case indicates clearly that Hal would retain ownership of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b686 Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it refused to award the estate a share of the value of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">ISSUE 11</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\u00b687 Is Reichman entitled to attorney fees and costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">\u00b688 Although fees and costs were claimed by the estate, and objections were filed by the appellants, the District Court had not addressed those claims prior to the filing of appellants\u2019 notice of appeal. Since these issues are best resolved, in the first instance, by the trial court, we remand for resolution of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\u00b689 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and this case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
