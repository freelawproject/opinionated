It is the recommendation of the Court that the Defendant be considered for placement in any available programs through the Department of Corrections with the recommendation that the Defendant shall obtain alcohol treatment, criminal thinking and any other programs determined appropriate. The Defendant shall register as a sexual offender, pursuant to Section 46-23-504, 46-23-505, and 46-23-506, MCA, with the Department of Institutions, Chief of Police, and Sheriff of the County wherein he resides for the remainder of his lifetime following release from custody.

The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AxIE\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it.

The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"AzG\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"Ai_\">Chairman, Hon.
