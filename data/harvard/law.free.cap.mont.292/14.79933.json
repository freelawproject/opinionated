Due to the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the terms and conditions of his suspended sentence while under the supervision of the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>of Probation and Parole, the Court finds that he is not entitled to receive, and shall not receive, credit for any elapsed time between the date of his conviction and the date of this Order, except that he shall receive credit from May 22, 1996, through December 12, 1996; from July 18,1997, through August 1,1997; from August 6, 1997, through date of sentencing, September 29,1997, for two hundred seventy-five (275) days jail time which he has previously served.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"AQR\">Done in open Court this 19th day of February, 1998.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate id=\"A3qq\">DATED this 12th day of March, 1998.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">On February 19, 1998, the defendant\u2019s application for review of that sentence was heard by the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Vg\">The defendant was present and proceeded Pro Se. The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AkK\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ-\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division provides: \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (Section 45-18-904(3), MCA.) The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"Agc\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AxE\">Chairman, Hon.
