The sentences shall run consecutive to the sentence imposed in Cause No. 12872.</p>\n<p id=\"AWQ\">On September 18, 1998, the defendant\u2019s application for review of that sentence was heard by the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AiiS\">The defendant was present and was represented by Margaret Borg from the Missoula County Public Defender\u2019s Office. The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AmV\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"AI4f\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence be amended to a five (5) year commitment to the Department of Corrections, on each count, with the amendment that said sentences be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in Cause No. 12872.</p>\n<p id=\"AjU\">The reason for the amendment is to conform to the understanding of the Court and the Defendant and to clarify the matter for the Board of Pardons and Parole.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AFIY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>DATED this 29th day of October, 1998.</decisiondate>\n<judges id=\"A_B\">Chairman, Hon.
