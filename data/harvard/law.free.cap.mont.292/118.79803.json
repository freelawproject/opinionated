Jarvenpaa chose to retire, accepted lump sum cash retirement benefits, then filed a wrongful discharge action against Glacier in the Ninth Judicial District Court, Glacier County. In response, Glacier filed a counterclaim to recover part of the retirement benefits Jarvenpaa received. The case was tried before a jury which returned a special verdict in Glacier\u2019s favor on both the wrongful discharge claim and the counterclaim, thus requiring Jarvenpaa to return $106,000 of his early retirement benefits, plus interest accrued. Judgment was entered on said verdict, and Jarvenpaa appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u00b62 The dispositive issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it denied Jarvenpaa\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Glacier\u2019s counterclaim?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">\u00b64 <em>2. </em>Did the District Court err when it refused to bifurcate Glacier\u2019s counterclaim from Jarvenpaa\u2019s wrongful discharge claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it limited Jarvenpaa\u2019s expert testimony and, in turn, refused Jarvenpaa\u2019s proposed jury instructions that pertained to Glacier\u2019s alleged personnel policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err when it allowed Glacier to introduce post-discharge evidence to substantiate the reasons why it discharged Jarvenpaa?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">\u00b67 For approximately thirty years, Donald Jarvenpaa was employed with Glacier Electric Cooperative, Inc., in a variety of positions, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>eluding manager of operations. However, on September 29, 1992, Glacier informed Jarvenpaa that due to alleged performance problems it would terminate him effective December 31,1992. Instead of firing Jarvenpaa, Glacier offered him an early retirement option. Glacier offered the early retirement option to four other employees; however, only Jarvenpaa had to retire or be fired. The total lump sum retirement package presented and accepted by Jarvenpaa was approximately $318,116. This sum included approximately $106,000 of early retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b68 After Jarvenpaa accepted the early retirement benefits, he filed a wrongful discharge action against Glacier on November 3, 1993, in the Ninth Judicial District Court, Glacier County. Pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-904, MCA, Jarvenpaa alleged that Glacier terminated him without good cause and in violation of its own written personnel policy. He also alleged that Glacier\u2019s actions were malicious and in retaliation for reporting Glacier\u2019s violation of environmental standards, pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-905(2), MCA, which allows for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b69 During the initial proceedings, Glacier filed a motion for summary judgment contending that Jarvenpaa should be precluded from pursuing a wrongful discharge claim since he agreed to retire. The District Court granted Glacier summary judgment and Jarvenpaa appealed. On July 11, 1995, we reversed the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. This Court determined that Jarvenpaa had been constructively discharged since he did not voluntarily retire; therefore, he had a right to pursue his wrongful discharge action. <em>See Jarvenpaa v. Glacier Elec. Coop., Inc. (Jarvenpaa I) </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 477, 898 P.2d 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b6 10 The issues now before us result from the District Court\u2019s rulings upon remand of Jarvenpaa\u2019s wrongful discharge action. After remand, the District Court allowed Glacier to file a counterclaim to collect the additional $106,000 that Jarvenpaa received for his early retirement, plus interest. Jarvenpaa moved for summary judgment in his favor on the counterclaim, but the District Court denied his motion. When Jarvenpaa requested that the District Court bifurcate Glacier\u2019s counterclaim from his wrongful discharge action, the District Court allowed the counterclaim to proceed and, in turn, overruled attempts to exclude evidence of his early retirement election. In addition, the District Court admitted certain post-termination evidence which Glacier offered to substantiate its reasons for terminating Jarvenpaa. Finally, when Jarvenpaa attempted to introduce ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>pert testimony to establish that Glacier violated its own written personnel policy, the District Court partially excluded such testimony. The District Court also refused Jarvenpaa\u2019s proposed jury instructions relating to the existence of a personnel policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b611 OnNovember8,1996, thejury returned a special verdict for Glacier. The jury decided that Jarvenpaa was not wrongfully discharged and awarded Glacier $130,069.26 on its counterclaim. Accordingly, the District Court entered judgment against Jarvenpaa on November 14, 1996. Jarvenpaa now appeals the District Court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b6 12 Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for summary judgment is <em>de novo. See Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34. Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s discretionary rulings is abuse of discretion. <em>See May v. First Nat\u2019l Pawn Brokers, Ltd. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 132, 134, 890 P.2d 386, 388. In <em>Montana Rail Link v. Byard </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 331, 337, 860 P.2d 121, 125, we held that \u201c[t]he standard of abuse of discretion is applied to discretionary rulings, such as trial administration issues, post-trial motions and similar rulings.\u201d In <em>Malta Public School District A and 14 v. Montana Seventeenth Judicial District Court </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 46, 50, 938 P.2d 1335, 1338, we stated that under Rule 42(b), M.R.Civ.P., the decision as to whether to bifurcate a trial is a matter left to the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d of the district court. In <em>State v. Romero </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 58, 73, 926 P.2d 717,726-27, and many cases thereafter, we stated that we review a district court\u2019s ruling on the admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion. In <em>Cechovic v. Hardin &amp; Associates </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 104, 116, 902 P.2d 520, 527, and cases thereafter, we applied the abuse of discretion standard to a trial court\u2019s selection of jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b6 13 The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>See C. Haydon Ltd. v. Montana Mining Properties, Inc. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 138, 146, 951 P.2d 46, 51. We will not substitute our judgment for the district court\u2019s unless it clearly abused its discretion. <em>See C. Haydon Ltd., </em>286 Mont. at 146, 951 P.2d at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\u00b614 Did the District Court err when it denied Jarvenpaa\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Glacier\u2019s counterclaim?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u00b615 Glacier contends that since Jarvenpaa maintains that he was discharged, he did not effectively retire and, therefore, should not be entitled to keep the early retirement benefits he received. Glacier argues that Jarvenpaa cannot elect to both retire and be fired. Applying a contract theory, Glacier further argues that since Jarvenpaa failed to fully perform his retirement, he breached his retirement agreement and should be compelled to pay back the early retirement benefits he received from this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b616 Jarvenpaa argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on Glacier\u2019s counterclaim because his wrongful discharge action should not affect his retirement agreement. He contends that his retirement was complete the day he voluntarily stopped working for Glacier. Additionally, he argues that since Glacier did not bargain for a release of potential claims in the retirement agreement, which Glacier itself drafted, Glacier should not be granted the net effect of a release by being allowed to pursue its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b6 17 To address these arguments, we must first return to our discussion in <em>Jarvenpaa I. </em>We determined in <em>Jarvenpaa I </em>that Jarvenpaa was constructively discharged, despite his agreement to retire. Now, we are asked whether, by prosecuting his wrongful discharge claim, Jarvenpaa must return a portion of his retirement benefits which represents the early retirement part of his lump sum retirement package.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b6 18  In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is clear that Jarvenpaa\u2019s retirement agreement was made as part of an ultimatum to either retire or be fired. Glacier caused Jarvenpaa to elect one or the other. Jarvenpaa could not elect both; hence, he could not elect to receive the benefits of both. He could either take an additional $106,000 in early retirement benefits, or he would be terminated. Jarvenpaa took the money, then claimed he did not retire but instead was constructively discharged. We agreed in <em>Jarvenpaa I </em>that the forced retirement was, in fact, a constructive discharge. However, Jarvenpaa cannot at the same time both retire and be discharged. We hold that while Jarvenpaa had the right to pursue the constructive discharge as wrongful, he cannot now keep the early retirement benefits after a jury determined that his discharge was not wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b619 Jarvenpaa analogizes his case to cases involving employees\u2019 retention of severance benefits in actions brought pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621-623 (1996), and similar federal statutes. <em>See, e.g., Raczak v. Ameritech Corp. </em>(6th Cir. 1997), 103 F.3d 1257, <em>cert. denied </em>(1998), 118 S. Ct. 1033, 140 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>101; <em>Long v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(3d Cir. 1997), 105 F.3d 1529, <em>cert. denied </em>(1998), 118 S. Ct. 1033, 140 L. Ed. 2d 100; <em>Oberg v. Allied Van Lines, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1993), 11 F.3d 679, <em>cert. denied </em>(1994), 511 U.S. 1108, 114 S. Ct. 2104, 128 L. Ed. 2d 665; <em>Forbus v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(11th Cir. 1992), 958 F.2d 1036, <em>cert. denied </em>(1992), 506 U.S. 955, 113 S. Ct. 412, 121 L. Ed. 2d 336. In these cases, each employee who elected to take a severance package signed a release of potential claims, but then filed a discharge action and was allowed to retain the severance packages while pursuing the litigation. Each employer unsuccessfully argued that the employee ratified the release by retaining the severance package and, therefore, should be forced to tender-back the severance package as a condition precedent to bringing the action. These cases, however, do not address Jarvenpaa\u2019s argument that he should be permitted to retain his early retirement benefits even after he was unsuccessful in his wrongfiil discharge case. We conclude that it is an entirely different concept to require a tender-back of paid benefits before an employee is allowed to file suit.</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\u00b620 In <em>Jarvenpaa I, </em>we stated that \u201cthe amount of the retirement benefit which he received is relevant to the amount of damages due to Jarvenpaa if he succeeds in this lawsuit.\u201d <em>Jarvenpaa I, </em>271 Mont. at 483, 898 P.2d at 694. Thus, we conclude that there are only two circumstances under which Jarvenpaa could keep his early retirement benefits: (1) if he, in fact, retired, which he did not do in this instance; or (2) if he was wrongfully discharged, then he could have applied his early retirement benefits as an offset against any wrongful discharge damages he was awarded. Neither of these scenarios occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b621 Based on this conclusion, we hold that the District Court did not err when it denied Jarvenpaa\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b622 Did the District Court err when it refused to bifurcate Glacier\u2019s counterclaim from Jarvenpaa\u2019s wrongful discharge claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b623 Jarvenpaa argues that even if the District Court correctly allowed Glacier\u2019s counterclaim, it should have bifurcated the counterclaim from his wrongful discharge action to avoid prejudice against him. According to Jarvenpaa, Glacier\u2019s counterclaim unnecessarily invited evidence of Jarvenpaa\u2019s election to retire and the retirement benefits he received. Jarvenpaa argues that not only did such evidence have no probative value to the issue of whether he was wrongfully discharged, it prejudicially persuaded the jury to find that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>discharge was fair, and not wrongful. Jarvenpaa further contends that the parties\u2019 separate claims corresponded to separate events and, therefore, should not have been intermingled.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b624 Despite Jarvenpaa\u2019s arguments, the District Court did not bifurcate the two claims and it admitted evidence of Jarvenpaa\u2019s retirement election. In its order, the District Court stated that evidence of Jarvenpaa\u2019s retirement had sufficient probative value in Jarvenpaa\u2019s wrongful discharge claim and, therefore, was not prejudicial. Hence, there was no reason to bifurcate Glacier\u2019s counterclaim from Jarvenpaa\u2019s wrongful discharge action.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b625 We agree. Evidence of Jarvenpaa\u2019s retirement election was helpful to the jury to make a well-informed decision of whether Jarvenpaa was wrongfully discharged. It was important that the jury consider all the events relating to Jarvenpaa\u2019s discharge. Contrary to Jarvenpaa\u2019s contention that his discharge was a separate event from his retirement election, we conclude that they were part of a single event.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b626 Furthermore, because Jarvenpaa alleged that, pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-905(2), MCA, Glacier acted with malice after he reported Glacier\u2019s violation of environmental standards, information about Jarvenpaa\u2019s retirement option was relevant. Information about the terms of Jarvenpaa\u2019s discharge could assist the jury to determine whether Glacier acted with malice when it discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b627  Thus, we hold that the terms of Jarvenpaa\u2019s discharge, to retire or be fired, are relevant to Jarvenpaa\u2019s wrongful discharge action. Therefore, the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted such evidence and when it refused to bifurcate Glacier\u2019s counterclaim from Jarvenpaa\u2019s wrongful discharge action.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">\u00b628 Did the District Court err when it limited Jarvenpaa\u2019s expert testimony and, in turn, refused Jarvenpaa\u2019s proposed jury instructions that pertained to Glacier\u2019s alleged personnel policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\u00b629 One of Jarvenpaa\u2019s goals at trial was to establish that Glacier had a written personnel policy. Once established, Jarvenpaa could then argue that Glacier violated said policy and, thereby, wrongfully discharged him pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-904(3), MCA. Jarvenpaa contends that Glacier\u2019s personnel policy comprised a selection of written materials it adopted from a management consultant whom Glacier hired. Jarvenpaa cites <em>Kearney v. KXLF Communications, Inc. </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 407, 869 P.2d 772, for support. In <em>Kearney, </em>we reversed a court\u2019s directed verdict for an employer in a wrongful discharge case and con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>eluded that an employer\u2019s policy to conduct annual performance evaluations may be interpolated from several writings, including preprinted evaluation forms and a memo from a supervisor. <em>See Kearney, </em>263 Mont. at 416-18, 869 P.2d at 777-78. Jarvenpaa argues that the materials Glacier received from its management consultant, which included supervisory assessment forms and a personnel development plan used to help managers and employees improve their performance, along with a letter written by Glacier\u2019s general manager that stated Glacier was getting the personnel development plan underway, could reasonably establish that Glacier had a personnel policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">\u00b630 Jarvenpaa further maintains that the District Court should have allowed his expert witness, who was a professor of management and worked as a management consultant, to testify that these materials constituted a personnel policy within common management standards and that Glacier violated the policy. Jarvenpaa points out that the District Court allowed Glacier\u2019s management consultant and general manager to testify on this issue so it should have allowed his witness to offer testimony on the same issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b631 In addition, Jarvenpaa proposed jury instructions to support his argument. One of Jarvenpaa\u2019s instructions stated that a personnel policy could include policies adopted by the employer found in other writings, including memos, forms, and other documents. Another instruction suggested that Glacier\u2019s personnel policy required Glacier to apply progressive discipline measures to discharge Jarvenpaa. He contends that Glacier failed to do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b632 The District Court limited the testimony of Jarvenpaa\u2019s expert witness and refused Jarvenpaa\u2019s proposed jury instructions. It is obvious that the District Court was not convinced that Glacier had actually adopted a written personnel policy. Concerned that it was the jury\u2019s proper role to decide whether Glacier had a written personnel policy, the District Court did not allow Jarvenpaa\u2019s expert witness to testify to its existence. Instead, the District Court limited Jarvenpaa\u2019s expert testimony to identify common management standards and discuss whether such standards were evident in the materials supplied by Glacier\u2019s management consultant. The District Court also allowed Jarvenpaa\u2019s expert witness to answer whether Glacier violated a personnel policy, assuming the materials established such a policy. The District Court concluded that there was a lack of foundation to allow Jarvenpaa\u2019s expert witness to testify to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>anything further. However, the District Court did instruct the jury that a wrongful discharge occurs when an employer violates the express provisions of its own written personnel policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b633 Once again, our standard of review is whether the District Court abused its discretion. We cannot say that the District Court\u2019s ruling on this evidentiary issue was an abuse of discretion so as to cause reversible error. The District Court concluded that a proper foundation had not been established to allow Jarvenpaa\u2019s expert witness to testify on the issue of whether Glacier adopted a personnel policy. Although Glacier\u2019s management consultant and general manager were allowed to testify on this issue, their stature as agents of the defendant was certainly different than Jarvenpaa\u2019s expert. Glacier\u2019s agents had first-hand knowledge on matters relating to this issue and were properly allowed to testify. Furthermore, Jarvenpaa had adequate opportunity to cross-examine Glacier\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b634 Also, we determine that <em>Kearney </em>does not support Jarvenpaa\u2019s argument. In <em>Kearney, </em>we stated that it was the proper role of the jury, not a judge, to determine whether the employer adopted a personnel policy. <em>See Kearney, </em>263 Mont. at 418, 869 P.2d at 778. Although an expert did testify in <em>Kearney, </em>we were not reviewing the propriety of such testimony. We did not consider the role of an expert witness, nor did we say that materials used by an employer constitute a personnel policy as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b635 Jarvenpaa cites other cases as support for his argument. <em>See, e.g., Mahan v. Farmers Union Central Exchange </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 410, 420, 768 P.2d 850, 857 (opinion testimony from an expert is permissible provided that foundation has been laid and the expert\u2019s specialized knowledge will assist the jury); <em>Flanigan v. Prudential Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 419, 430, 720 P.2d 257, 263-64 (in permitting an expert witness to interpret employment policies, the trial court acted within its discretion); <em>Crenshaw v. Bozeman Deaconess Hospital </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 488, 502, 693 P.2d 487, 494 (testimony of employee\u2019s expert on personnel management is properly admitted in action arising out of employee\u2019s termination when the jury\u2019s experience does not extend to the employer\u2019s disciplinary guidelines, much less the ability to evaluate propriety of such guidelines, and the expert\u2019s perspective assists the jury in understanding the evidence). Again, these cases are not on point. Each of these cases involved situations in which an expert witness testified on an issue of whether a personnel policy was violated, not whether a personnel pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>icy existed. In <em>Crenshaw, </em>and again in <em>Flanigan, </em>we stated that expert testimony should be allowed when it is \u201cbased on professional expertise and experience which the individual jury members were unlikely to possess.\u201d <em>Flanigan, </em>221 Mont, at 430, 720 P.2d at 263 (quoting <em>Crenshaw, </em>213 Mont. at 502, 693 P.2d at 494). Additionally, in <em>Mahan, </em>235 Mont. at 420, 768 P.2d at 857, we stated that opinion testimony from expert witnesses is admissible provided that the proper foundation testimony is in the record. In Jarvenpaa\u2019s case, the precise issue was whether a written personnel policy was even in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">\u00b636  For these reasons, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it limited Jarvenpaa\u2019s expert testimony and refused Jarvenpaa\u2019s proposed jury instructions. Given the latitude which the District Court gave Jarvenpaa in this area, and the instructions given to the jury, we conclude that Jarvenpaa was allowed to sufficiently present his theory on this issue and no reversible error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b637 Did the District Court err when it allowed Glacier to introduce certain post-discharge evidence to substantiate the reasons why it discharged Jarvenpaa?</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b638 During the trial proceedings, Jarvenpaa argued, as he does now, that evidence that pertained to reasons why he was discharged should have been limited to what Glacier wrote in a November 2, 1992, letter to him, and to what occurred before Glacier wrote the letter. Jarvenpaa repeatedly objected to evidence of events that occurred after the letter, including testimony by Glacier\u2019s witnesses that morale among employees improved after Jarvenpaa retired, and that managers who followed in Jarvenpaa\u2019s position handled the workload better than Jarvenpaa. Jarvenpaa argues that such after-acquired evidence should not have been allowed in his wrongful discharge action.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\u00b639 In its discretion, however, the District Court admitted the testimony of Glacier\u2019s witnesses. The District Court believed that the testimony was relevant, in some circumstances, to substantiate the reasons Glacier gave for Jarvenpaa\u2019s discharge in its November 2,1992, letter. Morale was specifically addressed in the letter, plus Jarvenpaa introduced post-November 2,1992, evidence in hopes of establishing that morale was still bad, thus opening the door on the issue. The other evidence admitted directly related to the matters addressed in the November 2,1992, letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u00b640 We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting such testimony. In its letter, Glacier indicated that Jarvenpaa detrimentally affected the morale and the operations of the workplace, and that he had problems exercising his duties as a supervisor. The District Court determined that Glacier\u2019s proffered evidence was relevant and admissible because it tended to prove the truth of the allegations Glacier made in its letter and whether Jarvenpaa was terminated for good cause. Furthermore, Jarvenpaa contended the pre-termination morale was attributable to other causes. Therefore, post-termination morale was probative of both Glacier\u2019s cause for termination and Jarvenpaa\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b641 It is true that an employer should be limited to introducing only those reasons itemized in a discharge letter as the reasons justifying termination. See, <em>e.g., Galbreath v. Golden Sunlight Mines, Inc. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 19, 23, 890 P.2d 382, 385 (any collateral reasons for the discharge suggested by the evidence, other than the sole reason stated in a discharge letter, is irrelevant and, therefore, inadmissible); <em>Flanigan, </em>221 Mont. at 431, 720 P.2d at 264 (after-acquired evidence that is not known to the employer at the time of an employee termination is not admissible); <em>Swanson v. St. John\u2019s Lutheran Hospital </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 414, 422, 597 P.2d 702, 706 (evidence outside the scope of a letter which states the reasons for an employee discharge is of questionable value and irrelevant). Unlike these cases, however, Glacier did not offer evidence to present collateral reasons for Jarvenpaa\u2019s discharge. Instead, it offered the evidence to substantiate the reasons it had already given in its November 2,1992, letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b642  The District Court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible. Absent a showing of abuse of discretion, we will not overturn the District Court\u2019s determination. Although we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting such evidence, we further note that the jury was properly instructed by the District Court that it was to consider only reasons asserted by Glacier at the time of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u00b643 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT, LEAPHART, GRAY and DISTRICT COURT JUDGE SALVAGNI, sitting for JUSTICE NELSON, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
