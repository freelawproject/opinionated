In accordance with one of the contract provisions, Triad demanded that the parties arbitrate their dispute in California. Keystone filed a motion to compel arbitration in Montana, and Triad filed a cross-motion to compel arbitration in California. The District Court denied Keystone\u2019s motion and ordered the parties to submit to arbitration in California. Keystone appeals. We reverse the order of the District Court. \u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the contract provision which requires arbitration in California is void because it violates \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, or \u00a7 27-5-323, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">\u00b63 Triad Systems Corporation is a California corporation engaged in the sale of computer hardware, software, and support systems. Keystone, Inc., is a Montana corporation engaged in the distribution of automotive parts and supplies in Billings, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">\u00b64 In November 1994, Keystone and Triad entered into a contract by which Keystone agreed to purchase a computer system from Triad for approximately $250,000. The system allegedly failed to work, and Triad was unable to correct the problems to Keystone\u2019s satisfaction. Keystone requested that Triad take back its computers and that it refund Keystone\u2019s payment. Triad refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">\u00b65 In November 1996, Keystone filed a complaint against Triad in the District Court in which it alleged breach of warranty, breach of contract, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation. In response, Triad contended that pursuant to the parties\u2019 contract, they were required to arbitrate any dispute between them before the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in San Francisco, California. Keystone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>notified Triad that it was willing to arbitrate the matter before the AAA, but only in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">\u00b66 In reliance on \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, Keystone moved the District Court to compel arbitration in Montana. Triad filed a cross-motion to compel arbitration in California in accordance with the terms of the contract. The District Court reasoned that \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, was preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), and that as such, its only choice was to enforce the parties\u2019 agreement, which called for the parties to arbitrate in California. Accordingly, it granted Triad\u2019s motion to compel arbitration in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b67 Is the contract provision which requires arbitration in California void because it violates \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, or \u00a7 27-5-323, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>See Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co., Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686; <em>see also Kreger v. Francis </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 444, 447, 898 P.2d 672, 674; <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b69 At the outset, it is necessary to discuss whether Montana law is even applicable to our interpretation of this contract. The terms of the contract provide that it \u201cwill be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California.\u201d Triad contends that because the parties made a valid agreement to interpret the contract according to the law of California, the question of how Montana law affects the parties\u2019 rights is irrelevant. Keystone acknowledges the contract\u2019s choice of law provision. However, it contends that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Casarotto v. Lombardi </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 369, 886 P.2d 931, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds,Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc. v. Casarotto </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 681, 116 S. Ct. 1652, 134 L. Ed. 2d 902, as it pertains to the validity of choice of law provisions, governs this case and resolves the question so that Montana law should apply to our interpretation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u00b610 In <em>Casarotto, </em>we held that the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 187(2) (1971) applies when we are faced with the question of whether to give effect to a contractual choice of law by the parties. The relevant portion of \u00a7 187(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied ... unless ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>(b)application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which, under the rule of \u00a7 188, would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">We rely on \u00a7 188 to determine which state has a materially greater interest in the particular contract issue and which state\u2019s law would apply in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties. The factors from \u00a7 188 that we consider include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">(a) the place of contracting,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">(b) the place of negotiation of the contract,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">(c) the place of performance,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">(d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">(e) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 188(2). Based on the facts in <em>Casarotto, </em>we concluded that: (1) Montana had a materially greater interest in the particular contract issue than Connecticut, the state whose law the parties had contracted to apply; (2) Montana law would apply absent an effective choice of law by the parties; and (3) application of Connecticut law would be contrary to a fundamental public policy of Montana. <em>See Casarotto, </em>268 Mont. at 375-77, 886 P.2d at 935-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">\u00b611 Triad has raised no challenge to our analysis in <em>Casarotto </em>nor made any suggestion that those same principles should not govern when a choice of law question arises. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s opinion reversing the <em>Casarotto </em>decision did not address that part of the opinion which dealt with choice of law. Therefore, that part of our decision is still valid precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">\u00b612 The record in this case suggests that the parties eventually entered into their contract after many months of negotiation in which officials from both companies traveled back and forth between California and Montana. Most significantly, however, the contract was performed almost exclusively in Montana. Triad developed the computer system to coordinate Keystone\u2019s distribution of auto parts across Montana, installed the system in Billings, and trained Keystone employees in Montana to use the system. Furthermore, the subject matter of the contract is located in Montana. We conclude, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>fore, that Montana has a materially greater interest in the contract issue than California, and that its law would apply in the absence of an effective choice of law provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b613 The next issue is whether an application of California law would be contrary to a fundamental public policy of Montana. In both <em>Rindal v. Seckler </em>(D. Mont. 1992), 786 F. Supp. 890, 894, and <em>State ex rel. Polaris Industries, Inc. v. District Court </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 110, 695 P.2d 471, the Federal District Court and this Court, respectively, noted strong public policy considerations in Montana for voiding choice of forum provisions. Although those cases involved contracts generally (as will be discussed), those same public policy considerations apply to choice of forum provisions in arbitration contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai5\">\u00b614  Therefore, to the extent that the application of California law would evade Montana\u2019s public policy regarding choice of forum provisions in contracts, we hold that the provision in this contract requiring the application of California law is void.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aki\">\u00b615 The parties agree on most relevant facts in this case. They both acknowledge that they executed a contract that requires that all disputes between them be submitted to arbitration before the AAA in San Francisco, California. They further agree that regardless of where their dispute is resolved, it should be settled by arbitration pursuant to the rules of the AAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b616 The basis of the parties\u2019 disagreement was the issue of whether \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, applies to the arbitration provision in their contract and renders void the forum selection clause that requires the parties to arbitrate in California. Section 28-2-708, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">Every stipulation or condition in a contract by which any party thereto is restricted from enforcing his rights under the contract by the usual proceedings in the ordinary tribunals or which limits the time within which he may thus enforce his rights is void. This section does not affect the validity of an agreement enforceable under Title 27, Chapter 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Keystone contends that, based on the statute, any forum selection clause that would require Montana residents to resolve disputes outside Montana when the usual procedure would be to resolve the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>pute in Montana, is void, and that the statute applies to arbitration provisions, as well as other contracts. Triad, on the other hand, asserts that the statute does not apply to arbitration agreements. In addition to the preemption position taken by the District Court, Triad relies on what it contends is an express exclusion in the last sentence of the statute and on its assumption that arbitration is not a usual proceeding in the ordinary tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b617 Section 28-2-708, MCA, has historically been applied for two distinct purposes: (1) to protect Montana residents from having to litigate outside of Montana; and (2) to invalidate pre-dispute arbitration agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b6 18 The first purpose reflects the fundamental public policy of this state to protect the \u201csubstantive rights of Montana residents to seek redress in the courts of [Montana].\u201d <em>Rindal, </em>786 F. Supp. at 894; <em>see also Polaris, </em>215 Mont. 110, 695 P.2d 471. Accordingly, \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, has been applied to invalidate forum selection clauses that would have the effect of forcing Montana residents to litigate disputes outside of Montana. <em>See Rindal, 786 </em>F. Supp. 890; <em>Polaris, </em>215 Mont. 110, 695 P.2d 471. <em>Rindal </em>and <em>Polaris </em>involved contracts that required all disputes to be resolved through the courts of Denver, Colorado, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, respectively. In each case, the forum selection clause was held to constitute \u201can improper restraint upon the [party\u2019s] exercise of its rights to enforce the... contract by a \u2018usual proceeding\" in the \u2018ordinary tribunals\u2019 of Montana.\u201d <em>Rindal, 786 </em>F. Supp. at 894 <em>(citing Polaris, </em>215 Mont. at 111, 695 P.2d at 472).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b6 19 Although neither <em>Rindal </em>nor <em>Polaris </em>dealt with an arbitration agreement, Keystone maintains that the interest which \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, was intended to protect, as applied in those cases, is as applicable to arbitration provisions as to contracts in general and, therefore, that we should apply the statute equally in the arbitration context to avoid anomalous results.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b620 We conclude that whether or not \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, pertains to arbitration contracts, \u00a7 27-5-323, MCA, provides the same protection in that context. That statute, which pertains specifically to arbitration agreements, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">No agreement concerning venue involving a resident of this state is valid unless the agreement requires that arbitration occur within the state of Montana. This requirement may only be waived upon the advice of counsel as evidenced by counsel's signature thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u00b621 There is no indication from the face of the contract at issue that the right to have disputes arbitrated in Montana was waived based on the advice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\">\u00b622  Accordingly, we hold that the provision at issue which requires that a Montana resident arbitrate disputes related to a contract to be performed in Montana at a location outside Montana is void because it violates Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b623 Our only remaining inquiry is whether Montana\u2019s controlling statutory law is preempted by the FAA which unquestionably applies and provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">A written provision in ... a contract... to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1994). The FAA generally preempts state law which restricts the application of arbitration agreements. <em>See Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 681, 686-87, 116 S. Ct. 1652, 1656, 134 L. Ed. 2d 902, 908-09; <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co. </em>(1974), 417 U.S. 506, 510-11, 94 S. Ct. 2449, 2453, 41 L. Ed. 2d 270, 276. However, when a state law does not conflict with the FAA so as to frustrate the objectives of Congress, it is not necessarily preempted. <em>See Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Jr. Univ. </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 468, 477-78, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 1255, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488, 499. State law may be applied in spite of the FAA\u2019s preemptive effect <em>\u201cif </em>that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally.\u201d <em>Perry v. Thomas </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 483, 492-93 n.9, 107 S. Ct. 2520, 2527, 96 L. Ed. 2d 426, 437; <em>see also Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. at 686-87, 116 S. Ct. at 1656, 134 L. Ed. 2d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"ARb\">\u00b624 Keystone contends that \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, governs the enforceability of contracts generally and, by logical extension, argues that applying the same restriction to arbitration agreements does not frustrate or conflict with the FAA. Therefore, it contends that the FAA should not preempt the statutes in question. Triad, like the District Court, relies on the general preemptive power of the FAA to avoid the effect of Montana\u2019s statutes. Upon review of the relevant statutes and case law, however, we conclude that the FAA does not preempt \u00a7 27-5-323, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u00b625 In Casarotto, the U. S. Supreme Court clarified the kind of state laws which are preempted by the FAA. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\">Courts may not ... invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable <em>only </em>to arbitration provisions. By enacting \u00a7 2, we have several times said, Congress precluded States from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status, requiring instead that such provisions be placed \u201cupon the same footing as other contracts.\u201d Montana\u2019s \u00a7 27-5-114(4) directly conflicts with \u00a7 2 of the FAA because the State\u2019s law conditions the enforceability of arbitration agreements on compliance with a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally. The FAA thus displaces the Montana statute with respect to arbitration agreements covered by the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">Applying \u00a7 27-5-114(4) here... would not enforce the arbitration clause in the contract between DAI and Casarotto; instead, Montana\u2019s first-page notice requirement would invalidate the clause. The \u201cgoals and policies\u201d of the FAA, this Court\u2019s precedent indicates, are antithetical to threshold limitations placed specifically and solely on arbitration provisions. Section 2 \u201cmandate[s] the enforcement of arbitration agreements,\u201d \u201csave upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d Section 27-5-114(4) of Montana\u2019s law places arbitration agreements in a class apart from \u201cany contract,\u201d and singularly limits their validity. The State\u2019s prescription is thus inconsonant with, and is therefore preempted by, the federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. at 687-88, 116 S. Ct. at 1656-57, 134 L. Ed. 2d at 909-10 (citations omitted). Based upon this language and an earlier reference in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, we read <em>Casarotto </em>to stand for the proposition that a state law may not \u201cplace arbitration clauses on an unequal \u2018footing\u2019 \u201d from general contract provisions. <em>Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. at 686, 116 S. Ct. at 1655, 134 L. Ed. 2d at 908 (quoting <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos., Inc. v. Dobson </em>(1995), 513 U.S. 265, 281, 115 S. Ct. 834, 843, 130 L. Ed. 2d 753, 769).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b626 As we stated above, \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, invalidates choice of forum provisions in contracts generally. Section 27-5-323, MCA, does the same to arbitration agreements. Montana law, therefore, does not distinguish between forum selection clauses which are part of contracts generally and forum selection clauses found in agreements to arbitrate. Such a distinction, if one existed, would certainly manifest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the kind of unequal treatment that <em>Casarotto </em>prohibits. The lack of such a distinction is evidence that the statute does not conflict with the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">\u00b627 We are further persuaded that Montana\u2019s statutes are consistent with the FAA because neither statute nullifies either party\u2019s obligation to arbitrate their dispute. Rather, they preserve the obligation to arbitrate and constitute no more of an intrusion than on any other general contract entered into in this State. That ultimately distinguishes this case from those cases relied on by Triad in which application of the respective state laws invalidated altogether the parties\u2019 agreements to arbitrate. <em>See Allied-Bruce, </em>513 U.S. 265, 115 S. Ct. 834, 130 L. Ed. 2d <em>753; Scherk, </em>417 U.S. 506, 94 S. Ct. 2449, 41 L. Ed. 2d 270; <em>see also Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. 681, 116 S. Ct. 1652, 134 L. Ed. 2d 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b628 The mere fact that in this case the statutes limit in part the enforceability of the agreement and nullify an agreement to resolve the parties\u2019 disputes in California does not create a conflict with the purpose of the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b629  Accordingly, we hold that neither \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA, nor \u00a7 27-5-323, MCA, are preempted by the FAA. In addition, we hold that the combined effect of these statutes, as applied to the arbitration provision in this case, invalidates only that portion of the agreement which requires Keystone to arbitrate the dispute outside of Montana. We reverse the order of the District Court that requires the parties to arbitrate in California, and order that arbitration occur in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"AWE\">\u00b630 This case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, LEAPHART, REGNIER, NELSON and GRAY concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\">.
