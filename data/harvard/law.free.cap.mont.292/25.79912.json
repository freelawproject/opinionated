It is the further order of this court that pursuant to Section 46-18-221, MCA the court finds based upon the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty and the testimony before the court, that while engaged in the commission of the offense, the defendant did knowingly display, brandish or otherwise use dangerous weapons, a knife and a rock, in the commission of the offenses. Accordingly, the court pursuant to Section 46-18-221, MCA 1995 also sentences the defendant to Montana State Prison for an additional ten (10) years with said term to run consecutively to the sentences outlined above. It is the order of this court that while serving the period of incarceration that pursuant to Section 46-18-202(2), MCA 1995 that until completion of both phases of sexual offender program, chemical dependency, anger management, criminal thinking therapy and receives his General Education Degree, the defendant shall not be considered for parole or participation in the supervised release program while serving the above mentioned sentences.

The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AXn\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"A5k\">Done in open Court this 20th day of February, 1998.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate id=\"AvO\">DATED this 12th day of March, 1998.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"ADP9\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division provides: \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (Section 45-18-904(3), MCA.) The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"AGD7\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"ACl\">Chairman, Hon.
