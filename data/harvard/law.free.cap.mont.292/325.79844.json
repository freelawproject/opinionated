After a three-day jury trial, DeVore was convicted of all counts except the criminal endangerment charge. DeVore appeals his conviction. We vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether DeVore\u2019s conviction should be reversed due to the District Court\u2019s denial of DeVore\u2019s motion to dismiss two jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b63 On the evening of March 5, 1996, Douglas DeVore and Steve Scott were involved in a verbal altercation following a game of pool at the Empire Bar in Billings. During their dispute, DeVore drew a handgun and fired a shot into the ceiling of the bar. DeVore left the bar immediately after he fired the shot, and Scott and another man followed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b64 The two continued to exchange words on the street, and DeVore eventually fired two more shots in Scott\u2019s direction. The shots narrowly missed Scott, who fled into the Northern Hotel. DeVore followed Scott into the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b65 There was conflicting testimony about DeVore\u2019s conduct at the hotel. Four witnesses testified that DeVore pointed the gun at them and that they were afraid that he would shoot them. DeVore, on the other hand, claims that he did not specifically point the gun at anyone and that he did not intend to injure anyone. He admits that he yelled for Scott, but that when he could not find him in the hotel, he left. Police then arrived at the hotel and handcuffed DeVore; DeVore admitted that he resisted the arrest \u201cslightly.\u201d The police testified that they had to wrestle him to the ground to handcuff him.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b66 The State charged DeVore by information in the District Court for the Thirteenth Judicial District in Yellowstone County. It alleged that DeVore had committed attempted deliberate homicide and felony criminal endangerment, and that he had resisted arrest; in June 1996, the information was amended to include four felony counts of assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b67 On the first day of the three-day trial, the parties participated in jury selection. During the State\u2019s examination, one juror was excused because he was acquainted with Scott and had heard Scott\u2019s version of the events. Two prospective jurors were also dismissed for cause during the defendant\u2019s examination, one because of his strong belief that it is inappropriate for citizens to carry handguns, and the other, Richard Klotz, because he was unsure of his ability to afford the defendant the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\u00b68 DeVore challenged two other prospective jurors, Kirk Brumfield and Jeffrey Schwehr, for cause based upon responses that they gave similar to Klotz\u2019s, which DeVore alleged raised concerns about their ability to presume he was innocent. The District Court told the jurors that they would have to presume DeVore innocent, and that if they were not convinced by the State beyond a reasonable doubt, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>would have to find that DeVore was not guilty. When asked by the District Court if they could do that, both Brumfield and Schwehr stated that they thought they could. The District Court then denied DeVore\u2019s challenges. DeVore removed Brumfield and Schwehr with two of his six peremptory challenges; he exhausted his four remaining peremptory challenges on other prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b69 During the trial, DeVore contended that he acted out of self-defense and that his state of mind did not reflect the necessary intent pursuant to the charged offenses. He testified that he was only attempting to scare Scott when he fired the shots on the street, and that he never intended to kill Scott or to cause injury to anyone at the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b610 The jury acquitted DeVore of the criminal endangerment charge and convicted him of all the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u00b611 Should DeVore\u2019s conviction be reversed due to the District Court\u2019s denial of DeVore\u2019s motion to dismiss two jurors for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"A2_\">\u00b612 We will not reverse a district court\u2019s decision regarding a juror\u2019s fitness to serve absent an abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Sullivan </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 313, 320, 880 P.2d <em>829, 834; State v. Williams </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 530, 536, 866 P.2d 1099, 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u00b613 Our analysis of this case involves a two-step process. First, we must determine whether the District Court abused its discretion when it denied DeVore\u2019s motion to remove Brumfield and Schwehr for cause. Second, if we determine that the District Court abused its discretion, we must determine whether DeVore\u2019s conviction should be set aside as a result of the District Court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\u00b614 Section 46-16-115, MCA, sets forth the reasons for which the District Court should excuse a juror for cause. It states in relevant part: \u201cA challenge for cause may be taken for... (j) having a state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">\u00b615 At issue here is the state of mind of jurors Brumfield and Schwehr. DeVore\u2019s counsel posed the following questions to all of the prospective jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">By the mere fact that defendant is charged with what they call an Information, which is a charging document filed with the courts, does anybody believe, therefore, that he is guilty of what he is charged with as he sits here before you right now? Does anybody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>believe that he has got to be guilty of something, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be charged?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b616 Three jurors responded to the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">SCHWEHR: Well, I do have to be honest. He may have to be guilty of something, but may have been not felony, felony assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: So you, therefore, as you sit before us in your mind the defendant is guilty of something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">SCHWEHR: Something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Even though you haven\u2019t heard any evidence whatsoever \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">SCHWEHR: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: \u2014 coming from this stand? The mere fact that he is charged with something causes you alarm, cause you to think that he is guilty of something? Maybe not what he is charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyU\">SCHWEHR: Fair or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">SCHWEHR: Fair or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: That\u2019s an honest answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-14\">KLOTZ: I would agree with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-15\">BRUMFIELD: So would I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-16\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: You agree with that? You know, [State\u2019s counsel] talked with you folks about this presumption of innocence, and each one of you said to him, \u201cWell, yeah, I presume him innocent.\u201d But you, sir, and you, sir, and you, sir, have spoken up now, and you are letting me know that your true feeling is that he\u2019s guilty of something here or he wouldn\u2019t be charged; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-17\">KLOTZ: That\u2019s correct on my part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-18\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: And then you are going to expect us, the defense, to come forward and prove to you that he is not guilty of what he is charged with, and maybe not guilty of anything. Is that the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZe\">KLOTZ: I don\u2019t expect you to prove anything. I expect them to prove that he is in fact guilty of the charges that you have explained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-19\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Okay. But while sitting there waiting for this proof to come to you from the State, you have already made up your mind he is guilty of something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-20\">KLOTZ: Well, of something. Maybe possibly guilty of shooting a gun at something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-21\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: And you, sir, feel the same way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>BRUMFIELD: Me or \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Both of y\u2019all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">BRUMFIELD: I just feel he wouldn\u2019t be here. Guilty of something, maybe he was guilty of being at the wrong place at the wrong time; but I feel there is guilt of something or he would not be in front of us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0H\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Those are honest answers and that is \u2014 anybody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">KLOTZ: I don\u2019t feel that anybody runs around packing a gun, and so there has got to be something there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Okay. So in your mind, if someone carries \u2014 by the mere fact that someone carries a firearm with them, then that gives you cause to believe that he\u2019s got \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">KLOTZ: There is something there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Okay. Of a sinister \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">KLOTZ: Yeah. In Texas you\u2019re licensed to carry them; you are not licensed in Montana to carry them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Judge, I am going to challenge these three people for cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">\u00b617 The District Court then instructed DeVore\u2019s counsel to inquire into whether the three jurors would be able to return a verdict of not guilty if the State could not prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, even if they thought that he was \u201cguilty of something.\u201d In its statements to DeVore\u2019s counsel, the District Court referred to \u201cwhat the law will require [the jurors] to do,\u201d and to the \u201cindependent oath as a juror\u201d that they would be given by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">\u00b6 18 DeVore\u2019s counsel told the jurors that the presumption of innocence \u201cis not something that you just pay lip service to, this is something that you are supposed to believe in.\u201d Klotz, however, agreed that he had difficulty with the concept, and maintained that the defendant was guilty \u201cmaybe of something \u2014 one of the charges.\u201d DeVore\u2019s counsel asked whether the other jurors believed like Klotz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-14\">BRUMFIELD: Well, I have some faith in the State and the police department that they just don\u2019t bring charges against somebody just because they picked that man, or somebody seen that man there. I think they do a lot of investigative work ahead of time before they bring this to the courts or to us as jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-15\">So that was why I stated that I feel that he is guilty of something, not necessarily of the charges brought up against him, and maybe he has other reasons for doing what he has done. But that\u2019s where I base that from, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>[DEF. COUNSEL]: That\u2019s exactly my point for a reason for doing what he has done. You haven\u2019t heard any evidence of anything that he\u2019s done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">BRUMFIELD: That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Other than the allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">BRUMFIELD: That\u2019s exactly right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: But you are already starting out with the concept of this presumption of innocence, a nice three set of words. But it doesn\u2019t really hold for you, what this is supposed to mean; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">BRUMFIELD: Perhaps, perhaps; I\u2019m not sure what that is to mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Well, this man is supposed to be presumed innocent of everything and anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">BRUMFIELD: Once he is in this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: As he sits before you right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">BRUMFIELD: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: But you believe, because in your faith in the system, beginning with the investigation by the police, and then the charging by the State, that this man sits before you guilty of something. Either one of the charges or all of the charges or something associated with those charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">BRUMFIELD: I guess I don\u2019t know how to answer that. Do I feel he\u2019s guilty of any of the charges? No. I really have no idea. I haven\u2019t heard anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: That\u2019s fair enough. And then underlying that, however, you believe that he is guilty of something; however, whether it\u2019s the charges or something less than those charges or he wouldn\u2019t be here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-16\">BRUMFIELD: I feel he is involved, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-17\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Okay. Involved in a manner that is criminal and, therefore, he is guilty of something or simply just involved because he is a defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-18\">BRUMFIELD: I don\u2019t know that I can answer that either. I guess I couldn\u2019t make my decision of guilty or not guilty until I heard everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-19\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Okay. Let me ask you this: If you were sitting in that man\u2019s chair right there, standing accused of these man\u2019s crimes, would you feel comfortable with someone of your frame of mind sitting where you are?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>BRUMFIELD: If I was guilty, absolutely not; if I was not, it would be a big maybe. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b6 19 Schwehr\u2019s dialogue with DeVore\u2019s counsel advanced as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoY\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Okay. And then going back to you, you heard these honest answers from these individuals. Do you still stand by your original statement? Do you feel that he is charged, therefore, guilty of something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">SCHWEHR: No, that\u2019s not true. I assume he is guilty of something. I don\u2019t assume just because he is charged with felony assault or anything like that. Like the gentleman in the jury box, he said that most likely there had to be an investigation, otherwise he would not be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Um-hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">SCHWEHR: Whatever he is accused of here, I am still even not a hundred percent, even though you ran off the list of charges. But unless our prosecuting attorneys can prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is in fact guilty of what he is charged there, I\u2019m going to insist that he be cleared of everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Okay. Now we discussed presumption of innocence here, and belief that this man wouldn\u2019t be here unless he is guilty of something. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">SCHWEHR: I still assume he is guilty of something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: Okay. So you don\u2019t believe in this presumption of innocence for what it means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">SCHWEHR: I want to; and as the Judge said, if I could take my brain and erase everything off of it like a blackboard, I would do' that. But unfortunately, I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: And that\u2019s because of your personal biases and prejudices that you have come to this courtroom with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGo\">SCHWEHR: (Nod of head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">[DEF. COUNSEL]: We cannot get rid of those internal things that are within us. But the problem is we have to truly believe, before we can ask you to sit as a juror, in all fairness to the defendant, that you believe in that concept there. And what you are telling me is that you have \u2014 you\u2019re having difficulty with your answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoT\">SCHWEHR: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">\u00b620 DeVore renewed his challenge for cause against all three jurors. The District Court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>What you are confusing is these folks seem to have some faith in the system. There is nothing wrong with that. What is \u2014 the question I haven\u2019t heard yet is whether you will accord the defendant his right to the presumption of innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">I don\u2019t care so much, or it\u2019s maybe not as important whether you believe that should be accorded him; will you, that is the question. Because you will be instructed and you will be expected to accord him the right, to accord him this presumption of innocence. You will be swearing to abide by that, and I need to know whether you can or not, whether you believe \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">There may be other things that may come up that you don\u2019t think the law ought to be the way it is. Well, that\u2019s something you need to take up with your legislator, because what you will be swearing in this Court as jurors, if you are seated as a juror, will be to follow the law, and the law does require that you give this man the presumption of innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">That will be with him at every stage of these proceedings, that is with him now. And it will not be overcome until all 12 that are seated as a juror find as a group, unanimously, that beyond a reasonable doubt, the State has overcome that presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Now, can you do that, [jurors]?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Brumfield and Schwehr each answered that they could do what the District Court had described; Klotz stated that he did not know. After the State\u2019s counsel also addressed the three of them, Brumfield and Schwehr stated that they felt that they could be fair and impartial jurors, while Klotz was still not sure. Further questions by both DeVore\u2019s counsel and the District Court revealed that Brumfield \u201ccan\u2019t honestly say I believe he is a hundred percent honest of everything when I am here in this courtroom for a reason, the State has brought charges against him for a reason, there is a reason.\u201d He nonetheless believed that based on his duty as a juror, and in spite of a personal belief that the defendant is guilty, he could find DeVore not guilty if the State did not convince him beyond a reasonable doubt. The District Court stated that it did not \u201chave any problem\u201d with Brumfield and Schwehr, but recognized that Klotz \u201chas a little more doubt in his mind.\u201d Therefore, the District Court excused Klotz for cause but denied DeVore\u2019s challenge to Brumfield and Schwehr.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b621  We have previously held that disqualification based on a juror\u2019s alleged prejudice is necessary only where jurors \u201cform fixed opinions on the guilt or innocence of the defendant which they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>not be able to lay aside and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Great Falls Tribune v. District Court </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 433, 439-40, 608 P.2d 116, 120 (citing/rein <em>v. Dowd </em>(1961), 366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 1642, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751, 756); <em>see also Sullivan, </em>266 Mont. at 320, 880 P.2d at 834. Similarly, \u201c[a] court must excuse a prospective juror if actual bias is discovered during voir dire.\u201d <em>State v. Chastain </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 61, 64, 947 P.2d 57, 59 (quoting <em>United States v. Allsup </em>(9th Cir. 1977), 566 F.2d 68, 71).</p>\n<p id=\"APS\">\u00b622 Based on this language, the State contends that in order for this Court to conclude that the District Court should have dismissed the jurors for cause, Brumfield and Schwehr must have displayed bias in the form of a fixed opinion of DeVore\u2019s guilt of the alleged crimes, something which the State contends they did not do. Despite the well-established deference that we give to district court decisions regarding a juror\u2019s fitness, we reject the State\u2019s suggestion here that our review of a District Court\u2019s decision regarding a juror\u2019s partiality is limited only to whether the juror has stated a specific belief that the defendant is guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b623 We noted in <em>Chastain </em>that \u201cfrequently, jurors are reluctant to admit actual bias, and... biased attitudes must be revealed by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Chastain, </em>285 Mont. at 64, 947 P.2d at 59. In the majority of our prior cases that have addressed juror partiality, jurors did not necessarily state a fixed opinion about the defendant\u2019s guilt, but nonetheless circumstantial evidence of bias was apparent in relation to the particular circumstances of the defendant\u2019s case. <em>See, e.g., Chastain, </em>285 Mont. at 63-64, 947 P.2d at 59 (defendant charged with sexually assaulting his young female relatives, and juror expressed prejudice based on his sister\u2019s abduction at the age of sixteen); <em>Sullivan, </em>266 Mont. at 321, 880 P.2d at 834 (juror reported prior knowledge of theft allegations against defendant, who was the local director of park and recreation department); <em>Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 534-35, 866 P.2d at 1101-02 (juror knew the arresting officer, resided near where the alleged incident occurred, and had recently been a juror on similar charges); <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>186 Mont. at 439-40, 608 P.2d at 120 (involving a very high-profile crime with extensive media coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b624 Here, Brumfield and Schwehr did not express an unequivocal opinion that DeVore was guilty as charged. They did, however, demonstrate another form of bias based on their belief that people charged with crimes must be guilty of \u201csomething.\u201d Moreover, they acknowledged that it was difficult for them to understand and apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>presumption of innocence. Although they may not have stated in so many words that they believed DeVore was guilty of the charges against him, their adherence to the belief that \u201che is guilty of something\u201d plainly demonstrated a serious question about their ability to act with impartiality and to afford DeVore the presumption of innocence to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b625 In <em>Williams, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">[W]hen voir dire examination discloses a serious question about a juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, that question should be resolved in favor of excusing that juror. The role of the District Court is not to simply establish some record from which a future argument can be made that the juror recanted his or her admission of bias.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">While there may be some temporary inconvenience to the court and to the parties from excusing a juror for cause, that inconvenience is minor compared to the expense and inconvenience that results from having to retry criminal cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\"><em>Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 539-40, 866 P.2d at 1104-05. As the State points out, the facts of <em>Williams </em>are distinguishable from this case. <em>Williams </em>involved a potential juror who, during voir dire, expressed her concern about her ability to be impartial. She was a close friend of the arresting officer, was a resident of the neighborhood where the homicide at issue had occurred, had read of the crime and formed an opinion about it, and had just recently been on a jury in another homicide trial. The defendant challenged the juror for cause, at which point the district court reminded her that if she was chosen as a juror she would be instructed not to form an opinion. When the district court asked whether she could keep an open mind, she said that she could. The district court, on that basis, denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss her. We held that both subsections (e), which addresses prior jury service in a trial that involved the same or a related offense, and (j)&gt; the provision relied on in this case, of \u00a7 46-16-115(2), MCA, constituted independent bases for her removal, and that the district court abused its discretion when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion to remove her. <em>See Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 534-37, 866 P.2d at 1101-03. Although the facts are different, the issues in <em>Williams </em>and this case are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b626 The State contends that the District Court properly characterized the jurors\u2019 statements as merely indicative of their \u201cfaith in the system,\u201d and consequently separated that belief from the question of whether the jurors could afford the defendant his right to the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>sumption of innocence. This is a semantic distinction without a difference. However their responses are characterized, Brumfield and Schwehr maintained that DeVore was \u201cguilty of something.\u201d They did not presume him entirely innocent and, therefore, were not impartial as the law requires that that term be defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b627 We note a further problem with the manner in which the District Court\u2019s discretion was exercised in this case. In <em>Williams, </em>we expressly admonished trial judges regarding attempts to rehabilitate jurors. <em>See Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 536, 866 P.2d at 1103 (\u201cIn the face of these admissions of bias, the District Court\u2019s rehabilitation of this witness was, at best, unpersuasive, and at worst, threatening.\u201d). Here, the District Court\u2019s effort to preserve Brumfield and Schwehr as jurors demonstrates two abuses. First, by deflecting the focus to law enforcement and characterizing the jurors\u2019 beliefs as a matter of the jurors\u2019 faith in that system, the District Court shifted the focus from the effect of those beliefs on the defendant\u2019s rights. Consequently, it ignored the obvious reality that jurors who steadfastly adhere to a belief that defendants are somehow guilty threaten a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b628  Second, the District Court told the jurors that they \u201cwill be instructed and ... expected to accord him the right,\u201d and that they would \u201cbe swearing in this Court as jurors... to follow the law,\u201d only to ask them immediately afterward, \u201ccan you do that?\u201d The State contends that Brumfield\u2019s and Schwehr\u2019s responses to this question and others in which they stated that they could find DeVore not guilty if the State failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt prove that the jurors were impartial. As we suggested in <em>Williams, </em>however, positive responses to this kind of effort at rehabilitation are not evidence of impartiality. \u201cFew people would show the kind of contempt for a judicial officer that would have been necessary to persist in her admissions of bias under those circumstances.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 536, 866 P.2d at 1103. Reliance by the State and District Court on those kinds of answers from jurors disregards this Court\u2019s instruction in <em>Williams, </em>which states that coaxed recantations of admissions of bias are merely fodder for appeal and ultimately the source of major expense and inconvenience. It is not a district court\u2019s role to rehabilitate jurors whose spontaneous, and thus most reliable and honest, responses on voir dire expose a serious question about their ability to be fair and impartial. Nor are we willing to disregard the dangers of such an approach under the auspices of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u00b629 Finally, we dismiss the State\u2019s assertion that the jurors\u2019 responses were not grounds to remove them for cause, based on the fact that they were the result of allegedly leading questions from DeVore\u2019s counsel, and that they occurred after the State emphasized to jurors that the voir dire process is about \u201ctruth-telling.\u201d The State seems to imply that the jurors were not at fault for their answers, and that the answers should be qualified, given the type of leading questions that were posed, and that the jurors should be commended for their willingness to give honest answers that reflect the views of many citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"AHR\">\u00b630 \u201cThe purpose of voir dire in a criminal proceeding is to determine the existence of bias and prejudice on the part of prospective jurors and to enable counsel to intelligently exercise his peremptory challenges.\u201d <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>186 Mont. at 440, 608 P.2d at 120. In general, there is no rule that prohibits counsel from using leading questions to uncover prejudice in prospective jurors. <em>See State v. Gray </em>(N.C. 1997), 491 S.E.2d 538, 545. Here, the State did not object to the questions posed by DeVore\u2019s counsel, and our review discloses nothing inherently inappropriate about the questions asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b631  Furthermore, while we acknowledge the State\u2019s contention that jurors Brumfield and Schwehr gave truthful answers throughout the examination by all the respective parties, and that their statements reflected honest beliefs about both DeVore\u2019s guilt and their ability to be impartial, that does not change the fact that the responses suggested a serious question about their ability to be entirely fair and impartial. We agree unequivocally with the State that neither Brumfield nor Schwehr is at fault in this case. The fact that they expressed a conceptual difficulty with the presumption of innocence, or that they tend to have faith in police investigation to the point that it would affect their partiality, is not unique among citizens and they have every right to these views. Nonetheless, a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury means that Brumfield and Schwehr, regardless of the propriety of their beliefs or their absolute right to maintain them, should have been dismissed by the District Court for cause. The State has provided no basis for its claim that jurors will somehow be discouraged from being fully honest in their responses during voir dire if we conclude here that the District Court abused its discretion when it refused to disqualify Brumfield and Schwehr for cause. Ultimately, despite a juror\u2019s best intentions and his professed willingness to follow a district court\u2019s orders, there is an abuse of discretion when a district court chooses to ignore a juror\u2019s expressed statements that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>he believes the defendant to be guilty of something in favor of its own attempt to rehabilitate the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b632 The second part of our inquiry in this case involves the effect of our conclusion that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied DeVore\u2019s motion to dismiss the two jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b633 Section 46-20-701, MCA, states that a defendant\u2019s conviction will only be overturned on appeal if the error was prejudicial. In <em>Williams, </em>we held that prejudice will be presumed if the following occurs: (1) a district court abuses its discretion by denying a challenge for cause to a prospective juror; (2) the defendant uses one of his peremptory challenges to remove the disputed juror; and (3) the defendant exhausts all of his peremptory challenges. <em>See Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 538, 866 P.2d at 1103. We must, however, balance the presumption \u201cagainst the totality of the circumstances in each case to determine whether the error contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 538, 866 P.2d at 1103. Here, we preliminarily note that DeVore exhausted all of his peremptory challenges, two of them to remove Brumfield and Schwehr. We therefore presume, pursuant to <em>Williams, </em>that DeVore was prejudiced by the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">\u00b634 DeVore contends on appeal, however, that we should disregard that portion of <em>Williams </em>which requires us to consider the totality of the circumstances in order to confirm that the defendant has in fact suffered the presumed prejudice. He proposes instead that as a matter of law, a defendant who has been forced to use one or more of his peremptory challenges to remove a juror whom the district court should have removed for cause should have his conviction overturned without further evaluation of the State\u2019s case against him. He bases his position on the dual notion that the rights provided to defendants by \u00a7 46-16-115, MCA, and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution, are not conditioned on the strength of the defendant\u2019s case, and that in a civil context, a party who has wrongly been denied an equal number of peremptory challenges does not have an obligation to show prejudice. The State, on the other hand, suggests that the <em>Williams </em>standard is appropriate, and that when applied here, the totality of the evidence against DeVore is so overwhelming that the District Court\u2019s decision not to remove the jurors did not have any effect on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b635 As DeVore correctly points out, our presumption of harm due to a district court\u2019s erroneous refusal to remove jurors for cause is based on the disadvantage inherent when a defendant has fewer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>peremptory challenges than the State. <em>See Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 537, 866 P.2d at 1103. However, we expressly rejected in <em>Williams </em>the rule that denial of the same number of peremptory challenges to the defendant as to the State constitutes prejudicial error as a matter of law and requires automatic reversal. <em>See Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 537-38, 866 P.2d at 1103. Instead, we considered the totality of the circumstances in that case. <em>See Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 538-39, 866 P.2d at 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap1\">\u00b636 As DeVore also points out, the rule in a civil context is that when one party has been erroneously denied an equal number of peremptory challenges, we presume prejudice as a matter of law and automatically grant the offended party a new trial. <em>See King v. Special Resource Mgmt., Inc. </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 367, 374, 846 P.2d 1038, 1042, <em>overruling Leary v. Kelly Pipe Co. </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 511, 549 P.2d 813 (requiring a demonstration of prejudice to reverse a jury verdict after a district court error in the grant of peremptory challenges); <em>see also Bueling v. Swift, </em>1998 MT 112, 288 Mont. 472, 958 P.2d 694. We recognize that our justice system demands that at least as much if not more protection be given to criminal defendants than to civil litigants and that, as such, the discrepancy between our rules in <em>Williams </em>and <em>King </em>requires some explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b637 The role of a jury in both civil and criminal cases is to resolve disputed issues of fact. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-15-104, MCA (\u201cA trial jury is a body of persons... sworn to try and determine, by verdict, a question of fact.\u201d); \u00a7 25-7-103, MCA (\u201cAll questions of fact... are to be decided by the jury ....\u201d); \u00a7 26-1-202, MCA (\u201cIf a trial is byjury, all questions of fact... must be decided by the jury ....\u201d); \u00a7 46-16-103(2), MCA (\u201cQuestions of law must be decided by the court and questions of fact by the jury....\u201d). It follows that where there are no disputed issues of fact, the jury, and therefore the potential influence of its individual constituents, \u201cbiased\u201d or not, is inconsequential to the final outcome of the case. On the other hand, where issues of fact do exist, the jury is the ultimate trier of the case and fairness requires that both parties have equal opportunity to shape the jury\u2019s composition by being provided an equal number of peremptory challenges. However, prejudice to a party from an erroneous denial of a challenge to a juror for cause can only occur if a question of fact exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b638 Theoretically, in a civil context, cases which present no issue of fact should not reach a jury. For example, if a plaintiff files suit and supports his claim with evidence, and the defending party fails to present evidence that a genuine issue of fact exists (or to dispute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>plaintiffs legal claim), the plaintiff may be entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, in which case a jury is never called upon to determine the issue. Rule 50, M.R.Civ.P., motions for judgment as a matter of law similarly permit either party to seek a final judgment from the district court when no issue of fact is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b639 Criminal cases are different. On the one hand, \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, authorizes a district court, upon either its own initiative or a motion by the defendant, to dismiss the case against a defendant before the matter reaches a jury based on its determination that the factual evidence is insufficient to support a guilty verdict. However, our criminal justice system does not provide the State a comparable procedural method by which to prevail absent submission of the evidence to the jury. That is, no matter how uncontroverted the State\u2019s evidence, our system guarantees a defendant the right to have his guilt determined by a jury of his peers. <em>See </em>Art. II, Sec. 24 and 26, Mont. Const. The effect of this protection is that a jury may occasionally be called upon to decide a criminal case even in the absence of a genuine issue of fact. Such was the case in <em>Williams </em>where the State\u2019s evidence was \u201cbasically uncontradicted,\u201d due to the defendant\u2019s failure either to rebut the State\u2019s evidence or to present any testimony of his own. <em>Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 539, 866 P.2d at 1104; <em>see also State v. Nichols </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 438, 448, 734 P.2d 170, 176 (holding that voir dire error was harmless because the defendant\u2019s trial testimony required any juror to convict on the charges).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b640 We must therefore account for the possibility that the jury\u2019s verdict was strictly a product of the evidence and that the District Court\u2019s error might have played no part whatsoever in what was an already uncontroverted matter according to the facts in the record. When error has not had a material impact on the result of a case, there is very little reason, beyond the unjustifiable punitive impact on the State and/or the district court, for the reversal of a defendant\u2019s conviction. This rationale underlies our well-established harmless error analysis, whereby a district court\u2019s error will be deemed harmless and a defendant\u2019s conviction will be upheld if the error did not contribute to the conviction. Accordingly, we reject DeVore\u2019s suggestion that we should no longer consider the totality of the circumstances in each case to determine whether the error contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction, and that defendants who can show an abuse of discretion by the district court during voir dire should have their conviction overturned as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u00b641 We reiterate here our rule from <em>Williams </em>that we must balance the presumption \u201cagainst the totality of the circumstances... to determine whether the error contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 538, 866 P.2d at 1103. In light of the presumption and our above analysis, a defendant on appeal need not show actual prejudice. Rather, he need only establish that the jury was charged with the determination of a factual issue important to the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b642 The record in this case reveals that, unlike Williams, DeVore gave testimony which created substantial and important issues of fact for the jury\u2019s determination. First, DeVore\u2019s primary defense involved his state of mind. The assault charges and the attempted deliberate homicide charge each required that the State prove that DeVore acted purposely and knowingly. DeVore conceded his conduct, but challenged the State\u2019s claim that he intended to injure the four alleged assault victims and to kill Scott. As such, DeVore\u2019s own testimony regarding his intent directly contradicted the evidence offered by the State to show that DeVore intended to injure and kill people that night. Second, there was conflicting testimony about whether DeVore actually pointed the gun at the four individuals in the hotel. Each issue depended heavily on the jury\u2019s assessment of DeVore\u2019s credibility, and the conflicting testimony clearly left to the jury the ultimate determination of whether DeVore acted in violation of the alleged statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b643  As we stated, DeVore need not show that a particular juror whom he would have removed if given the appropriate number of peremptory challenges led to his conviction. He must only demonstrate that in the totality of the circumstances important factual issues were determined by the jury, which confirms our presumption that he was prejudiced by the District Court\u2019s abuse of discretion during voir dire. The record demonstrates that the jury did decide important factual issues here. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand to the District Court for retrial of the charges of which the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, LEAPHART, NELSON, REGNIER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
