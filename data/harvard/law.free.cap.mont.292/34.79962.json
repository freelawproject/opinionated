The defendant shall receive credit for time served in the Montana State Prison. It is further ordered that as restitution in this matter is received by the Clerk of Court, the Clerk may pro rate partial payments to the victims. Defendant shall be designated a non-dangerous offender for the purposes of parole.

The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AaH\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"A4s4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Done in open Court this 19th day of February, 1998.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate id=\"A6P\">DATED this 12th day of March, 1998.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"A50\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division provides: \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (Section 45-18-904(3), MCA.) The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"A1uv\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AxU\">Chairman, Hon.
