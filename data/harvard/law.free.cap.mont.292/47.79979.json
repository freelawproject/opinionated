The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"AqG\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended so that the defendant is sentenced to the Department of Corrections for the remainder of her sentence instead of the Women\u2019s Correctional System.
