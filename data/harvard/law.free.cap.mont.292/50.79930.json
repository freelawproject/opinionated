The defendant is committed to the Montana Department of Corrections for appropriate placement into a community-based program, facility, or state correctional institution, to potentially include the Montana Women\u2019s Correctional Facility at Billings, Montana, for a period of ten (10) years, with five (5) years suspended on the Felony, subject to conditions as stated in the October 1,1997 judgment.

Normal rules of probation apply, plus the defendant must obtain her GED or a high school diploma within one year of today\u2019s date.</p>\n<p id=\"Asz\">Reasons for the amendment are: (1) The defendant lacks a criminal history.
