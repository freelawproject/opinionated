That the defendant is guilty of violating the terms and conditions of the sentence heretofore imposed upon him on the 5th day of March, 1997, and the suspended sentence is hereby revoked. 2.

The Court directs that the defendant not be considered for parole until such time as he has completed all phases of the chemical dependency treatment program offered by the Montana State Prison. The defendant shall receive a total credit of 28 days for time served in jail prior to this sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"AqY2\">On February 19, 1998, the defendant\u2019s application for review of that sentence was heard by the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap0P\">The defendant was present and proceeded Pro Se. The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AR17\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"Axp\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division provides: \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (Section 45-18-904(3), MCA.) The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"ARoE\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AhY\">Chairman, Hon.
