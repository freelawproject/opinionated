The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"Agb0\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended to ten (10) years to the Montana Women\u2019s Prison, with five (5) years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"AO7\">The reasons for the amendment are that the circumstances of the offense and the violation of probation were not serious enough to require such an extensive sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"AA36\">Chairman, Hon.
