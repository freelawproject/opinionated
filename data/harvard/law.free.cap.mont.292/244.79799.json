The District Court granted American Family\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the \u201cnonowned automobile exclusion\u201d is valid and excludes coverage for Henninger in the related negligence action commenced by Ross and Brenda Livengood (the Livengoods). Judgment was entered accordingly, the Livengoods appeal and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b62 The overall issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to American Family. The specific issues raised by the Livengoods in that regard are:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the \u201cnonowned automobile exclusion\u201d in Henninger\u2019s policy applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the \u201cnonowned automobile exclusion\u201d in Henninger\u2019s policy does not violate Montana\u2019s public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the \u201cnonowned automobile exclusion\u201d in Henninger\u2019s policy does not violate the reasonable expectations of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">\u00b66 Henninger was driving a 1993 Ford van owned by her roommate, Arthur Frehse (Frehse), on July 17, 1995, when she and the Livengoods were involved in a vehicle/motorcycle accident. The Livengoods sustained injuries in the accident and filed a negligence action against Henninger. Frehse and Henninger had separate automobile liability policies with American Family. American Family defended Henninger in the Livengoods\u2019 negligence action under the cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>erage afforded by the Frehse policy, but denied coverage under the Henninger policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b67 American Family subsequently filed the instant action seeking a declaration that Henninger\u2019s policy did not obligate it to defend Henninger or pay any compensatory damages for bodily injury recovered by the Livengoods. It contended that Henninger\u2019s policy covered compensatory damages for bodily injury arising from Henninger\u2019s use of her own vehicle, but expressly excluded coverage \u2014 under a provision hereinafter referred to as the nonowned automobile exclusion \u2014 while Henninger was operating Frehse\u2019s vehicle because Henninger and Frehse were residents of the same household.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b68 Both American Family and the Livengoods moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted American Family\u2019s motion, denied the Livengoods\u2019 motion, and entered judgment accordingly. The Livengoods appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b69 The nonowned automobile exclusion at issue in this case provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">This coverage does not apply to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">9. Bodily injury or property damage arising out of the use of a vehicle, other than your insured car, which is owned by or furnished or available for regular use by you or any resident of your household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">The District Court determined that no genuine issue of material fact existed with regard to Henninger and Frehse being residents of the same household and concluded that the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy applies. It also concluded that the exclusion did not violate either public policy or the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations. On those bases, the District Court granted summary judgment to American Family.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., criteria used by that court. <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34 (citations omitted). In establishing the propriety of summary judgment,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">[t]he movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264-65, 900 P.2d 901, 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\n<em>ISSUE ONE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in concluding that the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy applies?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b612 The Livengoods first assert that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to American Family because a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Henninger and Frehse were residents of the same household for purposes of applying the nonowned automobile exception. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b6 13 American Family alleged in its complaint that, at the time of the accident, Henninger and Frehse were residents of the same household. The Livengoods denied that allegation in their answer. Thereafter, however, Henninger and Frehse answered the complaint and admitted that they were residents of the same household on the date of the accident. That admission was sufficient to meet American Family\u2019s burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding residency in the same household. Thus, the burden shifted to the Livengoods to come forward with substantial evidence, not mere denial or speculation, that a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether Henninger and Frehse were residents of the same household. <em>See Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264, 900 P.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u00b6 14 The Livengoods did not come forward with any evidence whatsoever, much less substantial evidence, to controvert Henninger and Frehse\u2019s admission that they were residents of the same household and, thereby, to raise a genuine issue of fact in that regard. Instead, the Livengoods advanced cases from other jurisdictions setting forth factors tending to indicate whether two persons are residents of the same household. They advance those cases again on appeal, arguing therefrom that questions remain as to those factors in the present case. The problem with the Livengoods\u2019 argument, however, is that none of the cases on which they rely involve an admission by the persons involved that they were, in fact, residents of the same household. As a result, the questions the Livengoods raise about the duration and nature of Henninger and Frehse\u2019s relationship, their \u201cintentions\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>regarding the future and the like, are merely speculative and are insufficient to meet their burden of raising a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Henninger and Frehse were residents of the same household at the time of the accident. We conclude, therefore, that the District Court did not err in determining that no genuine issue of material fact exists regarding Henninger and Frehse being residents of the same household at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b6 15 The Livengoods also contend that the District Court erred in interpreting the nonowned automobile exclusion to require only that the vehicle driven by Henninger at the time of the accident be owned by Frehse, a resident of her household, and in determining, on that basis, that the exclusion applies. They posit that, in order for the exclusion to apply, Frehse also must have either furnished his vehicle \u2014 or made it available \u2014 for Henninger\u2019s \u201cregular use.\u201d Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b6 16 As set forth above, the policy language at issue excludes coverage for injury arising out of the insured\u2019s use of a vehicle \u201cowned by or furnished or available for regular use by you or any resident of your household.\u201d In its common usage, \u201cor\u201d connotes the disjunctive, and it is used to express an alternative or give a choice of one among two or more things. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1095 (6th ed. 1990). When a provision is written in the disjunctive, it is clear that only one of the separately stated factors must exist. <em>See Baldridge v. Board of Trustees </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 53, 62, 951 P.2d 1343, 1349. Indeed, in <em>Stutzman, </em>we implicitly interpreted a similarly worded exclusion of a vehicle \u201cowned by or furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any relative\u201d disjunctively, requiring the insurer to establish only that the vehicle was owned by a relative of the named insured. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 378, 945 P.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b617 Here, the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d separates each alternative in the nonowned automobile exclusion at issue. As a result, coverage clearly is excluded for injuries arising from Henninger\u2019s use of a vehicle \u2014 other than her insured car \u2014 which is either \u201cowned by\u201d or \u201cfurnished or available for regular use\u201d by either Henninger or any resident of her household. American Family established that Henninger was using a vehicle owned by Frehse, a resident of her household, at the time of the accident. It was not required to show that the separately stated alternative regarding a vehicle furnished or made available for her regular use by a resident of her household also was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u00b618  We hold that the District Court did not err in interpreting the policy language or in concluding that the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\n<em>ISSUE TWO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b619 Did the District Court err in concluding that the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy does not violate Montana\u2019s public policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b620 Having rejected the Livengoods\u2019 argument that the exclusion at issue did not apply, the District Court also rejected their contention that the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy violates Montana\u2019s mandatory insurance laws and is void as against public policy pursuant to <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Royle </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 173, 656 P.2d 820. On appeal, the Livengoods continue to rely on <em>Royle </em>in contending that the District Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b621 In <em>Royle, </em>a daughter sued her parents for injuries sustained while a passenger in a car being driven by her mother, owned by her father, and insured by Transamerica. <em>Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 174, 656 P.2d at 821. The parents\u2019 insurance policy contained a household exclusion clause which excluded coverage for \u201c \u2018bodily injury to any person who is related by blood, marriage, or adoption to [the insured], if that person resides in [the insured\u2019s] household at the time of loss.\u2019 \u201d <em>Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 174, 656 P.2d at 821. Relying on the exclusion, Transamerica refused to defend and the parents sought a declaratory judgment in federal court that the household exclusion was invalid. <em>Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 174-75, 656 P.2d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b622 On certification from the federal court, we addressed whether \u00a7 61-6-301(1), MCA, requiring an owner of a motor vehicle to \u201c \u2018continuously provide insurance <em>against loss resulting from liability imposed by law </em>for bodily injury or death or damage to property <em>suffered by any </em>person...\u2019[,]\u201d prohibited the household exclusion. <em>Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 175, 656 P.2d at 821. Determining that the legislature had expressly outlawed the household exclusion by requiring protection against bodily injury to any person, we held that the household exclusion was void and unenforceable. <em>Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 177, 181, 656 P.2d at 823, 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u00b623 <em>Royle </em>is not applicable here. There, we invalidated the household exclusion because it precluded coverage for injuries to relatives living in the insured\u2019s household in violation of the \u00a7 61-6-301(1), MCA, mandate that a vehicle owner\u2019s policy provide liability coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>for injuries to all persons. <em>Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 181, 656 P.2d at 824. In contrast, Henninger\u2019s policy complies with the requirements of \u00a7 61-6-301(1), MCA, by providing liability coverage for injuries suffered as the result of her operation of her insured vehicle. The nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy simply precludes coverage while she uses certain vehicles other than her insured vehicle. It does not preclude coverage for injuries sustained by particular persons in contravention of\u00a7 61-6-301(1), MCA, as was the case <em>in Royle. </em>Thus, the Livengoods\u2019 reliance on <em>Royle </em>is misplaced. \u00b624 Moreover, we distinguished <em>Royle </em>in addressing a household/vehicle exclusion in <em>Stutzman. </em>Both Stutzman and her husband were the named insureds in an automobile insurance policy issued by Safeco. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 375, 945 P.2d at 33. Stutzman was injured while a passenger in her husband\u2019s vehicle and claimed damages in excess of $200,000. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 375, 945 P.2d at 33. Safeco paid her the $100,000 liability limits under the policy and Stutzman sought additional coverage pursuant to the underinsured motorist benefits provided in the policy. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 375, 945 P.2d at 33-34. Safeco denied the additional coverage based on a policy clause that removed from the definition of \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d any vehicle \u201c \u2018owned by or furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any relative....\u2019\u201d <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 378, 945 P.2d at 35. It argued that, because the vehicle was owned by Stutzman\u2019s husband, a relative of the named insured, the vehicle was not an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d as defined under the policy and no additional coverage was available. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 378, 945 P.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b625 Stutzman filed an action in the district court to recover the underinsured motorist benefits. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 374, 945 P.2d at 33. Both parties moved for summary judgment and the district court granted Safeco\u2019s motion and denied Stutzman\u2019s motion. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 374, 945 P.2d at 33. Stutzman contended on appeal that, pursuant to <em>Royle, </em>household exclusion clauses in bodily injury liability cases were void and, therefore, the exclusion in her policy violated Montana\u2019s public policy. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 380, 945 P.2d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b626 We rejected Stutzman\u2019s argument. While not specifically stated in our opinion, Stutzman\u2019s policy provided the mandatory liability coverage required by statute at the time of the accident. <em>Cf. Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 375, 945 P.2d at 33-34; and \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-301(1) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>61-6-103(2)(b), MCA. Thus, unlike the situation in <em>Royle, </em>the underinsured motorist coverage at issue in Stutzman was optional, rather than statutorily mandated; as a result, the parties could freely contract regarding exclusions or limitations on the optional coverage. <em>See Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 380-81, 945 P.2d at 37. Therefore, while noting that we may invalidate a policy exclusion which violates Montana\u2019s mandatory insurance law, we ultimately held that the exclusion at issue \u2014 which was not contrary to any statutory mandate \u2014 did not violate Montana\u2019s public policy. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 380, 382, 945 P.2d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\">\u00b627 In the present case, as in <em>Stutzman, </em>Henninger\u2019s policy provides the mandatory liability coverage required by \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-301(1) and 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA, and the nonowned automobile exclusion is not contrary to any statutory mandate. Thus, on the record before us, we conclude that the nonowned automobile exclusion at issue in the present case does not violate Montana\u2019s public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b628 The Livengoods also present several hypothetical scenarios under which either they or Frehse might have been completely denied coverage for bodily injuries, arguing therefrom that the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy is contrary to Montana\u2019s public policy. Our function, however, is to interpret the law and apply it to the facts before us. As a result, we decline to address the Livengoods\u2019 hypothetical scenarios.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b629  We hold that the District Court correctly concluded that the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy does not violate Montana\u2019s public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>ISSUE THREE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b630 Did the District Court err in concluding that the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy does not violate the reasonable expectations of the insured?</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u00b631 With regard to the Livengoods\u2019 \u201creasonable expectations\u201d argument, the District Court concluded that the nonowned automobile exclusion was clear as to its meaning and intent and, as a result, did not offend Henninger\u2019s reasonable expectations. The Livengoods contend that the nonowned automobile exclusion is ambiguous both in and of itself and because of its positioning in the policy. Accordingly, they urge that the exclusion violates the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u00b632 The reasonable expectations doctrine provides that the objectively reasonable expectations of insurance purchasers regarding the terms of their policies should be honored notwithstanding the fact that a painstaking study of the policy would have negated those expectations. <em>Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 180-81, 656 P.2d at 824 (citation omitted). The doctrine is consistent with our strong public policy that insurance is to serve a fundamental protective purpose; moreover, it \u201cgoes hand in hand with our rule of strictly construing policy exclusions.\u201d <em>Wellcome v. Home Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 354, 358, 849 P.2d 190, 193 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b633 On the other hand, the reasonable expectations doctrine is inapplicable where the terms of the policy at issue clearly demonstrate an intent to exclude coverage. <em>Wellcome, </em>257 Mont. at 359, 849 P.2d at 194. The reason, of course, is that \u201c[expectations which are contrary to a clear exclusion from coverage are not \u2018objectively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Wellcome, </em>257 Mont. at 359, 849 P.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b634 The Livengoods first contend that the exclusion language is ambiguous, thereby offending Henninger\u2019s reasonable expectations. Specifically, they claim that the nonowned automobile exclusion is ambiguous because Henninger could have interpreted it to apply only if she and Frehse were residents of the same household and she regularly used Frehse\u2019s vehicle. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b63 5 We recently addressed the application of the reasonable expectations doctrine to exclusion language in <em>Stutzman. </em>The language at issue in Stutzman\u2019s policy excluded underinsured motor vehicle coverage for any vehicle \u201c \u2018owned by or furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any relative....\u2019 \u201d <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 378, 945 P.2d at 35. Stutzman\u2019s first contention on appeal was that the term \u201crelative\u201d was ambiguous with regard to whether it included a spouse. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 379, 945 P.2d at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u00b636 We began our discussion by reiterating the ambiguity principles applicable to insurance policies: 1.) that we will construe any ambiguity in a policy strictly against the insurer; and 2.) that we will not create an ambiguity where none exists, but will \u201cinterpret the terms of an insurance policy, ... according to their usual, common sense meaning as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of insurance products.\u201d <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 379, 945 P.2d at 36 (citations omitted). We concluded that, when applying a common sense interpretation to the term \u201crelative,\u201d the average consumer would conclude that the term included his or her spouse. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>at 379-80,945 P.2d at 36. We also concluded that, even when strictly construed against the insurer and from the perspective of the average consumer of insurance, the exclusionary language clearly and unambiguously excluded vehicles from the definition of an underinsured motor vehicle if owned by a relative, including a spouse, of the insured. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 380, 945 P.2d at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">\u00b637 Stutzman also contended that the exclusion was void because it violated her reasonable expectations as an insured. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 381, 945 P.2d at 37. We referred back to our conclusion that the exclusion clearly and unambiguously included one\u2019s spouse and, in reliance thereon, determined that any expectation by the insured to the contrary would not be objectively reasonable. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 381, 945 P.2d at 37. Consequently, we held that the exclusion did not violate the reasonable expectations of the insured. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 382, 945 P.2d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b638 As discussed above, the use of disjunctives to separate each alternative in the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy clearly precluded coverage for injuries arising from Henninger\u2019s use of a vehicle owned by a resident of her household. Thus, while strictly construing the nonowned automobile exclusion against American Family and applying a common sense meaning as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of insurance products, we conclude that the exclusion clearly and unambiguously precludes coverage under the facts before us. As a result, the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s poficy clearly demonstrates an intent to exclude coverage while Henninger was using a vehicle owned by Frehse, a resident of her household, and any expectation by Henninger to the contrary would not be objectively reasonable. <em>See Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 381, 945 P.2d at 37 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b639 The Livengoods also contend that, under <em>Shook v. State Farm Mut. Ins. of Bloomington, Ill. </em>(D.Mont. 1994), 872 F.Supp. 768, the nonowned automobile exclusion is ambiguous via its positioning in the poficy and, as a result, violates the reasonable expectations of the insured. American Family responds that the Livengoods did not raise this \u201cpositioning\u201d contention in support of their reasonable expectations argument in the District Court and, as a result, they may not raise it on appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b640 The entirety of the Livengoods\u2019 reasonable expectations argument in the District Court was set forth in two paragraphs. The first paragraph merely asserted in conclusory fashion that the nonowned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>automobile exclusion at issue was invalid in failing to honor the reasonable expectations of the purchaser and cited to our description of the reasonable expectations doctrine in <em>Royle. </em>The second paragraph simply stated that the exclusion was void and unenforceable because it violated the \u00a7 61-6-301(1), MCA, requirement that motorists carry insurance against loss resulting in liability imposed by law for injuries suffered by any person. We addressed this latter contention above and concluded that the nonowned automobile exclusion contained in Henninger\u2019s does not violate \u00a7 61-6-301(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b641 It is clear that the Livengoods\u2019 reasonable expectations argument in the District Court did not include a Shook-style positioning contention. It is equally clear that a party may not raise a new theory on appeal. <em>See Clover Leaf Dairy v. State </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 380, 387, 948 P.2d 1164, 1168 (citation omitted). As a result, we decline to address this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b642  We hold that the District Court correctly concluded that the nonowned automobile exclusion in Henninger\u2019s policy did not violate the reasonable expectations of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b643 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, REGNIER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
