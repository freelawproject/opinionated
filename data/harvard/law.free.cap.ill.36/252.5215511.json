S. L. Bryan, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-15\" pgmap=\"252\">This was an action of assumpsit brought by Deborah Williams against Jesse Edens, to the April term, 1864, of the Washington Circuit Court. A motion was made by defendant to quash the summons, which was denied. The declaration contained a count for the sale to defendant of Deborah Williams\u2019 interest in a quantity of household and kitchen furniture, etc., used in a house in Ashley in said county, known as the \u201c Ashley Hotel,\u201d at the price at which the articles had been inventoried.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-16\" pgmap=\"252\">Another count was for goods, wares and merchandize, generally, sold and delivered, and for money lent, and on an account stated. The plea was non-assumpsit.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-17\" pgmap=\"252(90) 253(102)\">It appeared in evidence, that the plaintiff, Deborah Williams, was a partner with one Richard Boren, in the \u201cAshley Hotel,\u201d the plaintiff owning ninety-five dollars worth of the furniture over and above her equal one-half part thereof. The defendant, Edens, bought Boren\u2019s interest in the property, about the first day of September, 1863, and thereupon became a partner of the plaintiff, he agreeing to pay the plaintiff ninety-five dollars, being the amount she owned in excess of her share. About the 23rd of November, 1863, the plaintiff sold her interest in the property to one Phelps, who acted, in the purchase, as the agent of defendant, Edens. The furniture was invoiced to Phelps, and defendant agreed to pay for it, the amount of the invoice, which was six hundred and seventy dollars and ninety cents, and as a mode of ascertaining the precise extent of defendant\u2019s liability under this purchase, the parties deducted this ninety-five dollars from the amount of the invoice and divided the remainder, to one-half of which was added the ninety-five dollars, making the amount of defendant\u2019s indebtedness, three hundred and sixty-two dollars and ninety-seven cents.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-6\" pgmap=\"253\">Defendant did not pay at the time, alleging, as an excuse, that he wanted to get a five hundred dollar bill changed.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-7\" pgmap=\"253\">When defendant was afterwards applied to for the money, he refused to pay, and said he had paid some claims which plaintiff\u2019s agent would not allow.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-8\" pgmap=\"253\">It was further proved, that plaintiff had loaned defendant seventy dollars to enable him to pay Boren when he bought him out, and that plaintiff had paid a note of thirty-two dollars which Boren owed a grocery, and which defendant had promised to pay for Boren at the time he purchased Boren\u2019s interest.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-9\" pgmap=\"253\">The issue was tried by the court, and a verdict found for the plaintiff for four hundred and eighty-two dollars and ninety cents.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-10\" pgmap=\"253\">A motion for a new trial was denied, and judgment entered on the verdict.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-11\" pgmap=\"253\">The case is brought here by writ of error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-12\" pgmap=\"253\">Mr. J.

The writ on its face, is, in all respects, formal and regular.</p> <p id=\"b254-6\" pgmap=\"254\">If, however, there was any valid objection to the writ, it was waived by pleading to the merits.</p> <p id=\"b254-7\" pgmap=\"254\">It is doubtless true, as a general principle, that one partner cannot sue another partner, at law, for any matter growing out of the partnership concern, or involving a consideration of partnership transactions, but for other and independent matters, there is no restriction upon partners. Ohitty on Contracts, 236 to 239, note 1.</p> <p id=\"b254-8\" pgmap=\"254\">This case involves no such considerations. The defendant in error was a partner with one Boren in a hotel, and owned, over and above her half of the furniture thereof, ninety-five dollars worth. The plaintiff bought Boren\u2019s interest in the hotel, and agreed to pay the defendant this ninety-five dollars, and thereupon became a partner with the defendant. Soon after, the plaintiff purchased out the interest of the defendant in the property, agreeing to pay her one-half of the invoice price of it. The invoice was made out at six hundred and seventy and ninety one-hundredths dollars, one-half of which would be three hundred and thirty-five and forty-five one-hundredths dollars. This the plaintiff excused himself from paying, alleging that he had to get a bill of five hundred dollars changed. It also appears that defendant loaned the plaintiff the sum of seventy dollars, and paid a note of thirty dollars for him, which he agreed to repay.</p> <p id=\"b254-9\" pgmap=\"254(89) 255(41)\">These several items are properly recoverable under the counts for goods sold, and for money lent, respectively. No consideration of partnership matters is involved in them in any sense or degree, but they are independent transactions. The sale by defendant to the plaintiff dissolved the partnership, and he became liable on his several promises. The plaintiff agreed to pay for the property according to the invoice, and was put in exclusive possession thereof. The contract was not, as the plaintiff seems to understand, that he would account for this property on settlement of the partnership, but that he would pay on the invoice for the property which he received. He has not so paid, and judgment was properly rendered against him for the amount found by the court</p> <p id=\"b255-5\" pgmap=\"255\">If there are unsettled partnership debts, the defendant is by no means exempt from liability for her proportion of them, and can be compelled to discharge that liability. Taking the contract of these parties as proved, there cannot remain a doubt of the plaintiff\u2019s liability to perform his contract, as he has made it.</p> <p id=\"b255-6\" pgmap=\"255\">The judgment is affirmed. Judgment affirmed,.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
