R. 54(B) that, \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">We find appellants\u2019 assertion to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Civ. R. 54(B) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">\u201cWhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may enter final judgment <em>as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties </em>only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">Civ. R. 54(B) is only applicable when the court enters final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>judgment \u201cas to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties.\u201d The express determination language of Civ. R. 54(B) is not appropriate herein, since the granting of the summary judgment of January 9, 1979, adjudicated all the claims of all the parties to the action as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Therefore, appellants\u2019 notice of appeal of June 12, 1979, was not timely filed. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b89-8\">Celebrezze, C. J., Cook, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and Reilly, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b89-9\">P. Brown, J., concurs in the judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b89-10\">Cook, J., of the Eleventh Appellate District, sitting for W.
