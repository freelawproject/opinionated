Vitoratos, </em>v. <em>Walsh </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 467; <em>State, ex rel. Terrell, </em>v. <em>Court </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 209; <em>State, ex rel. Vitoratos, </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Appellant essentially contends that <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1956), 351 U. S. 12, and its progeny overrule those cases of this court, <em>supra, </em>and now require that multiple free transcripts may be in order for an indigent defendant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><em>\u201cGriffin </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>and its progeny establish the principle that the State must, as a matter of equal protection, provide indigent prisoners with the basic tools of an adequate defense or appeal, when those tools are available for a price to other prisoners. While the outer limits of that principle are not clear, there can be no doubt that the State must provide an indigent defendant with a transcript of prior proceedings when that transcript is needed for an effective defense or appeal.\u201d <em>Britt </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1971), 404 U. S. 226, 227. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Arrington </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 114, 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Appellant was provided with a basic tool for his appeal when Judge Hill granted his request for a single trial transcript. The constitutional requirements were met and, thus, Judge Hill was not under a clear duty to provide a second transcript for appellant. <em>State, ex rel. Terrell, supra, </em>at page 210. Therefore, the Court of Appeals properly denied appellant\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-9\">Celebrezze, C. J., W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
