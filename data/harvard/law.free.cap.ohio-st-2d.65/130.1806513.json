The integrity of the profession can be maintained only if the conduct of the individual attorney is above reproach.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Stein </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 77, 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>It is hereby ordered that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-6\">Celebrezze, C.

I agree that sanctions must be applied in this disciplinary matter, but I vary with the majority as to the severity or degree. In my view, the facts of this matter present a circumstance concerning which this court should apply one of the most recently promulgated rules of sanction, that being a one-year suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Here, there is no fact pattern involving the moral turpitude of this attorney, nor did he abscond with clients\u2019 funds. His violations, in the main, involved a marked incapacity to appropriately handle his clients\u2019 problems and affairs. Whether such absence of this capability stemmed from a low level of legal expertise, or his health and psychological problems, as argued by the respondent, this writer is unable to completely evaluate. But, in any event, I feel this case does not present the type of situation that we have considered previously wherein we meted out the sanction of indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Accordingly, I would vote to suspend respondent from the practice of law for the period of one year.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-11\">C. Brown, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
