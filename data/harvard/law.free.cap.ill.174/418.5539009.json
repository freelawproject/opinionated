An investigation of the record leads us to adopt this statement of facts involved as being fair and complete. It is as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\" pgmap=\"419(266) 420(14)\">\u201cIn the year 1845 Lewis Latimer, one of the complainants, was living in the State of New York. His wife had recently died, leaving three children of tender age,\u2014two daughters and one boy. The daughters were from eight to twelve years of age, and the boy from five to seven. Lewis Latimer, the father, bound out the two girls and emigrated to the State of Illinois in the year 1845, and settled in LaSalle county with the boy. For about two years in LaSalle county he farmed as a renter. In 1848 he married and bought the farm involved in this contention and commenced improving the same. The boy, James A. Latimer, lived with his father and worked upon the farm during his minority, and from aught that appears in this record he performed every filial duty. He was frugal, industrious and obedient. On his twenty-first birthday, in 1861 or thereabouts, he enlisted in the army and continued therein in active service until the close of the war. At the close of the war he returned to his father\u2019s home in LaSalle county, and by mutual agreement between himself and his father they worked the farm in question on shares for two years. Then James A. Latimer married and worked the farm of his father on shares for another year. He then farmed several years as a renter of land from other persons. He then purchased eighty acres of land in Brookfield, LaSalle county, moved onto the same with his family and commenced improving it. He continued thereon for about eleven years, making a living for his family, but did not succeed in paying for the land.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\" pgmap=\"420(340) 421(68)\">\u201cAbout 1883 the second wife of Lewis Latimer and the step-mother of James A. Latimer died. An arrangement was then made between Lewis Latimer and his son, James, whereby James Latimer moved onto the farm in question. There were two houses on said farm. Lewis Latimer continued to keep house in one of the houses, hiring a house-keeper. Lewis Latimer was then well advanced in years, unable to perform hard labor, and James took charge of the management of the farm, made some improvements thereon from year to year, and kept the farm in good condition and repair until September, 1894, when the deed in question was executed. It is a fair assumption from the evidence in this case that there was an implied understanding, during all this time, between Lewis Latimer and his son, James A. Latimer, that James was ultimately to have the farm. The matter was spoken of between them on several occasions. On or about the first day of September, 1894, the question of sinking a well upon the farm was discussed between Lewis Latimer and his son, James. James said, in substance, to his father, that he was unwilling to sink the well and pay for it without knowing who was to have the farm. The talk between them upon that subject led to the conclusion that Lewis Latimer would execute a will, or some, paper which would secure the farm to James A. Latimer at the time of his (Lewis\u2019) death, and it was agreed that Woodruff A. Morey, then living in Marseilles, LaSalle county, should be procured to come out to the farm and make the necessary papers. Mr. Morey had formerly lived and grown up in the neighborhood where Lewis Latimer lived, and they were well acquainted with each other. In pursuance of that understanding, James A. Latimer, on or about September 20,1894, called upon Woodruff A. Morey at his place of business in Marseilles and arranged with him to come to the residence of Lewis Latimer and make the necessary papers. On September 21, 1894, said Morey came to the home of Lewis Latimer and prepared a deed, which was executed by Lewis Latimer and properly acknowledged. After the execution of said deed the grantor, Lewis Latimer, handed the same to Morey, saying, T want you to take that deed and keep it, and after my decease to deliver it to James Latimer.\u2019</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\" pgmap=\"421\">\u201cThereafter James A. Latimer and Lewis Latimer continued to live upon said farm, as theretofore, until March 18, 1895, when James A. Latimer died, leaving a widow and several children, who continued to live upon the farm, Lewis Latimer making his home with the widow until August 80,1895, at which time Lewis Latimer, with some members of the family, were visiting his grandson, Arthur Latimer, in Marseilles. While there, Mrs. Flint, who was living in Chicago, one of the daughters of Lewis Latimer, came, and an arrangement was made between Lewis Latimer and the widow of James, and Mrs. Flint, that Lewis Latimer should return to Chicago with Mrs. Flint for the purpose of a visit, with an understanding between all parties that at the end of two weeks some member of the family of the widow of James Latimer should go to Chicago and return with said Lewis Latimer. At the end of two weeks the said Arthur Latimer went to Chicago after his grandfather, Lewis Latimer. At that time Lewis Latimer was sick or not well, and did not return to LaSalle county, and has not since returned and has refused to return. On September 6, 1895, Lewis Latimer executed and acknowledged in due form of law a deed to appellants, Catherine A. Earing et al.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_y\" pgmap=\"421(70) 422(75)\">\u201cOn the 25th day of February, 1896, the bill in this case was filed seeking to set aside the aforesaid deed to James Latimer and have the same declared null and void, on the ground that the same was procured by the fraud and undue influence of said James A. Latimer, deceased. The complainants Catherine A. Earing and Eunice A. Flint are the daughters of said Lewis Latimer, and the same that were bound out by him about the year 1845, in the State of New York, as aforesaid, and since they were so bound out have never been members of nor lived in the family of their father, Lewis Latimer. They grew to womanhood in the State of New York and ultimately married, and are now living, Eunice A. Flint in the city of Chicago and Catherine A. Earing in the county of Livingston.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\" pgmap=\"422\">Upon a hearing the court found the equities of the cause with the defendants; that the deed in question to James A.

Latimer. Complainants\u2019 bill was ordered to be dismissed at their costs.

The son, who was the grantee in this deed, lived on the farm with his father, who was advanced in years and unable to perform hard labor, which necessitated that the son take the charge and management of the farm from year to year, which he did do for a number of years. The son was the only member of the family who resided with his father, and it appears from the record that about the time some improvements were necessary the subject as to the future ownership of the farm was talked of between the father and son, as it had been on a number of occasions before. The father expressed\" a desire to make such provision as would insure his son the future ownership of this land, and expressed a desire to execute a will or some paper which would accomplish such result. An old friend and acquaintance of the family, who was a notary public and banker of Marseilles, was solicited to come to the farm and prepare the necessary papers. On September 21,1894,\u2014the date of the deed in controversy, \u2014in pursuance of this invitation he went to the farm and was told by Lewis Latimer, the grantor, that he desired to arrange Ms matters in such shape there would be no trouble over his property after his death. Upon being asked if he desired to make a will he said he thought he did. Upon being informed by the notary that witnesses would be necessary to a will, and, in reply to an inquiry of Lewis Latimer as to whether any expense would be incurred in the transaction after his death, receiving the information that expense of probation of the will and administration would be necessary, he then declared he desired to arrange the matter in some other way. He was told the only other method would be to make a deed, with a proviso that he should have the control and use of the property so long as he lived, and that the deed should not take effect until after his decease. To this he expressed his satisfaction, and said that was the way he wanted it, at the same time suggesting that he desired each of his daughters to have the sum of $1000, saying that he believed that was all they were entitled to. Upon the suggestion by the notary that he had considerable personal property out of which this might be paid, he responded that he did not have very much, and desired Ms son, James, to have that, and to pay to each of his daughters the sum of $1000. The deed was then prepared by the notary in the ordinary form, containing the description of the land and the following clause: \u201cThis conveyance to be in force from and after my decease, and not before.\u201d Also the further \"clause: \u201cThe said James A. Latimer to have all of my personal estate, and to pay to each of my daughters, Catherine A. Earing and Eunice A. Flint, the sum of one thousand dollars ($1000) after my decease.\u201d The notary having been furnished, from other papers, the description of the lands, the deed was prepared and read over to the grantor, and he was asked if that was the way he desired it. The grantor then signed the deed and directed the notary as follows: \u201cI want you to take that deed and keep it, and after my decease to deliver it to James Latimer.\u201d Something was said regarding a consideration, whereupon the son, James Latimer, in the presence of the notary gave to his father a silver dollar, which the old gentleman laughingly took, making some jocular remark. The deed was taken and retained by the notary public upon the suggestion and request of the grantor, as above stated, Lewis Latimer remarking at the same time that the notary, being a banker, had a safe place or vault in which to keep it. Within less than one year after the execution of this deed and its delivery to Morey, James A. Latimer, the grantee, died, leaving his widow and children, the appellees in this case. Prior to his death he had made some improvements on the farm. He sunk a well at an expense of about \u00a7400, besides which he had furnished lumber, assisted in the work and boarded the men and teams for a number of months while they were engaged in the work. At the time of his death the work of boring the well was not completed, and the widow of James Latimer inquired of Lewis Latimer, who had continued to live with his son and family from the time of the execution of the deed until the death of the son, whether or not she should continue the work. His answer was, \u201cof course,\u201d remarking at the same time that the farm would be hers and the children\u2019s some time, and stating further that he desired her to take care of him, and that he wished the best of care. Before James Latimer died he had borrowed \u00a797 from his father to make payment of some expense on this well. This amount the father, after the death of James Latimer, collected from Mrs. James Latimer. Lewis Latimer, as appears from this record, also told a number of persons that he expected to remain upon the farm where his daughter-in-law and her children, the appellees, were, where he had the best of care, and that the farm would be theirs some time. He also said he intended to leave things as he and his son had arranged them,\u2014that all he wanted was his living. Some few months after the death of James Latimer, however, Lewis Latimer went to Chicago on a visit to one of his daughters, and after remaining a number of months he executed to his two daughters the deed mentioned in the statement herein, attempting, apparently, to revoke the deed which he had made to James Latimer.</p> <p id=\"b428-5\" pgmap=\"428\">A careful consideration of all of this evidence fails to convince us that the deed to James Latimer was obtained by fraud or any undue influence on his part. On the contrary, it seems to have been by premeditation and desire of the grantor that the property in question should be so disposed of. 'The evidence in this record convinces us that his intention was fully carried out by the notary public who prepared the deed at his suggestion, he reserving to himself a life estate and giving to his son, James Latimer, the fee. All of the facts connected with the execution by and turning over of this deed to the notary public, who was a banker, to be kept by him in his safe or vault, with directions to be delivered to the grantee upon the death of the grantor, are conclusive, in law, of the delivery of this deed.</p> <p id=\"b428-6\" pgmap=\"428(191) 429(56)\">The rule is well established in this State that if the grantor, by his act of delivery, loses all control over the instrument by which the grantee is to become possessed of the estate, then there is sufficient delivery. (Bryan v. Wash, 2 Gilm. 557; Shults v. Shults, 159 Ill. 654; Cline v. Jones, 111 id. 563.) The question is to be determined largely by the intention of the grantor, which may be ascertained by his acts and declarations, and by the circumstances attending the execution of the deed and its delivery to a third party. (Masterson v. Cheek, 23 Ill. 72; Walker v. Walker, 42 id. 311; Byars v. Spencer, 101 id. 429.) In the latter case it was said (p. 433): \u201cThe question as to what acts are necessary to constitute a sufficient delivery to render a deed operative and to pass the title to the land has been the subject of much discussion in this court. * * * It may be delivered to the grantee or to his agent. Nor is any particular form or ceremony necessary to constitute a sufficient delivery. It may be by acts or words, or both, or by one without the other, but what is said or done must clearly manifest the intention of the grantor and of the grantee that the deed shall at once become operative to pass the title to the land conveyed, and that the grantor loses all control over it.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b429-5\" pgmap=\"429\">In this case it was attempted on the part of the grantor, Lewis Latimer, to make a voluntary settlement or disposition of his property. The law makes stronger presumptions upon the question of delivery in a case of such character. Such settlements, fairly made, are binding on the grantor. (Reed v. Douthit, 62 Ill. 348; Walker v. Walker, supra; Cline v. Jones, supra; Shults v. Shults, supra.) In all such cases, however, the intention of the grantor is the controlling element. From the evidence presented in this record there can be no question but the grantor, Lewis Latimer, intended to make a voluntary settlement, \u25a0\u2014to devise or deed the land in question to his son. He first had in mind the preparation of a will, and\u201e after-wards desired the execution of the deed in question. Upon the execution of this deed a delivery of it was made to a third person with certain directions as to its delivery after his death, which was sufficient, and resulted in the grantor losing all control over the instrument. We hold, therefore, there was no fraud or undue influence in the procurement of this deed, but it was the deliberate and voluntary act and intention of the grantor. We hold, also, there was a sufficient delivery of the deed to pass the title to the grantee.</p> <p id=\"b429-7\" pgmap=\"429\">The third reason urged by appellants for a reversal of the decree in this cause is, that the deed in question was but a testamentary devise, and contained a clause to the effect that it was to be in force from and after the decease of the grantor, and not before, and that it was therefore void. This involves a question of law, only.</p> <p id=\"b429-8\" pgmap=\"429(19) 430(123)\">Under the statutes of this State livery of seizin is abolished. At common law a freehold estate could not be created to commence in futuro, except where there was a particular estate to support it as a remainder. This was because a charter of feoffment was the only common law instrument for the conveyance of a freehold, and a feoffment was void without livery of seizin, and that ceremony was necessarily performed presently. In this State, by the act of 1827 livery of seizin was abolished, and it was provided, in substance, that every deed or other conveyance should be sufficient without livery of seizin for conveying or transferring lands, so as absolutely and fully to vest in every donee, grantee, bargainee, or purchaser of such estate or estates as should be specified in the deed or other conveyance.</p> <p id=\"b430-5\" pgmap=\"430\">Since the act of the legislature of this State abolishing livery of seizin, the question as to whether or not a deed of conveyance reserving to the grantor a life estate and giving and granting to the grantee an estate in fee is a testamentary devise has been frequently presented. The rule is well established, a conveyance of real estate delivered, but not to take effect or to be recorded until the death of the grantee, is good and valid without the creation of an intermediate estate to support it, and such an instrument cannot be held to be one in the nature of a testamentary devise or disposition of the property.

Munstin, 42 id. 365; Elmore v. Munstin, 28 id. 309; Bryan v. Bradley, 16 Conn. 474; Wall v. Wall, 30 Miss. 91; Cummings v. Cummings, 3 Ga. 468.</p> <p id=\"b430-6\" pgmap=\"430(69) 431(220)\">In the case of Shackelton v. Sebree, supra, the question was fairly presented to this court by a clause reading, \u201cthis deed not to take effect until after my decease,\u2014not to be recorded until after my decease.\u201d The deed was properly executed and delivered. There, as here, the contention was urged that the deed was in the nature of a testamentary devise, and as such was not so executed and authenticated as to become operative and valid. In disposing of that contention it was said (p. 619): \u201cWas this deed void, or did it operate to convey the fee at the death of the grantor? Had he conveyed a life estate to another, or had he conveyed to another to hold in trust for him during his life, then it would have been free from all doubt; or had he, in the same instrument, reserved a life estate to himself, we apprehend that it will be conceded that the title would have passed to the grantee; * * * and had he expressly reserved in this deed a life estate he would have held in the same manner. If, then, in either of these cases the grantor could thus hold the title necessary to support a remainder, why not when, by operation of law and construction of the deed, he holds a life estate in legal effect the same? We are unable to perceive any reason in law or in fact.\u201d And further: \u201cHere the remainder-man was in being, named as grantee, and no reason is seen, since livery of seizin has been abolished, why the fee in remainder did not vest on the delivery of the deed, which has been adopted as a substitute for livery.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b431-5\" pgmap=\"431(174) 432(40)\">In Witham v. Brooner, 63 Ill. 344, it was said (p. 346): \u201cLivery of seizin is abolished by the first section of the Conveyance act, and the title is thereby absolutely vested in the donee, grantee, bargainee, etc., independently of the Statute of Uses. Hence, under this statute a deed in the form of a bargain and sale must be regarded as having the force and effect of a feoffment, and under the Statute of Uses a feoffment to A, for the use of or in trust for B, would pass the leg'al title to B. In a deed purely of bargain and sale, independently of the first section of the Conveyance act, the rule would be different and the title would vest in the bargainee. Without the first section the legal title would be in the trustee in this case; but as the trust was a passive one, the deed operated as a feoffment would at the common law, and vested the legal title in the cestuis que trust by virtue of the Statute of Uses. Thus the statute executes itself. It conveys the possession to the use and transfers the use to the possession, and by force of the statute the cestuis que trust had the lawful seizin, estate and possession.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b432-5\" pgmap=\"432\">It is apparent, therefore, that the deed in question was not a testamentary devise, for the reason it was to be in force and effect after the decease of the grantor, and conveyed to the grantee the fee based upon a life\" estate.</p> <p id=\"b432-6\" pgmap=\"432\">The decree of the circuit court of LaSalle county dismissing appellants\u2019 bill for want of equity is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b432-7\" pgmap=\"432\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
