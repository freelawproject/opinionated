The case, having been remanded, came on to be tried again before the circuit court of Marion county, at the February term, 1876.</p> <p id=\"b42-7\" pgmap=\"42\">By agreement of parties, the cause was submitted to the court for trial without a jury, the issues were found for the plaintiff, and the damages assessed at $2593.85, which was the sum appearing to be due upon the note, supposing there was no deduction to be made on account of usury. The defendants took this appeal from the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b42-8\" pgmap=\"42\">The error assigned is, that the finding of the court was contrary to the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b42-9\" pgmap=\"42\">The court below must have found there was no usury in the first note. ' The evidence upon that subject was contradictory. Without reviewing it, we will say that, after a careful examination of the whole testimony, we can not say that the finding of the court was so palpably against the weight of evidence as to require that it should be disturbed.</p> <p id=\"b42-10\" pgmap=\"42\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b42-11\" pgmap=\"42\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
