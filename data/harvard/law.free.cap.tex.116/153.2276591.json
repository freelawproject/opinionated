It follows that the Court of Civil Appeals had no jurisdiction of the appeal of the plaintiff in error and properly dismissed the appeal. Since the Court of Civil Appeals had no jurisdiction, we have none and the application for writ of error is accordingly dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
