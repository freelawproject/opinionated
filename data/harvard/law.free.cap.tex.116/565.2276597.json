Mrs. W. E. Earnest et al.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b595-5\">Application No. 15329.</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AnM\">Decided June 4, 1927.</decisiondate>\n<citation data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b595-6\">(296 S. W., 1088).</citation>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-12\"><em>E. G. Senter </em>and <em>Bledsoe &amp; Crenshaw, </em>for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-13\">The Honorable Court of Civil Appeals erred in holding that a bill of exceptions properly authenticated by the trial judge and containing a statement of all the testimony on the hearing of the motion for a new trial was insufficient to present the question of error in denying such motion, and that such matter could only be presented by a statement of facts. Vick v. Schaff, 260 S. W., 916; Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Tucker, 183 S. W., 1188; Coalson v. Holmes, 111 Texas, 502; Ayers v. Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co., 116 S. W., 612.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-14\">The Court of Civil Appeals erred in holding that the error of the trial court in overruling a motion for new trial could not be complained of in the appellate court except where the matter was assigned as error in the trial court. Art. 1844, Vernon\u2019s Sayles\u2019 Rev. Stats.; Bayes v. Stowers Furniture Co., 180 S. W., 149; Dees v. Thompson, 166 S. W., 56.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-15\">The court also erred in holding that although the bill of exceptions authenticated by the trial judge set forth the evidence upon the motion for a new trial and contained the recitation that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the bill was embodied all of the evidence heard by the court on the hearing of the motion for new trial, it would be conclusively presumed that the trial court had evidence before it which justified it in finding that appellant and its counsel were guilty of inexcusable negligence in failing to file itis answer in time. Authorities first above cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-3\">It appearing from the allegations of the motion and the evidence introduced upon its hearing that the appellant had in ample time employed an attorney to represent it in said cause and that the failure to file an answer was due to inadvertence and mistake and to the absence of said attorney from his office, and that appellant had a meritorious defense, the Court of Civil Appeals erred in affirming the action of the trial court in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. Evans v. Terrell, 95 S. W., 684; Robinson v. Collier, 115 S. W., 915; Hall v. McConey, 132 S. W., 618; Lewis v. Van Hooser, 227 S.
