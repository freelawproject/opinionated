It was never intended to apply to a case where the description of the county contained in the law authorizing its creation was certain, definite and readily ascertained when applied to objects called for and in no way conflicting with any other line. The line here in question is the true and established line, \u201cestablished\u201d by the law creating Rains County, as well as in the act to conform the boundary of Hunt County thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-4\">The word \u201crecognize\u201d means \u201cto admit; to acknowledge something existing before.\u201d 7 Words &amp; Phrases, p. 6005; 34 Cyc., 573.

This being true, it appears to follow, as night follows the day, that up to 1895, when Art. 1400 (now Art. 1606, R. S., 1925) was incorporated in the statutes of this State, Hunt County was the undoubted, absolute and unqualified owner of the land in controversy. The unauthorized survey of Perry Taylor could not take any part of the territory in question away from Hunt County. Acquiescence in or \u201crecognition\u201d of the line by Hunt County could not take from Hunt County any of its land. A county cannot be made to surrender its territory by mere fact that its officers or citizens acquiesce in an invalid, adverse claim. Marsalis v. Garrison, 27 S. W., 932</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-6\">The holding of the majority that the Legislature can ratify and thereby render valid an illegal Act it cannot now constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>tionally authorize is, it seems to us, fundamentally unsound. The Legislature cannot ratify a former Act where \u201cit has no present authority to authorize like proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-5\">There can be no shadow of legal claim on the part of Rains County to the land in question up to 1895. Rains County having no claim to the land, Hunt County being the undoubted owner of the property, did the Legislature undertake to and did it have the power, in definance of Subd. 3, Sec. 1, Art. 9, of the Constitution of 1876, to \u201cdetach\u201d from Hunt County the territory in question, under the guise of ratifying the unauthorized and illegal survey of Perry Taylor ? It seems clear to us that the Legislature never intended that Act to apply to such a case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-6\"><em>H. D. Garrett, E. D.

The court therefore did not err in submitting the case to the jury and the verdict and judgment are amply sustained by the evidence, even though the surveyor in running said lines in 1870 may have made a mistake and gone further into Hunt County than called for in the original Act establishing Rains County.

The line in controversy is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>west boundary of Rains and the east boundary of Hunt County. Hunt County claimed by its petition that:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">\u201c \u2018For many years there has been a dispute between the plaintiff and defendant as to true location of the boundary line between said counties, the disputed line being mainly the west boundary line of Rains County and that portion of the east boundary line of Hunt County adjoining the same * * *; that the defendant claims that the northwest corner of said Rains County is located about one mile farther west and several hundred feet farther north than the real northwest corner of said county, and that the line runs thence from said point to Hooker\u2019s Mill; that the true boundary line between said counties claimed by plaintiff is as follows: Beginning at the southwest corner of Hopkins County as established by Hiram McMillan on March 4, 1861, a stake from which a P. O. marked S. W. brs. N. 88 E. 395.5 vrs., thence W. at 8 degrees and 55 minutes variation 4 miles to a stake from which a bois d\u2019arc brs. N. 48 W. 474 vrs., this point being 638 vrs.

Perry Taylor, a competent surveyor, and that said Perry Taylor, with the assistance of the commissioners and others, surveyed and ran out the lines of Rains County as provided and directed by the Act, and actually marked and established the lines upon the grounds. * * * That the field notes of Rains County as so laid out and established were returned to the General Land Office on October 21, 1872, by J. W. Mont<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>gomery, who, at the time, was the duly elected and qualified surveyor of Rains County, and are as follows (here follows description) ; that the line so established has since that time been recognized; that the lines so laid out and established in 1870, and as described in the field notes returned to the General Land Office in 1872, is the true boundary line- between said counties; that there has not ever been any controversy as to the location of the boundary lines or any portion of said lines between Hunt and Rains County; that the land contiguous to said line/ etc., has been recognized as the boundary line. The prayer was that \u2018plaintiff take nothing by reason of its suit; that the court enter its decree declaring the boundary line established in 1870 to be the true boundary line between said two counties/</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u201cRains County was created by the Act of 1870, p. 2. Section 1 of the Act reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u201c \u2018That a new county, to be called Rains County, is hereby established out of the following portions of Wood, Hunt, Hopkins and Van Zandt Counties, bounded as follows, viz.: Beginning on the north bank of Sabine River, at Collins Ferry, known as .Mud Bridge, thence in a northern direction through a tract of land known as the Jim Bridges tract, to the McMillan boundary line between Wood and Hopkins Counties, thence west with said line four miles into Hunt County, thence about southwest in a direct line to Hooker\u2019s Mill on the east branch of Sabine River, thence down Sabine River with its meanderings to the place of beginning.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u201cAt the same session of the Legislature the boundaries of Hopkins and Hunt Counties were revised to be in conformity with the field notes of Rains County. Acts 1870, pp. 2 and 42. As revised the southwest corner of Hopkins County was to be on \u2018the north line of Rains County\u2019 at the west end of \u2018the McMillan line.\u2019 As to Hunt County, the second, third and fourth calls were:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\u201c \u2018Thence south to the north line of Rains County; thence with said line west four miles; thence in a southwestern direction to Hooker\u2019s Mill on the East branch of Sabine River.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\u201cThe lines bringing about the suit are the lines defined in the Acts, pertaining to Hunt and Rains Counties, reading:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">\u201c \u2018Thence with said line (referring to the McMillan line at the west end of which is fixed the S.

Prior to the year 1895 had the east boundary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>line of Hunt County, adjoining the west boundary line of Rains County, been surveyed and marked? Answer: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\">\u201c \u2018Question 2. Was said surveying and marking made on the line as alleged by plaintiff or on the line as alleged by the defendant? Answer: Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u201c \u2018Question 3. Prior to the year 1895 had there been any dispute or uncertainty as to location of the east boundary line of Hunt County, adjoining the west boundary line of Rains County. Answer: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u201c \u2018Question 4. Prior to the year 1895 had the said boundary line between the two counties been recognized as a definite line' by the officials of the two counties? Answer: Yes.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u201cThe evidence supports the verdict, and their findings are adopted. Upon this verdict the court entered judgment establishing the boundary line in question, as follows: Beginning at a \u2018stake on the north side of Sabine River near what is known as the old Hooker Mill;\u2019 thence north 15 degrees east to a point in the Wm. P. Buzan survey where a line so run will intersect a line running west from the southwest corner of Hopkins County at the west end of a line known as \u2018the McMillan line.\u2019 The evidence is referred to in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u201cII.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u201cThe commissioners appointed by the Act of 1870 employed, as they were authorized to do, Perry Taylor, a competent surveyor, to run out the boundary lines of Rains County as defined by the Act. In June, 1870, after the Act took effect on June 9, 1870, the surveyor, with the assistance of the commissioners and others, actually surveyed and established on the ground the lines. The markings in respect to the lines, especially the one in controversy, are definite and known objects existing and located on the ground. In fact, there is no dispute about the true location of these objects, and their locality. As to the line in controversy, the commissioners ran the line from the west end of the McMillan line west to a point in the \u2018Wm. P. Buzan survey\u2019 and thence southwest to Hooker\u2019s Mill on the east branch of Sabine River. The McMillan \u2018west end\u2019 is conclusively shown to be on the east line of Hunt County and at the southwest corner of Hopkins County. The postoak tree called for at this point by the McMillan survey is there now, and identified by those competent to testify thereto. It is described as a \u2018postoak marked S. W. and bears N. 88 E. 395.5 vrs.,\u2019 meaning from the west end of the McMillan line and the southwest corner of Hopkins County. The \u2018Wm. P. Buzan Survey\u2019 then existing, and now, is identified and located by those competent to know. \u2018Hooker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Mill,\u2019 on the east branch of Sabine River, is clearly identified and located on the ground. It is the S. W. corner of Rains County, and is an object called for in the Act creating the county. The point established in the \u2018Wm. P. Buzan Survey\u2019 as marked by the commissioners, as the west end of the third call, and as the northwest corner of Rains County, as now develops, actually measures on the ground \u2018into Hunt County,\u2019 as then existing, more than \u2018four miles\u2019 from the west end of the McMillan line or the southwest corner of Hopkins County. It is at least, according to evidence, 4.94 miles distant. The line is extended nearly a mile west beyond the call for distance designated in the Act of 1870. Running the line from the \u2018Buzan Survey\u2019 southwest to \u2018Hooker\u2019s Mill\u2019 would include a wedge-shaped strip of land that would not be within the boundaries defined in the Act creating the county. The lines, and the one in controversy especially, run out and established on the ground by the commissioners in June, 1870, have been \u2018recognized\u2019 and treated as the true boundary lines from that date up to a time just before the institution of this suit in 1923. No proceeding leading to a re-location of the line was had by the commissioners court of either of the counties from the time it was established at a point in the Wm. P. Buzan survey in 1870 until this suit was instituted. The commissioners court of each of the counties officially acted in reference to the line in establishing justice precincts, commissioners\u2019 and voting precincts and school districts, and in laying, out roads. Each county affected, though separately, exercised jurisdiction up to the full limits of the line. Votes cast by the residents along that line were returned and counted by the officers. Jurors were selected with reference to the line. Taxes were rendered and assessed with reference to the line, and the commissioners court approved the tax rolls. Deeds to land were registered and schools were located with reference to the line. The public, too, recognized the line as the boundary line of the counties. The map of Rains County originally made in the General Land Office in 1873 by the Commissioner of the State, and that has been in use in that office from that date to the present time, shows the northwest corner of Rains County to begin in the \u2018Wm. P. Buzan Survey,\u2019 thence east to the southwest corner of Hopkins County, and on to the northeast corner of Rains County. The abstract of land titles authorized by law and published by the General Land Office shows portions of the surveys through which the line passes to be in Rains County, and the other portions of those surveys to be in Hunt County.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201cHI.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u201cQuestion 1. Did this court err in declaring to be the true boundary line, and in directing it to be resurveyed and remarked as such, the boundary line as heretofore established by the commissioners in June, 1870, and from that date to this suit in 1923 recognized by the county officials of both the counties affected as the true boundary line, beginning at the west end of the McMillan line and running west to the \u2018Wm. P. Buzan Survey,\u2019 and thence southwesterly to Hooker\u2019s Mill on the east branch of Sabine River?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u201cThe trial court, in keeping with the facts, determined that the line thus established by the commissioners in 1870 and recognized thereafter was the boundary line between the two counties, and directed it to be relocated and remarked as such. This court in a majority opinion affirmed the trial court\u2019s judg-' ment. All the members of the court cannot agree upon the affirmance of the judgment, and dissent exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u201cQuestion 2. Did the establishment of the line in June, 1870, by the commissioners, at the place done, as the west line of Rains County and the east line of Hunt County, and the subsequent continuous recognition thereof as the boundary line, have, the legal effect of constituting such line, although not in accordance with the call for distance as designated in the Acts creating Rains County and defining the boundaries of Hunt County, the legal boundary line of such counties, in view of Art. 1400, Revised Statutes, reading:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u201c \u2018The county boundaries of the counties in this State as now recognized and established are adopted as the true boundaries of such counties, and the Acts creating such counties and defining the boundaries are continued in force ?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u201cQuestion 3. Can the one county be precluded from asserting in a suit against the other a different boundary line from the one established by the commissioners in June, 1870, and thereafter recognized as the true boundary line up to 1923, either upon the doctrine of estoppel or under the terms of Art. 1385, reading :</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\u201c \u2018Provided, that if _ it be found in any such case that the boundary line in question has been heretofore established under the law then in force, the same shall be declared to be the true line and shall be resurveyed and established as such\u2019 ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">We think the trial court and a majority of the Court of Civil Appeals entered the correct judgment in this cause.. The opinions of the majority and minority of the Court of Civil Appeals will doubtless- be published later. We see no reason to enter into any lengthy discussion of the issues involved in the questions certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Rains County was created by special legislative Act in 1870. Said Act made provision for its organization and for ascertaining, surveying and marking the boundaries <em>on the ground. </em>As stated by the Court of Civil Appeals:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u201cBy the Act five commissioners named herein were expressly given \u2018full powers to organize said county, to employ a competent surveyor to run the lines of said county, and, as early as practicable, to ascertain the center of said county,\u2019 etc.; \u2018and to divide the county into five precincts,\u2019 etc. The running out on the ground of \u2018the lines of said county\u2019 and the partitioning of the territory into precincts are necessary steps in the process of organization of a new county. And \u2018the lines of said county\u2019 enclosed the particular territory set apart to the new county out of the territory of the original counties. The proceedings of the commissioners in establishing the boundaries would not be wholly ex parte on the part of the new county of Rains. In so executing the command of the Legislature the commissioners named in the Act became and were the agents of the Legislature and not of the new county or any of the original counties. The consent neither of Hunt County nor of any of the original counties was necessary in order for the commissioners to run out and mark on the ground \u2018the lines of said county\u2019 defined by the Act, as directed by the Legislature. Hence the acts of the commissioners, being under authority of law, in legal effect would be binding equally on all the counties affected as well as on the public generally, unless in running out the boundaries defined in the Act they failed to place the lines on the ground in a position \u2018sufficiently special and well ascertained\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The lines were run out on the ground and the corners definitely marked and identified. The lines so surveyed were recognized by each county interested from 1870 to 1923. As shown by the facts in this record, no attempt within any reasonable time was made by Hunt County to set aside the survey as made on the ground. If Hunt County had felt that the lines as surveyed on the ground were not \u201csufficiently special and well ascertained,\u201d she could have had resort to the statutory method in such cases provided. In this connection, we quote again from the Court of Civil Appeals:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u201cAnd under the general statutory law in force it was only in case the method of surveying on the ground by the commissioners was such as not to place the line or lines on the ground, in the first instance, in a position \u2018sufficiently special and well ascertained,\u2019 that the county or counties interested could resort to the general statutory method of having the true line run out again and marked anew on the ground by joint surveys made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>by surveyors respectively representing the counties. Article 1057, P. D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\">The Legislature, in 1870, had the absolute right to fix or change county boundaries. This is conceded. Having provided for a laying out of the lines <em>on the ground, </em>and such lines having been <em>recognized </em>for more than fifty years by the counties involved as well as by the State of Texas, it must be held that the lines established by such survey were the true boundary lines between the counties, even though an error was made in one call. If a divisional line between the land of two private parties had been fixed on the ground by a surveyor appointed by the parties interested for that purpose, and his line as surveyed had been recognized by the parties for fifty years, it would be held that it was, according to the very intention of the parties, the true line from the beginning. We think no different rule should apply as between counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Therefore, we recommend that the first question certified be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">It is probably unnecessary, in view of aforesaid answer, to recommend an answer to either of the other questions certified. We shall not recommend any answer to the third one.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The second question certified refers to the curative Act of 1895, known as Art. 1400 of the Revised Statutes, and quotes from said article. That such article, if <em>constitutional, </em>corrects the irregularity in marking the original line in 1870 between these two counties is conceded by all the judges of the Court of Civil Appeals. But, Justice Hodges thinks such Act is unconstitutional, because it, in effect, applied to the case at bar, changes the boundaries of a county and detaches a part of its territory without the consent of such county. In that connection, he quotes the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u201cNo part of any existing county shall be detached from it and attached to another existing county until the proposition for such change shall have been submitted in such manner as may be provided by law to a vote of the electors of both counties, and shall have received a majority of those voting on the question in each.\u201d See Art. 9, Sec. 1, Constitution of the State of Texas, 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">In its opinion on rehearing, the majority of the Court of Civil Appeals treats this matter as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">\u201cNecessarily any legal objection, as urged, to the application of the article to the facts must rest, we think, upon the ground alone that the act of the commissioners in establishing the lines was of absolute invalidity, and not an act imperfectly done under authority. For if the act of the commissioners in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>establishing the line, as done, was merely an irregularity or imperfectness in executing the previous legislative authority to lay out \u2018the lines of said county,\u2019 then, in that case, the application of the curative statute would not be of the same import as conferring original authority upon the commissioners, never granted in the first instance. It is only in case the act of the commissioners could be said to be of absolute invalidity that the application of the curative statute, although relating to the time of doing the act, would be of the same import as conferring original authority upon the commissioner, having origin at the time of the passage of the curative law. In the latter case only would the limitation upon the present power of the Legislature to change county lines be applicable. Sykes v. Mayor and Aldermen of Columbus, 55 Miss., 115; Swartz v. Borough of Carlisle, 85 Atl., 847; Katzenberger v. City of Aberdeen, 121 U. S., 172, 30 L. Ed., 911; see 15 C. J., Sec. 28, p. 405. As determined in the original opinion, the article would be applicable to the present case and would not be subject to the constitutional objection, \u2018since the act of the commissioners in fixing the particular line on the ground, as done, was a mere irregularity in executing the powers conferred, and not of absolute invalidity, as independent of any legislative authority to lay out \u2018the lines of said county.\u2019 The commissioners appointed in 1870 had express legislative authority \u2018to divide the county into five precincts\u2019 and to run out on the ground \u2018the lines of said county.\u2019 In so executing the command of the Legislature the commissioners actually surveyed out the boundary lines on the ground and established them, but fixed the corner of the third call in the \u2018Wm. P. Buzan survey,\u2019 actually measuring, as later developed, \u20184.94 miles,\u2019 instead of \u2018four miles,\u2019 west of the S. W. corner of Hopkins County. This particular error of distance was occasioned, as we must assume, merely by mismeasurement on the ground. A mistake did not occur in the first and second calls, nor in the fourth call except so far as the consequence of beginning that call in the \u2018Wm. P. Buzan Survey.\u2019 Therefore, although the location of the corner of the third call at that point was erroneous in fact, yet it was purely the result of measurement on the ground, imperfectly done under authority to establish on the ground \u2018the lines of said county.\u2019 The lines so \u2018established\u2019 in 1870 were \u2018recognized\u2019 as the county boundaries for years afterward, not as established independent of any legislative authority, but as established in pursuance of legislative authority conferred upon the commissioners to do so in the manner done. According to the terms of Article 1400, the \u2018Act\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>creating the county in the first instance is \u2018continued in force\u2019 without re-defining the\" boundaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">We think this Act, as applied to the case at bar, is constitutional. We agree with the majority of the ' Court of Civil Appeals in this conclusion. The most that can be said in favor of Hunt County is that an error in surveying was made. An irregularity in one detail in exercising the general authority under the Act creating Rains County had occurred. Such irregularity was cured by the Act in question, and that Act but gave legislative approval to the acquiescence and recognition of the parties themselves of the lines as established in 1870. It did not detach any land from Hunt County which belonged to it. It merely gave final validity to the attempted exercise of authority conferred in 1870, and which attempted exercise thereof, even though erroneous in one respect, had been recognized by Hunt County from 1870 to 1895, when the curative Act was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We recommend that the second question certified be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering certified questions is adopted and ordered certified to the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\"><em>C.
