No bill of sale for any of the automobiles and no transfer of license fee receipt was filed with the tax collector. The Fidelity Union Fire Insurance Company issued to the said motor company an insurance policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>insuring the motor company against loss of said automobiles by fire. The automobiles were subsequently destroyed by fire, while in the possession of the motor company, and this suit was brought on said policy by the First State Bank of O\u2019Donnell, to whom the policy had been assigned by the motor company after the fire occurred. The Court of Civil Appeals for the Seventh District, in which the case is pending on appeal, has here presented certified questions, which should be answered as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\">The failure of the O\u2019Donnell Motor Company to demand and receive the tax collector\u2019s receipt for the license fee issued for the second-hand automobiles for the year that they were bought, as prescribed by Art. 1617%e of Vernon\u2019s Ann. Penal Code, Supp. 1922, or to file with the tax collector bills of sale covering the sale of the automobiles to the motor company, in accordance with the provisions of Art. 1617%f, Vernon\u2019s Ann. Penal.Code, Supp. 1922, did not operate to render void the sale of said automobiles to the O\u2019Donnell Motor Company. The sale, notwithstanding the requirements of said statutes were not fulfilled, had effect to invest the O\u2019Donnell Motor Company with ownership of said automobiles. The fact that the requirements of said statutes were not observed in the sale of the automobiles to said motor company will not defeat a recovery on the insurance policy sued on. Hennessey v. Automobile Owners Assn., 282 S. W., 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering the certified questions is adopted and ordered certified to the Court of Civil, Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><em>C.
