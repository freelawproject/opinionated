Plaintiff in error could not be heard to challenge the right of the court to determine the issue made by a plea of privilege and a controverting affidavit, after entering into an agreement in writing that the court should vacate a certain judgment against him, and thereafter hear and determine the question presented by the plea and the controverting affidavit thereto. Motion for rehearing is therefore overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
