And said Lakeside Company has so extended its canals and its pumping capacity as to enable it to irrigate this last named acreage and it plans and is now engaged in preparation for the irrigation season of 1924, to take and use and appropriate water to irrigate as much as twenty thousand (20,000) acres of land, though, in point of fact, its water rights are limited as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\u201c \u2018Plaintiff further alleges that notwithstanding the defendant Garwood Company has no right to take water from the Colorado River for irrigation purposes for a greater area of land than above stated, that nevertheless it did, in the year 1923, take water from the Colorado River, and appropriate same to the irrigation of more than seven thousand five hundred (7,500) acres of land, or nearly three (3) times the volume of water that it was entitled to take. And said Garwood Company has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>so extended its canals and its pumping capacity as to enable it to irrigate this last named acreage, and it plans and is now engaged in preparations for the irrigating season of 1924, to again take and use and appropriate water to irrigate as much as ten thousand (10,000) acres of land, though in point of fact, its water rights are limited as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u201c \u2018Fifth.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u201c \u2018Plaintiffs further allege that the intakes of the plaintiff companies, and the points of diversion from which they take water from the river, for the purpose of applying same to the lands upon their canals, are in Matagorda County, Texas, and that the lands watered by them through their canals are all in Matagorda County, Texas, and that these lands and canals and points of diversion are more than thirty (30) miles below the pumping plants and points of diversion of the defendant companies in Colorado County, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\u201c \u2018Plaintiffs further aver that both themselves and the defendant divert and use water solely for the irrigation of rice, which is the only crop which can be profitably irrigated by any of the parties hereto. That the irrigation season for rice begins about the 1st of May of each year, and the rice crop reaches its maximum requirements during June, July and August. That normally these last three months are the dry season in Texas, and in normal years the flow of the Colorado River and the volume of water therein available for irrigation is often lower during these months than during other periods of the year. That since it is necessary for all rice irrigators to take water during this period, the uses of all the companies plaintiff and defendant herein require them to draw upon this volume of water during this same period. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\u201c \u2018Sixth.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u201c \u2018Plaintiffs further aver that the volume of water in the Colorado River, at and below Columbus, in Colorado County, Texas, during normal years, is not sufficient to water in excess of sixty thousand (60,000) acres. That there are many years in which, due to drought and meagre rainfall, this volume of water will not be sufficient to irrigate more than half of such acreage, and they aver that the volume of water in said river, which reached Matagorda County, and was available for their uses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>in the \"season of 1923, was not sufficient to irrigate as much as thirty-five thousand (35,000) acres. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u201c \u2018That if the defendants are permitted to take the volume of water in 1924 that they did take in 1923, or are permitted to take any volume of water from the river in excess of the amount that they have the right to take under their appropriation, and uses, they will be taking water that does not belong to them, to which they have no right, and water that is covered by the appropriations owned and controlled by the plaintiffs, and that they will thus deprive the plaintiffs of a part of their fixed and vested water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u201c \u2018Seventh.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201c \u2018The plaintiffs allege that they and their predecessors in title have made vast improvements, and investments in canal plants, canal systems and equipment, and plans for irrigating large areas of land in Matagorda County, these improvements and expenditures amounting to in excess of one million (\u00a1\u00a1&gt;1,000,-000.00) dollars. That they have at this large expense and after years of effort built up large and successful irrigation systems. That the defendants, because of their position on the river, are able to divert and take such volumes of water as they will, regardless of the rights of these plaintiffs, and that in taking and appropriating such excess volumes of water as they did during the year 1923, they thus deprive these plaintiffs of water to which plaintiffs were entitled, and caused a shortage and loss of crops upon plaintiffs\u2019 canals.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u201c \u2018Eighth.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\u201c \u2018Plaintiffs aver that so long as these defendants continue their wrongful diversion of this volume of water to which they are not entitled, that these plaintiffs and their water users and water tenants are without remedy and are wholly at the mercy of the defendants. That if the water supply runs low during June, July and August, the defendants will, without regard to any limitation upon their rights, take all of the water that they want, depleting the volume that should come down to these plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs are wholly without remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\u201c \u2018That when such wrongful excess taking occurs, or is about to occur, the plaintiffs will have no remedy. If they should file a bill for a temporary injunction, and take testimony at a hearing, such delay would be ruinous, for it often happens during this critical season that a rice crop will be destroyed by heat and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>drought in a single week, sometimes in a shorter period. And if these plaintiffs should await the time of such unlawful and excess is about to occur, or is in progress, and seek to restrain the defendants at such time, they would be without efficient remedy, for it would happen that while the parties litigated, the rice crops upon the plaintiffs\u2019 canals would be destroyed, while those of the defendants would have been saved, with water that should have been left unmolested to reach the plaintiffs\u2019 canals. And the plaintiffs and their water tenants would be without remedy at law, and would be put to burdensome and expensive litigation from year to year.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u201c \u2018Ninth.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u201c \u2018Plaintiffs aver that as the owner of said canal systems in Matagorda County, Texas, and because of their appropriations and uses and water rights aforesaid, they are entitled to have the volume of water necessary to irrigate the acreage aforesaid come down to them, and to their plants, and intakes, and canals undiminished by the wrongful taking and diversion by the defendants or either of them of .the water to which they are not'entitled, and that the continuous wrongful taking of these defendants as aforesaid, situated as they are upstream, and with the power to take what they will is a constant menace and threat of damage to these plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u201c \u2018Tenth.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u201c \u2018The plaintiff, Markham Irrigation Company, is the owner of large bodies of land upon its canals, and all of the plaintiffs have numerous water tenants along and upon their canals, to whom they furnish water for irrigation from year to year, and the plaintiffs because of the appropriations and uses, have acquired the right to have the volume of water to which they are entitled flow down the river to their intakes, and into their canals, and this right, privilege and franchise inheres and is part of their canal systems, in the lands bordering upon their canals. The continued invasion of these rights by the defendants and the threatened invasion thereof in the ensuing year and in years to come is a constant menace, and cloud upon the rights and title of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">\u201c \u2018Eleventh.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">\u201c \u2018Wherefor, premises considered, plaintiffs pray that the defendants be cited as required by law in such cases, and upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>hearing hereof, that the plaintiffs have judgment fixing and establishing their water rights, as aforesaid, and that it be decreed that the defendants are not entitled to take volumes of water in excess of their rights, as stated in paragraph 3 hereof, and that the plaintiffs and each of them have judgment removing cloud from the title to the water rights, and privileges, occasioned by the continuous invasion, trespass and threatened invasions and trespasses of the defendants, and for an injunction perpetually restraining the defendants and each of them from taking any water in excess of their rights, during the months of May to August, inclusive, of each year, and for such other relief, both general and special, as the plaintiffs are entitled to have, both in law and equity.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">\u201cEach of the defendants filed and presented in due time a plea of privilege to be sued in Colorado County, where each has its domicile. Each of these pleas contained all statutory requirements, and in addition thereto, the plea of the Garwood Irrigation Company alleges that it has a permit to do business in Texas, and that its office and agency for the State of Texas is at Gar-wood, in Colorado County, and that it has never had an office or agency or done business' elsewhere in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u201cIn controverting affidavits, presented by plaintiffs, they claim venue in Matagorda County on the following grounds: (1) Under Sec. 24, Art. 1830, of Vernon\u2019s Sayles\u2019 Civil Statutes* on the ground that the damage caused plaintiffs\u2019 lands and crops in Matagorda County by the alleged wrongful taking of the water by the defendants in Colorado County was an essential part of plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action, and, each of plaintiffs and defendants being a corporation, the suit could be brought in Matagorda County. (2) Under Sec. 14 of said statute, on the ground that the suit is, in effect, one to quiet title and prevent injury to land in Matagorda County, and therefore the suit was properly brought in that county. (3) Under Sec. 9 of said statute, on the ground that the alleged wrongful act of each of the defendants was a trespass committed in Matagorda County, and, under the section cited, venue was properly laid in that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u201cIn addition to these grounds, plaintiffs controverted the plea of Garwood Irrigation Company on the further ground that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action accrued in Matagorda County and that the Garwood Company, being a foreign corporation, could be sued in Matagorda County, under Sec. 28, of said statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u201cOn the hearing in the court below, both pleas of privilege were overruled. From the conclusions of fact and law filed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the trial judge, at the request of appellants, it appears that the court sustained all of the grounds of venue asserted in appellees\u2019 controverting affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u201cAt a former day of the present term of this court we affirmed the judgment of the trial court, overruling appellants\u2019 pleas of privilege to be sued in the county of their domicile. On motion for rehearing appellants ask that in event we decline to grant the motion, we certify to your honorable court for decision the question of whether the district court of Matagorda County was authorized to overrule the pleas of privilege upon any of the grounds upon which its judgment is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u201cBecause no writ of error will lie from our judgment, and the final disposition of the case will be facilitated and made less burdensome to the litigants by a prompt and final determination of the question of venue, we grant appellants\u2019 request and respectfully certify for your decision the following questions: First: Does plaintiffs\u2019 petition allege a cause of action for injury or damage to land and crops in Matagorda County caused by the wrongful acts of the defendants, which will entitle plaintiffs to maintain this suit in that county under Sec. 24, Art. 1830, Vernon\u2019s Sayles\u2019 Civil Statutes? Second: Do the alleged wrongful acts and claims of the defendants so affect the title to plaintiffs\u2019 lands in Matagorda County as to entitled them to maintain this suit in said county under Sec. 14 of the Article of the statute before cited? Third: Is the suit maintainable in Matagorda County under Sec. 9 of said Article on the ground that the alleged wrongful acts of defendants was a trespass committed in Matagorda County? Fourth: Is the suit maintainable in Matagorda County against the appellant Garwood Irrigation Company under Sec. 28 of the statute above cited?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The second question refers to subdivision or section 14 of Article 1830 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas of 1911, reading as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u201c14. Suits concerning lands. \u2014 Suits for the recovery of lands or damages thereto, suits to remove incumbrances upon the title to land, suits to quiet the title to land, and suits to prevent or stay waste on lands, must be brought in the county in which the land, or a part thereof, may live.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The District Court sustained venue of this suit in Matagorda County, where the land is situated. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed that holding in the very able opinion by Chief Justice Pleasants. We have carefully reviewed his opinion and the authorities cited by him and have reached the conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the Court of Civil Appeals correctly decided this question. We feel that we can do no better than quote from that opinion in answering the second question certified. Such quotation is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">\u201cIn an able brief, appellants vigorously assail all of the conclusions of law upon which, the judgment of the trial court is based, and further contend that the evidence is insufficient to sustain appellees\u2019 claim that defendants are taking or threatening to take more water from the Colorado River than their permit authorizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u201cThe first proposition presented by appellants\u2019 brief assails the judgment on the ground that this is primarily a suit for injunction, and any question involving title to (or) injury to lands in Matagorda County is merely collateral to the granting of relief sought which, if granted, will operate primarily upon the person. of the defendants and therefore, under Article 4653, Vernon\u2019s Say les\u2019 Civil Statutes, the suit must be brought in the county of defendants\u2019 domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u201cIf the suit which seeks to establish plaintiffs\u2019 rights to water from the Colorado River for the operation of their irrigation system and the irrigation of their lands adjacent thereto in Matagorda County and to determine the legality of acts or claims of defendants, which deny and impair plaintiffs\u2019 rights as appropriators of the waters of the river, can be regarded as a suit to remove cloud and quiet plaintiffs\u2019 title to land in Matagorda County, the injunction, while essential and necessary to the full preservation of plaintiffs\u2019 right, is only auxiliary to plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action, and the statute cited by appellants is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u201cThe question has never been decided in this state but has frequently been passed upon by the courts of other states, and it has been generally held that a suit of this character is in its nature a suit to quiet title to land and must be brought in the jurisdiction in which the land is situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u201cWe think this is a sound conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 right to the water flowing through their canals obtained under their permits from the State is in its nature real estate, such right being appurtenant to the land is a part of the freehold and the title thereto passes and is inseparably connected with the title to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u201cIn the case of American Etc. Company vs. Mercedes Plantation Company, 155 S. W., 293, the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth District says: \u2018The right of an abutting land owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>to receive water from appellant is as complete and definite as his right of possession. It is an incorporeal hereditament- as inseparable from the land as any other quality of title.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u201cIt is true that the court in the case cited was speaking of the rights of a land owner other than the Irrigation Company, but we can see no sound reason for any distinction in the nature and quality of the right acquired under our irrigation statute by the Irrigation Company and that acquired by the individual owner of lands adjoining the irrigation canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u201cIn Long on Irrigation, page 297, the law is thus stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u201c \u2018In its nature, a water right or an interest in a water right and ditch is real estate, and a perpetual right to have a certain quantity of water flow through an irrigating ditch is a freehold estate. So, also, the right of a riparian proprietor, as such, to the use of water flowing by his land, is \u201cidentified with the realty, and is a real and corporeal hereditament.\u201d And the right of an irrigation company to have the water flow in the stream to the head of its ditch is an incorporeal hereditament appurtenant to the ditch, and is co-extensive with the right to the ditch itself. Further, it has been held that the right to take or divert water from the land of another constitutes an easement.\u2019 Many cases are cited in support of the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\u201cThe cases cited are largely, if not entirely, from Western States in which irrigation companies have been operating for a number of years under irrigation statutes similar to ours by which they obtain permits to take waters from the rivers. The cases fully sustain the rule announced by Mr. Long and there is nothing in our statutes which calls for the application of a different rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 right to have the water, to which they are entitled under their grants from the State, flow into their canals and ditches and upon their lands in Matagorda County is so identified with the realty as to become a part thereof, and the alleged wrongful acts of the defendants in preventing this flow is a direct injury to plaintiffs\u2019 land and a denial of their title which is thereby clouded, and plaintiffs\u2019 suit to establish their rights and title and silence the claims of the defendants asserted through their alleged wrongful acts is in its nature and effect a suit to remove cloud and quiet title, the venue of which is fixed by our statute in the county in which the land is situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">\u201cIn the case of Conant et al. v. Deep Creek Irrigation Co., 23 Utah, 627, 66 Pac., 188, the Supreme Court of Utah, in passing upon the question of the jurisdiction of the courts of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>state to determine the title and right to the use of water of an interstate stream for irrigating lands in another State, says:</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">\u201c \u2018An action therefore to quiet the title and determine and establish the right to divert and use water for such purposes is in the nature of an action to quiet title to real estate and must be commenced and prosecuted in the courts of the state in which the same is situated.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u201cThe opinion further holds:</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u201c \u2018It is a recognized rule of law that a person who has appropriated water at a certain point in a stream is entitled to have so much of the waters of said stream as he has appropriated flow down to him to the point of diversion; and if the settlers higher up on the stream, in another state, whose appropriations are subsequent, divert any of the waters of the stream which have been so first appropriated, then the courts of the latter state will protect the first settler in his rights. Howell v. Johnson (C. C.), 89 Fed., 556.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u201cThe fact that the question ip the case cited was the juris die-' tion of the courts of one state of a cause of action arising from wrongful acts committed by defendants in another state does not militate against the application of the holding to the question of venue of courts of different counties in the same State. The holding, that the right to the water was an appurtenance to the land and a part of the realty, and that a suit to establish and determine such right and prevent its impairment was in its nature a suit to quiet the title to land, was the basis upon which the jurisdiction of the state in which the land was situated was placed. If the holding as to the nature of the suit is sound, and as before said we think it is, the venue of appellees\u2019 suit must be held to be in Matagorda County.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u201cThe following quotation from the opinion of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth District, in the case of Rickey Land and Cattle Co. v. Miller &amp; Lux, 152 Fed., 11, shows how uniformly the courts have held that a water right of the kind involved in this suit is real property, and that a suit involving the title to such right is a suit affecting the title to land:</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u201c \u2018A water course consists of bed, banks and water.\u2019 Angel on Water Courses, Sec. 4. The right of plaintiff, as stated in its complaint, to have the water flow in the river to the head of its ditch, is an incorporeal hereditament appertaining to its water course. Granting that plaintiff does not own the corpus of the water until it shall enter its ditch, yet the right to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>it flow into the ditch appertains to the ditch. Real property consists of land, that which is affixed to land, and that which is incidental or appurtenant to land. Civil Code, 658. If the water course, consisting of the bed and banks of the trench, and of the water therein, be real property, the right to have water flow to it is incidental and appurtenant thereof.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\">\u201c \u2018And, generally, it is held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u201c \u2018The right of the prior appropriator to have the water flow in the stream to the head of his ditch is an incorporeal hereditament appurtenant to his ditch, and co-extensive with his right to the ditch itself.\u2019 Willey v. Decker, 73 Pac., 210, 225, 11 Wyo., 496, 100 Am. St. Rep., 939; Smith v. Denniff, 60 Pac., 398, 24 Mont., 20, 81 Am. St. Rep., 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u201c \u2018Or, putting it in another form that:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u201c \u2018A right to divert and use the water of a stream, acquired by appropriation, is a hereditament appurtenant to the land for the benefit of which the appropriation is made.\u2019 Conant v. Deep Creek &amp; Curlew Val. Irr. Co., 66 Pac., 188, 23 Utah, 627, 90 Am. St. Rep., 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u201c \u2018See, also, Simmons v. Winters, 21 Or., 35, 27 Pac., 7, 28 Am. St. Rep., 727; Hindman v. Rizor, 21 Or., 112, 27 Pac., 13; Bear Lake <em>&amp; </em>River Waterworks &amp; Irrigation Co. v. Ogden City, 8 Utah, 494, 33 Pac., 135; Tucker v. Jones, 8 Mont., 225, 19 Pac., 571; Sweetland v. Olsen, 11 Mont., 27, 27 Pac., 339; Cave v. Crafts, 53 Cal., 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u201c \u2018So it follows, as a deduction from these principles, as was said in the Conant case, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">\u201c \u2018An action, therefore, to quiet the title and determine and establish the right to divert and use water for such purposes, is in the nature of an action to quiet the title to real estate.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">\u201cWe think it clear that if our conclusion as to the nature and purpose of appellees\u2019 suit is correct, it necessarily follows that the injunctive relief sought is auxiliary to the main purpose of the suit, and the prayer for such relief does not bring the suit within the purview of Art. 4653 of the statute before cited, requiring suits for injunction to be brought in the county <em>of </em>the defendant\u2019s residence or domicile. The District Court of Matagorda County, having jurisdiction to determine and' establish plaintiffs\u2019 title to the water, claimed by them, and to quiet plaintiffs\u2019 title and right thereto, it also acquired jurisdiction of the defendants and was authorized to issue any writ necessary to accomplish the purpose of the suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">Believing that the court, in the opinion quoted, has already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>correctly answered its own question No. 2 in the affirmative, we recommend that it be answered by the Supreme Court in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Having held the jurisdiction of this cause in Matagorda County for the reason already stated, the Court of Civil Appeals expressly pretermitted a decision upon the other alleged grounds of jurisdiction in that county. For the same reason, we think it unnecessary for us to recommend answers to any of the other questions certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">But, we do believe, and therefore recommend, that questions one and four should be answered in the affirmative. We express no opinion whatever as to how the third question certified should be answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Our answers to the first arid fourth questions are based upon the theory that corporations, domestic or foreign, with permits to do business in Texas, are suable in any county where \u201cthe cause of action, or a part thereof, arose.\u201d See Subdivisions 24 and 28 of Article 1830, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">We think it clear that at least a part of this cause of action arose in Matagorda County. A case very much in point, its nature and result, will be seen from the following quotation from the brief filed in the Court of Civil Appeals for appellees:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u201cDesert Irrigation Co. et al. v. McIntyre et al., 16 Utah, 398, 52 Pac., 628. An action was brought in Millard County to determine the rights of plaintiffs and defendants to waters of the Sevier River flowing between a certain dam in Sanpete County and the canals of the plaintiffs in Millard County, and for a perpetual injunction to prohibit defendants from using or in any manner interfering with the use of the water to which plaintiffs were entitled. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the court in Millard County did not have proper jurisdiction, which motion was sustained. On the appeal of the case the defendants insisted that the case should have been brought in Sanpete County, where the alleged wrongful acts were committed, citing a constitutional provision of that state which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u201c \u2018That all civil and criminal business arising in any county must be tried in such county, unless a change of venue was taken, in such cases as may be provided by law.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u201cOn appeal the appellants insisted that this action was properly brought in Millard County, because the dam and ditches of the plaintiff and land to be irrigated by the dams and ditches were situated in that county, and this regardless of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>that the principal place of business and residence of the defendants and their dams and ditches were in the County of Sanpete. It was the further contention of the appellees that the cause of action set up consisted of certain trespasses on real property situated in Sanpete County.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u201cThe higher court reversed and remanded the case in part in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u201c \u2018As has been seen, it is the settled law of this State, both by constitutional provision and judicial construction, that every suit must be brought in the county in which the cause of action arose. Therefore when, in a case like the one at bar, the plaintiff bases his right to recover on certain material facts, some of which arose in one county and some in another, all of which being essential to his right, the important question is, where did the cause of action arise? * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u201c \u2018All wrongs are regarded as merely a privation of right, and the natural remedy is to put the injured party in the same position as he was before the wrong was committed. This may be effected by making restitution of the subject-matter in dispute or by making pecuniary satisfaction in damages. An inchoate right to receive satisfaction accrues to an injured party the moment he receives a wrongful injury, though the damages may not be fully ascertained, - until determined by the intervention of law by action brought for that purpose. The term \u2018action\u2019 is defined to be \u2018the lawful demand of one\u2019s right.\u2019 3 Bl. Comm., 116. Where, therefore, a wrong has been committed by one person, and injury has resulted, as a sequence, to another, the injured party has a lawful demand against the wrongdoer. <em>If the injury be to real property, as a trespass, or waste, or the like, an action therefor will be local, and the plaintiff must declare his injury to have happened in the county and place where it did actually happen </em>(italics ours) ; and if the acts which caused the injury in one county were committed in another, or if the cause of action consists of two or more material facts, which arose in different counties, the venue at common law may be laid in either. 3 Bl. Comm., 294, and note 3; Com. Dig., 263, note 11; 1 Chit. Pl., 268, 269; Sutton v. Clarke, 6 Taunt., 29. * * * The general doctrine at common law, no doubt, is that an action for injury to real property, as trespass, or case for nuisance, is local, and must be commenced within the county or district in which the land lies. Where, however, an act has been committed in one county or district, which caused injury to realty in another, suit may be brought in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>either. In such case the cause of action may be said to have arisen in either county. In Gould, Pl. p. 105, Sec. 108, referring to actions local, the author says: \u2018If, however, a tortious act, committed in one county, occasions damage to land or any other local subject, situate in another, an action for the injury thus occasioned may be laid in either of the two counties, at the choice of the party injured. Thus, if, by the diversion or obstruction of a water course in the county of A, damage is done to lands, mills, or other real property in the county of B, the party injured may lay his action in either of those two counties.\u2019 In Bulwer\u2019s Case (7 Coke, 2b), the law on this subject is stated thus: \u2018When one matter in one county is depending upon the matter in another county, there the plaintiff may choose in which county he will bring his action. * * * In all cases where the action is founded upon two things done in several counties, and both are material or traversable, and the one without the other doth not maintain the action, there the plaintiff may choose to bring his action in which of the counties he will.\u2019 Among the examples given in the case is this: \u2018If a man doth not repair a wall in Essex, which he ought to repair, whereby my land in Middlesex is drowned, I may bring my action in Essex, for there is the default, as is adjudged in 7 Hen., 4, pl. 8, or I may bring it in Middlesex, for there I have the damage.\u2019 So in Barden v. Crocker, 10 Pick., 390, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts said: \u2018And the second point is equally clear for the plaintiff. He may unquestionably maintain his action in either county \u2014 in Bristol, where the obstruction was raised, as well as in Plymouth, where the injury was sustained.\u2019 28 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Enc. Law, 225-227; Lower Kings River Water-Ditch Co. v. Kings River &amp; Fresno Canal Co., 60 Cal., 408; Foot v. Edwards, 9 Fed. Cas., 358 (No. 4908); Thayer v. Brooks, 17 Ohio, 489, 49 Am. Dec., 474; Oliphant v. Smith, 3 Penn. <em>&amp; </em>W., 180; Marshall v. Hosmer, 3 Mass., 23. Some of the decisions hold that, in cases of this character the action must be brought in the county or state where the resulting injury occurred. Thompson v. Crocker, 9 Pick., 59; Eachus v. Trustees, 17 Ill., 534; Thorn v. Maurer, 85 Mich., 569, 48 N. W., 640 Deacon v. Shreve, 23 N. J. Law, 204. While these cases do not militate against, but support, the venue as laid in the case at bar, still we are of the opinion that the doctrine hereinbefore stated is decidedly supported by the weight of authority; and this case comes clearly within that doctrine, as will appear from an examination of the facts.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">\u201c \u2018Neither the facts relating to the diversion alone, nor those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>relating to the injury alone, are sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendants. This is so, because' the mere construction of dams and ditches in Sanpete County, or even the diversion of the water from the river, gave the plaintiffs no right to complain, so long as the water to which they were entitled was not diverted thereby. Likewise, as to the injury, unless it were shown that it was caused by the wrongful acts of the defendants. Thus it is plain that some of the material facts arose in Sanpete County and some in Millard County, and the cause of action may properly be said to have arisen in each county. Therefore the plaintiffs had the right to elect in which they would bring their action, and having chosen to bring it in Millard County, where a part of that which is essential to their right to recover took place the venue was properly laid.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">It seems clear to us that \u201cin cases of this kind where the wrongful act is begun in one county and consummated in another, the suit may be prescribed in either county at the election of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Our own State has not had irrigation laws for any great length of time. We have but few, if any, cases in the Texas appellate courts upon certain rights of this nature. We are much impressed, therefore, by the following statement in the brief for appellees just referred to by us:</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u201cThe court must be impressed with the fact that the decisions from the Western States cited are well thought out and carefully expressed. They represent the learning of the judiciary of those States from which our water laws come, and we cannot ignore the construction of these statutes in the jurisdictions where they were first written and where experience has dictated their meaning and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Therefore, as already stated, we recommend that the first, second- and fourth questions certified each be answered in the affirmative and that the third question before us remain unanswered.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering certified question is adopted and ordered certified to the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\"><em>C. M. Cureton, </em>Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
