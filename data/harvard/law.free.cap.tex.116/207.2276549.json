It cannot be said for a minute that any other than Mr. Anderson was the sole representative, with full and plenary power to represent the appellant, and under the above facts, as we view it, the knowledge is not only brought home to the appellant, but it, by and through its authorized representatives, recklessly and maliciously discharged the duty in such a manner as to make it gross negligence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b238-6\">Mr. Judge NICKELS</author>\n<p id=\"Aly\">delivered the opinion of the Commission of Appeals, Section A.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Mrs. Bob Williams, widow of Bob Williams, brought the suit against Chronister Lumber Company, a corporation, and sought recovery of exemplary damages upon allegations that his death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>was caused by the gross negligence of the corporation (his employer). The matter of compensatory damages is not, presently, involved. From a judgment allowing that recovery, Chronister Lumber Company prosecuted its appeal and the case is now pending in the Court of Civil Appeals, Ninth District. That court has certified questions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><em>\u201cQuestion One: </em>Can the gross negligence of the woods foreman, Harris Anderson, be imputed to appellant, thereby making appellant guilty of gross negligence and liable in exemplary damages to appellee?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\"><em>\u201cQuestion Two: </em>Can the gross negligence of Harris Anderson be imputed to appellee\u2019s manager, S. W. Littlejohn, whom he represented and whose authority Anderson exercised in Little-john\u2019s absence, and, through Littlejohn, to appellant, making it guilty of gross negligence, and thereby liable to appellee in exemplary damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\"><em>\u201cQuestion Three: </em>Did Littlejohn occupy such a relation to appellant as to make it liable in exemplary damages for his gross negligence, and, through him, liable for the gross negligence of the foreman, Harris Anderson, who exercised his authority in his absence, in the particular field of his employment \u2014 that is, as woods foreman?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\"><em>\u201cQuestion Four: </em>In Railway Company v. Cowser, 57 Texas, 306, you said: \u2018Exemplary damages are allowed only for the wilful act, omission or gross negligence of the \u201cdefendant\u201d to the suit, if a corporation, for the wilful act, omission or gross negligence of one representing it in its corporate capacity, as a corporate officer, but not of a mere ordinary servant or agent.\u2019 Under the proposition of law thus announced, did Harris Anderson represent appellant in its \u2018corporate capacity,\u2019 so that his gross negligence would be imputed to appellant, a corporation, thereby making it liable in exemplary damages for his gross negligence? Did Littlejohn represent appellant in its \u2018corporate capacity\u2019 in the sense in which that expression is used in the foregoing legal proposition ?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\"><em>\u201cQuestion Five: </em>On the issue of gross negligence and exemplary damages, what must be the official relation of the guilty servant to his master, a corporation, to make it liable in exemplary damages for his gross negligence?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">A digest of the relevant evidence is included in the certificate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>and the controlling facts shown will appear in the course of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\">Sec. 26, Art. 16, of the Constitution declares that \u201cEvery person, corporation, or company that may commit a homicide through wilful act or omission, or gross neglect, shall be responsible in exemplary damages to the surviving husband, widow, heirs of his or her body, of such of them as there may be,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"AuW\">It will be noted that the provision does not name parents as being amongst those to whom the right of action is given. Whatever rights the surviving parents have depend upon, and are restricted by, the Death Statute (Arts. 2899-2903, R. S. 1879; Arts. 4694-99, R. S. 1911; Title 77, R. S. 1925) ; as \"to parents, the statute occupies a field not within the bounds of the constitutional provision cited. And this renders Houston <em>&amp; </em>T. C. Ry. Co. v. Cowser, 57 Texas, 293, 305-6, unauthoritative here. Cowser and wife sued for damages (actual and exemplary) for the death of their adult son, caused by the (alleged) gross negligence of the railroad corporation, then acting by and through its \u201ctrainmaster\u201d and train operatives. In respect of punitive damages, at least, they had no cause of action save that given (and limited) by the Death Statute then in force (Arts. 2899-2903, R. S. 1879). As said by Judge Bonner, the statute plainly exhibited a material distinction between death caused by act or omission of the \u201cproprietor,\u201d or the \u201cowner,\u201d etc., \u201cof a railroad,\u201d on the one hand, and conduct of the \u201cservant\u201d or \u201cagent\u201d of such \u201cproprietor.\u201d or \u201cowner.\u201d As to actual damages, the statute provided cause of action whether the act or omission was by the one or the other; but for exemplary damages, it created the right only for the \u201cgross negligence,\u201d etc., \u201cof the defendant.\u201d The suit was against a railroad corporation (i. e. the \u201cproprietor\u201d or \u201cowner\u201d of a \u201crailroad\u201d) ; it was predicated upon the neglect, etc., of a \u201cservant\u201d or \u201cagent;\u201d and the right to maintain it depended solely upon a statute providing the distinctions noted. Because the petition merely averred that death was caused by \u201cthe gross negligence and carelessness of the agents, servants and employes\u201d of the railroad owner, the trial court sustained a demurrer to the claim for punitive damages, and this action, Judge Bonner held, was correct. Such are the conditions which circumstanced the ruling included in the excerpt quoted by the Honorable Court of Civil Appeals. But the present suit is not maintained against the \u201cproprietor\u201d or \u201cowner\u201d of a \u201crailroad,\u201d and the right to maintain it is not dependent upon the Death Statute \u2014 for it was filed by the surviving \u201cwidow\u201d against a corporation char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tered to manufacture lumber. It is a suit of the nature allowed by Sec. 26, Art. 16, of the Constitution. Houston &amp; T. C. Ry. Co. v. Cowser, therefore, does not give much assistance in the right determination of the questions certified. It may be remarked in passing, however, that, since the ruling was based upon the statutory distinctions mentioned, the opinion seems to imply that (but for those distinctions) the gross negligence of the \u201ctrainmaster\u201d and operatives (who were not officers of the corporation, but were \u201cservants\u201d or \u201cagents\u201d) would have been imputable to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Unless a corporation is to be held liable in punitive damages for the grossly negligent acts or omissions of any one or more of its servants, agents, employes and officers, any answer that may be given the questions propounded will, of necessity, involve some distinctions arbitrarily drawn. The Constitution (in the provision quoted) uses the word \u201ccorporation\u201d without any qualification whatever. The entity of a corporation is a mere concept resting solely in legal fiction. A corporation is an artificial being, without mind, soul, heart or life; it may not conceive a purpose, form or execute a plan, or do an act except through the agency of men or women. Whatever those men and women (acting singly or in confederation) may do in its name or behalf \u2014 at least, within the general scope of employment \u2014 represents it in action in the achievement of the charter purpose. This is true of its janitor and of its president. The felling of trees was essential to the making of lumber and the manufacture of lumber was necessary to its sale; and each intermediate (or related) step, was logically and practicably of as much importance as was any other step in accomplishment of the corporate object. The stroke of the woodsman\u2019s axe and the moving of the secretary\u2019s pen equally represented the lumber corporation in movement; each acted for it in his appointed sphere and each there embodied and gave life to the corporation itself. This finds some illustration in Western Union Tel. Co. v. Czizek, 264 U. S., 281, 284, 68 L. Ed., 682, where the act of a \u201creceiving clerk\u201d in taking and misplacing a message at a local office of the telegraph company is thus described and given effect: \u201cThe hand that holds the paper technically is the hand of the company, but\" no more at the beginning than at the end.\u201d It might properly have been added that insofar as the company had a hand with which to receive the message and thus work out its corporate function the \u201creceiving clerk\u2019s\u201d hand was, in actuality also, its member. Logically, therefore, the gross negligence (as also the omission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>to use ordinary care) of an employe, of any grade, in respect to an act within the scope of employment is the gross negligence of the corporation itself, and a question of imputation, except as predicated upon inquiry into the Scope of authority, could not arise. Yet, rightly or wrongly, the doctrine of immunity of the corporation from liability for exemplary damages in some instances has so firmly become <em>stare decisis </em>as to preclude its challenge now. Except for the two extremes, the general field has not been marked out and within it the boundary line between liability and immunity, in many of its stretches, must yet be platted as the facts of particular cases, as they may arise, require. The straight line across the general field indicated by the excerpt from Cowser v. H. &amp; T. C. Ry. Co. (quoted in the certificate) is not the true line, in a comprehensive sense, because reason and justice will inject some meanderings.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\">The test of liability, <em>vel non, </em>we think, is. the scope of the employe\u2019s authority. This is shadowed forth in the excerpt quoted by the Court of Civil Appeals from Cowser v. H. &amp; T. C. Ry. Co. Judge Bonner there speaks of \u201cone representing\u201d the company \u201cin a corporate capacity,\u201d e. g. \u201ca corporate officer,\u201d and of \u201ca mere servant or agent.\u201d Manifestly, there are \u201cservants or agents\u201d who represent corporations \u201cin corporate capacities\u201d but who are not \u201ccorporate officers\u201d <em>eo nomine, </em>and, because of this, Judge Bonner must have used the phrase \u201cas a corporate officer\u201d merely as an illustrative example of \u201cone representing it in a corporate capacity.\u201d Moreover, in a subsequent portion of the opinion he makes it plain that the requisite \u201ccriminal intent\u201d (so-called) of a \u201cservant or agent\u201d may be imputed to the corporation \u201cwhen the act has been authorized or ratified\u201d by it. He wrote the opinion in Western Union Tel. Co. v. Brown, 58 Texas, 170, 44 Am. Rep., 610, also, and there the rule is thus stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u201cIt is now the settled law of this State, that, to make a corporation liable for exemplary damages the \u2018fraud, malice, gross negligence or oppression\u2019 which must authorize and justify the same, must-have been committed by the corporation itself, or some superior officer representing it in its corporate capacity; or, if committed by a subordinate servant or agent, the act must have been either previously authorized, or subsequently ratified or approved, by the company or such superior officer after knowledge of the fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">And thus it was recognized that the negligent act, or omission, of servant or agent (not a \u201ccorporate\u201d or \u201csuperior\u201d officer) is the act or omission of the corporation if \u201cpreviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>authorized.\u201d The rule, so restricted, appears to have the approval of the Supreme Court in opinions both prior and subsequent to that in Cowser v. H. <em>&amp; </em>T. C. Ry. Co.; Hays v. Houston &amp; G. N. Ry. Co., 46 Texas, 272, 281; International Ry. Co. v. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 69 Texas, 277, 280-281, 5 Am. St. Rep., 45, 5 S. W., 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The scope of the employe\u2019s authority, therefore, being the true subject of inquiry in any case, mere nomenclature exerts no great force in determination of whether or not the corporation is to be held responsible (exemplarily) for the wilful or grossly negligent act or omission of a particular officer, agent or employe. That servant\u2019s title may govern his wage but not the effect of his conduct. The actualities of authority and its user, and not <em>ex parte </em>artificialities, are important.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The Chronister Lumber Company, in the achievement of its corporate purpose, maintained and operated a tram railroad for the transportation of timber and its employes. The maintenance and operation of this facility was an important and substantial element of its plant. To supply timber for its sawmill (another important and essential plant element) it maintained a \u201cwoods force\u201d of employes, and, as stated, used the railroad for transportation between forest and mill. In charge of the \u201cwoods force\u201d and the transportation operations it had a \u201cwoods foreman\u201d (Harris Anderson). His duty and authority embraced superintendence of the logging and hauling operations \u2014 specifically, the make-up, speed and other details of operation of the train. \u201cIt was the trainmen\u2019s duty to comply with his orders.\u201d The corporation itself, as owner and user of the railroad, was charged with knowledge of the proper consist and arrangement, speed, etc., of the trains, and with the duty of correct application of that knowledge. This duty it delegated to the \u201cwoods foreman,\u201d without instructions (so far as we are advised) as to how the duty should be performed. It left to him the authority to place the caboose, in which the men were to ride, at the front instead of at the rear of the train, if he should so desire, and the power to control the speed, etc., of the train as thus made up. His authority in the premises was superior to that of the train operatives and of the employes who were to ride on the train. The train as arranged, and its operation as arranged, under Harris\u2019 \u201csuperintendence\u201d was the train and the operation of the corporation itself, for all this was \u201cpreviously authorized.\u201d If Harris was negligent in any of these respects, his negligence, whatever its degree, was that of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>corporation. Such is the inevitable result of applying the principles stated to the facts certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The Honorable Court of Civil Appeals states that \u201cthe evidence is sufficient to raise the issue and support a jury finding that Harris Anderson was guilty of gross negligence in the manner in which he made up and operated the log train, and that his negligence was the proximate cause of Bob Williams\u2019 death.\u201d We believe, therefore, that question No. 1, as certified, should be answered \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We do not perceive the materiality of questions Nos. 2 or No. 3, except as their subject-matter may be included in question No. 1, and to that extent they should receive the same answer. As to the remainder of the scope of question Nos. 2 and 3 we are without sufficient data upon which to formulate answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The excerpt from Cowser v. H. &amp; T. C. Ry. Co. quoted in question No. 4 has been discussed above, and the answer to be made should be considered in the light of that discussion. The question should be answered \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The answer to question No. 5 should be: An \u201cofficial relation,\u201d as commonly understood, is not requisite; the essential \u201crelation\u201d is that the act and the manner of its doing must have been previously authorized or subsequently ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering certified questions is adopted and ordered certified to the Court of Civil Appeals. <em>C. M. Cureton, </em>Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
