Nevertheless, in 1920 (and prior to July 7) it secured from the Secretary of State a permit for \u201cthe sale of goods, wares and merchandise\u201d in Texas. This permit, it will be noted, did not purport to allow operation of the \u201csales system,\u201d etc., as a corporate enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">July 7, 1920, t-he corporation and R. L. Gulley executed a contract in words as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u201cThis contract made and entered into by and between Bynn-Yann\u2019s Company, Inc., party of the first part, and R. L. Gulley, party of the second part, witnesseth:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u201cParty of the first part agrees to employ party of the second part as local trustee, manager, who shall have charge of a Bynn Yann\u2019s Grocery Store located as follows: Mineral Wells, Texas,</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">or such other location as may be hereafter elected by Bynn Yann\u2019s Company, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u201cParty of the first part further agrees that in consideration of one thousand fifty dollars paid by party of the second part it will and does hereby sell to party of the second part Thirty \u2014\u00a735, Certificates of Ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">\u201cParty of the first part further agrees to guarantee balance of the necessary funds with which to establish the store contemplated not to exceed a total of \u00a78,000 or refund the amount paid by the party of the second part, which when done shall relieve it of all liability hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">\u201cParty of the first part agrees that party of the second part shall receive as his remuneration 5 per cent of the gross sales of said store, payable each week, and one-half of the dividends declared by said store payable at the close of the quarter for his services and the services of employees under his charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">\u201cParty of the first part agrees that in event this contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>should be canceled by party of the first part that party of the second part shall be privileged to sell his interest and good will to any person acceptable to party of the first part. Party of the second part further agrees to abide by the terms set forth in a document printed on reverse side of certificates of ownership and governing the management of said store. Party of the second part agrees to devote his entire time to the management of the store established in the territory assigned him, and to accept and abide by any rule, regulation or order made by the Bynn Yann\u2019s Company, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u201cParty of the first part reserves the right to terminate this contract freed from all liability to party of the second part on giving notice in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Shortly thereafter the corporation issued to \u201csome thirty-odd\u201d persons (residing in Palo Pinto County) \u201ccertificates of ownership.\u201d Except for variation of date, name of the \u201cowner\u201d and number of \u201cshares,\u201d each \u201ccertificate\u201d read thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201cNo. 57 Store Capital Shares \u00a735.00 Shares</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axq\">\u00a78,000.00 B.Y.

At the end of every calendar month a sum equal to 3 per cent of the gross sales of Bynn Yann\u2019s Store No. 321 during each month shall be divided pro rata according to their holdings between all the owners of \u2018Certificates of Ownership\u2019 of this store.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">\u201cB.

Dallas, Texas, August 21, 1920.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-3\">. (Signed) \u201cBynn Yann\u2019s Company, Inc.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">\u201cBy Frank L. Medearis, State Manager.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u201cBynn Yann\u2019s Store No. 321\u201d was thereupon opened at Mineral Wells under Gulley\u2019s management. For its operation he bought and received goods from C. D. Hartnett Company, a Texas corporation, during the period intervening September 27, 1920, and March 17, 1924, and as a result a balance was due C. D. Hartnett Company on March 16, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">For recovery on the debt C. D. Hartnett Company sued J. C. Shirah and other individuals, alleging they owed the debt because they \u201cwere jointly engaged in the mercantile business\u201d and were \u201cconducting their said business as co-partners under the partnership or firm name of \u2018Bynn-Yann-Store\u2019,\u201d at Mineral Wells, and, as such, they had bought the goods and incurred the debt in question. It was further alleged that \u201csaid business as conducted by said defendants was unincorporated, but was a joint stock company\u201d with a capital of \u201c$7,000 and divided into 200 shares at $35.00 each, and each of the defendants were owners of shares of stock in said joint stock company\u201d for which they had paid $35.00 per sharp. The \u201cshares\u201d thus referred to are the \u201cshares\u201d evidenced by the \u201ccertificates of ownership\u201d issued by the corporation as above described.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Among the defenses interposed is one (sustained by the trial court) to the effect that \u201csaid shares of stock\u201d were bought from the Tennessee corporation as corporate stock, that the \u201ccertificates of ownership\u201d did represent corporate stock, that the defendants were, therefore, corporate stockholders and not personally liable for the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">C. D. Hartnett Company perfected its appeal to the Honorable Court of Civil Appeals, Eleventh District, and that court has certified questions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u201c1. Did the contract as made and entered into by Bynn Yann\u2019s Company, Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of Tennessee, with a permit to do business in Texas, with R. L. Gulley, dated July 7, 1920, whereby the business conducted at Mineral Wells, Texas, under the name of Bynn-Yann-Store No. 321, with a capital stock of $8,000, divided into shares of $35.00 each and certificates of ownership were issued and sold to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>appellees and others create and make such organization and business a co-partnership or joint stock company?</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Does the fact that the Bynn Yann\u2019s Company, Inc., a corporation, received a royalty and percentage on the business done in the Mineral Wells store by appellees and others who had bought certificates of ownership in said business relieve and release appellees from liability to the creditors of said business ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The \u201ccertificates of ownership\u201d were not certificates of shares of corporate stock for various reasons. In the first place, they do not have that purport; on the contrary they declare themselves to be evidence merely that their holders own \u201cshares of ownership in Bynn Yann\u2019s Store No. 821, located at City (of) Mineral Wells,\u201d Texas. In the second place, they declare the right of the holders (en masse) to receive, at the end of each month, a sum equal to 3 per centum \u201cof the gross sales of Bynn Yann\u2019s Store No. 321 during such month\u201d and the right of the corporation, as \u201croyalty,\u201d to take 2 per centum \u201cof the gross sales\u201d of that \u201cstore\u201d and another 1 per centum for \u201cservices rendered in connection with supervision of stores, purchasing for stores and attending to all matters in connection with the operation of the stores.\u201d Every right declared for the \u201ccertificate\u201d owner is a right which the law denies to a corporate stockholder and every right reserved for the corporation is one denied it by law. The whole scheme, if viewed as creating a corporate stockholding relationship, ignores the rights of creditors and defeats the trust fund principle, for the stockholder is to receive dividends whether earned or not and the corporation is to receive profits whether profit or loss be the local \u201cstore\u2019s\u201d portion. In saying this, of course, we merely take the words of the paper, for it does not exhibit means whereby the \u201cgross sales\u201d obligations declared are to be paid in event there is no profit. Again: The record shows $10,000, divided into 100 shares of $100 par value each, to be the total authorized capital stock for the corporation, and that of this 60 shares had already been issued (and were outstanding) when the \u201ccertificates of ownership\u201d (par value $35.00 per share, aggregate par value of $7,000) were issued.- These things sufficiently demonstrate that the defendants are not stockholders of the corporation. One relationship (i. e., corporate) in which individuality is not the entity, and of which our law takes cognizance, is, therefore, eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">There is, and can be, no claim of a limited partnership such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>as is permitted by the terms of Chap. 1, Title 105, R. S., 1925, nor did the enterprise belong to any one person.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\">It results that (as between the defendants and creditors) the concern,- at Mineral Wells, is a general partnership or a joint stock association \u2014 and whether one name for it would be more appropriate than the other is immaterial, for, on the case made, liability is identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We do, not wish to be understood as implying that a corporation may lawfully become a partner or member of a joint stock association, or that this corporation, itself, would not be liable to pursuing creditors. No such questions are in the case, and we do not pass upon the legal effect of the corporation\u2019s violation of the law further than to say its delinquencies do not clothe its associates with immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We recommend that the first question certified be answered \u201cYes\u201d and that the second be answered \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering certified questions is adopted and ordered certified to the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>C. M. Cureton, </em>Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
