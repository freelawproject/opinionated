The Korens had brought a libel action against Capital for publishing an allegedly false and malicious statement about Hal Barry Koren, describing his arrest by federal authorities on an extortion charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">In concluding that Judge Sachse was correct, we do not reach a series of intriguing constitutional issues raised by <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U. S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, </em>388 U. S. 130, 87 S. Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967); <em>Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, </em>403 U. S. 29, 91 S. Ct. 1811, 29 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971), and, most recently and revolutionarily, <em>Gertz v. Welch, </em>42 L. W. 5123 (decided June 25, 1974). A broad range of First Amendment considerations is foreclosed by our more pedestrian conclusion that the Korens did not cross the threshold of establishing a defamatory statement in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">On October 10, 1972, the following article appeared in <em>The Evening Capital:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">\u201cEXTORTION HEARING SET TODAY\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">\u201cBy PETER RUEHL Staff Writer\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">(1) \u201cHal Barry Koren, the 17-year-old youth, arrested early Saturday and charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>extortion, was scheduled to appear before a U.S. magistrate today in Baltimore for a preliminary hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">(2) \u201cThe youth was released yesterday on $15,000 bail. His father, court sources said, had to pay 10 percent bail bond \u2014 $1,500 \u2014 to get young Koren out of jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">(3) \u201cKoren lives at 1520 Gordon Grove Drive, Annapolis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">(4) \u201cThe Annapolis Senior High School student was arrested Saturday in Annapolis by FBI agents from the Baltimore office. He was charged with attempting to extort $20,000 from the Safeway Store in the Eastport Shopping Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">(5) \u201cThe store manager, Wilbur Dove, said he. received a lengthy letter demanding the money and threatening to place a bomb in the store if the money were not received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">(6) \u201cThe letter ordered the money to be delivered near the intersection of Bay Ridge and Arundel-on-the-Bay Roads and specified that the currency should be in $50 and $100 bills. The site would be marked by a white sheet on the left side of the road the letter said. The pick-up was scheduled for 9 p.m. Friday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">(7) \u201cFBI agents set up roadblocks in the vicinity but Baltimore Special Agent in Charge Thomas H. Farrow declined to say when and where the actual arrest took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">(8) \u201cFarrow said the bureau would not give out the information prior to Koren\u2019s trial because of the gravity of the federal crime and because the accused is a juvenile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-13\">(9) \u201c \u2018On the federal level, we restrict what we give out,\u2019 Farrow said. He added he didn\u2019t want to divulge the FBI\u2019s methods in apprehending the suspect because it could result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>in someone else trying the same thing and avoiding being caught.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">(10) \u201c \u2018The only thing that could happen if we gave the information out would be for someone to want to improve upon his (Koren\u2019s) method,\u2019 Farrow said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">(11) \u201cThe preliminary hearing today was preceded by an arraignment Saturday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">(12) \u201cIf tried as an adult and convicted, Koren would face a maximum sentence of 20 years and a minimum of five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">(13) \u201cIt is not know (sic) whether the FBI delivered the money or a decoy to the rendezvous site Friday night, but Safeway Stores officials said they didn\u2019t participate in the arrest after alerting federal officials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">(14) \u201cDove, the store manager, quoted the letter as saying if the money were not received, the letter would sent (sic) to The Evening Capital for publication.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">On April 26, 1973, the Korens sued Capital for libel, alleging that the article was false, malicious and libelous <em>per se.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>They claimed $25,000 in compensatory damages <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and $250,000 in punitive damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>In support of its motion for summary judgment, Capital submitted a copy of the Record of Proceedings before the United States- Magistrate for the District of Maryland, describing the circumstances of young Koren\u2019s arrest, and the affidavits of three Capital employees: Peter Ruehl, the reporter who prepared the article at issue; James Camenga, another reporter who had prepared an earlier article on the same subject; and Joseph A. Panella, Jr., an editor who supervised the work of Ruehl and Camenga. In support of their answer to the motion, the Korens filed an affidavit of Thomas H. Farrow, the FBI agent who had been interviewed by Ruehl in the course of Ruehl\u2019s preparation of the article. Capital then filed a second affidavit supplementing Ruehl\u2019s earlier affidavit. Also available was the filed deposition of Camenga.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The focus of the case narrowed down to a very fine point; indeed, ultimately to a single word. The FBI was investigating a serious extortion, a threat to place a bomb in a large retail store if $20,000 were not turned over to the extortionist. The FBI set a trap. Young Koren, by a set of bizarre and unforeseen circumstances, apparently chanced into the trap. Although probable cause apparently existed for the FBI to arrest him and to charge him, subsequent investigation revealed his lack of guilt and charges against him were dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The affidavits of Ruehl and Camenga, uncontested in this regard, established that neither reporter knew any of the Korens nor had any reason or desire to harm them in any way. Camenga wrote an initial article, not here in question, on October 9, 1972. He telephoned the Baltimore office of the FBI and learned therefrom that Hal Barry Koren, a seventeen-year-old Annapolis student, had been arrested by the FBI on October 6th and charged with extortion. Camenga also was told by the FBI that young Koren had been arraigned. Camenga also interviewed the threatened store manager and learned the details of the threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Ruehl was responsible for a follow-up article on October 10th. He relied for background upon Camenga\u2019s article of October 9th. That background constituted paragraphs 1, 4, 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>6, 7, 13 and 14 of the October 10th article. For follow-up, Ruehl called the FBI office in Baltimore and spoke with Special Agent Thomas Farrow. He learned from Agent Farrow the address of Koren; the fact that Koren had been released on bail following a preliminary hearing; and the fact that Koren, if tried as an adult and convicted, would face a maximum sentence of 20 years and a minimum sentence of 5 years. This information, all factually correct, provided the basis for paragraphs 2, 3, 11 and 12 of the October 10th article. Ruehl sought to elicit further information relating to the circumstances of Koren\u2019s arrest. Agent Farrow declined to provide such information, giving as his reasons the statements which appear in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the October 10th article.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Initially, there is no question but that truth is an absolute shield for Capital in reporting accurately newsworthy events, even when the object of the coverage is a \u201cprivate individual\u201d as opposed to a \u201cpublic official\u201d or \u201cpublic figure.\u201d <em>Time, Inc. v. Hill, </em>385 U. S. 374, 87 S. Ct. 534, 17 L.Ed.2d 456 (1967).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even if the underlying arrest or the underlying criminal charges turn out to be ill-founded, it is well settled that in Maryland a newspaper enjoys a qualified privilege to publish reports of arrests and charges on which arrests are made, as well as other matters involving violation of the law. <em>Evening News Co. v. Bowie, </em>154 Md. 604, 141 A. 416 (1928); <em>Piracci v. Hearst Corp., </em>263 F. Supp. 511 (D. Md. 1966) (construing Maryland law). This privilege is lost only when it can be shown that the defendant abused the privilege by publishing the defamatory statement (the charges that turn out to be ill-founded) with \u201cactual malice\u201d (in the common law sense connoting hatred or ill will, as opposed to \u201cconstitutional malice\u201d in the <em>New York Times v. Sullivan </em>sense connoting \u201cknowing or reckless falsity\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>Evening News v. Bowie, supra; Piracci v. Hearst Corp., supra. </em>The burden of proving such malice is on the plaintiff. <em>Domchick v. Greenbelt Consumer Services, Inc., </em>200 Md. 36, 87 A. 2d 831 (1952); <em>Stevenson v. Baltimore Baseball Club, Inc., </em>250 Md. 482, 243 A. 2d 533 (1968); <em>Simon v. Robinson, </em>221 Md. 200, 154 A. 2d 911 (1959); <em>Deckelman v. Lake, </em>149 Md. 533, 131 A. 762 (1926). Cf. <em>A. S. Abell Co. v. Barnes, </em>258 Md. 56, 265 A. 2d 207 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">With actual malice or ill will in the common law sense not remotely suggested, the Korens are bereft of even an arguable case with respect to paragraphs one through nine and eleven through fourteen. In reporting accurately what was told to its reporters by the FBI and by the victim of the crime, Capital was fully privileged. Even to begin to make a case, the Korens must establish some falsity emanating not from the FBI but from Capital directly. They, of necessity, direct their fire exclusively at paragraph 10. We quote paragraph 9 as well, in order to place paragraph 10 in context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">(9) \u201c \u2018On the federal level, we restrict what we give out,\u2019 Farrow said. He added he didn\u2019t want to divulge the FBI\u2019s methods in apprehending the suspect because it could result in someone else trying the same thing and avoiding being caught.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">(10) \u201c \u2018The only thing that could happen if we gave the information out would be for someone to want to improve upon his <em>(Koren\u2019s) </em>method,\u2019 Farrow said.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The case hinges upon the single word \u201cKoren\u2019s\u201d contained in parentheses after the word \u201chis.\u201d The Korens claim initially that there is a genuine dispute over a material fact, so as to defeat a motion for summary judgment and to require a trial. They produced an affidavit from Agent Farrow asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">\u201cThat on or about October 9, 1972, I stated to Peter Ruehl, a reporter for the Annapolis Evening Capital, in substance, that one reason why the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Federal Bureau of Investigation did not release information concerning cases of extortion was that someone might thereby utilize or improve upon the method of the perpetrator or perpetrators of such crimes and, further, that in making the aforesaid statement <em>I did not identify by name or otherwise any perpetrator or perpetrators, alleged or otherwise, of any particular crimes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The Korens posit a \u201cgenuine dispute over a material fact\u201d by juxtaposing the affidavit of Agent Farrow with the initial affidavit of Ruehl in which he stated that \u201c. . . Agent Farrow declined to provide such information, giving as his reasons the statements which appear in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the October 10,1972, article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The appellants\u2019 thesis is that Ruehl thereby swore that Farrow had uttered the word \u201cKoren\u2019s\u201d, whereas Farrow swore that he had not. The slightest semblance of a factual dispute, genuine or strained, material or immaterial, is dissipated, however, by the supplemental affidavit of Ruehl in which he amplifies and explains that the \u201cquoted matter appearing in Paragraph 10\u201d was \u201cto the best of his recollection and belief, a verbatim quotation . . . except for the word \u2018(Koren\u2019s)\u2019,\u201d and that \u201cthe word \u2018(Koren\u2019s)\u2019 was inserted by him to explain the word \u2018his\u2019 which appears immediately before it.\u201d Capital, in short, acknowledges full authorship of the word \u201c(Koren\u2019s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">This is dispositive of the threshold question of whether a summary judgment may lie. A trial was' simply not necessary to discover the source of the disputed word. Maryland Rule 610 d 1; <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. State Board, </em>268 Md. 32, 41, 300 A. 2d 367, quoting with approval <em>Knisley v. Keller, </em>11 Md. App. 269, 273 A. 2d 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The question now becomes that of what to make of the undisputed fact. The thesis of the Korens is that young Koren was defamed when Capital falsely attributed to the FBI the implication that Koren had committed a crime by falsely attributing to the FBI the reference to \u201cKoren\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>method.\u201d In our judgment, the thesis won\u2019t wash. A jury simply could not be permitted to base a finding of libel on so tenuous and speculative a reed. Initially, even the structure of the sentence belies the argument predicated upon it. The very use of the parentheses denotes a reporter\u2019s interpretation within the quoted material, parenthetically supplying an antecedent for an otherwise possibly ambiguous pronoun. If the proper noun were falsely being attributed to Agent Farrow, the quotation would have read \u201cKoren\u2019s method,\u201d not \u201chis (Koren\u2019s) method.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">More significantly, however, the whole point is trivial \u2014 a grasping at a straw of one small and technically arguable grammatical error to defeat an otherwise unassailable privilege based upon a truthful reporting of official action. The indirect contribution of one word in a tenth paragraph to the implication that the FBI believed Koren involved in the extortion was absolutely <em>de minimis. </em>The first paragraph of the article recounted that Koren had been arrested and charged with extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The second paragraph described how Koren was released only after posting a bail of $15,000. The strong implication is that both the charging agency (the FBI) and the United States Magistrate believed Koren to be involved in a very serious crime. The fourth paragraph refers directly to the Saturday arrest of Koren \u201cby FBI agents from the Baltimore office\u201d and their charging of him \u201cwith attempting to extort $20,000 from the Safeway Store in the Eastport Shopping Center.\u201d The implication therein is irresistible \u2014 \u201cthe FBI believed Koren to be the extortionist.\u201d The seventh paragraph described how the \u201cFBI agents set up roadblocks in the vicinity\u201d where the extortion money was to be delivered, all of this preceding the arrest of Koren. The eleventh paragraph reported the prior arraignment of Koren and his scheduled preliminary hearing \u2014 exercises that a person is not subjected to unless someone in responsible authority believes him to have perpetrated a crime. The very headline \u201cEXTORTION HEARING. SET TODAY\u201d clearly implies official belief in Koren\u2019s criminal involvement. In short, no perplexed reader was still seeking subtle clues in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the tenth paragraph as to the position of the FBI in the case. They had arrested and charged Koren because they believed him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">It is clear that where alleged libel derives from an innuendo, the court must consider the challenged words (or word) in the context of the whole article in which they appear. <em>Flaks v. Clarke, </em>143 Md. 377, 122 A. 383 (1923). As was said in <em>Maas v. National Casualty Co., </em>97 F. 2d 247, at 249:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">\u201c[S]ince the injurious character of the publication and the harm done to the plaintiff depends upon the manner in which the writing is understood by those to whom it is uttered, it must be read and construed in the sense in which the reader would ordinarily understand it. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Looking at the article as a whole, we conclude that for an ordinary reader, no arguably subtle implication in the tenth paragraph would add one whit to the clear drift of the rest of the article, the privilege of which is beyond cavil.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Our holding that there was no defamation on the part of Capital in the first instance makes it unnecessary to consider the degree of fault that would impose liability. We would note, however, that the Maryland law in this regard is currently in a state of limbo.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\"><em>New York Times v. Sullivan, supra, </em>changed radically the common law of defamation when the plaintiff is a public official, limiting liability to cases of \u201cconstitutional malice,\u201d that is, \u201cknowing or reckless falsity.\u201d See A. <em>S. Abell Co. v. Barnes, supra. Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, supra, </em>extended the First Amendment limitation to those cases where the plaintiff was, in more general terms, a \u201cpublic figure.\u201d The plurality opinion in <em>Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, supra, </em>would have extended the <em>New York Times </em>doctrine to cases involving even private plaintiffs involved in newsworthy events. <em>Gertz v. Welch, supra, </em>has, however, definitely declined so to extend the rule of <em>New York Times </em>and has allowed the states \u201csubstantial latitude\u201d in \u201cdefin[ing] for themselves the appropriate standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood injurious to a private individual.\u201d 42 L. W. at 5130. It has absolutely precluded, however, the imposition of \u201cliability without fault.\u201d Fault may no longer, as it was at the common law, be presumed from the very making of a statement libelous <em>per se. </em>Maryland\u2019s preexisting common law of presumptive fault is now unconstitutional. Maryland could, of course, opt for a stringent <em>New York Times </em>standard of \u201cknowing or reckless falsity\u201d even as to the defamation of newsworthy private persons. It could, on the other hand, opt for a lesser standard of negligence in failing to adhere to that standard of care prevailing in the journalistic profession. The latter would be, of the constitutionally permitted alternatives, the closest to our preexisting common law. The present case, however, is neither a necessary nor prudent vehicle for such decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-12\">. The paragraphs of the article as set out above are numbered to facilitate reference to them. Judge Sachse, in his opinion, referred to the paragraphs of the article by such numerical designations. The paragraphs, of course, were not numbered in the published article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-13\">. The continuing utility of the notion of libel <em>per se </em>is very much in doubt in the wake of <em>Gertz v. </em>Welch, <em>supra. </em>The Supreme Court made it clear that absolute liability even for defamatory falsehood cannot withstand First Amendment scrutiny. Fault, of varying degrees in varying situations, may never, as at the common law, be presumed from the character of the defamatory statement but must be independently proved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b599-14\">. <em>Gertz v.

General damages to reputation may not, as at common law, be presumed from the character of the defamatory statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b599-15\">. <em>Gertz v. Welch, supra, </em>also definitely established that there may never be punitive damages, absent the establishment of \u201cconstitutional malice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b601-5\">. <em>Time, Inc. o. Hill </em>dealt literally with invasion of privacy and not with defamation, but First Amendment limitations on state tort law are not dissimilar in the two situations. <em>Time, Inc. v. Hill </em>went further and held that, in invasion of privacy cases, even inadvertent or negligent falsehood will not give rise to liability if the \u201ccontent [would] not warn a reasonably prudent editor or broadcaster of its defamatory potential.\u201d <em>Gertz v. Welch, supra, </em>at 42 L. W. 5131.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
