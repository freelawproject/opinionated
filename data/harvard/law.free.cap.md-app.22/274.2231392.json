J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A68\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">The definition of obscenity originally announced by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U. S. 476, was significantly refined by the plurality opinion in <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts, </em>383 U. S. 413. Recognizing that the <em>Memoirs </em>plurality test for the determination of obscenity <em>vel non </em>had represented a sharp break with the test announced in <em>Roth, </em>the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>reformulated the test in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U. S. 15, and its siblings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enunciating a constitutional test for obscenity to which a majority of the Court subscribed for the first time in a number of years. <em>Miller </em>made clear, however, 413 U. S. at 24, n. 6, that its decision was not intended to hold all state statutes dealing with obscenity inadequate, recognizing that existing statutes \u201cas construed heretofore or hereafter may well be adequate\u201d, a recognition emphasized in <em>United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, </em>413 U. S. 123. In <em>Ebert v. Maryland State Board of Censors, </em>19 Md. App. 300, we construed, in the light of the <em>Miller </em>cases, the term \u201cobscene\u201d as used in Code, Art. 66A, subtitle \u201cMoving Pictures\u201d, and particularly \u00a7 6 thereof, dealing with the duty of the Maryland State Board of Censors to disapprove films which are \u201cobscene\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We found that material is within the constitutionally permissibly proscribed depictions in <em>Miller </em>when it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201c(1) portrays sexual conduct in a patently offensive way in that it contains patently offensive:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">(a) representations or descriptions of ultimate sex acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated; OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">(b) representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibitions of genitals; AND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK4\">(2) taken as a whole:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">(a) would be found by the average person, applying contemporary community standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of the State, to appeal to the prurient interest in sex; AND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">(b) does not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d 19 Md. App. at 314-315.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">This appeal requires us to construe Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 418A, subtitle \u201cObscene Matter\u201d. That statute bestows upon the circuit courts of the counties and upon the equity courts of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City the jurisdiction to enjoin the sale or distribution of any book, magazine, or other publication or article (including a motion picture film or showing) which is prohibited from sale or distribution. The State\u2019s attorneys of the county or Baltimore City in which a person sells or distributes, is about to sell or distribute, or has or is about to acquire possession with such intent, any such material which is obscene within the meaning of \u00a7 418 of Art. 27, may maintain an action for an injunction against such person. \u00a7 418A 1. Section 418 makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly send or cause to be sent, bring or cause to be brought, into Maryland for sale or distribution, or, in Maryland, to prepare, publish, print, exhibit, distribute, offer to distribute, \u201cany obscene matter\u201d. We read \u201cobscene\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 418, and, thus, as it is used in \u00a7 418A, as we construed it in <em>Ebert </em>with respect to Code, Art. 66A, that is, within the parameters enunciated in the <em>Miller </em>complex of cases. Since <em>Ebert, </em>however, the Supreme Court, on 24 June 1974, decided two other cases concerning obscenity, <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U. S. 87, and <em>Jenkins v. Georgia, </em>418 U. S. 153. We adopt, as applicable to Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 418 and \u00a7 418A, the definition and determination of obscenity set out in <em>Ebert, </em>as explicated, however, by <em>Hamling </em>and <em>Jenkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">What we did in <em>Ebert </em>with respect to Code, Art. 66A and what we do in this opinion with regard to Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 \u00a7 418 and 418A is to follow the dictates of the Supreme Court as to the basic guidelines for the trier of fact under the reformulated test for the determination of obscenity announced in <em>Miller. </em>Those guidelines must be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u201c(a) whether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest. . .; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d 413 U. S., at 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">With respect to (b), we have held that the statutes cover the sort of \u201cpatently offensive representations or description of that specific \u2018hard core\u2019 sexual conduct given as examples in <em>Miller v. California.\u201d </em>With respect to (c), we rejected as constitutional standards, as did the Court in <em>Miller, </em>\u201cthe ambiguous concept of \u2018social importance\u2019 \u201d, and the \u201cutterly without redeeming social value\u201d test. 413 U. S. at 25. With respect to (a), we now adopt the meaning of \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d as explicated in <em>Handing </em>and <em>Jenkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The Supreme Court has \u201ca duty to authoritatively construe federal statutes where \u2018a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised\u2019 . . .\u201d but must leave to state courts the construction of state legislation. <em>United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, supra, </em>at 130, no. 7. The Court indicated in that case that it was prepared to construe the generic terms in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462 to be limited to the sort of \u201cpatently offensive representations or description of that specific \u2018hard core\u2019 sexual conduct given as examples in <em>Miller v. California.\u201d </em>In <em>Hamling, </em>it so construed the companion provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461. In so doing, the Court explicated in several areas the reformulated test announced in <em>Miller. </em>We note that the generic terms used in \u00a7 1461, dealing with mailing obscene matter, are \u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile\u201d and that such terms used in \u00a7 1462, dealing with the importation or transportation of obscene matters, are \u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious or filthy\u201d. These terms are not defined in the statutes, nor is the method of determining them set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\n<em>The Conteynporary Community Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In <em>Hamling </em>it was contended that the standard in federal obscenity cases must be national ones and that the Court had not decided whether the Constitution requires the use of nationwide standards in federal obscenity prosecutions. The Court disagreed with those contentions. It said, 418 U. S. 87 at 104-105:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201cWe think that both of these contentions evidence a misunderstanding of our <em>Miller </em>holdings. <em>Miller </em>rejected the view that the First and Fourteenth Amendments require that the proscription of obscenity be based on uniform nationwide standards of what is obscene, describing such standards as \u2018hypothetical and unascertainable,\u2019 413 U. S. at 31. But in so doing the Court did not require as a constitutional matter the substitution of some smaller geographical area into the same sort of formula; the test was stated in terms of the understanding of \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards.\u2019 413 U. S. at 24. When this approach is coupled with the reaffirmation in <em>Paris Adult Theatre I v. </em>Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 56 (1973), of the' rule that the prosecution need not as a matter of constitutional law produce \u2018expert\u2019 witnesses to testify as to the obscenity of the materials, the import of the quoted language from <em>Miller </em>becomes clear. A juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required determination, just as he is entitled to draw on his knowledge of the propensities of a \u2018reasonable\u2019 person in other areas of the law. <em>Stone v. New York, Chicago &amp; St Louis R. Co., </em>344 U. S. 407, 409 (1953); <em>Schultz v. Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>350 U. S. 573, 525-526 (1956). Our holding in <em>Miller </em>that California could constitutionally proscribe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>obscenity in terms of a \u2018statewide\u2019 standard did not mean that any such precise geographic area is required as a matter of constitutional law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">\u201cOur analysis in <em>Miller </em>of the difficulty in formulating uniform national standards of obscenity, and our emphasis on the ability of the juror to ascertain the sense of the \u2018average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 without the benefit of expert evidence, clearly indicates that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 is not to be interpreted as requiring proof of the uniform national standards which were criticized in <em>Miller. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGL\">The Supreme Court has emphasized that a principal concern in requiring that a determination of obscenity <em>vel non </em>be made on the basis of \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d is to assure the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror\u2019s personal opinion, or by its effect on a particular sensitive person or group. <em>Miller </em>at 33; <em>Roth, </em>at 489-490; <em>Mishkin v. New York, </em>383 U. S. 502, 508-509. So explained the Court: \u201cThe result of the <em>Miller </em>cases, therefore, as a matter of constitutional law and federal statutory construction, is to permit a juror sitting in obscenity cases to draw on knowledge of the community or vicinage from which he comes in deciding what conclusion \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019, would reach in a given case.\u201d <em>Hamling, </em>418 U. S. 87, at 105. The Court, however, went further: \u201cBut this is not to say that a District Court would not be at liberty to admit evidence of standards existing in some, place outside of this particular district, if it felt that such evidence would assist the jury in the resolution of the issues which they were to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In <em>Jenkins </em>the Court had before it the constitutionality of a state statute. Billy Jenkins was convicted, prior to <em>Miller </em>and its companion cases, of violating Georgia\u2019s obscenity statute for showing the film \u201cCarnal Knowledge\u201d in a motion picture theatre. The statute defined obscene material in terms of the <em>Memoirs </em>definition and the jury was instructed under it. The Georgia appellate court affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the conviction. The Court said that its holding in <em>Miller </em>was \u201cthat it was constitutionally permissible to permit juries to rely on the understanding of the community from which they came as to contemporary community standards, and the States have considerable latitude in framing statutes under this element of the <em>Miller </em>decision. A State may choose to define an obscenity offense in terms of \u2018contemporary community standards\u201d as defined in <em>Miller </em>without further specification, as was done here, or it may choose to define the standards in more precise geographic terms, as was done by California in Miller.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>418 U. S. 153, at 157. That Georgia chose to define an obscenity offense in terms of contemporary community standards without further specification was accepted by the Supreme Court upon an implied judicial construction of the Georgia statute by the Georgia appellate court: \u201cWe agree with the Supreme Court of Georgia\u2019s implicit ruling that the Constitution does not require that juries be instructed in state obscenity cases to apply the standards of a hypothetical statewide community. <em>Miller </em>approved the use of such instructions; it did not mandate their use. What <em>Miller </em>makes clear is that state juries need not be instructed to apply \u2018national standards.\u2019 We also agree with the Supreme Court of Georgia\u2019s implicit approval of the trial court\u2019s instructions directing jurors to apply \u2018community standards\u2019 without specifying what \u2018community\u2019.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We construe Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 418 and, therefore, \u00a7 418A, as permitting the trier of fact to determine obscenity <em>vel non </em>by applying \u201ccommunity standards\u2019\u201d without specifying what \u201ccommunity.\u201d\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The <em>Miller </em>cases made abundantly clear that expert testimony is not necessary to enable the trier of fact to judge the obscenity of material which has been placed into evidence. See <em>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra, </em>at 56: <em>Kaplan v. California, supra, </em>at 120-121; <em>Ebert v. Maryland State Board of Censors, supra, </em>at 307-308. The ability of the juror to ascertain the sense of the \u201caverage person, applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>contemporary community standards\u201d without the benefit of expert evidence was emphasized in <em>Miller. </em>This rule was expressly affirmed in <em>Hamling. </em>\u201cExpert testimony is not necessary to enable the jury to judge the obscenity of material which . . . has been placed into evidence.\u201d <em>Hamling, </em>418 U. S. 87, at 100. \u201cThe jury was not bound .to accept the opinion of any expert in weighing the evidence of obscenity . .. .\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Jenkins, </em>418 U. S. at 159-160.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>The Function of the Trier of Fact and the Appellate Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In <em>Jenkins </em>there was little to be found in the record about the allegedly obscene film other than the film itself. Georgia contended that under <em>Miller </em>the obscenity <em>vel non </em>of the film was a question for the jury, and the jury having resolved the question against Jenkins, and there being some evidence to support its findings, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed. The Court pointed out that the questions of what appeals to the \u201cprurient interest\u201d and what is \u201cpatently offensive\u201d under the <em>Miller </em>obscenity test are \u201cessentially questions of fact.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>at 30. The Court made clear, however, that it did not agree that a jury\u2019s verdict that material is obscene virtually precludes all further appellate review that such material is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. \u201cEven though questions of appeal to the \u2018prurient interest\u2019 or of patent offensiveness are \u2018essentially questions of fact\u2019, it would be a serious misreading of <em>Miller </em>to conclude that juries have unbridled discretion in determining what is \u2018patently offensive.\u2019 Not only did we there say that \u2018the First Amendment values applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment are adequately protected by the ultimate power of appellate courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional claims when necessary,\u2019 413 U. S., at 25, but we made it plain that under that holding \u2018no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive \u2018hard core\u2019 sexual conduct. . . .\u2019 413 U. S., at 27.\u201d 15 Cr. L. at 3261. Triers of fact, in finding material obscene, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>observe \u201csubstantive constitutional limitations, deriving from the First Amendment. . . <em>Idem. </em>The examples <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of patent offensiveness given in <em>Miller, </em>while not purporting to be an exhaustive catalog of what juries might find to be patently offensive, \u201ccertainly intend to fix\u201d such limitations. Mr. Justice Brennan summed it up neatly in his opinion concurring in the result in <em>Jenkins:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">\u201cAfter the Court\u2019s decision today, there can be no doubt that <em>Miller </em>requires appellate courts \u2014 including this Court \u2014 to review independently the constitutional fact of obscenity. Moreover, the Court\u2019s task is not limited to reviewing a jury finding under part (c) of the <em>Miller </em>test that \u2018the work, taken as a whole, lack[ed] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u2019 <em>Miller </em>also requires independent review of a jury\u2019s determination under part (b) of the <em>Miller </em>test that \u2018the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law.\u201d 418 U. S. at 163-164.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\n<em>THE INSTANT CASE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">On 16 November 1973 the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, upon application of the State\u2019s Attorney, and after hearing, issued an order under the authority of Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 418A permanently enjoining Village Books, Inc., Gary Wahl, Dennis E. Pryba, and Leroy Eichhorn \u201cfrom the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>or further sale or the distribution or further distribution or the acquisition, publication or possession within this State\u201d of 24 designated publications. It further ordered that a Special Investigator of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office seize and destroy the publications and all copies of them and that the respondents surrender all copies of the publications possessed by them within this State. Village Books, Inc. and Wahl appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The application for injunctive relief alleged that on 25 June 1973 Lonnie Brown, a Special Investigator of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office purchased from Village Books, Inc., 4807 Allentown Road, Camp Springs, Maryland, 5 books \u201cdepicting patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal and perverted, and patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and the genitals\u201d. While on the premises Brown saw numerous other publications, similar to those he purchased, which were exhibited and offered for sale to the public. On 27 June, under the authority of a search and seizure warrant, he seized one copy each of a large number of such publications found on the premises. The premises were occupied by Village Books, Inc., Wahl was president of the corporation, Eichhorn was the cashier, and deliveries to the premises of materials offered for sale were made by Pryba. On 19 October 1973 Village Books, Inc., Pryba and Eichhorn filed a motion to suppress from use in evidence all the items seized \u201cwhile executing a search warrant which was unlawful and illegal in violation of the First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America and in violation of Article 23 and 26 of the Declaration of Rights of the State of Maryland.\u201d The same day the \u201cdefendants\u201d filed a motion to dismiss the Bill of Complaint for an injunction on the ground that Code, Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 417, 418 and 418A were unconstitutional. Upon hearing on 30 October both motions were denied. Upon hearing on 15 November on the merits of the Bill of Complaint the injunctive relief sought was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Appellants first ask: \u201cWas the Search Warrant unconstitutionally overbroad in allowing unlimited discretion to the officers executing the warrant to pick and choose the items to be seized? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The warrant commanded Brown, with the necessary and proper assistants to search 4807 Allentown Road \u201cfor the property specified, to wit: statues, figures, articles, films, photographs, books, publications, recordings, and other items depicting obscene matter and being exhibited and/or offered for sale and including all such statues or other figures or equipment, and one copy of all such books, films, photographs, recordings, and publications containing patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sex acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, and patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions and lewd exhibitions of the genitals and if the property be found there to seize it and to seize any property found liable to seizure under the laws of this State. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, it appeared that some 750 items were seized under the authority of the warrant \u2014 \u201capproximately 750 copies of different magazines, pocket books, paperbacks, newspapers, tape recordings, comic books, dildos, french ticklers, et cetera.\u201d Evidence proffered by the State tended to show that only those items were seized which were probably obscene, and then only one of each kind, and if there was only one of an apparently obscene item it was not taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The nub of appellants\u2019 argument on the question, as we understand it, is that \u201cdetermination by police officers of the status of the material, whether it is to be classified as obscene or not obscene, is not enough protection to satisfy the mandates of the First and Fourth Amendments.\u201d They assert: \u201cWe cannot permit unfettered discretion in seizures pursuant to overly broad warrants. The right to seize, in a free society, requires the sensitive determination of obscenity to be made judicially and not <em>ad hoc </em>by police officers in the field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>We think the answer to appellants\u2019 argument is found in <em>Hamling. </em>In that case the sufficiency of the indictment was attacked. The indictment charged an offense in the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461, which as we have indicated, spoke in terms of \u201cobscene\u201d, \u201clewd\u201d, and similar generic terms. The Court in <em>Roth </em>had held that the language of \u00a7 1461 was not \u201ctoo vague to support conviction for crime\u201d, 345 U. S. at 480. <em>Hamling </em>observed: \u201cIt is generally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the statute itself, as long as \u2018those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished.\u2019 \u201d 418 U. S. at 117, citing <em>United States v. Carll, </em>105 U. S. 611, 612. See <em>Hagner v. United States, </em>285 U. S. 427; <em>United States v. Debrow, </em>346 U. S. 374. The Court held that the word \u201cobscene\u201d met this test. \u201cThe definition of obscenity, however, is not a question of fact, but one of law; the word \u2018obscene\u2019, as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461, is not merely a generic or descriptive term, but a legal term of art. . . . The legal definition of obscenity does not change with each indictment; it is a term sufficiently definite in legal meaning to give a defendant notice of the charge against him.\u201d 418 U. S. at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Under this concept of \u201cobscene\u201d we think it patent that commanding the seizure of \u201cobscene matter\u201d does not allow \u201cunlimited discretion to the officers executing the warrant to pick and choose the items to be seized.\u201d We conclude that the warrant here was not constitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We see nothing in <em>Heller v. New York, </em>413 U. S. 483 to compel a contrary conclusion. Nor was there a massive search and seizure in the circumstances here as would put the seizure within the ambit of <em>Marcus v.

Maryland State Board of Censors, </em>an <em>ex post facto </em>denial of due process of law to the Appellants?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">At the hearing on the merits of the Bill for injunctive relief the trial court applying the <em>Miller </em>test adopted by <em>Ebert </em>found the material at issue to be obscene and, therefore, without the ambit of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The Constitution of the United States forbids the Congress <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the States <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to pass any ex post facto law. The Declaration of Rights to the Constitution of Maryland imposes a similar limitation on the legislature of Maryland.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The short answer to appellants\u2019 contention is that the proceeding here was civil. The constitutional prohibitions are not applicable to civil proceedings, but to legislation pertaining to criminal offenses. An ex post facto law within the contemplation of the constitutional prohibitions is one which, in its operation, makes that criminal which was not so at the time the action was performed, or which increases the punishment, or, in short, which, in relation to the offense and its consequences, alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage. Clark &amp; Marshall, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Crimes </em>(7th Ed.) \u00a7 1.06, pp. 37-42. See, Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2nd Ed.), p. 9; 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure </em>(1957) \u00a7 20; <em>Hochheimer\u2019s Criminal Law </em>(1st Ed.), \u00a7 66; <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(4th Ed.) \u201cex post facto law\u201d, and cases therein cited. As for the Maryland constitutional prohibition see <em>Braverman v. Bar Association, </em>209 Md. 328; <em>Bannister v. Bannister, </em>181 Md. 177; <em>Diamond Match Co. v. State Tax Commission, </em>175 Md. 234; <em>Elliott v. Elliott, </em>38 Md. 357; <em>Harrison v. State, </em>22 Md. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>We observe, however, that in <em>Hamling, </em>despite the many significant questions regarding the definition and determination of obscenity which it answered, the Court deemed the principal question presented by the case to be \u201cwhat rules of law shall govern obscenity convictions had prior to the date on which this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller v. California, supra, </em>and its companion cases were handed down, but which had not at that point become final.\u201d 418 U. S., at 98. The Court in <em>Jenkins </em>said that what was held in <em>Hamling </em>was that \u201cdefendants convicted prior to the announcement of our <em>Miller </em>decisions but whose convictions were on direct appeal at that time should receive any benefit available to them from those decisions.\u201d 418 U. S. at 155. It seems in both <em>Hamling </em>and <em>Jenkins, </em>that although the convictions were prior to the <em>Miller </em>decisions, the Supreme Court resolved each appeal in the light of the <em>Miller </em>decisions. Further, <em>Village Books, Inc., et al. v. State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>263 Md. 76, concerned, as does the case here, an injunction under the authority of Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 418A. It was issued by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County in early 1971. The Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the lower court in part upon determining, upon its independent constitutional appraisal, that certain material was hard core pornography, applying the <em>Memoirs </em>test. Upon certiorari the Supreme Court reversed and, by its mandate of 25 July 1973, remanded the case to the Court of Appeals of Maryland for further consideration in the light of the <em>Miller </em>decisions and <em>Heller v. New York, supra, Roaden v. Kentucky, supra, </em>and <em>Alexander v. Virginia, </em>413 U. S. 836. By its order of 10 October 1973 the Court of Appeals asserted that it had so reconsidered its opinion and judgment. It found simply that they should be reaffirmed and ordered that its judgment \u201centered on October 13, 1971 ... be, and it is hereby reinstated and reaffirmed.\u201d <em>Village Books, Inc., et al. v. State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>269 Md. 748. Here the determination of obscenity by the lower court in the first instance was in the light of the <em>Miller </em>decisions as adopted by <em>Ebert. </em>Under the rationale of the Supreme Court in its remand of <em>Village Books, Inc., et al. v. State\u2019s Attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>263 Md. 76, and the subsequent action of the Court of Appeals, we see no violation of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Appellants thirdly ask: \u201cIn an obscenity-per <em>se </em>proceeding, is the State required to introduce expert testimony to rebut that offered by the Appellants, that the questioned literary materials would not appeal to a prurient interest and did contain serious literary, scientific and social value?\u201d The answer is now clear. As we have indicated, expert testimony is not necessary to enable the trier of fact to judge the obscenity of material which has been placed in evidence. Nor is the trier of fact bound to accept the opinion of any expert in weighing the evidence of obscenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Appellants lastly ask: \u201cAre the twenty-four (24) books and magazines constitutionally protected?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">By agreement only 24 publications of the items seized were offered in evidence. The appellants\u2019 expert witness, Dr. Leonard Rothstein,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> placed the exhibits in four categories: (1) 12 paperback pocket books, not illustrated and supposedly fictional; (2) 7 magazines containing photographs, drawings and written material; (3) 3 publications, nonfiction, containing numerous photographs, both color and black and white; (4) 2 comic books. Following the <em>Miller </em>guidelines, the court found that \u201call twenty-four exhibits are obscene under the new definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">We have reviewed independently the constitutional fact of obscenity. We find that each of the publications depicts and describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way in that it contains patently offensive representations and descriptions of ultimate sex acts, normal and perverted, actual and simulated, and of masturbation and of lewd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>exhibitions of genitals. We find further that, taken as a whole, none of the publications has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, and that the average person applying contemporary standards of the community or vicinage would find each of them to appeal to the prurient interest in sex. In oral argument before us counsel for appellants referred to the publications as \u201cgarbage.\u201d That is a fair characterization as far as it goes. They are fulsome and noisome, and more to the point, they are hard core pornography, screaming for all to hear that they are obscene. See <em>Village Books, Inc., et al. v. State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>263 Md. 76, 85-86; <em>Donnenberg, et al. v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 591, 600; <em>Levin v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 139, 144-146. As long as material may be legally beyond the pale of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, these publications must be denied constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">On our viewing and reading of the publications here placed in evidence, we hold that each of them could, as a matter of constitutional law, be determined to be outside the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it is obscene. We, therefore, agree with the findings of the court below and affirm its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\n<em>Order of 16 November 1973 affirmed; costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-10\">. <em>Paris Adult Theatre I v.

Section 6 (a) of the statute commands the Board to approve and license films which are \u201cmoral and proper\u201d and to disapprove such \u201cas are obscene, or such as tend, in the judgment of the Board, to debase or corrupt morals or incite to crimes.\u201d The criteria of a tendency to debase or corrupt morals and to incite to crime have heretofore been declared invalid on constitutional grounds by judicial decision. <em>Dunn v. Maryland State Board of Censors, </em>240 Md. 249, 252-254. The only valid standard for disapproval of a film under the statute, therefore, is obscenity. <em>Sanza v.

S., at 25. The Court in <em>Jenkins </em>commented, 15 Cr. L. at 3261: \u201cIt would be wholly at odds with this aspect of <em>Miller </em>to uphold an obscenity conviction based upon a defendant\u2019s depiction of a woman with a bare midriff, even though a properly charged jury unanimously agreed on a verdict of guilty.\u201d The Court, upon its own view of the film in <em>Jenkins </em>was satisfied that it could not be found under the <em>Miller </em>standards to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, nothing in the movie falling within either of the two examples in <em>Miller, </em>nor there being anything sufficiently similar to such material to justify similar treatment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">. \u201cNo ... ex post facto Law shall be passed.\u201d Constitution of the United States, Art.
