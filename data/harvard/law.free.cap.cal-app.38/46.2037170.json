Upon this information he was duly arraigned, and admitted the prior conviction, but entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charge set forth in detail in the information; whereupon his case was set for trial. At the time set for the hearing, the defendant appeared in court, withdrew his plea of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d pleaded \u201cguilty, \u201d and asked for probation. The court thereupon dismissed the charge of prior conviction, but denied the request for probation, and continued the case for four days for sentence. When the ease was again called, the defendant, through new counsel, requested permission to withdraw his plea of \u201cguilty\u201d and to plead \u201cnot guilty.\u201d This request was denied. Whether such denial constituted error is the sole question presented for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">According to the showing made by the prosecution upon the hearing of this motion the defendant had confessed that he was guilty of the'offense chained, and it also appears from the record that he was an old offender; that in the matter of changing from \u201cnot guilty\u201d to \u201cguilty\u201d he had not been imposed upon in any way, and realized fully the consequence of his act. It is clear that he speculated upon the anticipated clemency of the trial judge, and it was not until he learned that his expectation in this behalf would not be realized that he attempted to retract his plea of \u201cguilty.\u201d The motion was addressed to the discretion of the court, and, under the circumstances of the case, it not being shown that there was any abuse of discretion, the action of the court must stand. <em>(People v. </em>Dabner, 153 Cal. 398, [95 Pac. 880]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>114 Cal. 10, [45 Pac. 986] ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cimini, </em>53 Wash. 268, [101 Pac. 891].)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
