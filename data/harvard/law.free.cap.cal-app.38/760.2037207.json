In this behalf he alleges that he is an Italian and can neither read, write, nor speak English. However, the fact was clearly established that the petitioner was directed to go to the St. Francis Hospital and the address was given in writing. These facts do not show any neglect or refusal on the part of the Company to furnish the petitioner hospital service. Yet it is clear that the commission could not make an award to petitioner for such services except it be first shown that the Company had neglected or refused to furnish such service. (Stats. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>1913, p. 279, sec. 15, subd. a.) The respondent Commission did not exceed its jurisdiction in refusing the petitioner an award. Its order is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Lennon, P.
