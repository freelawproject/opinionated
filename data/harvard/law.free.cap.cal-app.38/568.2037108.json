An order was made, however, allowing him fifteen days in which to file a brief and the attorney-general notified appellant\u2019s counsel to that effect. No brief has been filed and no application for extension of time has been made. We are justified in concluding, therefore, that the learned counsel for appellant can find no reasonable ground for urging a reversal of the judgment. Notwithstanding this virtual abandonment of the appeal, we have examined the record and find that the evidence is overwhelming and conclusive that the defendant committed a deliberate, cold-blooded murder, and that he was justly convicted of the offense. In fact, he admitted the crime in all its gruesome details, and the only defense was of a technical character.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The interests of justice demand the affirmance of the judgment of conviction, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
