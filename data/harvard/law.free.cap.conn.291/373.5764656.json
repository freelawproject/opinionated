We agree with the trial court that the defendant was ineligible for consideration under \u00a7 21a-283a because he previously had received a sentence departure under \u00a7 21a-283a. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. In 2004, the defendant\u2019s father arranged to sell a large quantity of marijuana to his friend, Robert Mellilo. Unbeknownst to either the defendant or his father, Mellilo had been arrested for the sale of narcotics and was cooperating with the statewide narcotics task force as an informant. Sergeant John Mucherino of the statewide narcotics task force, who was supervising Mellilo\u2019s cooperation with law enforcement officials, instructed Mellilo to contact the defendant\u2019s father for the purpose of purchasing 100 pounds of marijuana. In the course of setting up the transaction, the defendant communicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>several times with Mellilo, who ultimately arranged to have the defendant deliver the marijuana to him at a location in the city of Waterbury.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">On August 4, 2004, the defendant met Mellilo behind a motel in Waterbury. While the two men were engaged in conversation, Mucherino instructed his team to move in and arrest the defendant. A search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle revealed six bales of marijuana in the trunk. The state subsequently filed an information in the Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury (Waterbury case), charging the defendant with possession of four ounces or more of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> sale of marijuana by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b), and conspiracy to sell marijuana by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 2 la-278 (b) and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Following his arrest in the Waterbury case, the defendant agreed to cooperate with law enforcement officials, and he informed them that there was more marijuana located at his place of business, Mohawk Motors in the city of Torrington. Upon searching the premises of Mohawk Motors, the police discovered five additional bales of marijuana weighing approximately 100 pounds. Thereafter, the state filed an information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>in the Superior Court in the judicial district of Litchfield (Litchfield case), charging the defendant with possession of marijuana with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b), and conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (b) and 53a-48. The charges in the Litchfield case pertained only to the five bales of marijuana that had been concealed at the premises of Mohawk Motors.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The defendant proceeded to trial in the Litchfield case, and, on February 21, 2006, a jury found him guilty as charged. Following the jury verdict, the defendant filed a motion under \u00a7 21a-283a for a departure from the mandatory minimum sentence that the court otherwise would have been required to impose. The trial court, <em>Gill, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion and, on November 28, 2006, imposed a suspended prison sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">After the jury had returned its verdict in the Litchfield case, but before the court imposed sentence in that case, the defendant entered an <em>Alford </em>plea in the Waterbury case to one count of sale of marijuana by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 2 la-278 (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With the agreement of the trial court, <em>Iannotti, J.,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the sentencing in the Waterbury case was postponed until after the defendant had been sentenced in the Litchfield case. Several days after his sentencing in the Litchfield case, the defendant filed a motion in the Waterbury case pursuant to \u00a7 21a-283a, seeking a sentence of less than the mandatory minimum five year prison term prescribed under \u00a7 21a-278 (b). The trial court denied the motion, concluding that, because the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>already had received a sentence departure under \u00a7 21a-283a in the Litchfield case, he was not eligible for a second such departure in the Waterbury case. On December 8, 2006, the trial court rendered judgment of conviction, sentencing the defendant to the mandatory minimum term of five years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly determined that, because he already had received the benefit of the sentence departure provisions of \u00a7 21a-283a in the Litchfield case at the time of his sentencing in the Waterbury case, he was ineligible to receive a second such departure in the Waterbuiy case. We reject the defendant\u2019s contention because it conflicts with the plain meaning of \u00a7 21a-283a.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim raises an issue of statutory inteipretation over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Stiffler </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>288 Conn. 38, 42, 950 A.2d 1270 (2008). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine the meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We turn first, therefore, to the relevant text of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-283a, which provides: \u201c[W]hen sentencing a person convicted of a violation of any provision of this chapter ... for which there is a mandatory minimum sentence . . . the court may, upon a showing of good cause by the defendant, depart from the prescribed mandatoiy minimum sentence, provided the provisions of this section have not previously been invoked on the defendant\u2019s behalf . . . .\u201d The state contends that the only plausible reading of this statutory language is that if, at the time of a defendant\u2019s sentencing for a drug related offense, he already has received the benefit of a sentence departure under \u00a7 21a-283a, he is ineligible to utilize that provision a second time. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). We ordinarily look to the dictionary definition of a word to ascertain its commonly approved usage. See, e.g., <em>Jim\u2019s Auto Body </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>285 Conn. 794, 808, 942 A.2d 305 (2008). For present purposes, \u201cwhen\u201d means \u201c[a]t the time that\u201d; American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (3d Ed. 1992); \u201cprevious\u201d is defined as \u201c[e]xisting or occurring before something else in time or order\u201d or \u201cprior\u201d; id.; and \u201cinvoke\u201d means to \u201cuse or apply . . . .\u201d Id. As used in \u00a7 21a-283a, these words, like the other operative language of that statute, are plain and unambiguous as applied to the factual scenario presented: if, at the time of sentencing, the defendant has not used \u00a7 21a-283a on a prior occasion, the court has the discretion to depart from the prescribed mandatory minimum sentence, provided, of course, that the other requirements of \u00a7 21a-283a have been met. It is undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>puted, however, that the defendant in the present case received the benefit of \u00a7 21a-283a when he was sentenced in the Litchfield case on November 28, 2006. The court in that case departed from the statutorily prescribed mandatory minimum sentence by suspending the defendant\u2019s eight year sentence, five years of which would have been nonsuspendable but for the court\u2019s invocation of \u00a7 21a-283a. Because the defendant already had used \u00a7 21a-283ato receive a sentence departure in the Litchfield case several days prior to his sentencing in the Waterbury case on December 8, 2006, the trial court in the Waterbury case properly determined that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in his mandatory minimum sentence in that case under \u00a7 21a-283a.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Despite the clarity of \u00a7 21a-283a, the defendant contends that the words \u201chave not previously been invoked\u201d in \u00a7 21a-283a do not relate temporally to the time of sentencing. Under the defendant\u2019s reading of the statute, the determinative date is not the date of sentencing in the Waterbury case but, rather, the date on which the defendant entered his <em>Alford </em>plea in that case. Thus, the defendant claims that he was entitled to have the trial court consider a sentence departure under \u00a7 2 la-283a because he previously had not invoked that provision on April 13, 2006, the date on which he entered his <em>Alford </em>plea in the Waterbury case. The defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 21a-283a, however, has no basis in the plain statutory language, which unambiguously provides that a court may consider a sentence departure thereunder if, \u201cwhen sentencing\u201d a person convicted of a drug offense, the provisions of \u00a7 21a-283a \u201chave not previously been invoked on . . . behalf\u2019 of that person. General Statutes \u00a7 21a-283a. It is perfectly clear, therefore, that a defendant is not entitled to invoke \u00a7 21a-283a in a particular case if, at the time of his sentencing in that case, he already has availed him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>self of the benefit of that statute. Because it is undisputed that the defendant received the benefit of \u00a7 21a-283a when the court in the Litchfield case imposed a suspended sentence in that case on November 28, 2006, the trial court in the Waterbury case properly determined that the defendant, having previously invoked \u00a7 21a-283a, was not eligible to use it again in the Waterbury case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The defendant maintains that the interpretation he advances finds support in our decision in <em>State </em>v. Nowell, 262 Conn. 686, 817 A.2d 76 (2003), in which we held that \u00a7 21a-283a does not apply retroactively to persons who had committed an offense prior to the effective date of the statute but who were sentenced for that offense after the effective date. Id., 703. In reaching our conclusion, we explained that there is nothing in the language or history of \u00a7 21a-283a to indicate that the legislature intended to deviate from the general rule that substantive statutory provisions are to be applied prospectively; id., 702-703; and that, in determining \u201cwhether application of a particular [statute] to a criminal defendant would constitute retroactive application, we look to the law in effect on the date [that] the defendant committed his offenses.\u201d Id., 702. The defendant contends that, in light of our conclusion in <em>Nowell </em>that the date of sentencing did not control the determination of whether the defendant in that case was entitled to invoke the provisions of \u00a7 21a-283a, the date of sentencing also is not determinative with respect to the issue of whether \u00a7 21a-283a \u201cpreviously\u201d has been invoked. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, our analysis and conclusion in <em>Nowell </em>are wholly inapposite to the issue presented in this appeal because <em>Nowell </em>involved the entirely different issue of whether \u00a7 21a-283a has prospective or retroactive applicability. Indeed, there is nothing in <em>Nowell </em>that casts even the slightest doubt on the import of the straightforward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>statutory language, that is, a defendant is deemed to have used \u00a7 21a-283a on a previous occasion, thereby exhausting his eligibility thereunder, if the defendant had invoked the provision in another case at any time prior to sentencing in the second or subsequent case.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The defendant also claims that, even if \u00a7 21a-283a is plain and unambiguous as applied to the facts of this case, its application leads to a bizarre or arbitrary result. In essence, the defendant contends that, because the offenses in the Litchfield and Waterbury cases were so closely related, the legislature reasonably could not have intended a result pursuant to which the defendant\u2019s invocation of \u00a7 21a-283a in the former case would deprive him of the right to invoke that provision in the latter case. The defendant also posits a number of hypothetical fact patterns that he claims would yield unfair and unanticipated results, including a scenario in which the state induces a person to commit crimes in different jurisdictions solely for the purpose of depriving him of the opportunity to have the cases consolidated in one jurisdiction, with the result that he will be required to exhaust his eligibility under \u00a7 21a-283a in one jurisdiction before his subsequent sentencing in a second jurisdiction. The mere fact that the defendant can conceive of one or more situations in which it might seem harsh to apply \u00a7 21a-283a in accordance with its plain language does not mean that application of that language leads to bizarre, unworkable or arbitrary results. Moreover, to the extent that the defendant complains about the alleged unfairness of being charged in two different jurisdictions merely because the state, through Mellilo, opted to have the first transaction consummated in Waterbury, the defendant\u2019s argument is fundamentally flawed because the defendant seeks to shift to the state the blame for his own decision to commit separate and distinct crimes in both Waterbury</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>and Torrington.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the state used Mellilo as it did for the purpose of depriving the defendant of the opportunity to avail himself of the benefit of \u00a7 21a-283a in this or any other case. In other words, the defendant cannot invoke the provisions of \u00a7 21a-283a in the Waterbury case because he previously had invoked them in the Litchfield case, and for no other reason.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s contention that applying the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 21a-283a to the facts of this case leads to a result that is bizarre, unworkable or arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\"> <em>North Carolina v.
