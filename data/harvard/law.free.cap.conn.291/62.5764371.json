On appeal, the petitioner claims that: (1) he was denied due process of law when the first habeas court declared a mistrial after receiving most of the evidence; (2) he was denied due process of law when the second habeas court denied his petition based, in part, on its reliance on the transcripts from the petitioner\u2019s first habeas corpus trial to which both parties had stipulated; (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to present two exculpatory witnesses; (4) the second habeas court improperly failed to consider all of the evidence in denying the petitioner\u2019s claim of actual innocence; and (5) he was denied due process of law as a result of numerous delays during the proceedings concerning his petitions for habeas relief. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The opinion of the Appellate Court from the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal of his criminal conviction sets forth the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cThe [petitioner] was a member of a gang that sold illegal narcotics in New Haven. For several weeks preceding the death of the victim, Richard Coleman, the [petitioner\u2019s] gang was involved in a dispute with Shelton Tucker, Sean Green and Rodney Lewis over control of the drug trade on Arthur Street. On December-29, 1989, at approximately 6:30 p.m., several members of the [petitioner\u2019s] gang, including the [petitioner], his brother Troy Mozell, Eric Morton, Ronald Douglas and Matthew Bowden arrived at Arthur Street in a gray Jeep Cherokee. Meanwhile, Tucker and Lewis were walking across Arthur Street toward Tucker\u2019s residence at 2 Arthur Street. The victim, a bystander, was walking past Tucker\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u201cAs Tucker and Lewis crossed Arthur Street, the [petitioner], together with Morton and Bowden, exited the Jeep carrying handguns. Tucker and Lewis noticed the vehicle and the gunmen and began to run toward Tucker\u2019s residence. The trio chased Tucker and Lewis and simultaneously fired their weapons at them several times. To avoid the gunshots, Tucker and Lewis hid behind a vehicle that was parked in front of Tucker\u2019s house. When the shooting ceased, Tucker and Lewis saw that the victim was lying on the sidewalk in front of 6 Arthur Street. The victim was struck in the chest by a single nine millimeter bullet and died later that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u201cTucker and Lewis informed Detective Samuel Cotto of the New Haven police department that Troy Mozell and other members of the [petitioner\u2019s] gang were responsible for the shooting. Lewis specifically named Robert Henderson and Douglas, and described a third participant as \u2018a kid in a green jacket.\u2019 The New Haven police obtained search warrants for Henderson\u2019s apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>ment at 288 Front Street, the [petitioner\u2019s] apartment at 16 Peck Street and the gray Jeep Cherokee that was owned by the [petitioner\u2019s] mother, Alice Mozell. The police recovered two loaded nine millimeter ammunition clips from Henderson\u2019s apartment, six live nine millimeter cartridges from the [petitioner\u2019s] apartment, and a green jacket from inside the Jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u201cThe police initially arrested only Troy Mozell and Douglas. At a probable cause hearing on February 27, 1990, Tucker was called to testify. While testifying, Tucker saw the [petitioner] sitting in the courtroom gallery among several other spectators and recognized him as one of the shooters. Tucker\u2019s identification of the [petitioner] led police to investigate further and resulted in the [petitioner\u2019s] arrest.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mozell, </em>40 Conn. App. 47, 49-50, 668 A.2d 1340, cert. denied, 236 Conn. 910, 671 A.2d 824 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The record reveals the following additional undisputed facts and procedural history. After the jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (a) and 53a-48 (a), and manslaughter in the second degree as an accessory in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1) and 53a-8 (a). Thereafter, the petitioner filed a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction, and the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">On May 10, 2001, the petitioner filed a second amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The first habeas court, <em>Levine, J., </em>began trial on the petition on October 10, 2001. On September 17, 2002, that court declared a mistrial, giving no reason for its decision and, subsequently, denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration. On April 13, 2005, the petitioner filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. A second habeas hearing commenced on September 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>2006, and on January 24, 2007, the habeas court, <em>Hon. Anthony V. DeMayo, </em>judge trial referee, denied the petition for habeas corpus. Thereafter, on February 5, 2007, that court granted the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The petitioner first claims that he was deprived of his right to due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution in his first habeas trial when, after having heard testimony from all but two witnesses, the habeas court declared a mistrial. Specifically, the petitioner argues that, because there was no legitimate reason for the declaration of a mistrial, the habeas court\u2019s order declaring a mistrial was arbitrary and, therefore, constituted an abuse of discretion. The respondent, the commissioner of correction, first contends that the petitioner\u2019s claim is moot because the petitioner subsequently received a second habeas trial and, therefore, this court cannot grant the petitioner any practical relief. In the alternative, the respondent argues that the petitioner\u2019s claim must fail because the record is inadequate for review. Because the petitioner did not raise his claim at trial, he seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We conclude that this claim is inadequately briefed for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">We first address the respondent\u2019s argument that the petitioner\u2019s claim is moot because he received a second habeas trial and, therefore, he cannot receive any practi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>cal relief in this appeal. \u201cIt is axiomatic that when events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through a disposition on the merits, the case is moot and must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Blesso Fire Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eastern Connecticut State University, </em>245 Conn. 252, 256, 713 A.2d 1283 (1998); <em>In re Romance M., </em>229 Conn. 345, 357, 641 A.2d 378 (1994). In the present case, however, the petitioner claims that the mistrial declared in his first habeas trial affected the fairness of his second habeas trial because the second habeas court relied, in part, on transcripts from the first habeas trial in rendering its decision. Therefore, if the petitioner can prevail on his claims regarding the second habeas court\u2019s reliance on the transcripts from the first habeas trial, he can receive practical relief in the form of a new habeas trial. Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s claim is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Turning to the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim, we begin by setting forth our well settled standard of review. \u201cWhile the remedy of a mistrial is permitted under the rules of practice, it is not favored. [A] mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated. ... If curative action can obviate the prejudice, the drastic remedy of a mistrial should be avoided. . . . On appeal, we hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. The trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his function is to assure a fair and just outcome. . . . The trial court is better positioned than we are to evaluate in the first instance whether a certain occurrence is prejudicial to the defendant and, if so, what remedy is necessary to cure that prejudice. . . . The decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the sound discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tion of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Higgins, 265 Conn. 35, 75-76, 826 A.2d 1126 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Under <em>Golding, </em>a party \u201ccan prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the [petitioner] of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the [respondent] has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. In the present case, the first habeas court\u2019s order stated: \u201cThe court hereby declares a mistrial in the above referenced matter,\u201d without providing any further explanation for its actions. Because the petitioner failed to move for an articulation of the habeas court\u2019s declaration, the record is inadequate for review. Accordingly, we decline to review the petitioner\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The petitioner next claims that he was denied his right to due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution when the second habeas court, in denying his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, relied, in part, on the transcribed testimony from the petitioner\u2019s first habeas hearing. Although the petitioner acknowledges that both parties stipulated to the second habeas court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>reliance on that testimony, the petitioner nonetheless argues that: (1) the stipulation was inadequate; and (2) his waiver of his right to a new trial was not given knowingly and voluntarily. The petitioner claims, therefore, that he is entitled to a new trial. In response, the respondent argues that the habeas court\u2019s reliance was proper in light of the petitioner\u2019s waiver of his right to a new trial. Because the petitioner did not raise his claim at trial, he seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, and the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We conclude that the petitioner effectively waived this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">At the outset, we recognize that, when a right has been affirmatively waived at trial, we generally do not afford review under either <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>281 Conn. 469, 482, 915 A.2d 872 (2007), we concluded that \u201cunpreserved, waived claims, fail under the third prong of <em>Golding . </em>. . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly, we agree with the decisions of the Appellate Court that, \u201c[j]ust as a valid waiver calls into question the existence of a constitutional violation depriving the defendant of a fair trial for the purpose of <em>Golding </em>review, a valid waiver also thwarts plain error review of a claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Corona, </em>69 Conn. App. 267, 274, 794 A.2d 565, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 935, 802 A.2d 88 (2002). \u201c[The] [p]lain [e]rror [r]ule may only be invoked in instances of forfeited-but-reversible error . . . and cannot be used for the purpose of revoking an otherwise valid waiver. This is so because if there has been a valid waiver, there is no error for us to correct. . . . The distinction between a forfeiture of a right (to which the [p]lain [e]rror [r]ule may be applied) and a waiver of that right (to which the [p]lain [e]rror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>[r]ule cannot be applied) is that [wjhereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 274-75; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>52 Conn. App. 802, 809-10, 729 A.2d 778 (1999). On the basis of the record from the second habeas hearing, we decline to review the petitioner\u2019s claim under either <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine because we conclude that the petitioner waived his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that a criminal defendant may waive rights guaranteed to him under the constitution. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 478]. The mechanism by which a right may be waived, however, varies according to the right at stake. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>288 Conn. 770, 778, 955 A.2d 1 (2008). For certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver. . . . For other rights, however, waiver may be effected by action of counsel. . . . <em>New York </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>528 U.S. 110, 114, 120 S. Ct. 659, 145 L. Ed. 2d 560 (2000); see also <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>553 U.S. 242, 247-48, 128 S. Ct. 1765, 170 L. Ed. 2d 616 (2008).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>289 Conn. 598, 620, 960 A.2d 993 (2008). \u201cWhen a party consents to or expresses satisfaction with an issue at trial, claims arising from that issue are deemed waived and may not be reviewed on appeal. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Holness, </em>289 Conn. 535, 544-45, 958 A.2d 754 (2008) (holding that defendant waived [claim under <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), that trial court improperly admitted recording of conversation in violation of confrontation clause of federal constitution] when counsel agreed to limiting instruction regarding hearsay statements introduced by state on cross-examination); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabrica-tore, </em>supra, [481] (concluding defendant waived claim when he not only failed to object to jury instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>but also expressed satisfaction with it and argued that it was proper).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In the present case, both the petitioner and his counsel affirmatively agreed to have the second habeas court render a decision, in part, on the basis of the former testimony adduced at the first habeas trial, stipulating to their agreement at the beginning of the second habeas trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At that time, and in the presence of the petitioner, the respondent asserted that the petitioner\u2019s three primary habeas witnesses, Henderson, Tucker and Thomas Sanders, were all still living in the community and subject to subpoena. Thereafter, the respondent requested that the habeas court canvass the petitioner and ascertain his waiver of his right to have the witnesses recalled. Prior to the court\u2019s canvass, the petitioner\u2019s attorney stated that he had explained \u201cthe pluses and the serious minuses\u201d of recalling the witnesses, including the concern that any subsequent testimony could be impeached by the witnesses\u2019 former testimony from the first habeas trial, and that this was a \u201c[mjajor risk.\u201d Thereafter, the habeas court canvassed the petitioner as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">\u201cThe Court: But ... I want you [the petitioner] to . . . indicate to me whether you are in agreement with your counsel\u2019s position, namely, that I will take the transcripts of the mistrial and all that testimony that came in in that case plus what we hear today. And that\u2014and then decide if on the basis of that, ehminating the need for starting the case all over again, and bringing those people back, and bringing you back as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201cAnd as counsel points out, any time a person\u2019s called back to testify, his previous testimony is available in that transcript, and he can be cross-examined on any inconsistencies. And that\u2019s one of his reasons for preferring this route. And I just want to be sure that you concur in that decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">\u201c[The Petitioner]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">\u201cThe Court: You do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201c[The Petitioner]: Yeah. I don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. You\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">\u201c[The Petitioner]: I don\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Under the circumstances of the present case, it is clear that the petitioner has waived his claims that his stipulation to the use of the transcribed testimony was inadequate and that his waiver of his right to a new trial was not given voluntarily. The record reveals that the petitioner\u2019s decision to stipulate to the court\u2019s use of the transcribed testimony, thereby waiving his right to a new habeas trial, was not only voluntary and knowing, but also intentional and strategic. \u201cTo allow the [petitioner] to seek reversal now that his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to induce potentially harmful error, and then ambush the state with that claim on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricators, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 480-81. Accordingly, because the petitioner waived his claim, we decline review under <em>Golding </em>and the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The petitioner\u2019s third claim on appeal is that the second habeas court improperly rejected his claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in his criminal trial in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and arti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>cle first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution because his trial counsel, Thomas Farver, failed to present two allegedly exculpatory witnesses, namely, Henderson and Sanders. The petitioner contends that Henderson\u2019s testimony would have rebutted that of the state\u2019s only witness to testify to having heard the petitioner confess to the shooting, and that Sanders, an alleged eyewitness to the shooting, would have testified that the petitioner was not one of the gunmen. The respondent counters that the second habeas court properly denied the petition because the decision not to present the testimony of Henderson and Sanders was a reasonable tactical decision in light of: (1) the theory of the defense, which implicated Henderson; and (2) the substantial opportunities that the state would have had to impeach both Henderson and Sanders, given both the inconsistencies in their statements and their affiliation with the Island Brothers gang, of which the petitioner was a member. We agree with the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The following summary of the testimony presented at both the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial and the first habeas trial is relevant to the petitioner\u2019s claims. At the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, Douglas, a member of the Island Brothers gang, testified that, after the shooting had occurred, the petitioner and Bowden, another gang member, entered Henderson\u2019s apartment, where Henderson and others were playing cards. Douglas testified that, upon hearing that someone had been killed in the shootout, the petitioner and Bowden began arguing over who had fired the fatal shot. Douglas also testified that Daryl Jackson was among those present during this \u201cconfession.\u201d To rebut Douglas\u2019 testimony, Farver called Jackson and Bowden. According to Farver\u2019s offer of proof, Jackson would testify that he was not at Henderson\u2019s apartment on the night in question and that he did not hear any such conversation. Because Jackson was recovering from an unrelated gunshot wound at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the time of the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, however, Farver filed a motion for a continuance. The trial court denied the motion for a continuance, which the petitioner unsuccessfully challenged on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mozell, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 52-55. Farver did call Bow-den, who testified that he had gone to the scene of the shooting on Arthur Street, accompanied by only Douglas and Morton. He also testified that he never went to Henderson\u2019s apartment after the shooting and, accordingly, did not see the petitioner there.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Both Henderson and Sanders testified at the petitioner\u2019s first habeas trial. Henderson testified that he was present at his apartment after the shooting, and that the petitioner was not there and had never confessed to the crime. Henderson also testified that he was the leader of the Island Brothers gang at the time of the shooting, knew that he was a suspect in this case and that he had other charges pending against him at the time of the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. When asked what he would have said if he had been called as a witness at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, Henderson responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Sanders testified at the first habeas trial that he was an eyewitness to the shooting and that the petitioner was not among those involved. Sanders testified that he had seen Morton and Douglas on Arthur Street moments prior to the shooting. Moreover, although Sanders initially denied ever having given a statement to police regarding the incident, he later admitted to having provided the police with a statement when counsel confronted him with a transcript and an audiotape recording of his statement. In that statement, Sanders indicated that he had observed Tucker and Lewis approach his position and that, based on a prior incident with the two men, Sanders believed the two men were about to fire shots at him. Accordingly, he testified that he took cover and, as a result, did not actually witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the shooting. Sanders also testified that he was currently serving a sentence for a felony conviction. Finally, when asked what he would have testified to at the time of the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, Sanders responded, \u201cI just told you that I am not sure. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Later, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have cooperated back then. I don\u2019t know if I would have said that I was a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">During the second habeas trial, Farver testified as to why he did not call either Henderson or Sanders. With respect to Henderson, Farver stated that: (1) the petitioner, who was a good friend of Henderson, informed him that Henderson would not cooperate; (2) the attorney who was representing Henderson on another charge told him that Henderson would not cooperate; and (3) the defense might benefit from attempting to implicate Henderson as the offender because he had a motive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to Sanders, Farver testified that, after reading Sanders\u2019 statement to police, he concluded that Sanders was not a witness to the actual shooting. Moreover, Farver testified that the petitioner had informed him that, at the time of trial, Sanders was a fugitive from justice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">We begin with the applicable standard of review and the law governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims. \u201cThe habeas court is afforded broad discretion in making its factual findings, and those findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The application of the habeas court\u2019s factual findings to the pertinent legal standard, however, presents a mixed question of law and fact, which is subject to plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Mullaney, </em>286 Conn. 655, 661, 945 A.2d 442 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u201cA criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance of counsel at all critical stages of criminal proceedings. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>[466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.

The claim will succeed only if both prongs are satisfied.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Mullaney, </em>supra, 286 Conn. 661-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In denying the petition, the second habeas court concluded that Farver\u2019s performance was not deficient, specifically finding that Farver had been \u201cprepared for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>trial, [had] conducted a vigorous defense of a weak case and [had] performed throughout at a high level.\u201d In support of its conclusions, the habeas court stated that the testimony of Henderson and Sanders would not have added anything to the petitioner\u2019s trial and, in fact, would have done more harm than good. Specifically, the habeas court noted that the testimony of Henderson and Sanders was inconsistent: Henderson stated that Morton was one of the three gunmen who had come to his apartment after the shooting, whereas Sanders testified that Morton was not one of the shooters. Moreover, the habeas court noted that, by the time Henderson and Sanders had testified at the habeas trial, it was convenient to inculpate Douglas, Bowden and Morton, all of whom already had pleaded guilty to offenses stemming from the shooting. Additionally, with respect to Henderson, the habeas court found that: (1) Farver had been informed, both by the petitioner and by Henderson\u2019s attorney, that Henderson would not have cooperated; (2) Henderson was the leader of a drug dealing gang; (3) Henderson had a felony record; (4) Henderson knew the petitioner had been charged with the murder but never had come forward to police; and (5) it was unclear whether, if called, Henderson would even have testified. With respect to Sanders, the habeas court found that Sanders\u2019 testimony was considerably undermined by his denial of having given a prior statement to the police, until an audiotaped statement was played and he subsequently admitted to having made the statement. The second habeas court found that Sanders\u2019 habeas testimony also contradicted his statement to the police. In the statement, Sanders stated that he did not witness the shooting, but at the hearing, he testified that he had witnessed the shooting from start to finish. Moreover, Sanders had a felony record. In short, the second habeas court found the testimony of both Henderson and Sanders to be \u201ccontrived and not credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>On the basis of the record before us from both the petitioner\u2019s first and second habeas hearings, it is clear that Farver\u2019s performance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. \u201cAs a general rule, a habeas petitioner will be able to demonstrate that trial counsel\u2019s decisions were objectively unreasonable only if there [was] no . . . tactical justification for the course taken.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Bliden, </em>443 F.3d 238, 247 (2d Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1257, 127 S. Ct. 1383, 167 L. Ed. 2d 168 (2007); see also <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 689 (petitioner \u201cmust overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Eze </em>v. <em>Senkowski, </em>321 F.3d 110, 129 (2d Cir. 2003) (\u201cthe decision not to call a witness must be grounded in some strategy that advances the client\u2019s interests\u201d). In the present case, Farver\u2019s decision not to call either Henderson or Sanders was well within the realm of sound trial strategy. Farver vigorously opposed the admission of evidence relating to gang membership and gang activity. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mozell, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 50-52. The decision not to call Henderson, the former leader of the gang, and Sanders, whose gang affiliated drug dealing activities were presented as the motivation for the shooting, was entirely consistent with the theory of defense to exclude mention of gang involvement. Moreover, Farver intended to \u201cpoint a finger\u201d at Henderson, who, as Sanders\u2019 half brother, had an apparent motivation to commit the crime. Faiver concluded that it would have been unwise to ask a jury to believe Henderson\u2019s testimony while simultaneously asking the jury to believe that Henderson was a guilty party. In addition, as the habeas court\u2019s findings reveal, Henderson and Sanders\u2019 testimony likely would have done more harm than good, as both were gang members with felony records, and their sto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ries were inconsistent as to the identity of the shooters. Accordingly, we conclude that the habeas court properly determined that the petitioner had failed to establish that Farver\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The petitioner next claims that the second habeas court improperly rejected his claim of actual innocence because it failed to consider all of the evidence, namely, the recanted testimony of Tucker, the witness who initially had identified the petitioner as one of the shooters. In support of his claim, the petitioner notes that: (1) there was confusion as to whether Tucker\u2019s testimony was included in the transcripts provided to the habeas court; (2) the habeas court failed to mention the recantation in its memorandum of decision; and (3) in its memorandum of decision the habeas court referred to the testimony of Henderson and Sanders as the only newly discovered evidence. The respondent argues that the petitioner failed to establish that the habeas court did not consider Tucker\u2019s testimony. We agree with the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u201cIn <em>Miller v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>242 Conn. 745, 747, 700 A.2d 1108 (1997), this court held that the proper standard for evaluating a freestanding claim of actual innocence, like that of the petitioner, is twofold. First, the petitioner must establish by clear and convincing evidence that, taking into account all of the evidence\u2014both the evidence adduced at the original criminal trial and the evidence adduced at the habeas corpus trial\u2014he is actually innocent of the crime of which he stands convicted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, the petitioner must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>also establish that, after considering all of that evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom as the habeas court did, no reasonable fact finder would find the petitioner guilty of the crime.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Rowland, </em>263 Conn. 453, 475, 820 A.2d 1009 (2003).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The petitioner\u2019s claim that the second habeas court failed to consider all of the evidence is speculative. There is no evidence in the record, despite some initial confusion about the exhibits, to establish that the habeas court never reviewed the December 13, 2001 transcript, which contained Tucker\u2019s recanted testimony. Moreover, the evidence presented fails to demonstrate that the petitioner is actually innocent of the crimes of which he stands convicted. At best, the totality of Tucker\u2019s habeas testimony is contradictory and inconclusive on the question of whether the petitioner was present at the shooting. The purpose of presenting Tucker\u2019s testimony at the habeas trial was to give Tucker the opportunity to recant his earlier identification of the petitioner as one of the shooters. To this effect, Tucker testified that, on the night in question, he did not see the petitioner get out of the Jeep, did not see the petitioner on the street and did not see the petitioner either before or after the shooting. Prior to this testimony, however, when asked whether he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>able to see the faces of the individuals who got out of the Jeep, Tucker responded, \u201cNo.\u201d This assertion severely undermines the thrust of Tucker\u2019s testimony and does nothing to call into question the other evidence presented against the petitioner at his criminal trial, including the identification of the petitioner by another eyewitness, Stacy Bethea, or the testimony of Douglas, concerning inculpating statements allegedly made by the petitioner and Douglas after the shooting regarding who had fired the fatal shots. Finally, for the same reasons outlined in part III of this opinion, we conclude that the \u201cexculpatory\u201d testimony of Henderson and Sanders is insufficient to establish the petitioner\u2019s innocence by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The petitioner\u2019s final claim on appeal is that delays that have drawn out the proceedings on his habeas petitions for a period of nearly ten years<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> have denied him due process of law under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8,10 and 12, of the Connecticut constitution, access to the courts and the right to petition for a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>of habeas corpus. Because the petitioner did not raise this claim at trial, he seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We decline to review the petitioner\u2019s claim under <em>Golding </em>because the record largely is devoid of reasons explaining the nearly ten year delay in a manner appropriate to afford appellate review. For example, we do not know why there was a nearly three year gap between the declaration of a mistrial in the first habeas proceeding and the commencement of the petitioner\u2019s second habeas trial. The record reveals only that, during those three years, the petitioner\u2019s third counsel withdrew shortly after the mistrial and that the petitioner\u2019s fourth counsel filed an amended petition. Because neither the petitioner nor any of the petitioner\u2019s attorneys testified with respect to the reason for any delays, we also do not know whether part of that passage of time, for example, had been the result of a strategic decision to attempt to discover more exculpatory evidence, an oversight on the part of the petitioner\u2019s counsel, a refusal to cooperate on the part of the petitioner or any other potential reasons for which trials are delayed. While a ten year delay is troubling on the face of the matter, the appropriate course of action would have been to raise the claim in the habeas court. In view of the inadequate record, we decline to afford <em>Golding </em>review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-10\"> The petitioner appealed from the judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-9\"> The respondent argues that <em>Golding </em>review is inapplicable in all circumstances that arise from an appeal from the judgment of a habeas court. We disagree. Inasmuch as the petitioner challenges the actions of the habeas court itself, we conclude that <em>Golding </em>review is applicable.

See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>101 Conn. App. 465, 470-71, 922 A.2d 221 (2007). Because the respondent does not challenge the petitioner\u2019s claim on those grounds and the habeas court proceeded as if the evidence was newly discovered, we are not called upon to resolve this question.

The petitioner\u2019s initial special public defender moved to withdraw as counsel on January 25, 1999, due to a personal conflict of interest. On January 14, 2000, the petitioner\u2019s replacement counsel also moved to withdraw due to her assignment to the public defender\u2019s office, which apparently had a conflict of interest with the petitioner. The initial habeas trial commenced on October 10, 2001. The habeas court received the testimony of various witnesses over the course of six nonconsecutive days, which lasted through April 3, 2002. On September 17, 2002, the first habeas court declared a mistrial. Following the mistrial, the petitioner\u2019s third counsel moved to withdraw as counsel, and the motion was granted on September 19, 2003. The petitioner\u2019s fourth habeas counsel, Salvatore Adamo, was appointed on November 5, 2003. Attorney Adamo filed an amended petition on April 13, 2005. The petitioner\u2019s second habeas trial commenced on September 12, 2006, whereupon the second habeas court received the testimony of the remaining two witnesses.
