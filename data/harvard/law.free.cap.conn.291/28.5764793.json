We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant and Lynn Bossert, the victim, began living together in 1993. During their relationship, he was gainfully employed as a draftsman for Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. As their relationship continued, the defendant grew suspicious about the victim\u2019s fidelity, and when she became pregnant, he questioned whether he was the father of the baby. In March, 2003, the victim gave birth to a girl, two months premature. The victim and the defendant later hired a nanny, Delores Sowa, to care for the baby while both parents worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">On September 11, 2003, the defendant arrived home from work at approximately 5:50 p.m., took over the care of the baby and received the daily report from Sowa before she left. When the victim arrived home, she and the defendant, along with the baby, went to a previously scheduled counseling session with a family and marriage therapist, Julie M. Sowell, whom the couple had been seeing for the previous five months. The counseling session ended at 7:45 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Sometime after 9 p.m. that evening, the defendant and the victim had an altercation in their home, during which the defendant pushed the victim and then strangled her to death. In strangling the victim, the defendant used both of his hands and a dog leash. The strangulation caused extensive petechial hemorrhaging and edema, which indicated that force had been applied to the victim\u2019s neck for a prolonged length of time. The defendant stopped applying pressure to the victim\u2019s neck only after she had ceased struggling. He then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ripped a locket from the victim\u2019s neck and left her body lying on the floor in a pool of blood. Sometime thereafter, the defendant wrote what appeared to be a suicide note to his friends and family.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">At about 7:05 a.m. the following morning, the defendant telephoned Sowa, who was due to arrive shortly before 7:30 a.m., and told her not to come to the house because he was staying home from work that day. Sowa asked to speak with the victim, but the defendant said that she was in the shower. The defendant then put the baby in his car and drove to his parents\u2019 home. As soon as he arrived, he realized that he had forgotten the baby\u2019s diaper bag and returned to his house. There, he packed up the baby\u2019s things, including diapers, wipes, bottles and formula, and returned to his parents\u2019 home. The defendant\u2019s father met him in the driveway, where the defendant told his father that he and the victim had had a fight, that he had pushed her and that \u201cshe might be dead.\u201d When the two entered the house with the baby, the defendant\u2019s father awakened his wife and told her that the defendant had said that \u201c[the victim] might be dead.\u201d The defendant went into the bathroom and began sobbing. The defendant\u2019s father left his house to check on the victim. After discovering the victim lying dead on the floor surrounded by blood, he telephoned the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">While the defendant waited at his parents\u2019 home with his mother, the police surrounded the home. Major Peter Warren of the state police telephoned the house and asked to speak with the defendant. The defendant fully understood and complied with Warren\u2019s instructions to come out of the front door of the house slowly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Once outside, the defendant followed additional instructions that he was given, and he was arrested without further incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Following his arrest, the defendant was brought to the police station where he gave a statement to state police Detectives Richard Covello and Brian Van Ness. During the interview, the defendant made several incriminating and remorseful statements. He stated that he did not deserve help because of what he had done to the victim. Then, slumped over with his head down, he began crying. Later, in response to a question regarding what in his past he regretted most, the defendant said, \u201ctaking [the victim\u2019s] life.\u201d The defendant admitted to killing the victim, and forensic examination of the victim\u2019s fingernail clippings revealed skin scrapings consistent with the defendant\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The record discloses the following additional facts. At trial, the defendant presented two affirmative defenses: that he suffered from a mental disease or defect and that he suffered from an extreme emotional disturbance. In support of those defenses, he offered the testimony of Marvin Zelman, a board certified psychiatrist. Zelman testified that, on February 24, 2003, the defendant went to the police complaining of depression and paranoia. The police brought the defendant to Waterbury Hospital for an emergency psychiatric examination, which resulted in the defendant\u2019s inpatient treatment for nine days and subsequent outpatient treatment. According to the hospital records, the defendant reported that, although he had been prescribed psychiatric medications for mental illness, he had not been taking those medications for the past year. The hospital diagnosed the defendant as having major depression, recurrent, with psychosis. While at the hospital, the defendant initially was prescribed Haldol, an antipsychotic medication, but later was prescribed Risperdal, another anti-psychotic medication effective in the treatment of both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and Remeron, an antidepressant. The defendant was discharged from the hospital on March 4, 2003, despite his physician\u2019s conclusion that he was, at the time of discharge, a danger to himself and to others. Although he was supposed to remain on his psychiatric medications, in the weeks after his discharge, the defendant gradually reduced and then discontinued taking his medications. In the days before the victim was killed, the defendant suffered from paranoid delusions, believing, in part, that he was being investigated at work for the crash of a helicopter designed by the company. The defendant told Zelman that he had killed the victim because he was angry at her for cheating on him with her former husband or one of his coworkers. Zelman testified that, in his opinion, on the date of the killing, the defendant was \u201cpsychotic, and [that] the nature of his illness is schizoaffective disorder, depressive type.\u201d In his opinion, the strangulation was a product or byproduct of the defendant\u2019s mental illness. Zelman explained: \u201c[The defendant] was severely disturbed. He was psychotic, out of touch with reality, incapable of making judgments, reasonable judgments, and mentally ill at the time and this is how he responded to a provocation.\u201d In Zelman\u2019s opinion, the events between the time the defendant was discharged from the hospital and the night on which the victim was killed represented a \u201cpsychiatric perfect storm. . . . You have one of the sickest people combined with the worst treatment and that\u2019s what really happened. ... All he needed was a stressor and multiple stressors occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Zelman underscored that, in his view, the defendant was unable to control his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the murder charge, and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. This direct appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In his first claim on appeal, the defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury to consider whether the state had proven the elements of murder before considering the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses of mental disease or defect<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and extreme emotional disturbance; see footnote 1 of this opinion; \u201ceffectively told [the jury] to disregard evidence of insanity insofar as it might have shed light on whether the defendant acted with the necessary mens rea.\u201d The defendant contends that the instruction impaired his constitutional right to present a defense and that it diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof on the element of specific intent. The defendant acknowledges that he did not raise an objection before the trial court, and, accordingly, seeks to prevail on this unpreserved claim under either <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The state responds that the defendant\u2019s claim fails to satisfy the second prong of <em>Golding </em>because, as this court has stated, \u201can instructional omission with respect to an affirmative defense such as legal insanity does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Slate v. Wilson, </em>242 Conn. 605, 632, 700 A.2d 633 (1997); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreshaw, </em>214 Conn. 540, 546, 572 A.2d 1006 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Suggs, </em>209 Conn. 733, 751, 553 A.2d 1110 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 196-97, 502 A.2d 858 (1985). Should this court reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, the state maintains that: the instruction was correct; the defendant \u201cconflates the analytic distinction [that exists] between mental status as it relates to the insanity defense and mental status as it relates to intent to engage in criminal conduct\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Mullaney, </em>286 Conn. 655, 664, 945 A.2d 442 (2008); and, because the trial court told the jury to consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the killing in deciding the issue of intent, the instructions did not prohibit the jury from considering the defendant\u2019s mental condition, which predominated the trial, as one of those circumstances. We conclude that, under the circumstances of the present case, the defendant cannot satisfy the second prong of <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine, and we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The record discloses the following additional pertinent facts. In its preliminary instructions prior to the commencement of evidence, the trial court gave the jury an overview of both the charged crime of murder and the affirmative defenses of mental disease or defect and extreme emotional disturbance. In instructing on murder, the court read the statutory offense and explained the elements, including specific intent. In its subsequent instructions on the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, the court read the relevant statute; see footnote 4 of this opinion; and explained that the jury would not consider this defense if it did not find that the state had proven the charge of murder. The trial court then turned to the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, gave a brief overview of the defense, read the relevant statute; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and explained that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>consideration of this defense would depend on its findings. In so instructing, the court remarked to the jury that, \u201c[o]bviously, in this particular case, the mental state of the defendant at the time of these acts that are charged by the state is crucial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">To aid the jury in its final deliberations, in accordance with <em>numerous </em>discussions the trial court had had with the parties at the close of evidence and the copy of the proposed instructions the court had given counsel during its charging conference; see Practice Book \u00a7 42-19; the trial court then provided a flow chart to the jury. That chart directed the juiy first to consider the charge of murder and to consider the affirmative defenses, first mental disease or defect and then extreme emotional disturbance, only if the jury concluded that the state had proved all of the elements of murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Consistent with the sequence in the flow chart, the court first instructed the jury on the crime of murder and the specific intent element of that crime. The court then instructed on the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, followed by the defense of extreme emotional disturbance. Within its charge, the court specifically instructed the jury to follow its flow chart and to consider first whether the state had proven its charge and then to consider the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses. Additionally, the court outlined the four possible verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">At the conclusion of the court\u2019s instructions, the court provided the jury with a verdict form that reflected the opposite sequence. The form required the jury first to consider whether the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect. If the jury concluded that the defendant did not so suffer, it was then to consider whether the defendant had acted under extreme emotional disturbance. Only if the jury answered these two questions in the negative did the jury reach the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>whether the defendant had committed the crime of murder. After a three day weekend break and prior to deliberations, however, the court briefly reviewed its charge to the jury, including the order in which the jury was to consider the issues in reaching those verdicts consistent with the flow chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">As the defendant concedes, he never objected to the sequence of the instructions, the flow chart, the explanation of the possible verdicts or anything else related to the specific intent or affirmative defense instructions. We conclude that under the circumstances of the present case, the defendant cannot satisfy <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Although it is well settled that an instructional impropriety with respect to an affirmative defense such as legal insanity does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 632; we understand the defendant\u2019s claim more broadly. He recognizes that the court gave an otherwise proper instruction on his affirmative defenses and that it is generally the duty of the court to structure the jurors\u2019 deliberations in a manner that permits them to perform in an orderly fashion their fact-finding function in relation to the charged crime and any defenses. He further appreciates that there is a distinction under our case law between mental status as it relates to the insanity defense and mental status as it relates to intent to engage in criminal conduct. He suggests, nevertheless, that we should reexamine that concept, contending that the jury likely was confused by the sequence in which the court directed it to consider the evidence so that it did not consider mental status evidence relevant to the affirmative defenses when considering the intent element of the crime. We conclude that, even if we were inclined to agree that our law in this area should be reconsidered, the present case is not an appropriate one in which to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>We begin with a very brief overview of the affirmative defenses at issue. The affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, otherwise known as the insanity defense, is codified in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13. See footnote 4 of this opinion. This defense has both a cognitive and a volitional prong. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 613. \u201cUnder the cognitive prong [of the insanity defense], a person is considered legally insane if, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity ... to appreciate the . . . [wrongfulness] of his conduct. . . . Under the volitional prong, a person also would be considered legally insane if he lacks substantial capacity ... to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Extreme emotional disturbance, an affirmative defense that reduces the crime of murder to manslaughter, is codified in \u00a7 53a-54a (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201c[I]t shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be ... .\u201d See footnote 1 of this opinion. This court offered the following guidance on the application of this defense in (State v. <em>Zdanis, </em>182 Conn. 388, 390-91, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1981): \u201cIn determining whether the defendant has established the affirmative defense of an extreme emotional disturbance by a fair preponderance of the evidence as a mitigation of murder to manslaughter, the trier of fact must find that: (a) <em>the emotional disturbance is not a mental disease or defect that rises to the level of insanity as defined by the penal code-, </em>(b) the defendant was exposed to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>extremely unusual and overwhelming state, that is, not mere annoyance or unhappiness; and (c) the defendant had an extreme emotional reaction to it, as a result of which there was a loss of self-control, and reason was overborne by extreme intense feelings, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation or other similar emotions. Consideration is given to whether the intensity of these feelings was such that his usual intellectual controls failed and the normal rational thinking for that individual no longer prevailed at the time of the act.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We previously have recognized that there is a \u201crisk that a juiy may have difficulty in understanding the distinction between mental status as it relates to the defense of insanity and mental status as it relates to intent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Joyner, 225 Conn. 450, 461 n.5, 625 A.2d 791 (1993). That difficulty in part stems from the conclusion reached by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 205-207, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1977), that sanity is not an element of the crime in a criminal prosecution. Although we have suggested that \u201c[w]hatever risk of confusion may be engendered by this distinction must be addressed by an appropriate jury instruction\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>supra, 461 n.5; as with any jury instruction claim, we must examine the issue or issues before the jury, including what was undisputed, and examine the charge \u201cin view of the factual posture of the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 569, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In the present case, as his brief to this court elucidates, the defendant relied on the volitional prong of \u00a7 53a-13. The psychiatric evidence portrayed him as a severely disturbed psychotic who lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to societal standards. In essence, there was no assertion that the defendant did not fully intend to strangle the victim until she was dead, only that he could not stop himself. On the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>of that theory, however, a finding of intent to kill would not have undermined the jury\u2019s ability to consider and indeed believe the evidence offered in support of the defendant\u2019s theory of his affirmative defense under \u00a7 53a-13. Additionally, the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant specifically had intended to kill the victim, but that the defendant\u2019s extreme emotional disturbance resulted in a loss of self-control. Thus, the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses in no way challenged the intent element of the crime. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s repeated failures to object to the sequence that the trial court directed the jury to follow in its deliberations, despite direct inquiries from the trial court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as well the defendant\u2019s express adoption of this sequence in his closing argument<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> indicate that the defendant\u2019s theory of the case at trial was not the one that he advances on appeal. The evidence offered in support of the affirmative defenses advanced at trial simply was not relevant to his specific intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">There may be a case in which a defendant\u2019s insanity defense evidence actually challenges the intent element of the crime, one in which the defendant\u2019s mental state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>is such that he intends to engage in the conduct for which he is charged, but, because of a mental disease or defect or his extreme emotional state, does not act with the specific intent required for the charged offense. By way of example, if an accused intentionally engaged in conduct\u2014the stabbing of a person\u2014but, because of his mental state, thought he was stabbing a piece of meat, the jury\u2019s function to assess whether the state had proved the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt would require it to consider his affirmative defense evidence in concert with its assessment of his intent. In other words, the affirmative defenses in that case would intersect with an essential element of the offense. That situation, however, is not at issue in the present case, as no evidence had been introduced at trial reflective of that scenario. Thus, irrespective of the order in which the jury was directed to consider the affirmative defenses, that sequence did not either dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof on the element of intent for the crime charged or undermine the defendant\u2019s ability to present evidence relevant to that element. Accordingly, although the defendant struggles mightily to invoke <em>Golding </em>review and the plain error doctrine, he cannot prevail under either.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In his second claim on appeal, the defendant asserts that the trial court improperly admitted a statement by his mother in which she states that he essentially admitted the crime to her. The defendant claims that the statement was introduced in violation of his confrontation rights under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. The state agrees that the trial court violated those rights but contends that the impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The record discloses the following additional undisputed facts. The state subpoenaed the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>mother, Joan Madigosky, to testify. When she failed to appear due to illness, the state offered her statement to police detective David Edwards \u201cbased on her purported inability to be here and the residual exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d The defendant objected, claiming that the statement violated his confrontation rights, but the trial court overruled his objection. Thereafter, the state introduced into evidence Joan Madigosky\u2019s statement, in which she described the events that had unfolded at her home the morning after the murder and recounted the defendant\u2019s statements admitting that he had pushed the victim and that he was sure she was dead.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u201cUnder <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>[541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004)], the hearsay<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> statements of an unavailable witness that are testimonial in nature may be admitted under the sixth amendment\u2019s confrontation clause only if the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Hearsay statements that are nontestimonial in nature are not governed by the confrontation clause, and their admissibility is governed solely by the rules of evidence. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, [823-24, 126 S. Ct. 2266], 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (2006). Thus, the threshold inquiry for purposes of the admissibility of such statements under the confrontation clause is whether they are testimonial in nature. Because this determination is a question of law, our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>280 Conn. 361, 378, 908 A.2d 506 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u201cIn <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court declined to spell out a comprehensive definition of testimonial .... Instead, the court defined a testimonial statement in general terms: A solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact. . . . The court did note, however, three formulations of th[e] core class of testimonial statements . . . [1] ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent\u2014that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially ... [2] extrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions . . . [and 3] statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>285 Conn. 162, 169-70, 939 A.2d 1105, cert. denied, 553 U.S. 1085, 128 S. Ct. 2885, 171 L. Ed. 2d 822 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In the present case, the state concedes that introduction of the statement violated the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights because it was testimonial, as a consequence of police interrogation, and the defendant had not had an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. We agree. Therefore, the only issue is whether the state can sustain its burden of proof that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>284 Conn. 328, 377, 933 A.2d 1158 (2007) (\u201c[i]f an [eviden-tiary] impropriety is of constitutional proportions, the state bears the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u201cWhether a constitutional violation is harmless in a particular case depends upon the totality of the evidence presented at trial. ... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>275 Conn. 785, 832, 882 A.2d 604 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1025, 126 S. Ct. 1578, 164 L. Ed. 2d 309 (2006). \u201cWhether such error is harmless in a particular- case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Conn. 231, 254, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996). In order to assess the harmfulness of the impropriety, \u201cwe review the record to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence . . . complained of might have contributed to the conviction . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gerardi, </em>237 Conn. 348, 362, 677 A.2d 937 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Although the state did not state expressly the purpose for which it offered the statement, the state\u2019s closing argument indicates that its purpose was to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s remorse following the killing, which the state argued was relevant to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the wrongfulness of his conduct. Indeed, the defendant agrees that the statement \u201cshowed [him] reacting in a sober, guilt-ridden manner in the wake of the victim\u2019s death . . . .\u201d There was, however, ample evidence of the defendant\u2019s remorse that properly was admitted, thereby making his mother\u2019s statement cumulative. The note the defendant wrote to his family and friends after he strangled the victim; see footnote 2 of this opinion; demonstrated remorse at a time even closer to the act. Additionally, testimony about the defendant\u2019s remorse from his father related to the same events and time period in his mother\u2019s statement. Finally, testimony also established that the defendant had demonstrated remorse when he broke down crying in his interview at the police station and when he told the police how much he regretted what he had done and that he did not deserve help because of what he had done to the victim. Therefore, the statement of the defendant\u2019s mother was cumulative in that it was only one of several pieces of evidence that the jury heard demonstrating that the defendant had \u201creact[ed] in a sober, guilt-ridden manner in the wake of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>death . . . .\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 39-40, 770 A. 2d 908 (2001) (\u201ccorroborative testimony was merely cumulative and was therefore harmless\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 529, 539 A.2d 80 (1988) (one factor to be considered in determining whether improper ruling on evidence is harmless error is \u201cwhether the testimony was cumulative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Furthermore, there was ample other evidence corroborating the defendant\u2019s controlled behavior following the strangulation of the victim, which the jury evidently relied on to reject the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses: the note the defendant wrote after strangling the victim, which clearly reflected his knowledge of what he had done; his telephone call to Sowa to cancel her services and his excuse for why the victim could not come to the telephone; and his gathering and organizing his child\u2019s things before driving her to his parents. Against this backdrop, we conclude that the introduction of the statement by the defendant\u2019s mother was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Lastly, the defendant claims that comments by the trial court constituted judicial impropriety that deprived him of a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant contends that \u201c[t]he record . . . reveals numerous instances of the trial court interceding, both in and out of the jury\u2019s presence, in the merits of trial to interrupt and rebuke defense counsel,\u201d which the defendant claims demonstrated the court\u2019s animus.

Otherwise, the defendant has offered blanket citations to various pages or sequences of pages of the transcript. Of the three instances that the defendant cites, none rises even remotely to the level of judicial impropriety.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, lacking citation to the specific language complained about in connection with the appropriate legal analysis, this claim is inadequately briefed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>256 Conn. 291, 312-13, 772 A.2d 1107 (\u201cThe defendant\u2019s argument regarding this subject is inadequately briefed. Although the standard for prosecutorial misconduct in this regard is set forth, the defendant fails to cite specific language as examples of his claims that the state improperly commented on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify or that the defendant was misusing his pro se status.\u201d), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1068, 122 S.

In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . . Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly. ...
