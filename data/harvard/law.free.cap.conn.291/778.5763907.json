The sole issue in this appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence of forty-seven years in consideration of the defendant\u2019s postsentence testimony for the state against one of his codefendants, Keith Foster, during Foster\u2019s trial. Because we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for modification of his sentence, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The state charged the defendant by substitute information with felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 53a-92 (a) (2),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and conspiracy to commit sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-70 (a) (1) and (3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant pleaded guilty as to all three counts, and pursuant to a plea agreement, agreed with the state to a sentencing range of thirty-five to fifty years. In January, 2005, the trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of forty-seven years in prison. In February, 2006, state police officers approached the defendant and asked if he would be willing to cooperate with the state in the prosecution of two codefendants, Foster and June Bates Seger. On March 28, 2006, the state and the defendant entered into an agreement pursuant to which the defendant agreed, among other things, to testify at Foster\u2019s trial. In exchange, and only upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>completion of the proceedings against Foster and Seger, the state agreed to consent to a sentence modification hearing pursuant to \u00a7 53a-39 (b), at which the state would apprise the court of the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s truthful cooperation. The defendant testified at Foster\u2019s trial; subsequent to Foster\u2019s conviction, Seger pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">At the beginning of the defendant\u2019s sentence modification hearing on July 11, 2007, the trial court informed the parties that, in preparation for the hearing, it had reviewed the defendant\u2019s sentencing memorandum and amended sentencing memorandum, the transcript of the defendant\u2019s plea, the letter of agreement between the state and the defendant and the transcripts of the defendant\u2019s testimony during Foster\u2019s trial. The state did not oppose the defendant\u2019s motion and, as required by the agreement, informed the court of the defendant\u2019s cooperation at Foster\u2019s trial, stating that the defendant had provided \u201cevidence that was probative on the issue [s] of planning, cooperation, conspiracy, motive, sexual assault, kidnapping and murder.\u201d The court also heard statements from the victim\u2019s mother, Cynthia Measles, and the victim\u2019s two sisters, Jennifer Johnson and Victoria Measles, all of whom opposed any sentence reduction. The court issued a brief memorandum of decision on July 13, 2007, denying the defendant\u2019s motion for modification of his sentence and offering the following explanation: \u201cThe court, after consideration of the arguments of counsel and review of the transcripts, finds that the sentence as imposed, based on the heinous nature of this crime and the [defendant\u2019s] involvement, is fair, just and reasonable.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal to reduce his sentence in light of his postsentence cooperation in the prosecution of Foster constituted an abuse of discretion. The state responds that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>was not required to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence and that the court acted within its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We never have reviewed a trial court\u2019s judgment granting or denying a motion to modify a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 53a-39 (b). As with all sentencing decisions, however, \u201cwhen the sentence imposed is within the limits fixed by statute for the offenses charged,\u201d we review the court\u2019s determination for abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>224 Conn. 347, 370, 618 A.2d 513 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>168 Conn. 623, 638, 362 A.2d 813 (1975). Moreover, in arriving at its sentencing determination, the sentencing court \u201cmay appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information [it] may consider or the source from which it may come. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 47, 561 A.2d 897 (1989). That this broad discretion applies with equal force to a sentencing court\u2019s decision regarding a sentence modification is supported by the wording of \u00a7 53a-39 (b), which provides in relevant part that \u201cthe sentencing court or judge <em>may, </em>after hearing and for good cause shown, reduce the sentence, order the defendant discharged, or order the defendant discharged on probation or conditional discharge for a period not to exceed that to which the defendant could have been originally sentenced.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">\u201cIn determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>286 Conn. 367, 377, 944 A.2d 276 (2008). Generally speaking, under this deferential standard, \u201c[w]here the trial court has properly considered all of the offenses proved and imposed a sentence within the applicable statutory limitations, there is no abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>It is undisputed that the original sentence imposed by the trial court was within the applicable statutory limitations and within the thirty-five to fifty year sentencing range agreed upon by the state and the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant nonetheless claims that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to refuse to reduce his original sentence. That claim, however, is not reconcilable with the broad discretion conferred upon a sentencing court. Although \u00a7 53a-39 (b) provides that the trial court <em>may </em>reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cfor good cause shown, \u201d the statute does not limit the information a court may consider in determining whether a defendant has shown good cause for the requested modification, nor does it suggest that the court\u2019s discretion is somehow limited. In arriving at its decision to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a modification of his sentence, the trial court engaged in the type of broad inquiry that we have deemed appropriate in sentencing determinations. See <em>State </em>v. Anderson, supra, 212 Conn. 47. Despite the brevity of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, the record demonstrates that the court\u2019s decision was based on a thorough review of <em>all </em>of the relevant information. Specifically, the court stated at the beginning of the sentence modification hearing that it had considered the defendant\u2019s sentencing memo-randa, the transcript of the defendant\u2019s plea and sentencing hearings, the letter of agreement between the defendant and the state, and the transcripts of the defendant\u2019s testimony at Foster\u2019s trial. During the modification hearing, the defendant detailed the extent of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>cooperation with the state, arguing that he should receive some \u201cconsideration\u201d for that cooperation. Also during the hearing, the state acknowledged the value of the defendant\u2019s testimony, and admitted that the cooperation of codefendants had been necessary in order for the state to obtain a conviction against Foster. The state further acknowledged that the evidence provided by the defendant was probative on the issues of \u201cplanning, cooperation, conspiracy, motive, sexual assault, kidnapping and murder.\u201d The state also pointed out, however, that the defendant originally had been charged with capital felony, and that the sentence the defendant ultimately received as a result of the original plea bargaining process was substantially less than the sentence that he otherwise could have faced. See footnote 7 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The court\u2019s statement in its memorandum of decision that it had arrived at its determination \u201cafter consideration of the arguments of counsel and review of the transcripts\u201d further emphasizes that the court considered all of the relevant materials, including the transcripts of the defendant\u2019s testimony at Foster\u2019s trial. The memorandum of decision also reveals, however, that of all the relevant information considered by the court, it ultimately considered the \u201cheinous nature of this crime and the [defendant\u2019s] involvement,\u201d to be the determining factor in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for modification of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">It was not an abuse of discretion for the court to rely on the horrific nature of this crime in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for modification. We have reviewed the materials relied on by the sentencing court, including the transcripts of the defendant\u2019s plea and sentencing hearings, and the defendant\u2019s testimony at Foster\u2019s trial. All of these materials attest to the heinous nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>of this crime.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This information was just as relevant at the modification hearing as it was during the defendant\u2019s original sentencing. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining, based on the nature of this crime, that the defendant\u2019s original sentence was \u201cfair, just and reasonable\u201d under the totality of the circumstances considered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for modification of his sentence was an abuse of discretion because the court\u2019s decision \u201cassigned no value\u201d to the defendant\u2019s postsentence cooperation with the state. Put another way, the defendant appears to argue that because his original sentence was determined prior to his cooperation with the state, his subsequent cooperation <em>required </em>that the sentencing court reduce his sentence, and that the court had discretion only as to the amount of the reduction. Any other result, according to the defendant\u2019s logic, signifies that the trial court gave no consideration at all to the defendant\u2019s postsentence cooperation. In connection with this claim, the defendant also contends that the only information that the trial court could consider in determining whether to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to modify his sentence was new information that had not been available during the original sentencing hearing because the information that had been available to the court at the time of sentencing already had been factored into the defendant\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">We find the defendant\u2019s argument unpersuasive. His claim relies on the fact that the court\u2019s memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>of decision did not state expressly why the court had determined that the defendant\u2019s postsentence cooperation was insufficient to justify a reduction of his sentence. The defendant conceded at oral argument before this court, however, that he did not file a motion for articulation of the memorandum of decision. Moreover, as we already have noted, the memorandum of decision, although brief, stated that the court considered the arguments of counsel and the transcripts in arriving at its decision. Thus, although the court did not explain precisely why it had considered evidence of the defendant\u2019s cooperation insufficient to justify a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence, it is clear from the memorandum of decision that the court considered that cooperation in ruling on the motion. The memorandum of decision also clearly stated the basis for the court\u2019s denial of the motion\u2014the heinous nature of the crime and the defendant\u2019s involvement in it. A reasonable interpretation of the memorandum of decision is that the court considered the defendant\u2019s cooperation, but deemed that cooperation insufficient, in light of the heinous nature of the crime, and the fact that the defendant was a main actor in the kidnapping, rape and murder of the victim, to justify a reduced sentence. This reading is consistent with the court\u2019s conclusion, following the modification hearing, that the original sentence imposed was \u201cfair, just and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">As part of his claim that only his postsentence cooperation was relevant, the defendant points out that it was the only evidence not factored into his original sentence. He appears to claim that, because the only postsentence development is one that would support a more lenient sentence, he was entitled to a reduction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There are several premises underlying the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>argument, however, that are irreconcilable with the broad discretion exercised by a sentencing court. First, the defendant presupposes that the court could not examine the entire record in determining whether his postsentence cooperation justified a sentence modification, and was limited to considering only information that had been unavailable during the original sentencing, and, therefore, could not consider the facts of the crime, as well as the defendant\u2019s subsequent attempts to cover up the murder, in ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion. This premise is completely at odds with the discretion possessed by a sentencing court. As we have stated previously in this opinion, that discretion is broad, as is the inquiry conducted by the sentencing court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 370-71; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 47. The court properly examined the totality of the circumstances in ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion. Second, the defendant presumes that, because he cooperated with the state, the court was obligated to grant his motion for modification, and had discretion only as to the amount of the reduction. The defendant cites to no authority for this proposition; nor does he make any attempt to reconcile this claim with the broad discretion of the sentencing court\u2014as he cannot. Lastly, even if we were to accept the defendant\u2019s claim that the court was limited to considering only information that was unavailable at the original sentencing, the defendant\u2019s argument would fail because there was new information available to the court that would have justified a denial of the defendant\u2019s motion. Specifically, during his testimony at Foster\u2019s trial, the defendant stated that he carried the victim to the river and held her feet while another codefendant stepped on her neck and held her head under water until she drowned. In the defendant\u2019s earlier accounts of the victim\u2019s murder, not only did he fail to admit participating in the actual killing of the victim, but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>also claimed that he was in the woods being sick when that codefendant murdered her.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is possible that the trial court\u2014in aproper exercise of its discretion\u2014could have given weight to the fact that the defendant\u2019s testimony at Foster\u2019s trial admits to a much greater and more culpable role in the murder of the victim. According to the defendant\u2019s logic, the trial court would have abused its discretion in doing so, even though the information that the defendant provided at Foster\u2019s trial was highly relevant information that the trial court did not have before it at the original sentencing. That contention, however, would be inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court properly could consider new information in ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39 (b) provides: \u201cAt any time during the period of a definite sentence of more than three years, upon agreement of the defendant and the state\u2019s attorney to seek review of the sentence, the sentencing court or judge may, after hearing and for good cause shown, reduce the sentence, order the defendant discharged, or order the defendant discharged on probation or conditional discharge for a period not to exceed that to which the defendant could have been originally sentenced.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court ...
