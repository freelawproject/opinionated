(Dominion), claiming that the operation of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station (Millstone), which is owned and operated by Dominion, is causing unreasonable pollution of the waters of the state in violation of the Connecticut Environmental Protection Act, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-14 et seq. (act). The plaintiff also claimed that she was entitled to relief under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-20<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>administrative proceeding pertaining to the renewal of Dominion\u2019s permit to discharge wastewater from Millstone into the Long Island Sound is inadequate to protect the rights recognized by the act. The defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing. The trial court treated the complaint as if it had been brought under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and concluded that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring an action under that provision. The trial court also concluded that \u00a7 22a-20 did not provide an independent cause of action. The trial court therefore granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and rendered judgment for the defendants. On appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly determined that (1) she lacks standing under \u00a7 22a-16, and (2) \u00a7 22a-20 does not provide an independent cause of action. We conclude that the plaintiff has standing under \u00a7 22a-16 to raise her claim that the existing permit renewal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>proceeding is inadequate to protect the rights recognized by the act, in accordance with \u00a7 22a-20. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts. Millstone is an electric generating facility that is located in Waterford and powered by two nuclear power generating units. During operation, Millstone withdraws water from Niantic Bay to cool the generating units and then discharges the water into the Long Island Sound. These activities are authorized by a permit (discharge permit) issued by the state department of environmental protection (department) pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342 and General Statutes \u00a7 22a-430.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The department originally issued the discharge permit in 1992 to Dominion\u2019s predecessor, Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (Northeast). On June 13, 1997, Northeast submitted to the department an application for renewal of the discharge permit. After Dominion purchased Millstone on March 31, 2001, the department approved the transfer of permits and authorizations for the operation of the facility from Northeast to Dominion, including an emergency authorization that the department had issued pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-6k.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The discharge per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>mit remained in effect pending disposition of the renewal application pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-182 (b) and 22a-430 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In August, 2006, the department issued its tentative draft decision to renew the discharge permit. Thereafter, the department received public comment on the draft decision, including correspondence from the plaintiff, in which she stated that, \u201cif Millstone is to be permitted to continue to operate, it must be ordered to convert to a closed-loop cooling system.\u201d In November, 2006, the plaintiff filed a notice of intervention in the permit renewal proceeding pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19, <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claiming, inter alia, that Millstone\u2019s operations would \u201centrain and impinge [marine life], a natural resource of vital import[ance] to the state, and thereby continue the process by which indigenous fish stocks have been devastated,\u201d that the operations would \u201ccontinuously release vast quantities of hot water [in]to the Long Island Sound, thereby directly endangering [marine life] and marine habitat and contribut[e] significantly to the warming of the Long Island Sound,\u201d and that \u201cimplementation of a closed cooling system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>in lieu of the current \u2018once-through\u2019 cooling system . . . would virtually eliminate waterborne adverse impacts to the marine environment . . . .\u201d The hearing officer allowed the plaintiff to intervene for the purpose of raising these claims but excluded numerous other claims that the plaintiff had made in her motion for intervention concerning Dominion\u2019s and the department\u2019s alleged collusion and past illegal activities, as well as the potentially adverse impact of radioactive pollution. The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration in which she claimed, inter alia, that the hearing officer\u2019s \u201cdecision manifests rank prejudice, prejudgment, legal error and extraordinary disregard for the letter and spirit of [the act].\u201d The hearing officer denied the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Thereafter, in March, 2007, the plaintiff brought the present action, alleging that (1) the water discharged from Millstone is polluted with toxic chemicals and radioactive byproducts of the nuclear fission process, (2) the water is discharged at a higher temperature than the ambient temperature of the water in the Long Island Sound, (3) the chemical and waste byproducts accumulate in the Niantic Bay and Jordan Cove, and contaminate the water and destroy marine life, (4) \u201c[a]t the reactor intakes, billions of microscopic and larger [marine life] are destroyed through entrainment and impingement annually,\u201d and (5) the facility has \u201cdevastated the populations of indigenous fish and other species . . . .\u201d The plaintiff also alleged that (1) the commissioner\u2019s predecessor, Arthur J. Rocque, Jr., \u201cbelieved [that] he lacked legal authority to issue and renew . . . \u2018emergency authorizations\u2019 but issued them nevertheless,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) the current commissioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Regina McCarthy, \u201chas permitted Millstone to operate pursuant to the illegal \u2018emergency authorizations\u2019 since her appointment,\u201d (3) the hearing officer assigned to the permit renewal proceeding ha[s] a conflict of interest and [is] biased, and (4) the department has prejudged the permit renewal application and has declined to consider the environmental impact of Millstone\u2019s discharge water.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought a temporary restraining order and a temporary injunction requiring Dominion to reduce Millstone\u2019s \u201cwater intakes to \u2018cold shutdown\u2019 levels from April 1 through May 15, 2007,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> an order that Dominion \u201cconvert Millstone to a closed cooling system . . . prior to 2010,\u201d and a judgment declaring that the existing administrative and regulatory procedures are inadequate for the protection of the rights recognized by the act. The plaintiff also sought an ex parte temporary restraining order directing Dominion to reduce water intakes to \u201c[c]old [shutdown\u201d levels from April 1 through May 15, 2007, and enjoining the administrative proceedings. The trial court, <em>Bryant, J., </em>denied the application for an ex parte temporary restraining order and scheduled a hearing on the plaintiffs request for a temporary injunction for March 19, 2007. On that date, however, the defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the court considered at that time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After the hearing but before the court, <em>Bryant, J., </em>had rendered a decision on the motions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>dismiss, the case was reassigned to the court, <em>Tanzer, J., </em>who conducted a second hearing on the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Thereafter, the trial court, <em>Tanzer, J.,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>granted the motions to dismiss. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that, \u201c[a]lthough the plaintiff did not identify \u00a7\u00a7 22a-16 and 22a-19 (a) by number or title in her complaint or supporting memoranda, the court [would] overlook this procedural error and address both sections.\u201d Relying on this court\u2019s decisions construing the standing requirements of \u00a7 22a-16, the trial court concluded that, because the conduct that the plaintiff alleged in her complaint arose out of a permitting proceeding, the plaintiff lacked standing. E.g., <em>Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>267 Conn. 116, 148, 836 A.2d 414 (2003) (\u201c[when] the alleged conduct involves a permitting claim . . . there is no standing pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16 to bring the claim directly in the Superior Court\u201d). The court also concluded that \u00a7 22a-20 did not provide an independent cause of action. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">This appeal followed. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly determined that she lacked standing under \u00a7 22a-16 and that \u00a7 22a-20 does not create an independent cause of action. Although we conclude that \u00a7 22a-20 does not create an independent cause of action, we also conclude that the plaintiff has standing under \u00a7 22a-16 to raise her claim that the existing permit renewal proceeding is inadequate to protect the rights recognized by the act, in accordance with \u00a7 22a-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Because a proper understanding of the applicable statutory scheme is necessary for our resolution of this matter, we first consider whether \u00a7 22a-20 creates an independent cause of action and, if not, the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>that statute. This issue presents a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Commission, </em>284 Conn. 268, 294, 933 A.2d 256 (2007). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 294-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">We begin with the relevant language of the statute: \u201cSections 22a-14 to 22a-20, inclusive, shall be supplementary to existing administrative and regulatory procedures provided by law .... Any person entitled to maintain an action under said sections may intervene as a party in all such procedures. Nothing herein shall prevent the maintenance of an action, as provided in said sections, to protect the rights recognized herein, where existing administrative and regulatory procedures are found by the court to be inadequate for the protection of the rights.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-20. The plaintiff contends that the latter two sentences of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>quoted portion of the statute implicitly authorize an independent cause of action under any of the sections referred to in the first sentence, including \u00a7 22a-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">We are not persuaded. First, as a purely linguistic matter, nothing in the latter two sentences authorizes any person to bring an action. Rather, the sentences merely refer to actions that <em>are </em>authorized by the act. Second, it is readily apparent that several of the sections listed in the first sentence of \u00a7 22a-20 do <em>not </em>create independent causes of action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, a comparison of the language of \u00a7\u00a7 22a-16 and 22a-19 with the language of the other sections listed in the first sentence of \u00a7 22a-20 demonstrates that <em>only </em>\u00a7\u00a7 22a-16 and 22a-19 contain language that explicitly confers standing to initiate legal proceedings. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16 provides in relevant part that \u201cany person . . . may maintain an action in the superior court . . . for declaratory and equitable relief against . . . any person . . . for the protection of the public trust in the . . . natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201cany person . . . may intervene as a party on the filing of a verified pleading asserting that the proceeding or action for judicial review involves conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably . . . destroying the public trust in the . . . natural resources of the state.\u201d No comparable authorizing language appears in \u00a7 22a-20 or in any of the other sections listed in the first sentence of \u00a7 22a-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">The plaintiff contends, however, that, even if \u00a7 22a-20 does not explicitly create an independent cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>action, it implicitly does so. In support of this claim, she relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997), in which we stated that, \u201c[i]n determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one, several factors are relevant. First, is the plaintiff one of the class for whose . . . benefit the statute was enacted . . . ? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? . . . Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 249. The plaintiff contends that, because the legislature conferred on \u201c[a]ny person\u201d the right to seek judicial relief to protect the environment; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-20; the answer to all three of these questions clearly is \u201cyes.\u201d The plaintiffs argument is flawed. Section 22a-20 does not itself confer on any person the right to seek judicial relief. This stands in marked contrast to other provisions of the act, in which the legislature explicitly has provided recourse to persons seeking to protect the environment. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16. In such circumstances, we are reluctant to recognize a cause of action not expressly created under the act, at least in the absence of a persuasive reason to do so, and the plaintiff has not identified any such reason in the context of the present case. Furthermore, we are not aware of any indication of legislative intent to create a cause of action in addition to and independent of \u00a7 22a-16. Accordingly, we reject this contention of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In addition, we reject the plaintiffs contention that \u00a7 22a-20 would be superfluous if it was not intended to create an independent cause of action. The first sentence of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-20 provides that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>provisions of the act \u201cshall be supplementary to existing administrative and regulatory procedures provided by law . . . .\u201d This provision clarifies that the existence of an administrative or regulatory procedure governing the conduct complained of does not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction over claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16. Similarly, the provision in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-20 that \u201c[njothing herein shall prevent the maintenance of an action ... to protect the rights recognized herein, where existing administrative and regulatory procedures are found by the court to be inadequate for the protection of the rights [recognized by the act],\u201d allows a plaintiff to seek relief under \u00a7 22a-16 even if the conduct complained of is the subject of other administrative or regulatory procedures. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-20 further provides that, in any action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16, the trial court may review existing administrative and regulatory procedures \u201cto the extent necessary\u201d to protect the rights granted by the act and, in doing so, may take \u201cadditional evidence . . . Thus, the existence of an independent action under \u00a7 22a-20 is not necessary to protect the rights recognized by the act because the procedure described in \u00a7 22a-20 may be invoked in an action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 22a-20 does not create an independent cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We next address the issue of whether the plaintiff had standing to bring an action under \u00a7 22a-16.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>begin our analysis by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cIf a party is found to lack standing, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause. ... A determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction .... The objection of want of jurisdiction may be made at any time . . . [a]nd the court or tribunal may act on its own motion, and should do so when the lack of jurisdiction is called to its attention. . . . The requirement of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by any party and can be raised at any stage in the proceedings. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">\u201cStanding is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented. . . . These two objectives are ordinarily held to have been met when a complainant makes a colorable claim of direct injury he has suffered or is likely to suffer, in an individual or representative capacity. Such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy . . . provides the requisite assurance of concrete adverseness and diligent advocacy. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>requirement of directness between the injuries claimed by the plaintiff and the conduct of the defendant also is expressed, in our standing jurisprudence, by the focus on whether the plaintiff is the proper party to assert the claim at issue. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">\u201cTwo broad yet distinct categories of aggrievement exist, classical and statutory. . . . Classical aggrievement requires a two part showing. First, a party must demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as opposed to a general interest that all members of the community share. . . . Second, the party must also show that the agency\u2019s decision has specially and injuriously affected that specific personal or legal interest. . . . Aggrievement does not demand certainty, only the possibility of an adverse effect on a legally protected interest. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">\u201cStatutory aggrievement exists by legislative fiat, not by judicial analysis of the particular facts of the case. In other words, in cases of statutory aggrievement, particular legislation grants standing to those who claim injury to an interest protected by that legislation. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">\u201cTraditionally, citizens seeking to protect the environment were required to show specific, personal aggrievement to attain standing to bring a legal action. . . . The [act] . . . however, waives the aggrievement requirement in two circumstances. First, any private party, including a municipality, without first having to establish aggrievement, may seek injunctive relief in court for the protection of the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction . . . . General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16. Second, any person or other entity, without first having to establish aggrievement, may intervene in any administrative proceeding challenging conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 127-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 22a-16, standing ... is conferred only to protect the natural resources of the state from pollution or destruction. . . . Accordingly, all that is required to invoke the jurisdiction of the Superior Court under \u00a7 22a-16 is a colorable claim, by any person [or entity] against any person [or entity], of conduct resulting in harm to one or more of the natural resources of this state. . . . Although it is true, of course, that the plaintiff need not prove [his or her] case at this stage of the proceedings . . . the plaintiff nevertheless must articulate a colorable claim of unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction of the environment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC v. New London, </em>282 Conn. 791, 804, 925 A.2d 292 (2007). \u201cA complaint does not sufficiently allege standing [however] by merely reciting the provisions of \u00a7 22a-16 . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Rather, it \u201cmust set forth facts to support an inference that unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction of a natural resource will probably result from the challenged activities unless remedial measures are taken.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 804-805.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">In the present case, we conclude that the plaintiffs complaint adequately sets forth facts to support an inference that unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction of a natural resource will probably result from Millstone\u2019s operation. The complaint contains specific allegations of harm to the marine life in the Long Island Sound, Niantic Bay and Jordan Cove, both through the discharge of contaminated and heated water into those bodies of water and through the \u201cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>trainment and impingement\u201d of marine organisms at the reactor intakes. The plaintiff also specifically alleged that the existing permit renewal proceeding is inadequate to protect the rights recognized by the act because the hearing officer is biased and the department has prejudged the matter, thereby entitling her to judicial review of the proceeding under \u00a7 22a-20. In essence, therefore, the plaintiff alleges that, if the hearing officer and the department had fairly and impartially conducted the permit renewal proceeding, they would not have allowed Dominion to continue Millstone\u2019s operations under the emergency authorization or issued the tentative decision to renew the discharge permit because the impact of the operations on the marine life in the neighboring bodies of water is more harmful than that permitted by the applicable regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The defendants contend, however, that, because the plaintiffs claims are premised entirely on alleged flaws in the permitting process, she has no standing to bring an action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16. See <em>Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 148 <em>(Connecticut Coalition), </em>see also <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>275 Conn. 383, 394, 880 A.2d 865 (2005) (\u201c\u00a7 22a-16 does not confer standing on a plaintiff who seeks to challenge the validity of the permitting process\u201d). We conclude that the defendants read <em>Connecticut Coalition </em>and <em>Lewis </em>too broadly. In both of those cases, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the act were premised entirely on allegations of technical or procedural violations of the governing permitting statutes and regulations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As we stated in <em>Connecticut Coalition, </em>\u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>claim that conduct is not properly authorized does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>necessarily establish that the conduct causes unreasonable pollution under [the act].\u201d <em>Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>supra, 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">We also stated in <em>Connecticut Coalition, </em>however, that \u201cthe fact that conduct may be permitted under the relevant environmental statute does not preclude a claim that the activity causes unreasonable pollution under [the act], as when the alleged pollution exceeds the amount approved in the permit.\u201d Id.; cf. <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Commission, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 293 (\u201ca determination that the work was required to be, but was not, in compliance with the substantive provisions of the applicable inland wetlands regulations could support a finding that it constituted unreasonable pollution under [the act]\u201d); <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 808 (\u201c[a] claim that the defendant has violated the <em>substantive </em>provisions of [a statute imposing environmental standards] . . . may give rise to an inference that the conduct causes unreasonable pollution\u201d [emphasis in original]). Thus, we have recognized that the mere fact that conduct comes within the scope of a statutory permitting scheme does not preclude a claim under the act if, as in the present case, the plaintiff makes a colorable claim that the conduct will cause unreasonable pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">We acknowledge that, in a number of earlier cases, this court did not expressly distinguish cognizable claims under the act that involve polluting conduct that comes within the scope of a statutory permitting scheme from impermissible claims that implicate only technical or procedural violations of the permitting scheme. In <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>192 Conn. 591, 473 A.2d 787 (1984), overruled in part by <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 545, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002), for example, this court stated broadly that \u201cinvocation of the [act] is not an open sesame for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>standing to raise environmental claims with regard to any and all environmental legislation.\u201d <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>supra, 597. We concluded that the plaintiffs in that case lacked standing, under a variety of environmental statutes, to challenge the failure of the defendant utility companies to obtain certain permits to bum mineral oil containing polychlorinated biphenyls. Id., 593, 596-97; see also id., 596 C\u2018[w]e are unpersuaded that the legislature intended, in the cited statutes, to create private causes of action to supplement the pervasive regulatory powers of the [department] over environmental licenses\u201d). We also noted, however, that the trial court in that case had concluded that the plaintiffs had standing to bring an action under \u00a7 22a-16 because they had claimed that the burning of the oil was \u201creasonably likely to result in the unreasonable pollution, the impairment of and the destruction of the public trust in the air, water resources and other natural resources [of the state].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 600. That ruling was not challenged on appeal. Id. Thus, as in <em>Connecticut Coalition, </em>our conclusion in <em>Middletown </em>that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring a claim involving polluting conduct that was within the jurisdiction of an administrative body was limited to pure permitting claims.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See id., 596-97. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim under \u00a7 22a-16 that the same conduct would result in unreasonable pollution was cognizable.

To the extent that we concluded in <em>Fish Unlimited </em>that courts lack jurisdiction under \u00a7 22a-16 over <em>any </em>claim that involves polluting conduct that is within the jurisdiction of an administrative body, however, that conclusion was inconsistent with <em>Middletown </em>and was expressly overruled by this court in <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 506, in which we held that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply to claims of unreasonable pollution brought under the provisions of the act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Id., 545. In reaching that conclusion, we relied heavily on the language of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-18, which provides in relevant part that a trial court has \u201cdiscretion . . . whether to remand an action [brought pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16] to an administrative agency that has within its jurisdiction . . . appropriate \u2018administrative, licensing or other such proceedings . . . .\u2019General Statutes \u00a7 22a-18 (b).\u201d <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 532. We reasoned that this provision could never be invoked if the plaintiff were required to exhaust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>administrative remedies before bringing an action under the act. Id. Similarly, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-20 expressly provides in relevant part that an action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16 is \u201csupplementary to existing administrative and regulatory procedures provided by law and in any action maintained under [\u00a7 22a-16], the court <em>may </em>remand the parties to such procedures. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, as we have indicated, the mere fact that an administrative body has jurisdiction over an environmental issue, including a permitting proceeding, does not deprive the courts of jurisdiction over a claim brought under \u00a7 22a-16 that involves that environmental issue or that arises from the proceeding. Rather, to have standing under \u00a7 22a-16 to raise such a claim, a plaintiff need only make a colorable claim \u201cthat unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction of a natural resource will probably result from the challenged activities unless remedial measures are taken.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 804-805.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The commissioner contends that the plaintiff has not claimed that Dominion has failed to comply with the discharge permit or that the defendants otherwise have violated the statutory scheme, but has claimed only that the statutory permitting scheme is not stringent enough. The commissioner contends that, under <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 506, the act does not authorize the courts to impose stricter environmental standards than that provided in the applicable regula-toiy scheme. See id., 557 (\u201cwhen there is an environmental legislative and regulatory scheme in place that specifically governs the conduct that the plaintiff claims constitutes an unreasonable impairment under [the act], whether the conduct is unreasonable under [the act] will depend on whether it complies with that scheme\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We agree with the commissioner\u2019s reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>of <em>Waterbury. </em>We disagree, however, that the plaintiff in the present case is seeking to have the court impose stricter environmental standards than that provided by statute and regulation.

Thus, she seeks to have the trial court enforce compliance with the existing statutory scheme, not to conceive and impose its own standard of reasonableness.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff has standing to bring an action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16 and that the trial court improperly dismissed her complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>The sole remaining issue is the appropriate remedy on remand. If the trial court determines that the plaintiff has not established that the hearing officer is biased or the department has prejudged the permit renewal application and that the permit renewal proceeding is adequate to protect the rights recognized by the act, the court then will have the discretion to stay this action pending completion of the permit renewal proceeding. See <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 546 (\u201cunder the . . . doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which is embodied by \u00a7 22a-18 of [the act], the court has discretion, and in certain cases should refer the case, or certain aspects of it, to the administrative agency, yet retain jurisdiction for further action, if appropriate, under that section\u201d). If, on the other hand, the trial court determines that the permit renewal proceeding is inadequate to safeguard the rights recognized by the act, the court may stay those proceedings and craft orders to ensure that those rights are adequately protected.

Rather, she is claiming that the permit renewal proceeding is inadequate to protect the rights recognized by the act because the commissioner and the hearing officer have failed to enforce the existing statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b834-5\"> We recognize that, as an intervenor in the permit renewal proceeding, the plaintiff could raise these claims at the conclusion of the proceeding in an appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-437 (a). Cf. <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>289 Conn. 12, 34, 959 A.2d. 569 (2008) (plaintiffs, as environmental intervenors under \u00a7 22a-19, could appeal from decision of commissioner under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 for limited purpose of raising issues regarding pollution, impairment or destruction of state\u2019s inland wetlands and watercourses). The existence of that remedy, however, does not deprive the plaintiff of standing under \u00a7 22a-16. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-20 (action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16 is supplementary to existing administrative procedures); see also <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 545 (plaintiff had standing to bring action under \u00a7 22a-16 without exhausting administrative remedies).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\"> We, of course, consider only the claims that the plaintiff raises. We need not, and do not, address the extent to which any other claim may satisfy the statutory requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
