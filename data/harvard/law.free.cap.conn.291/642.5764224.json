Beginning in 2001, the defendant began visiting with Kenneth Edwards, Jr., a captain in the New London police department. Over a two year period, the defendant\u2019s visits with Edwards at his office occurred almost weekly. During these visits, conversation between the two ranged from the defendant\u2019s concerns about the police department to discussion about both of their families and themselves. The defendant also regularly called Edwards by telephone, and the two exchanged dialogue similar to that of their face-to-face visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>In 2003, Edwards terminated his relationship with the defendant after the defendant began exhibiting unhealthy aggressive behavior toward both Edwards and other officers working for the police department. Thereafter, the defendant became increasingly frustrated with Edwards, and started leaving him angry voicemails. In these voicemails, the defendant often would begin with a fairly calm demeanor, but eventually would escalate to the point that he was screaming angrily, yelling obscenities, saying that he wished Edwards was dead, and threatening both Edwards and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">On January 11 and 13, 2005, the defendant left two voicemail messages for Edwards on his office telephone in which he used curse words and accused Edwards of, among other things, giving the defendant\u2019s name \u201cup to drug dealers,\u201d and attempting to charge him with arson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result of these two voicemails, Edwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>made a complaint to the New London police department. The defendant subsequently was arrested on a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The state ultimately charged the defendant with four counts of harassment in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (l)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Counts one and two concerned the January 11, 2005 telephone call to Edwards, while counts three and four concerned the January 13, 2005 telephone call. Each count was based respectively on different subdivisions of \u00a7 53a-183 (a). The defendant moved to dismiss counts one and two on statute of limitations grounds, and the trial court thereafter denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">At trial, the state sought to introduce evidence of misconduct by the defendant through the testimony of five different witnesses. Doreen Fuller, the principal of an elementary school, Officers Graham Mugovero, Todd Bergeson and William Edwards,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> all of the New London police department, and Christopher Burke, a licensed clinical social worker for the department of mental health and addiction services, all testified against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>defendant. The defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude the misconduct evidence, but the trial court denied the motion, admitted the testimony and ordered Burke to testify after concluding that his testimony fell within the dangerous client exception to the social worker-client confidentiality rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury acquitted the defendant of two counts of harassment in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (1), but found him guilty of two counts of harassment in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3). The trial court thereafter sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of six months incarceration, suspended after sixty days, with one year probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the dangerous client exception to the social worker-client confidentiality rule contained in \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) permits in-court testimony by the social worker, and that Burke\u2019s testimony therefore was improperly ordered by the trial court. More specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly ordered Burke to testify because the social worker-client confidence protected his testimony as confidential. The defendant further claims that recognition of the social worker-client confidence is essential to the mental health and well-being of Connecticut citizens, and that a testimonial exception to this confidentiality under \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) would directly undermine this well-being. Additionally, the defendant asserts that admission of Burke\u2019s testimony was <em>not </em>a harmless impropriety because the testimony was probative in showing that Edwards was not alone in concluding that the defendant was a danger to Edwards and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">In response, the state asserts that \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) creates a testimonial exception to the social worker-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>client confidentiality statute that allows social workers to testify and divulge otherwise protected confidential information communicated by a client only if the social worker believes that \u201cthere is a substantial risk of imminent physical injury by the person to himself or others . . . .\u2019\u2019In the alternative, the state claims that even if this court should find that no testimonial exception exists, the admission of Burke\u2019s testimony was a harmless impropriety because Edwards\u2019 testimony and the audiotapes of the voicemail messages demonstrate \u201can overwhelming case of harassment.\u201d We agree with the defendant that \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) does not permit in-court testimony by the social worker, and that the trial court improperly ordered Burke to testify. We agree with the state, however, that this improper action by the trial court was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The following additional undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude the state from admitting evidence of misconduct by the defendant. Specifically, the defendant sought to preclude Burke, Fuller, Mugovero, Bergeson, and William Edwards from testifying. In his motion, the defendant objected to the admission of testimony by Burke, whom he argued would improperly breach the statutory social worker-client confidence by testifying. The trial court denied the motion in limine and ordered Burke to testify before the jury about the nature of his relationship as well as his prior communications with the defendant, concluding that his testimony fell within the dangerous client exception to the social worker-client confidentiality statute. The trial court then ordered Burke to answer questions not about the precise statements made to him by the defendant, but instead about his perceptions of what the defendant had told him. The trial court also gave a limiting instruction to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>after Burke\u2019s testimony as to the proper use of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">At trial, Burke testified that after being telephoned by the police department, he interviewed the defendant in August, 2003, while the defendant was in lockup for a prior, unrelated charge. Without testifying as to the specific content of his interview of the defendant, Burke testified that his impression after the interview was one of \u201cconcern\u201d; he \u201cwas very concerned about some of the contents of what [the defendant] had said,\u201d and believed that the defendant was \u201cvery angry\u201d with Edwards and that both Edwards and his family \u201cmight be in danger.\u201d Burke further testified that pursuant to the statutory exception to the social worker-client confidentiality statute, he \u201cfelt [he] had a duty to warn [Edwards]\u201d of this danger. In answering the state\u2019s questions on redirect examination, Burke again testified before the jury that his interview of the defendant occurred while the defendant was in \u201clockup.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim requires us to interpret \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2). We first address the appropriate standard of review. \u201cWell settled principles of statutory interpretation govern our review.\u201d <em>Viera </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>283 Conn. 412, 420-21, 927 A.2d 843 (2007); see also, <em>e.g., Edelstein </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health &amp; Addiction Services, </em>240 Conn. 658, 659, 692 A.2d 803 (1997) (interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-146o, physician-patient confidentiality statute). \u201cBecause statutory interpretation is a question of law, our review is de novo.\u201d <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>232 Conn. 392, 396, 655 A.2d 759 (1995); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Arthur H., </em>288 Conn. 582, 590, 953 A.2d 630 (2008) (\u201c[a]s with any question of statutory construction, our review of this threshold question as to the requirements of the statute is plenary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>In construing \u00a7 52-146q, we are mindful of General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which instructs us that \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning ... \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>288 Conn. 610, 620, 954 A.2d 806 (2008); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Arthur H., </em>supra, 288 Conn. 590, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Bletsch, </em>281 Conn. 5, 16, 912 A.2d 992 (2007); <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Commission, </em>284 Conn. 268, 294-95, 933 A.2d 256 (2007); <em>Viera </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 421, citing <em>Nine State Street, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>270 Conn. 42, 46, 850 A.2d 1032 (2004). \u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tarnowsky </em>v. <em>Socci, </em>271 Conn. 284, 287 n.3, 856 A.2d 408 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In accordance with \u00a7 l-2z, we begin our analysis with the text of the statute. Section 52-146q (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAll communications and records shall be confidential and, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a social worker shall not disclose any such communications and records unless the person or his authorized representative consents to such disclosure. . . .\u201d The subsection creating the relevant exception in the present case, \u00a7 52-146q (c), provides in relevant part: \u201cConsent of the person shall not be required for the disclosure or transmission of such person\u2019s communications and records in the following situations <em>as specifically limited </em>... (2) Communications and records may be disclosed when a social worker determines that there is a substantial risk of imminent physical injury by the person to himself or others . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The text of \u00a7 52-146q (c) thus provides us with particular instructions: it requires that the statutory exceptions to the social worker-client confidentiality statute<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> be \u201cspecifically limited\u201d to the specified situations. With regard to \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2), we note that the text of the exception requires that, for disclosure to be permitted, the social worker must determine that there is a \u201csubstantial\u201d risk of \u201cimminent\u201d physical injury by the client to himself or others. This exception is precise and limited. The apparent intent of this exception is to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>disclosure in order to prevent imminent physical injury. Section 52-146q (c) (2) is silent, however, as to whether this exception extends to permitting the social worker to testify in court proceedings. This silence is notable because, in contrast, two of the other exceptions specifically reference court proceedings. Section 52-146q (c) (3) provides in relevant part that \u201c[cjommunications and records made in the course of an evaluation ordered by a court may be disclosed <em>at judicial proceedings </em>in which the person is a party . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Additionally, subdivision (4) provides that \u201c[cjommunications and records may be disclosed <em>in a civil proceeding </em>in which the person introduces his mental condition as an element of his claim or defense . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-146q (c) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We note with particular emphasis that this silence does not constitute ambiguity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This court has recently made clear that \u201c[tjhe fact that . . . relevant statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>provisions are silent . . . does not mean that they are ambiguous.\u201d <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>269 Conn. 120, 133, 848 A.2d 451 (2004); see also <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 410, 419, 862 A.2d 292 (2004) (\u201c[statutory] silence does not . . . necessarily equate to ambiguity\u201d). Significantly, \u201c[t]he test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Viera </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 421; <em>Tarnowsky </em>v. <em>Socci, </em>supra, 271 Conn. 287 n.3; see also <em>Genesky </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>275 Conn. 246, 278, 881 A.2d 114 (2005) <em>(Borden, J., </em>concurring) (\u201cif the text of the statute at issue, considering its relationship to other statutes, as applied to the facts of the case, would permit more than one likely or plausible meaning, its meaning cannot be said to be \u2018plain and unambiguous\u2019 \u201d). The silence of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) regarding whether it permits in-court testimony by a social worker should not be skewed as to indicate ambiguity for the purpose of looking beyond the text as allowed by \u00a7 l-2z. Instead, our case law is clear that ambiguity exists only if the statutory language at issue is susceptible to more than one plausible interpretation. The text of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) is not susceptible to more than one plausible interpretation. Rather, the statutory exception is silent with regard to court testimony and that silence only furthers our need to examine closely the precise language of the statute in order to understand the legislature\u2019s intention. See <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>supra, 133 n.18 (finding no need to resort to legislative history in order to construe statute at issue because, despite silence of statute as to contested meaning, careful examination of statutory scheme and language indicate clear and reasonable interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">We are mindful of the significance of the precise language and syntax used by the legislature in \u00a7 52-146q <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>(b) to indicate its understanding and use of the term \u201cconfidential\u201d with regard to its characterization of both the social worker-client confidentiality statute and the exceptions to that confidence laid out in \u00a7 52-146q (c). As previously set forth herein, \u00a7 52-146q (b) provides that \u201c[a]ll communications and records shall be confidential <em>and, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a social worker shall not disclose any such communications and records . . </em>. .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) Importantly, the legislature explicitly provided that all communications and records are <em>both </em>confidential <em>and </em>not subject to disclosure, except as specifically excepted in subsection (c) of \u00a7 52-146q. The legislature, by virtue of its explicit provision for both confidentiality <em>and </em>limited disclosure, clearly indicated that it did not consider the word \u201cconfidential\u201d to include the possibility of disclosure<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that all communications and records are confidential, regardless of their potential for disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The implications of this strict reading of the text are significant. Because all communications between social workers and their clients are confidential, those communications falling under the dangerous client exception are confidential as well. When a social worker determines, through communication with his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>client, that there is a substantial risk of imminent physical injury to either the client or another person, he or she is authorized by the statute to divulge this information at that point for the purpose of preventing injury. The communications, however, retain their confidential nature by virtue of the statutory mandate in \u00a7 52-146q (b). Confidentiality is not destroyed by disclosure to prevent injury, and testimony in court proceedings by the social worker about the disclosed communications or records is not allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The marked difference in the text of the statutory exceptions, together with the specific language and syntax used by the legislature, as well as the statute\u2019s direction to read the exceptions \u201cas specifically limited,\u201d leads us to conclude that this exception was <em>not </em>intended to permit in-court testimony. If the legislature wanted to make specific allowances for the disclosure of otherwise confidential communications between social workers and their clients in court proceedings, it could have done so, and, in fact, has already done so in two other subdivisions of \u00a7 52-146q (c). See, e.g., <em>Genesky </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 258 (\u201cif the legislature wants to grant benefits to [constables and police officers] in a single statutory provision, it knows howto do so\u201d); <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 135 (\u201cif the legislature had wanted to grant a municipality . . . discretionary authority with respect to the classification of property as forest land it could have done so\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>265 Conn. 35, 46, 826 A.2d 1126 (2003) (\u201cif the legislature had wanted to make knowledge as to location of a school an element of the offense [of possession of narcotics within 1000 feet of a school], it would have done so\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>261 Conn. 111, 135-36, 802 A.2d 754 (2002) (\u201cif the legislature had wanted to turn killings accomplished during robberies, burglaries and laxce-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>nies into an [aggravating factor to be considered for the imposition of the death penalty for capital felony], it simply would have said so\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>250 Conn. 188, 199, 736 A.2d 790 (1999) (\u201cif the legislature had wanted to prohibit the state from introducing a witness\u2019 testimony before an investigatory grand jury in the state\u2019s case-in-chief against that witness, it easily could have done so\u201d). \u201cWe presume that the legislature is aware of the judicial construction placed upon its enactments.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cro-well, </em>228 Conn. 393, 401, 636 A.2d 804 (1994), citing <em>Cappellino </em>v. <em>Cheshire, </em>226 Conn. 569, 576, 628 A.2d 595 (1993). Moreover, \u201c[t]he intention of the legislature is found not in what it meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 452, 364 A.2d 167 (1975), citing <em>Schwab </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 479, 482, 226 A.2d 506 (1967). Because the legislature expressly could have permitted disclosure in any court proceedings under \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2), as it did in subdivisions (3) and (4), but did not do so, we interpret the statute\u2019s silence as evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent not to apply the dangerous client exception in the context of court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Our examination of the relationship of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) to other statutes establishing confidentiality of certain records and communications requires a similar interpretation. General Statutes \u00a7 52-146o, which was enacted in 1990 only two years prior to \u00a7 52-146q, protects patients\u2019 communications and information from disclosure by physicians, surgeons and health care providers. Section 52-146o (a) specifically provides that \u201cin any civil action or any proceeding preliminary thereto or in any probate, legislative or administrative proceeding, a physician or surgeon . . . shall not disclose\u201d any communications by or information from a patient. Although \u00a7 52-146o is not substantively parallel to \u00a7 52-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>146q because it prohibits rather than establishes opportunities for in-court testimony by physicians, surgeons and health care providers, it further evidences the legislature\u2019s awareness that an issue frequently arises as to whether the statutory confidence can or should be enforced in court proceedings. Where the legislature wants to make an exception for court proceedings, court proceedings are <em>specifically </em>referenced.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 52-146c (b), enacted in 1969, which protects communications between psychologists and patients, provides in relevant part: \u201c[I]n civil and criminal actions, in juvenile, probate, commitment and arbitration proceedings, in proceedings preliminary to such actions or proceedings, and in legislative and administrative proceedings, all communications shall be privileged and a psychologist shall not disclose any such communications . . . .\u201d Although enacted more than two decades before \u00a7 52-146q, \u00a7 52-146c emphasizes the legislature\u2019s ability and tendency to reference specifically court proceedings where it intends either to prohibit or to permit in-court testimony.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Moreover, General Statutes \u00a7 52-146f, which establishes the eight exceptions for the psychiatrist-patient privilege created in \u00a7 52-146e, epitomizes the legislature\u2019s ability to make explicit allowances for testimonial exceptions in the language of the statute itself. Importantly, \u00a7 52-1461' contains the same instruction that each exception be read \u201cas specifically limited . . . .\u201d In accordance with this instruction, subsections (4)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and <em>(5)</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of \u00a7 52-146\u00cd create express exceptions to the evi-dentiary confidentiality for in-court testimony by the psychiatrist. Subsection (2) of \u00a7 52-146\u00cd,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> on the other hand, creates the analogous dangerous patient exception for the psychiatrist-patient privilege and contains no such explicit testimonial allowance. Although the concurring opinion may find significance in the place<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ment of the dangerous patient exception with other exceptions in \u00a7 52-146f that may be understood to permit in-court testimony,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we find the exception\u2019s placement to be inapposite to our analysis today. Subsection (2) is one of eight exceptions to the psychiatrist-patient confidentiality statute listed in \u00a7. 52-146f. Two of those eight exceptions create explicit exceptions for in-court testimony. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-146\u00cd (4) and (5). Six of the exceptions do not create such exceptions, and have not been interpreted as doing so one way or the other. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-146\u00cd (1), (2), (3), (6), (7) and (8). Accordingly, \u00a7 52-146f is not only structured precisely like \u00a7 52-146q (c), but also has been interpreted in a similar manner. It is a prime example of the legislature\u2019s ability to make and, indeed, history of making, explicit exceptions for in-court testimony with regard to the greater evidentiary confidentiality statutes. It only serves as further support for our conclusion today that \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) clearly and unambiguously does not extend to permitting in-court testimony by a social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Having concluded that \u00a7 52-146q is clear and unambiguous, we are statutorily prohibited by \u00a7 l-2z from conducting any extratextual analysis. Even if we were to conclude, however, that \u00a7 52-146q is ambiguous and that we are therefore permitted to consider extratextual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>sources, we are not persuaded by the state\u2019s claim that the majority of state jurisdictions has concluded that the duty to warn third parties about threatening statements made to a psychotherapist gives rise to an exception to the psychotherapist-client evidentiary confidentiality. Indeed, four of the six state cases, as well as the federal Circuit Courts of Appeal cases,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> cited by the state to support this proposition concern <em>common-law </em>exceptions to confidentiality statutes, and are thus irrelevant to our discussion today. See generally <em>United States </em>v. <em>Auster, </em>517 F.3d 312 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 840, 129 S. Ct. 75, 172 L. Ed. 2d 67 (2008); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>133 F.3d 1356 (10th Cir. 1998); <em>Bright </em>v. <em>State, </em>740 A.2d 927 (Del. 1999); <em>People </em>v. <em>Bierenbaum, </em>301 App. Div. 2d 119, 748 N.Y.S.2d 563 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>300 Or. 203, 709 P.2d 225 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1141, 106 S. Ct. 1793, 90 L. Ed. 2d 339 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Agacki, </em>226 Wis. 2d 349, 595 N.W.2d 31 (1999). Moreover, the California case to which the state cites interprets a section of the California Evidence Code that expressly creates an exception to the privilege. See <em>San Diego Trolley, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>87 Cal. App. 4th 1083, 1091, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 476 (2001); id., 1091 n.1 (quoting \u00a7 1024 of California Evidence Code, which provides that \u201c \u2018[t]here is no privilege under this article\u2019 \u201d). We are not faced with such clear and express statutory language in \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2). Finally, in <em>Guerrier </em>v. <em>State, </em>811 So. 2d 852, 855-56 (Fla. App.), review denied, 831 So. 2d 672 (Fla. 2002), the Florida Appellate Court interpreted a statutory dangerous patient exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the physician-patient privilege broadly and not strictly and narrowly, as must be done in this case by the express terms of \u00a7 52-146q (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The statutory exceptions in \u00a7 52-146q (c) should be strictly construed and limited to their plain and literal meaning. When compared to other subdivisions of the same statute as well as other similar confidentiality statutes, it is clear that the legislature carefully chose the very precise words that it used in \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) and failed to authorize testimony in court proceedings. Where a social worker \u201cdetermines that there is a substantial risk of imminent physical injury by the person to himself or others,\u201d he or she may choose to disclose that information to prevent physical injury. General Statutes \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2). That exception, however, as \u201cspecifically limited\u201d by the precise language of the statute, does not permit the social worker to testify as to the client\u2019s confidential communication in any court proceedings. Accordingly, we further conclude that the trial court improperly ordered Burke to testify about the communications made to him by the defendant in violation of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>We next turn to whether the improper admission of Burke\u2019s testimony was harmful. \u201cWhen an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the [impropriety] was harmful.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>258 Conn. 79, 94-95, 779 A.2d 112 (2001). \u201c[A] nonconstitutional [impropriety] is harmless when an appellate court has a fair assurance that the [impropriety] did not substantially affect the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>279 Conn. 331, 357, 904 A.2d 101 (2006); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Snelgrove, </em>288 Conn. 742, 758, 954 A.2d 165 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\u201c[WJhether [the improper admission of a witness\u2019 testimony] is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the [improperly admitted] evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 358; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>272 Conn. 515, 527, 864 A.2d 847 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 385, 857 A.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>257 Conn. 156, 174, 777 A.2d 604 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">In the present case, Burke\u2019s testimony was not of great importance to the state\u2019s case against the defendant. First, Burke\u2019s testimony did not include a repeti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>tion of outrageous remarks made by the defendant, but was limited to a description of the defendant\u2019s alleged demeanor toward and feelings about Edwards. The state referenced the testimony only once in its closing argument before the jury, briefly describing it in that way, revealing its relative lack of importance. Second, Burke\u2019s testimony regarding the telephone call he made to Edwards was cumulative. Edwards himself also testified to receiving a telephone call from Burke which \u201cput [him] in fear for [his] family\u2019s safety.\u201d Burke provided the jury with essentially the same information about his telephone call to Edwards as Edwards did himself. Moreover, the defendant concedes in his brief that Burke\u2019s testimony was \u201cneedlessly cumulative\u201d in that it \u201csimply amounted to a particularly colorful example of [the defendant\u2019s] unusual behavior.\u201d Accordingly, a third consideration is that not only was Burke\u2019s testimony cumulative, but it also was clearly corroborated by Edwards\u2019 testimony about the same incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Fourth, the defendant was given a unique opportunity to prepare his cross-examination of Burke with the knowledge and foresight of what questions the state would ask Burke during its direct examination. During argument over the defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of Burke\u2019s testimony, the state specifically outlined for both the court and the defendant the exact questions it planned to ask Burke. As the trial court remarked, the defendant \u201c[knew] exactly what the direct questions [would] be\u201d and thus could \u201ccross-examine with any questions . . . with regard to any documentation or whatever else [he felt to be] necessary.\u201d Additionally, the defendant was given an opportunity to speak with Burke during the recess before Burke\u2019s testimony, in order to clarify certain points that would be important in his cross-examination. The defendant was thus clearly given a broad opportunity to prepare for his cross-examination of Burke.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Finally, even without Burke\u2019s testimony, the state had a strong case against the defendant. The state not only presented Edwards\u2019 testimony, but also played for the jury the actual voicemail recordings that the defendant had left for Edwards. Both the voicemail recordings and Edwards\u2019 testimony strongly supported the charge of harassment in the second degree. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the improper admission of Burke\u2019s testimony did not substantially affect the jury\u2019s verdict and it therefore was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted the uncharged misconduct testimony of Fuller, and Officers Mugovero, Bergeson and William Edwards. The defendant claims that each witness\u2019 testimony should have been barred as irrelevant, more prejudicial than probative, or cumulative, or all three. He further contends that the admission of any and all of this testimony was harmful. In response, the state claims that the testimony of the four witnesses properly was admitted within the trial court\u2019s broad discretion. Specifically, the state asserts that the witnesses\u2019 testimony was relevant to the defendant\u2019s state of mind and not to his character. We agree with the state and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The following undisputed additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. At trial, the state introduced the uncharged misconduct testimony.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Fuller, the elementary school principal, testified that on March 9, 2005, the defendant telephoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>her and inquired if Edwards\u2019 children attended her school; she opined that the call was \u201creminiscent of child abduction cases.\u201d Mugovero, an officer in the New London police department, testified that on March 19, 2004, the defendant approached him and stated that he \u201cwas going to skin Captain Edwards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Bergeson, another New London police officer, testified that: (1) while investigating a reported disturbance at the defendant\u2019s home on November 15,2005, he heard the defendant \u201cyelling and screaming\u201d about how \u201cboth . . . Edwards and his brother [William] Edwards should both be dead\u201d; and (2) on April 12, 2006, the defendant told Bergeson that his constitutional rights were being violated, that \u201cEdwards has one more coming,\u201d and that Bergeson should \u201c[j]ust tell . . . Edwards that [he is] trying to protect his children, maybe [Edwards will] give [him] $20 for it.\u201d Finally, William Edwards, Captain Edwards\u2019 brother and an officer with the New London police department, testified about three encounters with the defendant prior to his arrest. During these encounters, which occurred in December, 2003, October, 2004 and November, 2004, respectively, the defendant: (1) accused William Edwards of being a thief; (2) stated that \u201cyou\u2019ll get yours, I know where your daddy is and where your brother is\u201d; and (3) called William Edwards a coward and stated that \u201ctime was running out\u201d for the Edwards family.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We first address the applicable standard of review for this evidentiary challenge. \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law ... for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 218, 926 A.2d 633 (2007). \u201cWe will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>280 Conn. 36, 50, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>905 A.2d 1079 (2006); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>270 Conn. 337, 355, 852 A.2d 676 (2004) (\u201c [reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cIn determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d <em>DiPalma </em>v. <em>Wiesen, </em>163 Conn. 293, 298-99, 303 A.2d 709 (1972); see also <em>Slate </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>172 Conn. 140, 144, 374 A.2d 150 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">\u201cThe rules governing the admissibility of evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior misconduct are well established. Although evidence of prior unconnected crimes is inadmissible to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s bad character or to suggest that the defendant has a propensity for criminal behavior . . . such evidence may be admissible for other purposes, such as to prove knowledge, intent, motive, and common scheme or design, if the trial court determines, in the exercise of judicial discretion, that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial tendency.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 354; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Morowitz, </em>200 Conn. 440, 442, 512 A.2d 175 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">It is well established that the trial court is afforded broad discretion in determining whether to admit each witness\u2019 testimony; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 355; and must conduct a balancing act of the testimony\u2019s prejudicial versus probative value. Id., 354. Also, \u201c[s]ome degree of prejudice inevitably accompanies the admission of evidence of a defendant\u2019s other misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 365; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>213 Conn. 422, 436, 568 A. 2d 448 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Faria, </em>47 Conn. App. 159, 175, 703 A.2d 1149 (1997), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 965, 707 A.2d 1266 (1998). \u201cEvidence is prejudicial when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>256 Conn. 429, 454, 778 A.2d 812 (2001); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We begin our analysis by noting first that harassment in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) is a specific intent crime. In the present case, therefore, the state had the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant\u2019s intent to \u201charass, annoy or alarm\u201d Edwards. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3); see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>233 Conn. 211, 212-13, 658 A.2d 566 (1995) (state must \u201cconvince a trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the offense\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The testimony of each of these four witnesses was relevant to the defendant\u2019s intent. Fuller\u2019s testimony corroborated the state\u2019s claim that the defendant was fixated on Edwards, and was relevant to show the defendant\u2019s specific intent to cause alarm with regard to the safety of Edwards\u2019 children. The testimony of Mugovero and Bergeson showed the defendant\u2019s specific intent to cause annoyance, and helped the jury understand how a police officer might have been alarmed by the defendant\u2019s conduct. Likewise, William Edwards\u2019 testimony was relevant to show the defendant\u2019s intent to \u201charass, annoy or alarm\u201d Captain Edwards in violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Because the trial court gave limiting instructions to the jury regarding each witness\u2019 testimony so that the jury would know specifically for which purposes the testimony should be considered, the court minimized any undue prejudice that might otherwise have occurred.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he instructions limiting the use of the misconduct evidence [serve] to minimize any prejudicial effect that it otherwise may have . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 454; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 428, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 47, 58, 505 A.2d 1225 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Furthermore, the record in the present case reflects that the trial court properly undertook a balancing of the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect and determined that the prejudice did not outweigh its probative value. The trial court carefully listened to the defendant\u2019s arguments about prejudice as well as the state\u2019s offers of proof as to the probative value of the testimony. The court nevertheless properly found the evidence admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">We briefly address the defendant\u2019s claim that the testimony of Fuller and Bergeson was irrelevant because it concerned events that occurred three to four months after the defendant had been arrested. We conclude that the trial court reasonably could have determined that their testimony was relevant to the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the defendant\u2019s intent because it concerned ongoing conduct by the defendant that was relevant to his earlier intent. In a similar case, <em>State </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>100 Conn. App. 337, 344, 917 A.2d 1008, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 919, 925 A.2d 1102 (2007), the Appellate Court concluded: \u201c[T]he defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the shooting may be proven by his conduct before, during and after the shooting. Such conduct yields facts and inferences that demonstrate a pattern of behavior and attitude toward the victim by the defendant that is probative of the defendant\u2019s mental state.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Likewise, in the present case, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant\u2019s mental state shortly after he left the voice-mail messages for Edwards was relevant to his mental state at the time that he left the messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Under the given circumstances, with due regard for the broad leeway possessed by trial courts in determining the admissibility of evidence, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in admitting the testimony of Fuller, Mugovero, Bergeson and William Edwards. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court acted properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">In this opinion ROGERS, C. J., and NORCOTT and SCHALLER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-14\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the case from the Appellate Court to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-15\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of harassment in the second degree when ...

He first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss the first two counts of the state\u2019s substitute information as being time barred by the applicable statute of limitations. He also claims that the prosecution was void ab initio on the ground that the arrest warrant was issued with the wrong name. The defendant fails to cite any authority or to provide adequate analysis in support of these claims, however, and we therefore decline to review them. See <em>State </em>v. <em>T.R.D., </em>286 Conn. 191, 213-14 n.18, 942 A.2d 1000 (2008) (\u201cWe repeatedly have stated that [w]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . .

Most of these statutes notably reference court proceedings where the legislature either creates or prohibits in-court testimony opportunities.

We disagree. While the language of subsection (4) and (5) of \u00a7 52-146\u00cd itself creates exceptions to the evidentiary privilege for in-court testimony, subsection (1) merely allows for the disclosure of communications or records for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment and contains <em>no </em>provision that either explicitly permits disclosure of this information during in-court testimony or that has been interpreted by this court to permit the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\"> Both the state and the concurrence emphasize in particular the analysis in <em>United States v. </em>Auster, <em>517 F.3d 312 </em>(5th Cir.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 840, 129 S.

The analysis by the court in <em>Auster </em>bears no relation to our analysis today, however, because its reasoning is based on common-law principles governing federal evidentiary privileges.

Section l-2z, which specifically directs our attention to the actual text of the statute and its relationship to other statutes, does not permit statutory interpretation to be influenced by hypotheticals. Moreover, although \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) prohibits social workers from testifying as to the substantive content of their confidential communications with and records of their clients, it may not preclude social workers from testifying to: (1) the existence of a confidential relationship; and (2) the fact that the social worker warned the third party of possible injury as permitted under the statute. Some courts have noted a possible distinction between testimony concerning the substance of confidential communications and testimony concerning the fact of disclosure of those communications.

Applying these principles to the present case leads me to conclude, contrary to the determination of the majority, that the trial court properly permitted the state to introduce Burke\u2019s testimony into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">My first point of disagreement with the majority is its refusal to acknowledge that \u00a7 52-146q creates an evidentiary privilege for communications between a social worker and a client. The majority insists that \u00a7 52-146q merely provides for the confidentiality of such communications. The majority reasons that, under \u00a7 1-2z, it must refrain from construing the statute to establish a privilege because of the absence of textual support for that construction. See footnote 10 of the majority opinion. In my view, the defendant\u2019s claim, which implicates the scope of \u00a7 52-146q and its dangerous client exception, requires us to decide that question. Furthermore, \u00a7 52-146q is not clear and unambiguous on the point, and resort to extratextual evidence convincingly establishes that \u00a7 52-146q does, indeed, create such a privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">To appreciate fully the scope of \u00a7 52-146q, it is necessary first to recognize the distinction between confidential communications and privileged communications. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemah, </em>289 Conn. 411, 417 n.7, 957 A.2d 852 (2008). \u201cUnlike privileged information, confidential information generally may be disclosed under court order, over the objection of the information supplier, when a court deems it necessary to do so under a standard such as \u2018in the interests of justice\u2019 or \u2018necessity.\u2019 \u201d C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Evidence (4th Ed. 2008) \u00a7 5.2, p. 220; see also 81 Am. Jur. 2d, Witnesses \u00a7 274 (2004) (\u201c \u2018[confidentiality\u2019 and \u2018privilege\u2019 are not synonymous, and are two compatible, yet distinct, concepts; \u2018privilege\u2019 addresses a person\u2019s right not to have another testify as to certain matters as part of a judicial process, while \u2018confidentiality\u2019 addresses the obligation to refrain from disclosing information to third parties other than as part of the legal process\u201d). Consequently, not all confidential communications are privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">It is true, of course, that \u00a7 52-146q (b) provides that \u201c[a]ll communications and records shall be confidential . . . .\u201d Another provision of the statute, however, expressly refers to the confidentiality rights created thereunder as privileges. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-146q (a) (5) (\u201c \u2018[authorized representative\u2019 means . . . (C) if a person has been declared incompetent <em>to assert or waive his privileges under this section, </em>a guardian or conservator who is duly appointed to act for the person\u201d [emphasis added]). Moreover, other closely related statutes that protect confidential communications between mental health professionals and their patients or clients give rise to a privilege. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-146c (privileged communications between psychologist and patient); General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d (privileged communications between psychiatrist and patient); General Statutes \u00a7 52-146p (privileged communications between marital and family therapist and client); General Statutes \u00a7 52-146s (privileged communications between professional counselor and client). At the very least, therefore, \u00a7 52-146q is ambiguous as to whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>provides only for the confidentiality of communications between a social worker and a client or, instead, establishes a social worker-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Accordingly, we may consult extratextual sources to ascertain the statute\u2019s meaning in this respect. This evidence demonstrates convincingly that the statute was intended to create a privilege for social worker-client communications.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, supra, \u00a7 5.49.1, p. 266 (\u201c[t]he statute makes statements to social workers \u2018confidential,\u2019 when the statute clearly intends privilege status\u201d). Indeed, there is no reason to believe that the legislature would have established a privilege for communications between all other mental health care providers and their patients or clients, and fail to create one for communications between social workers and their clients. Furthermore, the fact that \u00a7 52-146q establishes a privilege finds support in the pertinent legislative history. Specifically, Jan Fontanella, then president elect of the Connecticut chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, testified before the judiciary committee in support of the statute concerning the need to establish a social worker-client privilege. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 1992 Sess., pp. 1352-54. We have recognized that testimony before a legislative committee may be relevant to a statutory analysis because such testimony tends to shed light on the problems that the legislature was attempting to resolve in enacting the peitinent legislation. E.g., <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Fleet National Bank, </em>252 Conn. 1, 17, 742 A.2d 293 (1999). It therefore is clear that \u00a7 52-146q establishes a social worker-client privilege rather than a rule preserving the confidentiality of social worker-client communications, as the majority asserts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The existence of a statutory privilege having been established, I next must consider the scope of that privilege in light of the statute\u2019s delineated exceptions to its prohibition on disclosure. General Statutes \u00a7 52-146q (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAll communications and records shall be confidential and, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a social worker shall not disclose any such communications and records unless the person or his authorized representative consents to such disclosure. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) provides: \u201cCommunications and records may be disclosed when a social worker determines that there is a substantial risk of imminent physical injury by the person to himself or others, or when disclosure is otherwise mandated by any provision of the general statutes.\u201d I disagree with the majority that these statutory provisions plainly and unambiguously provide that communications and records indicating that a client poses a substantial risk of imminent physical injury to himself or others may not be disclosed in court proceedings. Rather, \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) plainly provides that such communications and records may be disclosed to third parties without the client\u2019s consent and, therefore, are not confidential. Cf. <em>PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>267 Conn. 279, 330-31, 838 A.2d 135 (2004) (when statements to attorney are made in presence of third party who has no obligation to keep statements confidential, there is no reasonable expectation of confidentiality).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The provision does not specify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>one way or the other whether disclosable, nonconfidential communications and records are nevertheless privileged. In other words, the statute does not indicate to whom an appropriate disclosure under \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) may be made, and it provides no indication with respect to the ramifications that such a disclosure will have on the communication. Section 52-146q (c) (2) also contains no language suggesting that the social worker\u2019s right to disclose threatening communications terminates upon the first disclosure of that threat; indeed, the statute provides no guidance whatsoever as to when, if ever, that right to disclosure is terminated. Because \u00a7 52-146q is silent on these issues,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and because the statute expressly provides for disclosure of communications to third parties\u2014communications for which there could have been no reasonable expectation of confidentiality in the first place\u2014\u00a7 52-146q is not plain and unambiguous as applied to the present factual scenario, that is, with respect to the admissibility of Burke\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, under \u00a7 l-2z, we may consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2), the legislative policy underlying the provision, and its relationship to other statutory provisions and common-law principles governing the same general subject matter. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\u201cThe common-law principles underlying the recognition of testimonial privileges can be stated simply. For more than three centuries it has now been recognized as a fundamental maxim that the public . . . has a right to every man\u2019s evidence. When we come to examine the various claims of exemption, we start with the primary assumption that there is a general duty to give what testimony one is capable of giving, and that any exemptions which may exist are distinctly exceptional, being so many derogations from a positive general rule. . . . Exceptions from the general rule disfavoring testimonial privileges may be justified, however, by a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jaffee </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>518 U.S. 1, 9, 116 S.

Because they are not privileged, the state was entitled to use them in its case against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">My conclusion is bolstered by the legislative history and genealogy of General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e, which governs the psychiatrist-patient evidentiary privilege, and General Statutes \u00a7 52-146f, which sets forth specific situations in which consent for disclosure of psychiatric records and communications is not required. Two members of the committee that drafted the original versions of these statutes authored an article<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in which they stated that the committee members \u201cdeliberately chose not to write a \u2018future crime\u2019 exception into the [proposed] bill\u201d that eventually was enacted as No. 529 of the 1961 Public Acts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A. Goldstein &amp; J. Katz, \u201cPsychiatrist-Patient Privilege: The GAP Proposal and the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>necticut Statute,\u201d 36 Conn. B.J. 175, 188 (1962). The committee members \u201cwere persuaded that, as a class, patients willing to express to psychiatrists their intention to commit crime are not ordinarily likely to carry out that intention. Instead, they are making a plea for help. The very making of these pleas affords the psychiatrist his unique opportunity to work with patients in an attempt to resolve their problems. Such resolutions would be impeded if patients were unable to speak freely for fear of possible disclosure at a later date in a legal proceeding.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In 1969, however, the legislature amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 52-146a and created a new exception to the psychiatrist-patient privilege \u201cwhen the psychiatrist determines that there is substantial risk of imminent physical injury by the patient to himself or others . . . .\u201d Public Acts 1969, No. 819, \u00a7 4 (P.A. 819), now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 52-146\u00cd (2). The legislative history of P.A. 819 sheds no light on the reason for this legislative change of heart. The article by Goldstein and Katz makes it clear, however, that the exceptions originally listed in General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1961) \u00a7 52-146a, now codified as amended at \u00a7 52-146f (1), (4) and (5), were intended to be exceptions to the evidentiary privilege, not merely exceptions to the nondisclosure requirement. See A. Goldstein &amp; J. Katz, supra, 36 Conn. B.J. 186 (\u201c[a]fter a great deal of discussion, and considerable compromise, our committee agreed upon three general situations in which the <em>privilege </em>was to be treated as terminated\u201d [emphasis added]); see also Public Acts 1961, No. 529 (providing that, in three enumerated circumstances, now codified as amended at \u00a7 52-146f [1], [4] and [5], \u201c[t]here shall be no privilege for any relevant communications under th[e] act\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This historical backdrop strongly suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>that the subsequently enacted exceptions to \u00a7 52-146e set forth in \u00a7 52-146\u00cd, including the dangerous patient exception, also were intended to create exceptions to the evidentiary privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The relevant language of \u00a7 52-146q (c) was enacted in 1992; see Public Acts 1992, No. 92-225, \u00a7 2; and is substantially identical to the language of \u00a7 52-146\u00cd. Accordingly, it reasonably may be presumed that \u00a7\u00a7 52-146e and 52-146f served as the pattern for \u00a7 52-146q. Moreover, I can conceive of no reason why a psychiatrist would be permitted to testify in a judicial proceeding regarding communications from a patient that gave rise to a reasonable belief that there was a substantial risk that the patient would cause serious injury to himself or others but a social worker would not. Accordingly, I believe that the exception set forth in \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) was intended to have the same scope and meaning as the exception set forth in \u00a7 52-146f (2).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The conclusion that \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) creates an exception to the evidentiary privilege also is bolstered by the portion of the statute that permits disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>of communications and records when \u201cdisclosure is otherwise mandated by any provision of the general statutes.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2). General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 (b) provides that social workers are mandated reporters under General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101a, which requires \u201c[a]ny mandated reporter . . . who in the ordinary course of such person\u2019s employment or profession has reasonable cause to suspect or believe that any child under the age of eighteen years\u201d has been subject to abuse or neglect or is at risk of serious harm, to submit a report to the commissioner of children and families or a law enforcement agency. Under General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101e (a), employers are prohibited from discriminating against a person who makes such a report or who \u201ctestifies or is about to testify in <em>any proceeding </em>involving child abuse or neglect.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clear to me, therefore, that the legislature contemplated that social workers, as mandated reporters, may be called on to testify regarding communications from a client injudicial proceedings involving the client\u2019s past abuse or neglect of a child, even though the legislature did not expressly permit such testimony in \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2). I find it highly unlikely that the legislature would have a different expectation with respect to communications giving rise to a belief that a client poses a substantial risk of serious harm to himself or others and yet place that exception within the same subdivision, indeed, the same sentence, of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">My conclusion that communications falling within \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) are neither confidential nor privileged also is supported by the majority of jurisdictions that have concluded that the duty to warn third parties about threatening statements made to a psychotherapist gives rise to an exception to the psychotherapist-client evidentiary privilege.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>San Diego Trolley, Inc. </em>v. <em>Supe</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number><em>rior Court, </em>87 Cal.

See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Auster, </em>517 F.3d 312, 320 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 840, 129 S. Ct. 75, 172 L.

The court in <em>Auster </em>rejected the reasoning of two circuit courts that had concluded that there is no such exception because those courts failed to recognize that, under federal evidentiary law, the test for the applicability of an evidentiary privilege is \u201cwhether there was a reasonable expectation of confidentiality when the statement was made.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Auster, </em>supra, 317 (rejecting reasoning of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>340 F.3d 978 [9th Cir. 2003], cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1220, 124 S.

Put differently, if, in accordance with a dangerous patient exception to the privilege, a therapist lawfully discloses a patient\u2019s communications to the police or to the person or persons placed at risk by the patient, the damage to the psychotherapist-patient relationship has been done, and in-court testimony by the therapist is likely to cause little, if any, additional harm to that relationship.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This is particularly true, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the court in <em>Auster </em>underscored, in view of the fact that neither the target of the threat nor the police have any obligation to keep the information confidential, and it is highly unlikely that they will do so. See, e.g., id., 318 (\u201cthere are likely mutual acquaintances between the target and the patient\u2014e.g., friends, [coworkers], family\u2014and the target will almost certainly tell them, if for no other reason than to let them know that there is a potentially serious problem with the patient and that everyone ought to be on the lookout for trouble\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The court further concluded in <em>Auster </em>that the \u201ccost benefit scales\u201d strongly favor an exception to the privilege in a criminal trial; id., 319; where the public\u2019s interest in the full disclosure of the truth is especially great. Indeed, there may be cases in which the psychotherapist or social worker is the <em>only </em>source of information concerning the threats made by the patient or client. There also may be cases, of course, in which the testimony of the psychotherapist or social worker is critical to the state\u2019s criminal case against the patient or client. When that person remains a threat, and when a criminal prosecution is the best way to protect against that danger, the core purpose of the statutory exception is defeated by barring the psychotherapist or social worker from testifying at trial. In sum, I find the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Auster </em>persuasive and in accord with the common-law principles governing evidentiary privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The majority\u2019s contrary conclusion is incorrect because its reasoning is flawed in a number of important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>respects. First, the majority states that, \u201c[i]f the legislature wanted to make specific allowances for the disclosure of otherwise confidential communications between social workers and their clients in court proceedings, it could have done so . . . .\u2019\u2019In support of this observation, the majority relies on subdivisions (3) and (4) of \u00a7 52-146q (c), which expressly permit disclosures of communications and records by social workers in court proceedings in certain situations. This reliance is misplaced for several reasons. First, those provisions pertain to court proceedings <em>only, </em>that is, the exception to the general rule of nondisclosure that is carved out under each of those subdivisions is expressly restricted to such proceedings. By contrast, the dangerous client exception of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) is an exception of general applicability that applies whenever its requirements are met. Because the dangerous client exception and the exceptions limited to court proceedings are materially different in this respect, they bear no logical connection to one another. Consequently, no inference reasonably can be drawn that the legislature expressly would have mentioned court proceedings in \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) if it had intended that that provision would apply to such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The majority\u2019s faulty reasoning in this respect may be demonstrated by applying it to the fee collection exception of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (5). See footnote 1 of this opinion. Under that exception, a social worker who makes a claim for collection of fees for services may provide certain otherwise privileged information to \u201cindividuals or agencies involved in such collection . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-146q (c) (5). The provision, however, contains no express reference to court proceedings. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, namely, that an exception to the privilege does not apply to judicial proceedings unless the language of the exception contains an express reference to such proceedings, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>person or agency involved in the collection of the unpaid fee on behalf of the social worker would be unable to bring an action to recover those fees, if necessary, because \u00a7 52-146q (c) (5) contains no express reference to judicial proceedings. Having recognized the need for a limited exception to the privilege for fee collection purposes, the legislature cannot possibly have intended such an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Finally, the purpose of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (3) and (4) is to <em>limit the scope of the disclosure </em>allowed by the exceptions, not to expand the forums in which disclosure may be made. Nothing in subdivisions (3) and (4) indicates that the legislature intended that some exceptions to the general rule requiring consent for disclosure were for <em>confidentiality </em>purposes and some exceptions were for <em>privilege </em>purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The majority also relies on General Statutes \u00a7 52-146o (a), which provides in relevant part that \u201cin any civil action or any proceeding preliminary thereto or in any probate, legislative or administrative proceeding, a physician or surgeon . . . shall not disclose\u201d communications or information made by a patient, in support of its contention that the legislature would have expressly allowed court testimony in \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) if that is what it had intended to do. The majority further relies on General Statutes \u00a7 52-146c (b), which provides in relevantpart: \u201c[I]n civil and criminal actions, in juvenile, probate, commitment and arbitration proceedings, in proceedings preliminary to such actions or proceedings, and in legislative and administrative proceedings, all communications shall be privileged and a psychologist shall not disclose any such communications . . . .\u201d Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, however, these statutes tend to demonstrate that, if the legislature had intended to <em>prohibit </em>disclosures in court proceedings under the exception set forth in \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2), it knew how to do so expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The majority also relies on the principle that statutory exceptions to statutorily created evidentiary privileges, like all statutory exceptions, \u201care to be strictly construed with doubts resolved in favor of the general rule rather than the exception .... [When] express exceptions are made, the legal presumption is that the legislature did not intend to save other cases from the operation of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Falco </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>254 Conn. 321, 330, 757 A.2d 571 (2000). The issue before us in this case, however, is not the scope of the communications and records to which \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) applies, which, I acknowledge, would be subject to strict construction under <em>Falco. </em>Rather, the issue is whether the communications and records that undisputedly come within the scope of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) may be disclosed in judicial proceedings or, instead, are privileged. In my view, that question is governed by the principles that evidentiary privileges must be strictly construed and that only confidential information qualifies for privileged status. See, e.g., <em>PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>supra, 267 Conn. 330 (because evidentiary privileges tend to prevent full disclosure of truth in court, they must be strictly construed).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Finally, the majority\u2019s interpretation has potentially dangerous consequences that are antithetical to the purpose of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2). One such example, which I previously described, is the case in which the social worker\u2019s testimony is critical to the state\u2019s criminal prosecution of the client\u2014a course of action that will be most prudent when the client remains a danger to the target of his threat. The following additional example also is illustrative of the serious adverse consequences of the majority\u2019s holding. A social worker, S, learns from her client, C, that C intends to cause immediate and serious physical injury to a third person, T. Because the communication falls within \u00a7 52-146q (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>(2), S relays the information to T. Like S, T takes the information seriously and goes to court to obtain a restraining order barring C from having any contact with T. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2), however, S cannot testify at the court hearing on T\u2019s application for a restraining order. Because S\u2019s testimony is the only evidence that T has to establish that C poses an immediate and serious danger to T, and because T\u2019s testimony regarding S\u2019s disclosure to T would consist of inadmissible hearsay, the court has no basis on which to issue the restraining order. In such circumstances, the obvious objective of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2), that is, to make it possible for T to protect herself from C, is thwarted.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Ido not believe that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>reasonably could have intended such an unfortunate and potentially harmful result. In fact, the ramifications of the majority\u2019s decision are far broader than they may appear. There is nothing in the language of the exceptions to the statutory provisions governing other similar privileges, including the psychiatrist-patient privilege; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d et seq.; the psychologist-patient privilege; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-146c; the marital and family therapist-client privilege; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-146p; and the professional counselor-client privilege; General Statutes \u00a7 52-146s; or the public policy underlying those exceptions, that would result in an inteipretation of those provisions that is different from the interpretation that the majority has adopted for purposes of the dangerous client exception to the social worker-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">For all the foregoing reasons, I would conclude that, because the communications and records that are subject to \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) are not confidential, they are not privileged, and, therefore, the trial court properly admitted Burke\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s threatening statements.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-146q provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) All communications and records shall be confidential and, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a social worker shall not disclose any such communications and records unless the person or his authorized representative consents to such disclosure.

The question in this case, however, is not whether the statute applied to the defendant\u2019s statements to Burke but whether statements to which \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) undisputedly applies are subject to an evidentiary privilege. Because clients are on notice that, if they communicate to a social worker threats that fall within the scope of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2), those threats potentially may be disclosed and therefore are not confidential.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b702-9\"> See A.

Footnote 22 of the majority opinion. Surely, the majority does not mean to imply that its interpretation of \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2) would not be binding in a case involving these hypothetical facts. Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion that this court, is <em>prohibited </em>from considering the future ramifications of its interpretation of a statute, this court is <em>required </em>to consider those ramifications. Indeed, the only reason that the majority gives for declining to consider the hypothetical is that such consideration is barred by \u00a7 l-2z, a broad assertion with which I also disagree. To the extent that the majority deems the hypothetical to be irrelevant because of its conclusion that \u00a7 52-146q is plain and unambiguous as applied to the facts of this case, I previously have explained my disagreement with the majority\u2019s determination in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">I also am confused by the majority\u2019s substantive response to the posited hypothetical. The majority raises the possibility that the potential harm posed by its interpretation of \u00a7 52-146q may be mitigated by testimony from the social worker (1) concerning the existence of a professional relationship with the client, and (2) that the social worker did in fact warn the third party, in accordance with the dangerous client exception, of the substantial and imminent risk of being harmed physically by the client. Footnote 22 of the majority opinion. Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, it seems quite evident that such testimony would effectively constitute disclosure of information that inarguably is protected under the statute. Moreover, if, in fact, the majority is correct in suggesting that \u00a7 52-146q does not preclude testimony by a social worker that he warned a third party m accordance with the statute\u2019s dangerous client exception, I am unable to discern why the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>facts of the present case do not place it outside the purview of \u00a7 52-146q altogether. The trial court expressly advised Burke <em>not </em>to testify about the content of the defendant\u2019s communications to him but, instead, about his perception and reaction to those communications. Burke, therefore, did not testify about the specifics of what the defendant had told him but merely that he had met with the defendant and that he had warned Edwards of potential harm to him and his family based on the defendant\u2019s angry feelings toward Edwards. To the extent that these disclosures are not materially different from those that the majority indicates may be excluded from the scope of \u00a7 52-146q, I cannot see why, if the majority\u2019s suggested inteipretation is correct, Burke\u2019s testimony would be problematic. In such circumstances, I do not understand why the majority would not first resolve this threshold issue of statutory interpretation, one way or the other, before addressing the secondary question of whether the challenged testimony properly was admitted under the dangerous client exception set forth in \u00a7 52-146q (c) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
