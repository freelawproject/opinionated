J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcX\">In these certified appeals, we must determine whether the Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction to decide the appeals brought by the plaintiffs, Roy Sastrom and Guy Levine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the declaratory rulings by the defendant, the psychiatric security review board (board), in which the board concluded that \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the Regulations of Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>cut State Agencies<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is valid because it does not conflict with General Statutes \u00a7 17a-599.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appellate Court concluded that the board\u2019s rulings are not among the final decisions that may be appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., and affirmed the judgments of the trial court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeals. We reverse the judgments of the Appellate Court because we conclude that the Superior Court did have jurisdiction over the administrative appeals from the board\u2019s declaratory rulings as to the validity of \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the regulations. We further conclude, however, that judgments should be rendered in favor of the board on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeals because \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the regulations does not conflict with \u00a7 17a-599.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The relevant facts and procedural histories are set forth in the decisions of the Appellate Court and are not in dispute. Sastrom, the plaintiff in the first case, was committed on July 11, 1994, \u201cto the jurisdiction of the [board] for a period of time not to exceed forty years after he was acquitted by reason of mental disease or defect of the charges of two counts of harassment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182b (a), four counts of threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (2), and two counts of attempt to commit larceny in the fifth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-125a. [Sastrom] initially was confined at the Whiting Forensic Division of Connecticut Valley Hospital (Whiting), a maximum security mental health facility, but subsequently was transferred to the less restrictive setting of the Dutcher Enhanced Security Service of Connecticut Valley Hospital (Dutcher). While at Dutcher, he was moved from South 2, the enhanced treatment unit, to North 3, a community transition unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u201cOn June 21, 2002, the treatment team granted [Sas-trom\u2019s] request for \u2018Level 4\u2019 privileges, which included one hour per day on the grounds without supervision. On July 4, 2002, [Sastrom] signed himself out at 9 a.m., and was declared absent without leave when he was not present one hour later. [Sastrom] had wandered to a . . . wooded area near the hospital and fallen asleep. The next morning, as he was walking back to Dutcher, several staff members reported seeing him on a road. When a state police trooper arrived, [Sastrom] hid in some bushes. After several hours, the troopers, with the aid of a police dog, located [Sastrom] and returned him to the custody of the [board].</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u201cFollowing his apprehension, [Sastrom] was returned to Whiting. The [board] held a hearing on July 12 and September 20, 2002, regarding the proper placement of [Sastrom]. In a memorandum of decision dated October 28, 2002, the [board] ordered that [Sastrom] remain confined at Whiting for the purposes of care, custody and treatment under maximum security conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u201cIn a petition for a declaratory [ruling] dated March 30, 2004, [Sastrom] sought a determination of whether his confinement in maximum security was appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>and whether \u00a7 17a-581-44 [of the regulations] was invalid in light of the specific violence requirement of \u00a7 17a-599. After a hearing, the [board] issued a decision on September 30, 2004. The [board] noted [Sastrom\u2019s] clinical progress and found that, on the basis of the hospital treatment team\u2019s recommendation, he could be treated in the less restrictive conditions at Dutcher.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u201cThe [board] concluded that [Sastrom] could not prevail with respect to his claim that \u00a7 17a-581-44 [of the regulations] was invalid because it conflicted with \u00a7 17a-599. The [board] determined that \u2018nothing in the statute suggests that its intent is to mandate actual violence as a prerequisite for placing acquittees<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in maximum security settings. Rather, the statute evinces a concern that acquittees be placed in settings appropriate to the type of danger that they pose to themselves and others. Thus, far from being in conflict with the statute ... \u00a7 17a-581-44 complements it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>100 Conn. App. 212, 214-16, 918 A.2d 902 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The plaintiff in the second case, Levine, was committed on March 6, 1992, \u201cto the custody of the [board] for a period of time not to exceed 100 years after he was acquitted by reason of mental disease or defect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>two counts of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. [Levine] was confined at [Whiting] ....</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u201cOn July 18, 2004, [Levine] petitioned the [board] for a declaratory ruling pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 and \u00a7 17a-581-58 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. Specifically, [Levine] sought a ruling on whether he met the statutory standard for confinement in a maximum security setting and whether \u00a7 17a-581-44 was invalid in light of the specific violence requirement of \u00a7 17a-599. On October 1, 2004, the [board] held a hearing on the petition. On November 29, 2004, the [board] issued its declaratory ruling and found that [Levine], because he was so violent or so dangerous, could safely be treated only in the maximum security setting at Whiting.\u201d <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>100 Conn. App. 224, 225-26, 918 A.2d 900 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The board again concluded that \u201cnothing in the statute suggests that its intent is to mandate actual violence as a prerequisite for placing acquittees in maximum security settings. Rather, the statute evinces a concern that acquittees be placed in settings appropriate to the type of danger that they pose to themselves and others. Thus, far from being in conflict with the statute . . . \u00a7 17a-581-44 complements it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The plaintiffs appealed from the board\u2019s declaratory rulings to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The board argued that there was no statutory right to appeal from its declaratory rulings, and, therefore, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court agreed with the board and concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the decisions being appealed were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>within the exclusive list of appealable orders set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 17a-597. Accordingly, it dismissed the appeals. <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 216; see also <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgments of dismissal to the Appellate Court, which concluded that the UAPA does not permit \u201cappeal[s] for every declaratory ruling, but only for those that meet the conditions of [General Statutes] \u00a7 4-183, as restricted by [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 4-186 (f) and 17a-597.\u201d <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 223; see also <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 227. We granted certification in each case to determine whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals from the declaratory rulings issued by the board. <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>282 Conn. 920, 920-21, 925 A.2d 1101 (2007); see also <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>282 Conn. 921, 925 A.2d 1101 (2007).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reverse the judgments of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Our resolution of the certified question is guided by our well settled standard of review. \u201cWe have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary. . . . Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>type of controversy presented by the action before it. ... [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ferguson Mechanical Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Works, </em>282 Conn. 764, 770-71, 924 A.2d 846 (2007). This case raises two jurisdictional issues, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u201cWe have declared that [t]here is no absolute right of appeal to the courts from a decision of an administrative agency. . . . Appeals to the courts from administrative [agencies] exist only under statutory authority .... Appellate jurisdiction is derived from the . . . statutory provisions by which it is created . . . and can be acquired and exercised only in the manner prescribed. ... In the absence of statutory authority, therefore, there is no right of appeal from [an agency\u2019s] decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fullerton </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>280 Conn. 745, 760, 911 A.2d 736 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">In the cases before us, we must determine whether the UAPA authorizes the Superior Court to assume jurisdiction over appeals from the board\u2019s declaratory rulings as to the validity of \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the regulations. The plaintiffs claim that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the judgments of the trial court dismissing their administrative appeals. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the legal question presented in these cases is inherently a judicial matter and should not be left to the discretion of administrative bodies. In support of this assertion, the plaintiffs quote from our holding in <em>Dyous </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>264 Conn. 766, 777, 826 A.2d 138 (2003), that the decision to confine an acquittee under conditions of maximum security is \u201cbest left to the professional discretion of the board, whose mandate is the protection of the general public,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>because of its expertise regarding matters of mental health. They argue that, because the board does not have similar expertise in the law, the legislature clearly did not establish the board as the final arbiter of the validity of its own regulations. They further maintain that the conclusions of the trial court and the Appellate Court effectively grant the board exclusive authority and jurisdiction to determine the validity of its own regulations, requiring complete deference to the board\u2019s legal conclusions while affording only substantial deference to certain findings of fact, which they claim is an absurd and unworkable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The construction of the UAPA, as with other statutes, presents a question of law subject to plenary review. <em>Stiffler </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>288 Conn. 38, 42, 950 A.2d 1270 (2008). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine the meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>We begin with the text of the UAPA. Section 4-183 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the Superior Court . . . .\u201d A \u201c \u2018[f]inal decision,\u2019 \u201d as defined by \u00a7 4-166 (3) (B), includes a \u201cdeclaratory ruling issued by an agency pursuant to section 4-176 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is clear from the language of \u00a7 4-183 (a) that, in general, persons who are aggrieved by a declaratory ruling of an agency may appeal that ruling to the Superior Court after exhausting their administrative remedies. See <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Medical Examining Board for State Employee Disability Retirement, </em>75 Conn. App. 215, 220-21, 815 A.2d 281 (2003) (acknowledging general right to appeal declaratory rulings).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The Superior Court\u2019s jurisdiction over administrative appeals from final decisions of the various agencies is not, however, unlimited. General Statutes \u00a7 4-185 (b) provides in relevant part that \u201cthis chapter shall apply to all agencies and agency proceedings not <em>expressly </em>exempted in this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislature has expressed one such exemption in \u00a7 4-186 (f), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe provisions of section 4-183 shall apply to the [board] in the manner described in section 17a-597 . . . .\u201d Accordingly, appeals from final decisions, including declaratory rulings, of the board are governed by \u00a7 17a-597, which sets forth respective lists of appealable and nonappealable decisions of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Specifically, \u00a7 17a-597 (a) provides that orders of the board entered pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-584 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>(2) or (3),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or General Statutes \u00a7 17a-587,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>may be appealed </em>to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 4-183, whereas \u00a7 17a-597 (b) provides that a decision by the board that an acquittee should be discharged made pursuant to \u00a7 17a-584 (l), <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or General Statutes \u00a7 17a-592<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or \u00a7 17a-593 (d),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>shall not be subject to judicial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>review </em>pursuant to \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the language of \u00a7 17a-597 provides a right of appeal from a decision of the board ordering an acquittee\u2019s confinement, conditional release or temporary leave, but expressly exempts from judicial review decisions recommending to the court that an acquittee be discharged from the board\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Section 17a-597, however, does not state expressly whether declaratory rulings as to the validity of regulations issued by the board pursuant to \u00a7 4-176 (a) are appealable. Simply put, it does not identify the board\u2019s declaratory rulings under \u00a7 4-176 (a) among either the list of appealable decisions set forth in \u00a7 17a-597 (a) or the list of nonappealable decisions set forth in \u00a7 17a-597 (b). Accordingly, we conclude that the language of \u00a7 4-186 (f) is ambiguous with respect to the board\u2019s declaratory rulings. We therefore must look beyond the text of the statute to discern whether the legislature intended to subject the board\u2019s declaratory rulings to judicial review.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Stiffler </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>supra, 288 Conn. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Our review of the history and statutory framework of the UAPA, as well as relevant case law, leads us to conclude that, although the legislature intended to limit judicial scrutiny of certain <em>factual </em>determinations made by the board, it expressed no intention to prevent courts from scrutinizing the board\u2019s <em>legal </em>conclusions as to whether a regulation is valid or ultra vires. Prior to July 1, 1989, the UAPA generally permitted appeals from declaratory rulings as to the validity of a regulation, but only in contested cases. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7\u00a7 4-176<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>183 (a);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Ratick Combustion, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Heating, Piping &amp; Cooling Work Examining Board, </em>34 Conn. App. 123, 127-28, 640 A.2d 152 (1994); <em>Shearson American Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Banking Commissioner, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 462, 464, 466 A.2d 800 (1983). The UAPA also permitted aggrieved persons to petition the courts directly for declaratory judgments with respect to an agency\u2019s rulings on the validity of its regulations in noncontested cases, subject to the exhaustion of their administrative remedies. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 4-175;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Ratick Combustion, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Healing, Piping &amp; Cooling Work Examining Board, </em>supra, 127; <em>Shearson American Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Banking Commissioner, </em>supra, 466; see also <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>208 Conn. 663, 672, 546 A.2d 257 (1988). Thus, all agency determinations regarding the validity of regulations were subject to judicial scrutiny under the UAPA, <em>either </em>by way of an administrative appeal <em>or </em>in a direct action for a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nothing in the UAPA exempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the board from this statutory framework. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7\u00a7 4-185 and 4-186; see also 28 S. Proc., Pt. 15, 1985 Sess., pp. 4912-13, remarks of Senator Richard Johnston; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 5,1985 Sess., pp. 1439-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In 1988, the legislature passed No. 88-317 of the 1988 Public Acts (P.A. 88-317), which substantially revised the UAPA. See <em>Vernon Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>217 Conn. 130, 131, 585 A.2d 76 (1991). The purpose of this revision, in part, was to \u201csimplify the [circumstances] that require appeal [from declaratory rulings] as oppose[d] to independent action.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1,1988 Sess., p. 188; see also Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciaiy, Pt. 2, 1988 Sess., p. 380. Accordingly, the legislature subjected declaratory rulings on the validity of regulations, in both contested and noncontested cases, to judicial review by way of appeal; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-176 (a), 4-183 (a) and 4-166 (3); and limited direct petitions to the Superior Court for declaratory judgments to those circumstances wherein the petitioner first had requested a declaratory ruling from the agency, but did not receive one. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-176 (e)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and 4-175 (a);<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>LoPresto </em>v. <em>State Employ</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>ees Retirement Commission, </em>234 Conn. 424, 432 n. 15, 662 A.2d 738 (1995) (declaratory ruling constitutes final decision for purposes of appeal under \u00a7 4-183); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>83 Conn. App. 599, 605, 851 A.2d 320 (trial court had jurisdiction to entertain administrative appeal because declar atory ruling is appealable regardless of whether it arises in contested case), cert. denied, 271 Conn. 909, 859 A.2d 561 (2004). Therefore, once an agency has opined on the validity of its regulations, an aggrieved party may no longer bring an independent action in the Superior Court for a declaratory judgment, but must instead rely on the record before the agency in seeking a review of the agency\u2019s legal conclusions in an administrative appeal. See <em>Vincenzo </em>v. <em>Chairman, Board of Parole, </em>64 Conn. App. 258, 263, 779 A.2d 843 (2001); see also General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-175 (a) and 4-183 (i) and (j).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We conclude from this history that the legislature, in enacting P.A. 88-317, indicated its intent to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>allowing for judicial review of all declaratory rulings by the various state agencies, in both contested and noncontested cases, by including declaratory rulings among the list of final decisions that may be appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 4-183. Nothing in this history <em>expresses </em>a legislative intent to limit that broad grant of jurisdiction. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-185 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Our conclusion that the legislature did not intend to restrict judicial review of the board\u2019s declaratory rulings regarding the validity of its regulations finds further support in <em>Hill v. State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 601, 610-11, wherein the Appellate Court held that an applicant for a disability retirement pension who had received an adverse decision from the state medical examining board (medical board) was not entitled to review of that board\u2019s decision by the state employee\u2019s retirement commission, but could seek the commission\u2019s review of the medical board\u2019s legal conclusion that it was collaterally estopped from making an independent determination of whether the applicant\u2019s injury was service connected in light of previous workers\u2019 compensation proceedings arising out of the same facts. In <em>Hill, </em>the Appellate Court observed, and we agree, that \u201c[i]t is logical to assume that the legislature intended to designate the medical board as the sole arbiter of <em>medical eligibility </em>for disability retirement pension benefits so as to take advantage of the board\u2019s medical expertise. See <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>[210 Conn. 214, 219, 554 A.2d 292 (1989)]. . . . [I]t is not logical to assume that the legislature also intended to mandate the same deference with respect to eligibility <em>as a matter of law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Hill </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>supra, 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Likewise, it is logical that the decision to confine an acquittee under conditions of maximum security would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>be \u201cbest left to the professional discretion of the board, whose mandate is the protection of the general public,\u201d because of its expertise regarding matters of mental health. <em>Dyous </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 777. The board\u2019s expertise in matters of mental health, however, does not provide a sound basis for the conclusion that the legislature intended to defer to the board\u2019s legal analysis as to the validity of its regulations. Cf. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gro-ton, </em>262 Conn. 45, 64, 808 A.2d 1107 (2002) (declining to relegate to zoning board responsibility of constitutional fact-finding in absence of expertise).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We conclude, on the basis of its language and history, that the UAPA clearly provides for judicial oversight with respect to the validity of the regulations promulgated by the various agencies, including the board. We further conclude that the list of fact based determinations excluded from judicial review in \u00a7 17a-597 does not express a legislative intent, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4-185 (b) and 4-186 (f), to limit appellate review of the board\u2019s legal conclusions as to the validity of its own regulations. If the legislature had intended to include the board\u2019s declaratory rulings as to the validity of its regulations among the exemptions expressed in \u00a7 17a-597, it easily could have expressed that intent. See <em>In re Darlene C., </em>247 Conn. 1, 11, 717 A.2d 1242 (1998). Accordingly, the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the Superior Court lacks jurisdiction over administrative appeals from the board\u2019s declaratory rulings as to the validity of its regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Our conclusion that the UAPA allows the court to assume jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeals does not end our discussion. We next must address the board\u2019s argument that the courts lack jurisdiction in the present cases because the plaintiffs are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>not aggrieved by the board\u2019s declaratory rulings. As we noted previously in this opinion, \u00a7 4-183 (a) permits a person who has exhausted all available administrative remedies <em>and who is aggrieved by a final decision </em>to appeal to the Superior Court. The board argues that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate either statutory or classical aggrievement and, therefore, do not have standing to appeal the board\u2019s rulings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u201cIt is . . . fundamental that, in order to have standing to bring an administrative appeal, a person must be aggrieved. . . . Standing ... is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bongiorno Supermarket, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>266 Conn. 531, 538, 833 A.2d 883 (2003). \u201cAggrievement is established if there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alvord Investment, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>282 Conn. 393, 400, 920 A.2d 1000 (2007). \u201cIf a party is found to lack [aggrievement], the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bingham </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Works, </em>286 Conn. 698, 701, 945 A.2d 927 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u201cTwo broad yet distinct categories of aggrievement exist, classical and statutory. . . . Statutory aggrievement exists by legislative fiat, not by judicial analysis of the particular facts of the case. In other words, in cases of statutory aggrievement, particular legislation grants standing to those who claim injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to an interest protected by that legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In this case, the plaintiffs have not identified, and we do not find, any legislation, either in the board\u2019s enabling act, General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 et seq., or elsewhere in the General Statutes, that confers standing on the plaintiffs. See id., 703-705. Accordingly, we conclude that they are not statutorily aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">With respect to classical aggrievement under the UAPA, the plaintiffs must make a two part showing. \u201cFirst, [they] must demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the [controversy], as opposed to a general interest that all members of the community share. . . . Second, [they] must also show that the [alleged conduct] has specially and injuriously affected that specific personal or legal interest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 702. Moreover, the plaintiffs must demonstrate a relation to the action of the board beyond \u201cthe fact that they were the petitioners. If this in and of itself were sufficient to appeal the adverse declaratory ruling to the Superior Court, the provisions of \u00a7 4-183 requiring aggrievement would be meaningless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 705-706; id., 706 (expansive right to petition for declaratory ruling under \u00a7 4-176 does not confer automatic right to appeal under \u00a7 4-183).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The plaintiffs in this case have asserted a legal interest in the conditions of their confinement. Specifically, the plaintiffs have asserted that, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-599, they are entitled to be confined in a less restrictive setting if the board finds that they are not \u201cso violent as to require confinement under conditions of maximum security.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 asserted interest clearly is personal to them because, unlike members of the general public, an improper application of \u00a7 17a-599 might subject them to stricter conditions of confinement than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>conditions to which they otherwise would be entitled. Further, the plaintiffs allege that the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the regulations improperly broadens the scope of \u00a7 17a-599, subjecting them to conditions of maximum security confinement that the statute otherwise would not allow. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiffs are classically aggrieved because there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that the board\u2019s declaratory rulings have affected their alleged interest in being confined under conditions that are less than maximum security conditions.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Appellate Court, therefore, improperly affirmed the judgments of the trial court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Because the Appellate Court and the trial court both concluded that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeals, neither court reached the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Ordinarily under these circumstances, we would remand the case to the trial court for a review of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Subsequent to oral argument in this case, however, we ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the following questions: \u201c(1) Does \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the [regulations] . . . conflict with ... \u00a7 17a-599?\u201d and \u201c(2) If the answer to question one is yes, should the regulation be declared invalid?\u201d The record on appeal therefore is adequate for our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>review of the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims because: (1) all parties have briefed their claims to this court; and (2) their claims present issues of law that are subject to plenary review by this court. See <em>Testa </em>v. <em>Geressy, </em>286 Conn. 291, 313-14, 943 A.2d 1075 (2008) (reviewing merits of plaintiffs claims after concluding that trial court improperly declined to review claims). In light of this record, and because this issue is one of first impression and a question of law over which we exercise plenary review; <em>Farmers Texas County Mutual </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>282 Conn. 535, 541, 923 A.2d 673 (2007); see also <em>Stiffler </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>supra, 288 Conn. 42; we conclude that a final resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeals by this court will best serve the interests of judicial economy. See <em>Testa </em>v. <em>Geressy, </em>supra, 314, quoting <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>216 Conn. 627, 639, 583 A.2d 906 (1990) (\u201cbecause the administrative record before us on appeal is identical to that which was before the trial court, the interests of judicial economy would not be served by a remand in this case\u201d). Accordingly, we address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the regulations conflicts with \u00a7 17a-599 and, therefore, is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the regulations conflicts with \u00a7 17a-599 because the regulation subjects an acquittee to maximum security confinement under a more inclusive standard than the standard set forth in the statute. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the regulations, which subjects an acquittee who \u201cposes a danger to self or others\u201d to the possibility of maximum security confinement, bestows upon the board broader discretion than the legislature had intended when it enacted \u00a7 17a-599, which subjects acquittees to maximum security confinement if they are found to be \u201cso violent as to require [such] confinement . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 argument necessarily is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>premised on an assumption that \u00a7 17a-599 does not allow the board discretion to commit to maximum security confinement acquittees whom the board does not find to be \u201cso violent as to require confinement under conditions of maximum security . . . .\u201d We disagree with this premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The text of \u00a7 17a-599 provides in relevant part: \u201cAt any time the court or the board determines that the acquittee is a person who should be confined, it shall make a further determination of whether the acquittee is so violent as to require confinement under conditions of maximum security. Any acquittee found so violent as to require confinement under conditions of maximum security shall not be confined in any hospital for psychiatric disabilities . . . unless such hospital . . . has the trained and equipped staff, facilities or security to accommodate such acquittee.\u201d The second sentence of the statute clearly expresses a legislative intent to prohibit the placement of an acquittee in a security setting that is less than maximum if that acquittee is determined to be so violent as to require maximum security confinement. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 position, however, nothing in the statute limits the board\u2019s discretion with respect to the placement of acquittees who are not found to be so violent as to require maximum security confinement. Thus, \u00a7 17a-599 does not contemplate that <em>only </em>\u201cso violent\u201d acquittees may be confined under conditions of maximum security.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">This interpretation of \u00a7 17a-599 is buttressed by a review of the statutory scheme of which \u00a7 17a-599 is a part. Section 17a-584 specifically provides that the board\u2019s \u201cprimary concern\u201d in considering the confinement of acquittees \u201cis the protection of society . . . .\u201d In addition, \u00a7 17a-584 (3) provides that \u201c[i]f the board finds that the acquittee is a person who should be confined, the board shall order the person confined in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities ... for custody, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>care and treatment.\u201d Thus, while the board\u2019s consideration of an acquittee\u2019s placement must focus first on the interests of society, the board also must facilitate the care and treatment needs of the acquittee. Confinement under conditions of maximum security reasonably could further both purposes. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-561 (hsting purposes served by Whiting). As we stated in <em>Dyous </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 777, decisions with respect to the danger the acquittee poses to others and the appropriateness and type of treatment are best left to the professional discretion of the board. Those concerns would be served better when the board has greater, not less, discretion to determine the placement of acquittees consistent with the requirements of due process.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Thus, in deferring to the professional judgment of the board in determining the placement of acquittees who are not found so violent as to require maximum security confinement, our legislature has struck a proper balance between the plaintiffs\u2019 liberty interests and the board\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting public safety. Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the legislature has limited the board\u2019s discretion as to which acquittees under its jurisdiction may be confined in maximum security settings. Having rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 predicate assumption that \u00a7 17a-599 limits the board\u2019s discretion, we further reject the plaintiffs\u2019 ultimate claim that \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the regulations con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>flicts with \u00a7 17a-599 in that it improperly expands the board\u2019s authority under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The judgments of the Appellate Court are reversed and the cases are remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgments of the trial court and to remand the cases to the trial court with direction to affirm the decisions of the psychiatric security review board.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-11\"> We refer to Sastrom and Levine individually by name where necessary and collectively as the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> Section 17a-581-44 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides: \u201cThe [b]oard may order a person confined in a maximum security setting if the [b]oard finds that the acquittee poses a danger to self or others such that a maximum security setting is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Section 17a-581-2 (a) (6) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies defines danger to self or to others as \u201cthe risk of imminent physical injury to others or self, and also includes the risk of loss or destruction of the property of others.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-599 provides in relevant part: \u201cAt any time the court or the board determines that the acquittee is a person who should be confined, it shall make a further determination of whether the acquittee is so violent as to require confinement under conditions of maximum security.

Accordingly, the answer to the first question in his petition for a declaratory ruling is no. He is neither so violent nor so dangerous at this time as to require maximum security confinement and may be transferred to the less restrictive treatment environment of Dutcher. \u201d <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 100 Conn.

See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-585. Accordingly, a determination that \u00a7 17a-581-44 of the regulations is invalid would result in practical relief to Sastrom because, at his next biennial review and thereafter, the board no longer could apply the \u00a7 17a-581-44 standard for determining the conditions of his confinement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> Legislative deference to the board with respect to decisions concerning the conditions of an acquittee\u2019s confinement is consistent with due process.

Ed. 2d 28 (1982), the United States Supreme Court held that, in balancing the liberty interests of involuntarily committed individuals against the legitimate interests of the state, due process requires only that government actors exercise professional judgment as to the needs of such individuals and the safety of others in maldng decisions regarding the conditions of the individual\u2019s confinement. Further, such decisions by professional personnel are entitled to a presumption of correctness. Id., 323.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
