The defendant challenges the court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider his motion to vacate the judgment and to withdraw his plea. The defendant also contests the court\u2019s conclusion that a writ of error coram nobis is not available because its judgment was not void orvoidable. Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly declined to terminate several special conditions of probation on the ground that these conditions were not contemplated by the defendant at the time of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The state urges us to affirm the decision of the trial court on these issues. Alternatively, with regard to the jurisdictional issue, the state claims that there is no \u201cconstitutional violation\u201d exception to the general rule that the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over a criminal case terminates upon execution of the sentence. We agree with the state\u2019s alternate ground regarding the issue of jurisdiction, and, although we proceed by a slightly different route than the trial court, we affirm as to the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On May 16, 2007, the defendant, pursuant to an agreement with the state, entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charges of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>sexual assault in the fourth degree and criminal trespass in the first degree. After canvassing the defendant in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 39-19,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court accepted the plea. The court sentenced the defendant to one year incarceration on each count, to run consecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>tively, execution suspended, and three years of probation. At sentencing, the court also imposed several special conditions of probation \u201cin addition to the usual terms . . . .\u201d Specifically, the court ordered that the defendant \u201cundergo whatever sex offender evaluation and treatment that [would be] deemed appropriate by the probation department\u201d and \u201chave no contact . . . with the [victim] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">On May 21, 2007, the office of adult probation advised the defendant that he would be required to comply with certain additional \u201c[s]ex [o]ffender [conditions of [probation,\u201d including a requirement that he notify his employer of his conviction. In response, on May 24, 2007, the defendant filed a motion to modify the conditions of his probation, specifically asking the court to terminate the special sex offender conditions. At a hearing conducted on May 31, 2007, the court suspended the application of several of these conditions and stayed several others. Specifically, the court extended the deadline for the defendant to notify his employer of his conviction in order to afford the defendant and his counsel additional time to determine how to comply with the requirement in a way that would minimize any negative impact on the defendant\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Dissatisfied with the trial court\u2019s refusal to terminate several of these conditions, particularly, the employer notification requirement, the defendant, on July 26, 2007, filed a motion to vacate the judgment and to withdraw his plea, and a petition for a writ of error coram nobis in the alternative. On August 1, 2007, the court heard arguments on the motion and petition. The state challenged the court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider the motion and disputed all of the defendant\u2019s arguments on the merits. At this hearing, defense counsel reminded the court that the defendant\u2019s motion for modification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of May 24, 2007, never had been withdrawn or definitively decided, and the court stated that it would treat that motion as an alternative prayer for relief and issue a single decision addressing all of the defendant\u2019s claims. On August 23, 2007, the court issued a lengthy and thorough memorandum of decision, in which it dismissed, on jurisdictional grounds, the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and to withdraw his plea, rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that the constitutional violation exception applied under the facts of the case. The court also denied both his petition for a writ of error coram nobis and his motion to modify the conditions of his probation. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We first must address the threshold matter of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and to withdraw his plea. Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction are purely legal in nature and subject to plenary review. E.g., <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Pritchard, </em>281 Conn. 262, 270, 914 A.2d 1025 (2007) (\u201c[a] determination regarding . . . subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law . . . [and, therefore] our review is plenary\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We conclude that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the defendant\u2019s motion and, moreover, conclude that there is no constitutional violation exception to this rule extant in our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u201cThe Superior Court is a constitutional court of general jurisdiction. In the absence of statutory or constitutional provisions, the limits of its jurisdiction are delineated by the common law. ... It is well established that under the common law a trial court has the discretionary power to modify or vacate a criminal judgment before the sentence has been executed. . . . This is so because the court loses jurisdiction over the case when the defendant is committed to the custody of the commissioner of correction and begins serving</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the sentence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>230 Conn. 427, 431-32, 646 A.2d 85 (1994). The present case does not present a challenge to this general premise. The dispute centers on whether our common law has established an exception to this rule when a defendant claims that his plea was the product of an alleged constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We begin with the well established premise that \u201cthe jurisdiction of the sentencing court terminates once a defendant\u2019s sentence has begun, and, therefore, that court may no longer take any action affecting a defendant\u2019s sentence unless it expressly has been authorized to act.\u201d <em>Cobham </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 30, 37, 779 A.2d 80 (2001); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>277 Conn. 764, 775, 894 A.2d 963 (2006); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>208 Conn. 420, 424-25, 545 A.2d 559 (1988). This principle is memorialized in Practice Book \u00a7 39-26, which provides: \u201cA defendant may withdraw his or her plea of guilty or nolo contendere as a matter of right until the plea has been accepted. After acceptance, the judicial authority shall allow the defendant to withdraw his or her plea upon proof of one of the grounds in Section 39-27. <em>A defendant may not withdraw his or her plea after the conclusion of the proceeding at which the sentence was </em>imposed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Although there are several exceptions to this rule that afford the trial court jurisdiction over a defendant\u2019s challenge to his <em>sentence, </em>we find it instructive that none of these exceptions extends the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider a postsentencing attack on the plea itself. For instance, one such exception is expressed in Practice Book \u00a7 43-22: \u201cThe judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>manner. \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Another example is found in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (c), which grants the trial court the authority to \u201cmodify or enlarge\u201d the conditions of a defendant\u2019s probation \u201c[a]t any time . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 43-21 provides yet another example of an explicit exception to the trial court\u2019s lack of postsentencing jurisdiction, providing: \u201cAt any time during the period of a definite sentence of three years or less, the judicial authority may, after a hearing and for good cause shown, reduce the sentence or order the defendant discharged or released on probation or on a conditional discharge for a period not to exceed that to which the defendant could have been sentenced originally.\u201d None of these explicitly codified exceptions is relevant, however, to a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider a defendant\u2019s postsentencing request to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The trial court, relying on Appellate Court precedent; e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>84 Conn. App. 429, 434, 853 A.2d 607 (2004); determined that there is another \u201cnarrow\u201d exception pursuant to which the trial court retains jurisdiction after the imposition of sentence. The court explained: \u201c[Another] situation in which the trial court may retain jurisdiction is in those cases [in which] \u2018it is apparent on the record that a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were infringed during the plea taking proceeding or that the defendant was not advised of the consequences of his plea and was therefore denied due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>cess.\u2019 \u201d Although we recognize that the trial court was obligated to follow this precedent of the Appellate Court, we conclude that the precedent is based on a flawed understanding of prior cases and is inconsistent with our recent opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 764.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The case that appears to be the source of the so-called constitutional violation exception to the jurisdiction rules is <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaeffer, </em>5 Conn. App. 378, 498 A.2d 134 (1985). In <em>Schaeffer, </em>the defendant sought to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere two days after sentencing on the ground that the court had exceeded the state\u2019s sentencing recommendation without affording him an opportunity to withdraw his plea. Id., 379, 381. While noting that Practice Book, 1978-97, \u00a7 720, now Practice Book \u00a7 39-26, provides that \u201c \u2018[a] defendant may not withdraw his plea after the conclusion of the proceeding at which sentence was imposed\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaeffer, </em>supra, 385; the Appellate Court nevertheless declared that \u201c[pjostsentence attacks on the voluntary and intelligent nature of a plea . . . may be made if the defendant has not been made aware of the true nature of the charge against him because the court failed to apprise him of a crucial element of the charge ... or if the court failed to explain to the defendant [that] his plea operated as a waiver of constitutional rights. ... If it is apparent on the record that a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were infringed during the plea taking proceeding or that the defendant was not advised of the consequences of his plea and was there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>fore denied due process, a plea may be withdrawn even after the sentence proceeding has concluded.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 385-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In carving out this exception, <em>Schaeffer </em>relied on three cases, namely, <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983), <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>197 Conn. 17, 495 A.2d 1028 (1985), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-9), </em>36 Conn. Sup. 578, 421 A.2d 557 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A fundamental misunderstanding of <em>Childree </em>has created confusion in our law with respect to whether there is an exception to the rule depriving the trial court of jurisdiction to consider a motion to withdraw a plea once the sentence has been executed. In <em>Childree, </em>unlike in the present case, the defendant had timely appealed from the judgment of conviction, and, therefore, this court undoubtedly had jurisdiction over the appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra, 119. <em>Childree </em>concerned only the availability of <em>appellate review </em>for a defendant\u2019s claim that his guilty plea had been constitutionally deficient when such a claim was raised for the first time on appeal. See id. The court stated: \u201cWe begin our analysis by noting that the proper procedure for raising a claim that a guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made is to make that claim in the trial court in the first instance. . . . There is no explanation on the record why this procedure was not followed. Nonetheless, because the error claimed by the defendant involves the violation of a fundamental constitutional right, <em>we will consider it for the first time on appeal.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Id. Thus, it is apparent that the defendant in <em>Childree </em>was not seeking to challenge his plea by way of a motion to withdraw in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>court but, rather, via a direct and timely appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See id. The issues of subject matter jurisdiction and preservation of claims for appellate review are separate and independent considerations. See footnote 6 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In <em>Childree, </em>this court was applying the well established exception to the general rule of nonreviewability for unpreserved claims rather than establishing a new exception affording trial courts subject matter jurisdiction over postsentencing plea challenges. Our decision to review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claims in <em>Childree </em>was premised on the <em>pre-Golding</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>framework set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973) (\u201cThere appear ... to exist only two situations that may constitute \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 such that newly raised claims can and will be considered by this court. The first is . . . [when] a new constitutional right not readily foreseeable has arisen between the time of trial and appeal. . . . The second \u2018exceptional circumstance\u2019 may arise [when] the record adequately supports a claim that a litigant has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>fair trial.\u201d [Citation omitted.]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This fact was made explicit in <em>Childree </em>when we cited to <em>Evans </em>in support of our determination to review \u201cfor the first time on appeal\u201d the defendant\u2019s claim that his plea was unknowing and involuntary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 119.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The most we can extrapolate from <em>Childree, </em>therefore, is that a defendant who seeks to challenge his plea after being taken in execution of his sentence may do so if he directly appeals from the judgment of conviction in a timely manner and convinces the reviewing court that he is entitled to review of his claim under the <em>Golding </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In other words, such claims are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>to be treated on par with all other unpreserved claims. The mere fact that the constitutional validity of a defendant\u2019s plea is not necessarily immune from appellate review, however, does not alter the fact that once a defendant\u2019s sentence is executed, the trial court lacks jurisdiction to entertain any claims regarding the validity of that plea in the absence of a statute or rule of practice to the contrary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 773-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">To the extent that cases such as <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 21-22, <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-9), </em>supra, 36 Conn. Sup. 579-80, <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 433-36, <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>85 Conn. App. 27, 37-38, 856 A.2d 452, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 933, 859 A.2d 931 (2004),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaeffer, </em>supra, 5 Conn. App. 385-86, suggest that there exists in our jurisprudence a constitutional violation exception to the trial court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea after the sentence has been executed, those cases are hereby overruled. In fact, that aspect of these cases was implicitly overruled by our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>in <em>Reid.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The essential facts and procedural posture in <em>Reid </em>are strikingly similar to those presently before us.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In that case, the defendant, Mark Reid, filed a motion to withdraw his plea on the ground that it was not knowing and voluntary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 771. Reid filed the motion several years after his sentence was executed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See id., 770-71. \u201cThe trial court . . . noted that [Reid\u2019s] motion to withdraw the plea was untimely . . . but concluded that, because [Reid] had asserted constitutional claims that could be reviewed, it would consider the motion.\u201d Id., 771. The trial court ultimately denied the motion on the merits; id.; concluding that Reid had failed to demonstrate \u201ca clear constitutional violation\u201d or \u201ca clear deprivation of his right to a fair hearing.\u201d Id., 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Reid appealed from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his plea. See id. On appeal, the state asserted that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider Reid\u2019s motion. Id. Despite the ostensibly constitutional basis for Reid\u2019s challenge, we held that \u201cthe trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear1 and determine [Reid\u2019s] motion to withdraw.\u201d Id., 776. We stated that, \u201c[u]nder well established law, it is clear that the trial court\u2019s lack of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the motion to withdraw rendered void its denial of that motion.\u201d Id. Consistent with our settled jurispru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>dence regarding jurisdiction, we reached this conclusion <em>before </em>considering the merits of the underlying claim, thereby foreclosing the possibility of the existence of a constitutional violation exception to the trial court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The unmistakable implication of <em>Reid </em>is its refutation of the exception contemplated by the trial court and urged by the defendant in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Having determined that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s postsentencing motion to withdraw his plea,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we must nevertheless address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly denied his petition for a writ of error coram nobis. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s petition on the ground that he had \u201cnot proven that the judgment [of conviction] complained of was void or voidable.\u201d Although, in our view, the court improperly considered the merits of the defendant\u2019s petition, we nevertheless agree that a writ of error coram nobis is inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u201cA writ of error coram nobis is an ancient common-law remedy which authorized the trial judge, within three years, to vacate the judgment of the same court if the party aggrieved by the judgment could present facts, not appearing in the record, which, if true, would show that such judgment was void or voidable. <em>Montville </em>v. <em>Alpha Mills Co., </em>86 Conn. 229, 233, 84 A. 933 (1912). . . . The facts must be unknown at the time of the trial without fault of the party seeking relief. <em>State </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>263 Minn. 168, 115 N.W.2d 920 (1962). . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Grisgraber, </em>[183 Conn. 383, 385, 439 A.2d 377 (1981)]. A writ of error coram nobis lies only in the unusual situation [in which] no adequate remedy is provided by law. . . . Moreover, when habeas corpus affords a proper and complete remedy the writ of error coram nobis will not lie. . . . Id.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Henderson, 259 Conn. 1, 3, 787 A.2d 514 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">A defendant seeking to withdraw his plea after his sentence has been executed has several avenues available to challenge the constitutionality of his plea. First, a defendant may file a timely appeal in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 and request review of his unpreserved claims under <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Alternately, a defendant may file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge the constitutionality of his plea. See, e.g., <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Office of Adult Probation, </em>67 Conn. App. 142, 143, 786 A.2d 1120 (2001). Of course, if this claim is not first raised on direct appeal, the defendant must satisfy \u201cthe cause and prejudice standard of <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594 (1977), for determining the reviewability of habeas claims that were not properly pursued on direct appeal. . . . Unless the [defendant] can satisfy that standard, [he is] not entitled to review of [his] claims on the merits.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 144; see also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>218 Conn. 403, 417, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991) (adopting federal cause and prejudice standard for \u201chabeas review with respect to constitutional claims not properly preserved because of a trial court default\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>We conclude that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that this case presents us with the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify the issuance of a writ of error coram nobis. We reach this conclusion because the defendant may yet avail himself of a writ of habeas corpus and, therefore, has not met his burden of demonstrating that he has no adequate remedy available to him. Thus, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of error coram nobis.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">We turn now to address the defendant\u2019s final claim that the trial court improperly denied his motion to modify the conditions of his probation. First, to the extent that the defendant grounds his claim on the allegation that the conditions imposed were not in accord with his understanding of his plea, it is precluded by the same jurisdictional bar as his more direct attempt to withdraw the plea itself.

To the extent that the defendant\u2019s claims are based on alleged flaws in the court\u2019s acceptance of his plea, Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 is clearly inapplicable. Moreover, the defendant does not claim, nor is there anything in the record to indicate, that his sentence is \u201cillegal,\u201d and the defendant did not rely on \u00a7 43-22 in his motion. Thus, we need not concern ourselves with this narrow exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"><em> </em>Although the trial court referred to <em>Reid </em>in its memorandum of decision, it failed to recognize the significance of that case with respect to <em>Falcon </em>and other Appellate Court cases, which purport to expand the jurisdiction of the Superior Court by way of an exception for constitutional violations. As we explain more fully in this opinion, although <em>Reid </em>did not explicitly overrule this line of Appellate Court cases, its holding is clearly inconsistent with the existence of any such exception and, therefore, overruled those cases sub silentio.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> Because <em>Martin </em>relied directly and exclusively on <em>Childree and Anonymous (1980-9) </em>in support of its application of this purported exception; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 21-22, we need not address it separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\"> The procedural posture of the appeal is the most critical element in determining jurisdiction under these circumstances. If a defendant files a timely direct appeal in which he challenges the constitutionality of his plea, an appellate court clearly has subject matter jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the judgment of conviction rendered in accordance with that plea, even if such a claim must undergo an analysis under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or the plain error doctrine; see Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; before it can be reviewed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra 189 Conn. 119; see also footnote 8 of this opinion. If, on the other hand, a defendant seeks to challenge the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a postsentencing motion to withdraw his plea, over which that court lacks jurisdiction, this court also would lack jurisdiction to review the merits of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of that motion. The confusion caused by these two procedural scenarios and their significance with respect to the issues of reviewability and jurisdiction have, in our view, largely created the false notion of a constitutional violation exception that we address in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"><em> State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\"> <em>Childree </em>was decided prior to this court\u2019s opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233,567 A.2d 823 (1989), in which we established a framework for assessing, inter alia, the reviewability of unpreserved constitutional claims: \u201cUnder <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

See id., 617. Hatch made the claim on direct appeal. See id. The Appellate Court noted that Hatch had failed to move to withdraw his plea pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-26 and, therefore, \u201carguably failed to preserve his claim before the trial court.\u201d Id., 618. The court proceeded to examine the reviewability of Hatch\u2019s claim under the <em>Golding </em>doctrine, with no mention of any exception that would have conferred jurisdiction on the trial court to hear the claim after Hatch\u2019s sentence was imposed.

Among the conditions stayed were the special sex offender conditions at issue in this appeal. On July 26, 2007, before the trial court took any further action with respect to these conditions, the defendant filed the motion to vacate the judgment of conviction and to withdraw his plea, the dismissal of which forms the basis for this appeal.
