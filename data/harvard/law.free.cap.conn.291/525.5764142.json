The plaintiff, Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., appealed to the Superior Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-237, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the decision of the defendant, Pamela Law, the commissioner of revenue services, denying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s request to exchange its research and development tax credit carried forward from income year 2003 for a credit refund in income year 2004 pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-217ee and 12-217n. The plaintiff now appeals<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the defendant, dismissing the plaintiffs appeal after concluding that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the relevant terms of \u00a7 12-217n by prematurely attempting to exchange its research and development tax credit from income year 2003. We affirm the judgment of the trial court, but on the alternate ground<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that \u00a7 12-217ee authorizes the exchange of an unused research and development tax credit for a credit refund only in the income year in which the taxpayer qualifies for the credit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The record reveals the following stipulated facts and relevant procedural history. The plaintiff, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New Haven, is a qualified small business for the purposes of \u00a7 12-217ee. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-217n (b) (4). Section 12-217ee permits a qualified small business to exchange for a credit refund the research and development credit that it was allowed in a particular income year, but was unable to take in that year because it had no tax liability. General Statutes \u00a7 12-217ee (a). For its income year 2003, the plaintiff had incurred substantial expenses for research and development and claimed a tax credit for those expenses in excess of $600,000. The plaintiff sought and received, pursuant to \u00a7 12-217ee (a), a credit refund equal to one third of that credit and, pursuant to \u00a7 12-217n (d) (4), carried forward the remaining two thirds of the allowable 2003 research and development credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In income year 2004, the plaintiff again incurred substantial expenses for research and development and claimed a tax credit for those expenses. Once again, it sought and received a credit refund equal to one third of the 2004 credit. Additionally, however, the plaintiff also sought to exchange for a credit refund the carried forward balance of its 2003 research and development tax credit. The defendant denied the plaintiffs request.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff then timely appealed from the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>denial to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 12-237. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In that appeal, the trial court disagreed with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-217ee, and concluded that the statute does permit qualified taxpayers to exchange for a credit refund their research and development tax credits carried forward from previous income years. The court nevertheless rendered judgment for the defendant because it concluded that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the ordering rule found in \u00a7 12-217n (d) (2) and (4). The trial court determined that this ordering rule requires taxpayers to exchange tax credits \u201caccording to their expiration dates . . . .\u201d Thus, the court concluded that \u201cthe plaintiff, having outstanding . . . research and development tax credits earned in the income years of 2001 and 2002, is not entitled to the payment of the . . . research and development tax credits earned in the subsequent income tax year of 2003 without first using up prior . . . research and development tax credits.\u201d The trial court therefore concluded that the plaintiffs attempt to exchange its research and development tax credit from income year 2003 was premature and in violation of the ordering rule. This appeal followed. See footnote 6 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">On appeal, the defendant contends, as an alternate ground for affirming the judgment of the trial court, that \u00a7 12-217ee authorizes the exchange of an unused research and development tax credit for a credit refund only in the income year in which the taxpayer qualifies for the credit. More specifically, the defendant claims that the language of \u00a7 12-217ee clearly and unambiguously limits the exchange of unused research and development tax credits for a refund to credits that are earned in the current income year. Put another way, the defendant contends that \u00a7 12-217ee does not authorize the exchange of tax credits carried forward from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>previous income years for a refund in subsequent years. We agree with the defendant and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court, albeit on this alternate ground. See footnote 5 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">We begin by setting forth the appropriate standard of review. The resolution of this appeal requires us to interpret \u00a7 12-217ee. \u201cWell settled principles of statutory interpretation govern our review.\u201d <em>Viera v. Cohen, </em>283 Conn. 412, 420-21, 927 A.2d 843 (2007). \u201cBecause statutory inteipretation is a question of law, our review is de novo.\u201d <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>232 Conn. 392, 396, 655 A.2d 759 (1995); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Arthur H., </em>288 Conn. 582, 590, 953 A.2d 630 (2008) (\u201c[a]s with any question of statutory construction, our review of this threshold question as to the requirements of the statute is plenary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., </em>286 Conn. 454, 464-65, 944 A.2d 315 (2008).\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>289 Conn. 769, 779, 961 A.2d 349 (2008).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Before we begin our statutory analysis, a brief explanation of the history of research and development tax credits in Connecticut is warranted. In 1993, the legislature established a tax credit for certain research and development expenses that allowed businesses to claim a tax credit equal to a percentage of their research and development expenses paid or incurred during an income year. See Public Acts 1993, No. 93-433, \u00a7 1; General Statutes \u00a7 12-217n. In 1998,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the legislature expanded the terms of \u00a7 12-217n so that qualified small businesses<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> could avail themselves of this tax credit. See Public Acts 1998, No. 98-110, \u00a7 23. Under the amended statute, a qualified small business may claim a tentative tax credit equal to 6 percent of the total amount of its research and development expenses for an income year. General Statutes \u00a7 12-217n (c) (1). Addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tionally, no more than one third of the credit may actually be taken as a tax credit in an income year. General Statutes \u00a7 12-217n (d) (2). The remaining two thirds of the credit is carried forward to subsequent income years. General Statutes \u00a7 12-217n (d) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In 1999, the legislature enacted \u00a7 12-217ee which, for the first time, gave qualified small business taxpayers with no tax liability the option of exchanging their research and development tax credit for a credit refund. See Public Acts 1999, No. 99-173, \u00a7 38; General Statutes \u00a7 12-217ee (a). Pursuant to this enactment, a qualified small business with no tax liability that had incurred research and development expenses in an income year acquired the option to exchange its research and development tax credit for a credit refund instead of carrying forward the unused tax credit. General Statutes \u00a7 12-217ee (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In the present case, we must decide whether the refund option adopted in 1999 applies to tax credits carried forward from prior income years or whether, alternatively, the refund is permitted only in the same income year in which the taxpayer qualifies for the credit. We begin our analysis with the text of \u00a7 12-217ee (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny taxpayer that (1) is a qualified small business,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (2) qualifies for a credit under section 12-217j or section 12-217n, and (3) cannot take such credit in the taxable year in which the credit could otherwise be taken as a result of having no tax liability under this chapter may elect to carry such credit forward under this chapter <em>or </em>may apply to the [defendant] as provided in subsection (b) of this section to exchange such credit with the state for a credit refund equal to sixty-five per cent of the value of the credit. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 12-217ee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>(a) clearly provides a qualified small business taxpayer with a choice of one of two options regarding its unused research and development tax credits: the taxpayer may \u201celect to carry such credit forward\u201d <em>or </em>it \u201cmay apply to the [defendant] ... to exchange such credit . . . for a credit refund . . . .\u201d Nothing in the text of the statute suggests in any way that these two conceptually distinct options may be combined, that is, that the taxpayer may carry the credit forward <em>and </em>apply to exchange the carried forward credit for a refund. \u201c[The legislature\u2019s] use of the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 between sub-parts of a statute indicates that the legislature intended its parts to be read separately, in the disjunctive. <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>216 Conn. 458, 467, 582 A.2d 190 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Earl B. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Children &amp; Families, </em>288 Conn. 163, 178, 952 A.2d 32 (2008); see also <em>Sestito </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>178 Conn. 520, 525, 423 A.2d 165 (1979) (\u201c[t]he use of the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 in the statute clearly indicates that the legislature intended the parts of the statute to be separate and not cumulative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Additional language in \u00a7 12-217ee (a) also suggests that carried forward credits cannot be exchanged for a refund, providing in relevant part that a qualified small business taxpayer \u201cmay apply to the [defendant] . . . for <em>a </em>credit refund . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the article \u201ca\u201d has significance. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>6 Conn. App. 505, 510, 506 A.2d 562 (1986) (legislature\u2019s use of article \u201ca\u201d in phrase \u201c \u2018a crime\u2019 \u201d makes phrase singular pertaining to only single criminal act or transaction); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rios, </em>110 Conn. App. 442, 450-51, 954 A.2d 901 (2008) (same). By its reference to a single credit, and not a plurality of credits, it is clear that the legislature intended the refund provision to apply only to taxpayers who presently qualify for a tax credit in a single\u2014that is, not more than one\u2014income year. We therefore understand this to be indicative of the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ture\u2019s intention that under \u00a7 12-217ee, a taxpayer may only exchange a tax credit in the single income year in which the credit was earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The text of \u00a7 12-217ee (b), concerning the procedure for obtaining a refund in exchange for the credit, lends further support for the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute, and provides in relevant part: \u201cAn application for refund of such credit amount shall be made to the [defendant], <em>at the same time such taxpayer files its return for the income year </em>.... <em>No application for refund of such credit amount may be made after the due date or extended due date, as the case may be, of such return. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Pursuant to this language, the exchange of the research and development tax credit is directly tied to the due date of the tax return for the <em>same </em>income year in which the credit was earned under the statute. The text clearly prohibits refunds after the due date of the tax return for the income year- in which the credit is earned, thus strongly suggesting that the refund can only be sought once, namely, in the year in which the credit is earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">It is important to note that the legislature enacted \u00a7 12-217ee six years after it had established research and development tax credits in \u00a7 12-217n, including the provisions of subsection (d) of subdivision (4) of \u00a7 12-217n, which provide for the carry forward of unused tax credits. \u201c[T]he legislature is presumed to be aware and to have knowledge of all existing statutes and the effect which its own action or nonaction may have on them.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Eighth Utilities District, </em>179 Conn. 589, 594, 427 A.2d 425 (1980); see also <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Saars, </em>150 Conn. 290, 298, 188 A.2d 863 (1963) (\u201c[i]t is a well recognized rule of statutory construction that the legislature is presumed to know all the existing statutes, the judicial interpretation of them, and the effect that its action or nonaction will have on them\u201d). Despite its awareness of these carry forward provisions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>legislature failed to provide in \u00a7 12-217ee that carried forward credits were also eligible for a credit refund. If the legislature had intended to draft a statute that authorized the exchange of carry forward tax credits for refunds, it could have easily and explicitly said so. See, e.g., <em>Genesky </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>275 Conn. 246, 258, 881 A.2d 114 (2005) (\u201cif the legislature wants to [engage in a certain action] it knows how to do so\u201d); <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>269 Conn. 120, 135, 848 A.2d 451 (2004) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>265 Conn. 35, 46, 826 A.2d 1126 (2003) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>261 Conn. 111, 135-36, 802 A.2d 754 (2002) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>250 Conn. 188, 199, 736 A.2d 790 (1999) (same). Moreover, \u201c[t]he intention of the legislature is found not in what it meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 452, 364 A.2d 167 (1975), citing <em>Schwab </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 479, 482, 226 A.2d 506 (1967). Section 12-217ee (a) provides only for the exchange for refund of a tax credit for which a small business taxpayer qualifies in a given income year; it does not provide for the exchange for refund of carried forward tax credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">On the basis of the text of \u00a7 12-217ee, we conclude that a qualified small business taxpayer may exchange a research and development tax credit for a credit refund only during the income year in which the small business taxpayer qualifies for and earns that credit. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court on the alternate ground that tax credits carried forward from prior income years do not qualify for a credit refund under \u00a7 12-217ee.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-217ee (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny taxpayer that (1) is a qualified small business, (2) qualifies for a credit under section 12-217j or section 12-217n, and (3) cannot take such credit in the taxable year in which the credit could otherwise be taken as a result of having no tax liability under this chapter may elect to cany such credit forward under this chapter or may apply to the commissioner [of revenue services] as provided in subsection (b) of this section to exchange such credit with the state for a credit refund equal to sixty-five per cent of the value of the credit. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-217n provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) There shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter the amount determined under subsection (c) of this section in respect of the research and development expenses paid or incurred during any income year, subject to the limitations of this section. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"A2t\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201c(c) (1) The amount allowed as a credit in any income year shall be the tentative credit calculated under subdivision (2) of this subsection ... if applicable, except that in the case of a qualified small business the tentative credit allowed for research and development expenses shall be equal to six per cent of such expenses ....</p>\n<p id=\"at-dedup-0\">\u201c(d) ...

Second, any ambiguity in the statutory formulation of an exemption must be resolved against the taxpayer. Third, the taxpayer must bear the burden of proving the error in an adverse assessment concerning an exemption.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). We emphasize that these presumptions are rules of construction and, accordingly, are to be used only after we have determined that a statute is ambiguous pursuant to \u00a7 l-2z. If we determine that no such ambiguity exists, these presumptions are inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> Although this amendment was enacted in 1998, it was applicable only to income years commencing on or after January 1, 2000.
