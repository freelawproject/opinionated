On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress two eyewitness identifications violated his right to due process of law under both the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and arti-</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>cle first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling that those identifications were reliable under the totality of the circumstances test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S.

Specifically, the state argues that the trial court correctly concluded that the identifications were reliable under the totality of the circumstances and asserts that there is no basis for this court to exercise its supervisory authority to mandate new identification procedures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As an alternative ground for affirmance, the state also argues that the trial court improperly concluded that the identification procedures used by the police were unnecessarily suggestive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the state and affirm the judgment of the trial court on this alternative ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In its memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court made the following findings of fact. On the evening of Friday, December 19, 2003, Mark Clement and his friend, Christopher Valle, were visiting at the apartment of a mutual friend, Miguel Delgado, Jr., at 134 Babcock Street in Hartford. The three men, along with various others, socialized regularly on weekends at Delgado\u2019s apartment. The apartment itself was on the third floor of the building and could be accessed by visitors through a front door that opened into a lighted common hallway at the top of the interior staircase.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Delgado\u2019s apartment was relatively small, consisting of a short interior hallway leading from the front door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>directly into the living room, a small game room adjacent to the living room, a kitchen to the rear of the living room and a bedroom off of the kitchen. On the evening of December 19, the living room was illuminated only indirectly by light emanating from the kitchen and game room. There was a couch on the back wall of the living room that faced the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">After arriving at the apartment, Delgado, Clement, Valle and another man named Amauri Escobar primarily remained in the game room playing video games and drinking alcoholic beverages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While several other people visited the apartment intermittently throughout the night, only these four men were present just prior to the robbery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">At around midnight on December 20, as Valle was preparing to leave the apartment, he exited the game room to say goodnight to Delgado, who was standing just inside the front door attempting to get rid of two men who stood facing him in the common hallway. As Valle approached the front door, one of the strangers, a Hispanic male in his early twenties wearing braids and black clothing, pointed a handgun directly at him and entered the apartment, forcing Valle and Delgado backward into the living room and ordering them to sit on the couch. Shortly thereafter, the intruders entered the game room, announced their presence and ordered Clement and Escobar to join Valle and Delgado. Once everyone returned to the living room, the intruders were only one or two feet away from their victims for a period of several minutes. Importantly, both Valle and Clement had multiple opportunities to see the faces of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the perpetrators, particularly the gunman. Valle initially saw the gunman in the brightly lit common hallway while Delgado was trying to get rid of him. Clement observed the gunman\u2019s face when the gunman entered the lighted game room and announced that \u201cit was a stickup.\u201d Further, while Valle and Clement were seated on the couch, they both viewed the intruders\u2019 faces with the light from the kitchen and the game room providing illumination.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The intruders then ordered all of them to surrender their money and jewelry, which Clement, Valle and Escobar did promptly. Delgado, however, offered only a small amount of marijuana, insisting that that was all he had. The intruders, who were dissatisfied with this offer, apparently were convinced that Delgado had money and drugs stashed elsewhere in the apartment, and demanded to be taken to inspect the back bedroom. Delgado, who was now standing to the side of the couch and blocking the entrance to the kitchen, refused. Delgado suddenly rushed at the gunman and grabbed his arm. A struggle ensued, during which Delgado forced the gunman back toward the front of the apartment, and a shot rang out. Valle jumped to his feet from his position on the couch and began to head for the perceived safety of the game room. He then heard a second shot and saw Delgado fall to his knees on the floor. Valle made it to the game room with Clement behind him, while Escobar apparently escaped out of the rear exit of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Valle heard a third shot fired, and, once it was apparent that the intruders had fled, he eventually emerged from the game room. Feeling around on the floor in the relative darkness of the hall near the front door, Valle discovered Delgado lying in a pool of blood. When he turned the living room light on, Valle realized that Delgado was critically wounded and called the police. Immediately after the incident, both Valle and Clement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>expressed to police investigators their confidence that they could identify the gunman.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">On December 23, 2003, while making his regular visit to his parole officer, Valle was startled to observe the defendant at the office of the parole officer, immediately recognizing him as the gunman who had robbed him four days earlier. Valle reported his observation to personnel on duty in the office. This information was relayed to Detective Patricia Beaudin of the Hartford police department, who was leading the investigation into the incident. On the basis of this information, a photographic array was produced consisting of photographs of eight men fitting the description that Valle had provided, including that of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Beaudin and her partner, Detective Ezequiel Laure-ano, contacted Valle and asked him to come to the police station to view the photographs in the array. Prior to having him look at the photographic array, Beaudin instructed Valle simply to look at the photographs and tell her if he recognized anyone, and that it was fine if he did not. Neither Beaudin nor Laureano told Valle that he had to select a photograph, and they did not indicate in any way which photograph he should pick. In addition, consistent with the detectives\u2019 instructions, there was a notice prominently printed at the bottom of the photographic array that provided: \u201cYou have been asked to look at this group of photographs. The fact that they are shown to you should not influence your judgment. You should not conclude or guess that the photographs contain the person who committed the offense under investigation. You are not obligated to identify anyone. It is just as important to free innocent persons from suspicion as to identify guilty parties. Please do not discuss this case with other witnesses nor indicate in any way that you have, or have not identified someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Valle immediately selected the photograph depicting the defendant, indicating that he was sure that the individual pictured was the gunman. Although acknowledging some superficial differences between the defendant\u2019s photograph and the others in the array, Valle denied that such discrepancies played any roll in his choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Four days later, Beaudin contacted Clement and requested that he view the photographic array that Valle had previously viewed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The detectives followed an almost identical procedure with Clement, and either read aloud or pointed out the same prominent notice at the bottom of the board on which the photographic array was mounted. Clement believed that the array contained photographs of known robbers but did not know if photographs of either of the persons who had robbed him would be included in the display. He further indicated that, although neither of the detectives pressured him to select any photograph or indicated in any way that he should choose a particular photograph, he did feel that a suspect was probably in the array and that he should \u201cpick somebody . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Clement found himself immediately drawn to one photograph but was concerned about speaking up too quickly and identifying the wrong person. He described how he eliminated all but two of the photographs as possibilities and how he kept returning to the photograph that originally had garnered his attention. Clement noted that he based his identification almost exclusively on the defendant\u2019s eyes, which he recognized as the eyes of the gunman who had robbed him and his companions. He indicated that the choice he had made was based on his own \u201cgut feeling,\u201d derived from his personal observations of the gunman during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the robbery. When he finally did inform Beaudin of his choice, about which he felt fairly confident, she informed him that he had done well because he had chosen the same photograph as Valle.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">On the basis of these identifications, an arrest warrant was issued for the defendant, which was executed on December 30, 2003. The state subsequently filed a five count information charging the defendant with one count of felony murder, three counts of robbery in the first degree, and one count of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress as evidence any pretrial or in-court identifications offered by the state. The defendant argued that the procedures used in connection with the photographic array identifications were unnecessarily suggestive and unreliable and that any in-court identification by Valle and Clement would be irreparably tainted by such prior, purportedly improper identifications. The state responded that the identification procedures were not unnecessarily suggestive and that, even if they were, the identifications themselves were sufficiently reliable under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The trial court held a hearing on the motion on December 7, 2005, and heard testimony from Valle, Clement and Beaudin. In addition, the trial court considered several scientific articles and reports regarding the suggestiveness and reliability of various identification methods. On December 20, 2005, the court heard arguments on the motion, and, on January 4, 2006, the court made an oral ruling denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The trial court issued a \u201c [corrected\u201d memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on March 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court determined that the identification procedures used were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>unnecessarily suggestive but nonetheless sufficiently reliable under the totality of the circumstances to be admissible at trial. The court based its determination primarily on what it termed the \u201cuniversal judgment of the relevant scientific community\u201d that sequential identification procedures, pursuant to which a witness views photographs or live suspects one at a time, are superior to the traditional lineup or photographic array in which a witness views all of the individuals simultaneously. The court was persuaded by the suggestion in the literature that sequential procedures may be superior because they limit the operation of \u201c \u2018relative judgment,\u2019 \u201d whereby a witness may be tempted to choose the photograph or individual who looks the most like their memory of the perpetrator relative to the others viewed through a process of elimination, rather than by actually comparing each individual to their memory of the perpetrator. Sequential procedures reduce or eliminate this tendency, it is argued, by depriving a witness of the opportunity to compare subjects to each other and by forcing the witness to rely strictly on his memory rather than on the relative judgment process.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The trial court also was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the fact that the identification procedures in this case were not \u201cdouble blind.\u201d To qualify as double-blind, a photographic array must be administered by an uninterested party without knowledge of which photograph represents the suspect. Again relying on the scientific literature, the court found that \u201c[t]he risk of producing a misidentification in such circumstances, due to conscious or unconscious bias by a highly interested person administering the procedure, is so well established in the relevant scientific literature that experts have strongly recommended that all pretrial identification procedures be conducted only by persons who do not know which member of the lineup or photospread is the suspect.\u201d The court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>concerned that Beaudin\u2019s statement to Clement congratulating him on choosing the same photograph as Valle was outward evidence of a bias in the process that subtly and perhaps subconsciously infected the procedure before Clement had made his choice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, and on the basis of the scientific research,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the trial court essentially concluded that the traditional identification procedure that the police used in this case was per se unnecessarily suggestive. The court further directed that \u201c[pjolice . . . conducting photo [graphic] identifications should henceforth strive to eliminate the danger of misidentifi-cation arising from the simultaneous showing of multiple [photographs] by making all such showings sequentially.\u201d Despite finding these flaws in the identification process in the present case, the court nonetheless examined the totality of the factual circumstances under the <em>Manson </em>test, determined that the identifications by Valle and Clement were reliable, and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Thereafter, the jury found the defendant guilty of the felony murder charge, two of the robbery charges and the attempted robbery charge. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of fifty years imprisonment, execution suspended after thirty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>five years, and five years probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We begin by noting that we need not reach the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the challenged identifications were reliable under the <em>Manson </em>test because we decide this case on the state\u2019s alternative ground. In this regard, the state claims that the trial court improperly determined that the identification procedures were unnecessarily suggestive, whereas the defendant agrees with the court\u2019s conclusion. We elect to address this aspect of the court\u2019s ruling, rather than simply uphold the court\u2019s analysis of reliability, in order to confront what we view as the trial court\u2019s establishment of a per se rule with respect to the question of the suggestiveness of the identification procedures at issue. Although we appreciate the trial court\u2019s laudable desire to improve the dependability of the eyewitness identification process, we cannot agree that the procedures used in this case were unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Turning to the applicable legal principles, we first observe that the defendant invoked his due process rights under both the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution in support of his motion to suppress. The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision does not differentiate its analysis between these sources of law. This is the correct approach as this court explicitly has held that article first, \u00a7 8, provides no greater protection than the federal constitution in the realm of identification procedures. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 568, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006). We reaffirm the congruence between the protections afforded by our state constitution and the federal constitution in the area of pretrial identification and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>proceed to analyze the question in the same fashion under both provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Although we have never directly addressed the standard for reviewing whether a photographic array is unnecessarily suggestive,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we are influenced by federal precedent and the approach taken by our sister states. The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe ultimate question as to the constitutionality of . . . pretrial identification procedures ... is a mixed question of law and fact . . . .\u201d <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Mata, </em>455 U.S. 591, 597, 102 S. Ct. 1303, 71 L. Ed. 2d 480 (1982). More specifically, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently has affirmed that \u201ca court must determine whether the pretrial identification was impermissibly suggestive .... Such an analysis is a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Quarterman, </em>456 F.3d 537, 544 (5th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1343, 127 S. Ct. 2030, 167 L. Ed. 2d 772 (2007); accord <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Keane, </em>United States Court of Appeals, Docket No. 01-2136, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 23588, *4 (2d Cir. November 13, 2002), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Fischer, </em>540 U.S. 869, 124 S. Ct. 191, 157 L. Ed. 2d 125 (2003); <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Young, </em>34 F.3d 421, 427 (7th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1021, 115 S. Ct. 1369, 131 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1995). \u201cWe review the [trial] [c]ourt\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion, applying clear error review to its underlying factual findings and plenary review to its conclusions drawn from such facts.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mathis, </em>264 F.3d 321, 331 (3d Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 908, 122 S. Ct. 1211, 152 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2002). Our sister states that have addressed this question are generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>in accord. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>114 P.3d 42, 49 (Colo. App. 2005) (\u201cThe ultimate question as to the constitutionality of pretrial identification procedures is a mixed question of law and fact. Thus, we give deference to the trial court\u2019s finding of historical fact . . . but may give different weight to those facts and may reach a different conclusion.\u201d), review denied, Colorado Supreme Court, Docket No. 05SC46, 2005 Colo. LEXIS 597 (Colo. June 27, 2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>255 Kan. 21, 26, 871 P.2d 1265 (1994) \u201c[a]n eyewitness identification due process determination is a mixed question of law and fact that should be reviewed de novo\u201d); <em>McClenton </em>v. <em>State, </em>167 S.W.3d 86, 96 (Tex. App. 2005) (\u201c[t]he admissibility of an identification is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>334 S.C. 411, 418, 513 S.E.2d 626 (App. 1999) (Howell, C. J., dissenting) (\u201c[w]hether an eyewitness identification is sufficiently rehable is a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review on appeal\u201d), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 343 S.C. 282, 540 S.E.2d 445 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Given the weight and uniformity of the preceding authority, as well as its commonsense appeal, we conclude that a claim of an unnecessarily suggestive pretrial identification procedure is a mixed question of law and fact. With respect to our review of the facts, we further note that, because the issue of the suggestiveness of a photographic array implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process, we undertake a \u201cscrupulous examination of the record to ascertain whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>288 Conn. 345, 364, 952 A.2d 784 (2008); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 547 (\u201c[b]ecause the issue of the reliability of an identification involves the constitutional rights of an accused . . . we are obliged to examine the record scrupulously to determine whether the facts found are adequately supported by the evidence and whether the [trial] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>court\u2019s ultimate inference of reliability was reasonable\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Our analysis proceeds in three parts. In part I of this opinion, we examine the approach taken by the trial court and, in particular, the scientific foundation underlying its conclusions. In part II of this opinion, we more fully describe the appropriate legal framework for analyzing suggestiveness and proceed to apply those principles to the facts of this case. Finally, in part III of this opinion, we address the defendant\u2019s request that this court exercise its supervisory authority to mandate the implementation of specific eyewitness identification procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">We begin our analysis with the state\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that a photographic array conducted pursuant to the traditional simultaneous identification procedure by an interested administrator is inherently unnecessarily suggestive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>agree. To the extent that the trial court\u2019s decision implies that the simultaneous display of photographs in an array by a police officer with specific knowledge of the case is <em>per se </em>unnecessarily suggestive, it is incorrect.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">This court has, for some time, maintained a stem test for suggestiveness: \u201cAn identification procedure is unnecessarily suggestive <em>only </em>if it gives rise to a <em>very substantial </em>likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>262 Conn. 825, 832, 817 A.2d 670 (2003), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 555, 757 A.2d 482 (2000). We take this opportunity to revisit our definition of suggestiveness. The phrase we have been using to define \u201cunnecessarily suggestive\u201d seems to have its origins in <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247 (1968), in which the United States Supreme Court declared that \u201cconvictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 384. The first use of this language by this court appears to have occurred in <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>182 Conn. 366, 438 A.2d 432 (1980), in which we resolved the claim of the defendant, Norman A. Theriault, that the trial court improperly declined to suppress a pretrial identification in violation of \u201chis due process rights because it was impermissibly suggestive <em>and </em>gave rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 371. We concluded that the one-on-one \u201cshow-up\u201d procedure used in <em>Theriault </em>was inherently suggestive as well as unnecessary under the circumstances. Id., 372-73. We upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling, however, concluding that the identification, although suggestive, was nonetheless sufficiently reliable. Id., 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In <em>Theriault, </em>we examined the suggestiveness of the identification procedures, in addition to the overall reliability of the identification itself, under the totality of the circumstances; see id., 371-72; in order to determine whether the challenged identification violated Theri-ault\u2019s due process rights on the ground that it \u201cgave rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidenti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>fication.\u201d Id., 371. There is no indication in <em>Theriault </em>that we used this phrase to <em>define </em>suggestiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The first instance in which this court conflated these two concepts apparently occurred in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>203 Conn. 159, 523 A.2d 1284 (1987). In <em>Williams, </em>we stated that \u201c[a]n identification procedure is unnecessarily suggestive when it lgive[s] rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d Id., 174. Part of this statement was derived from our opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 243-44, 476 A.2d 550 (1984). This language also can be traced from <em>Ledbetter </em>back to <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>216 Conn. 492, 501, 582 A.2d 751 (1990), which contains the exact same language as <em>Williams </em>and which also cited to <em>Fullwood. </em>In our view, defining \u201cunnecessarily suggestive\u201d in this manner has been the result of a misstep. It is illogical and inconsistent with the authority on which it purports to be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We next set forth what we believe is the correct approach to this issue. First, there appears to be a consensus with regard to the overall analytical framework to be used in considering a claim of this sort: \u201cIn determining whether identification procedures violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights, the required inquiry is made on an ad hoc basis and is two-pronged: first, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive; and second, if it is found to have been so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on examination of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. <em>Theriault, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 371-72; see also <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brath-waite, </em>supra, 432 U.S. 107 (\u201c[T]he first inquiry [is] whether the police used an impermissibly suggestive [identification] procedure .... If so, the second inquiry is whether, under all the circumstances, that suggestive procedure gave rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d); <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>v. <em>DeCologero, </em>530 F.3d 36, 62 (1st Cir.) (\u201cwe first determine whether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive, and if it was, we then look to the totality of the circumstances to decide whether the identification was rehable\u201d), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1005, 129 S. Ct. 513, 172 L. Ed. 2d 376, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1039, 129 S. Ct. 615, 172 L. Ed. 2d 469 (2008). We continue to endorse and adhere to this widely utilized analytical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In the seminal case of <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>supra, 409 U.S. 188, the Supreme Court explained the overarching concern that courts face when assessing a challenged identification procedure: \u201cIt is . . . apparent that the primary evil to be avoided is \u2018a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 ... It is the likelihood of misidentification which violates a defendant\u2019s rights to due process . . . .\u201d Id., 198, quoting <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 390 U.S. 384. As courts apply the two-pronged test to determine if a particular identification procedure is so suggestive and unreliable as to require suppression, they always should weigh the relevant factors against this standard. In other words, an out-of-court eyewitness identification should be <em>excluded </em>on the basis of the procedure used to elicit that identification <em>only </em>if the court is convinced that the procedure was so suggestive <em>and </em>otherwise unreliable as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The critical question for our present purposes is what makes a particular identification procedure \u201csuggestive\u201d enough to require the court to proceed to the second prong and to consider the overall reliability of the identification. This is a straightforward question that does not appear to have received a very direct answer. There are, however, two factors that courts have considered in analyzing photographic identification procedures for improper suggestiveness. The first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>factor concerns the composition of the photographic array itself. In this regard, courts have analyzed whether the photographs used were selected or displayed in such a manner as to emphasize or highlight the individual whom the police believe is the suspect. See, e.g., <em>State v. Williams, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 176 (multiple photographs of same individual in same or subsequent photographic arrays possibly suggestive \u201cwhen, in the context of the entire array, the recurrence unnecessarily emphasizes the defendant\u2019s photograph\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 247 (to be unnecessarily suggestive, variations in array photographs must highlight defendant to point that it affects witness\u2019 selection); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 656, 431 A.2d 501 (\u201c[when] afeature is placed on the defendant\u2019s photograph in order to make the picture conform to the witness\u2019 description of the criminal he or she had seen, the identification proceeding has been held to have been rendered highly suggestive\u201d), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeCologero, </em>supra, 530 F.3d 62 (at first step in two-pronged test, court \u201cconsider^] whether the photo [graphic] array included, as far as was practicable, a reasonable number of persons similar in appearance to the suspect\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rattler, </em>475 F.3d 408, 413 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (court must \u201cexamine the suggestivity of irregularities between the subjects in the array\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The second factor, which is related to the first but conceptually broader, requires the court to examine the actions of law enforcement personnel to determine whether the witness\u2019 \u201cattention was directed to a suspect because of police conduct. ... In considering this [factor, the court should] look to the effects of the circumstances of the pretrial identification, not whether law enforcement officers intended to prejudice the defendant.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Bouchard, </em>405 F.3d 459, 470 (6th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1100, 126 S. Ct. 1032, 163 L. Ed. 2d 871 (2006). It stands to reason that police officers administering a photographic identification procedure have the potential to taint the process by drawing the witness\u2019 attention to a particular suspect. This could occur either through the construction of the array itself or through physical or verbal cues provided by an officer. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 248 (irregularity in defendant\u2019s photograph not suggestive because it did not \u201csignal to the witnesses that the defendant was the person whom the police believed to be the perpetrator of the robbery\u201d); see also <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 390 U.S. 385 (\u201c[t]here is no evidence to indicate that the witnesses were told anything about the progress of the investigation, or that the [law enforcement] agents in any other way suggested which persons in the pictures were under suspicion\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>185 Conn. 607, 612, 476 A.2d 550 (1981)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (no basis for claiming that \u201cdisplay itself was suggestive or that [the administering officer] was suggestive in any respect in the selection process\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 656 (\u201c[a] procedure is unfair which suggests in advance of identification by the witness the identity of the person suspected by the police\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We hereby clarify that a determination as to whether a particular identification procedure is \u201cunnecessarily suggestive\u201d must focus on the foregoing factors. The phrase \u201cvery substantial risk of irreparable misidentifi-cation\u201d must be understood as the overall standard for suppressing an out-of-court identification. By improperly making the test of suggestiveness so rigorous, we essentially have made the reliability prong of the analysis vestigial. Obviously, any identification resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>a procedure that fails our current test for suggestiveness could never be considered sufficiently reliable under the totality of the circumstances to warrant admissibility. The suggestiveness prong should be less stringent and more focused on the mechanics of the photographic array itself as well as the behavior of the administering officers. This approach is more logical, gives some meaning to the term \u201csuggestive\u201d that accords with common experience, and can be readily applied by trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We stress that this is <em>not </em>a \u201cbest practices\u201d test. In other words, the test does not require a court to engage in a relative value judgment of various possible identification techniques and settle on the one that it believes bears the least risk of mistake, a decision that would be prone to being revised or second-guessed as the scientific debate evolves and new studies become available. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Nunez, </em>93 Conn. App. 818, 832, 890 A.2d 636 (\u201c[t]he question ... is not whether a double-blind, sequential identification procedure is less suggestive than the traditional procedures . . . but . . . whether the traditional procedures are unnecessarily suggestive under [the Connecticut] constitution\u201d), cert. denied, 278 Conn. 914, 899 A.2d 621, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 906, 127 S. Ct. 236, 166 L. Ed. 2d 186 (2006); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 244 (\u201c[i]t has been generally recognized that the presentation of several photographs to witnesses, including that of the suspect ... is by itself a nonsuggestive and constitutionally acceptable practice, in the absence of any unfairness or other impropriety in the conduct of the exhibit\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Nor does this test require law enforcement personnel to alter their procedures every time a fresh scientific study suggests that a new identification procedure might lead to more reliable results. Moreover, although our analysis focuses principally on two key functional aspects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>of the eyewitness identification process,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we stress that it is the <em>entire </em>procedure, viewed in light of the factual circumstances of the individual case, that must be examined to determine if a particular identification is tainted by unnecessary suggestiveness. The individual components of a procedure cannot be examined piecemeal but must be placed in their broader context to ascertain whether the procedure is so suggestive that it requires the court to consider the reliability of the identification itself in order to determine whether it ultimately should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In the present case, although the facts adduced at the hearing on the motion to suppress are essentially undisputed, the true controversy involves the potential suggestiveness of the chosen procedures in light of the scientific data presented to the trial court, which the court clearly found to be overwhelmingly persuasive in fashioning its categorical rule. It is this evidence that we now review to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusion that the photographic arrays and the detectives\u2019 method of presenting them were indeed unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The defendant presented four scientific documents to the trial court in support of his contention that the simultaneous, single-blind procedures used in this case were inherently suggestive. The state responds by presenting this court with two additional documents indicating that the science in this area is less than settled.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>We will briefly discuss each article or report, organizing our discussion chronologically on the basis of the date that the document was published and beginning with the scientific documents presented by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The authors of the first document; see G. Wells et al., \u201cEyewitness Identification Procedures: Recommendations for Lineups and Photospreads,\u201d 22 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 603 (1998); discuss potential problem areas with traditional procedures and eventually make four recommendations that they believe would improve the accuracy and reliability of eyewitness identifications. The authors admit to relying \u201cheavily on relative-judgment theory, which describes a process by which eyewitnesses make lineup identifications.\u201d Id., 613. They note that \u201c[tjhere is good empirical evidence\u201d in support of the relative judgment theory; id.; and their recommendations are aimed primarily at countering the negative effect that the relative judgment process can have on the accuracy of eyewitness identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The authors\u2019 first recommendation is that \u201c[t]he person who conducts the lineup or photospread should not be aware of which member of the lineup or pho-tospread is the suspect.\u201d Id., 627.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The authors admit, however, that they are \u201caware of no studies indicating that lineup and photospread administrators are affecting the identification behaviors of eyewitnesses in actual cases\u201d; id., 628; and caution that this recommendation should be taken \u201csomewhat on face value . . . .\u201d Id. The authors\u2019 second recommendation is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>a warning be given to eyewitnesses indicating that the suspect may or may not be present in the lineup or photospread, and that the witness therefore should not feel compelled to make an identification. Id., 629. The third recommendation concerns the structure of the lineup or photospread itself and advises that \u201c[t]he suspect should not stand out in the lineup or photospread as being different from the distracters based on the [eyewitness\u2019] previous description of the culprit or based on other factors that would draw extra attention to the suspect.\u201d Id., 630. Finally, the authors recommend that the identification administrator collect a statement from the witness after an identification is made regarding the witness\u2019 level of confidence in his selection. Id., 635. The authors of this article expressly decline to recommend the use of sequential identification procedures, noting that \u201c[t]he superiority of the sequential over the simultaneous procedure is evident primarily under conditions [when recommendation two] (warning the eyewitness that the culprit might not be present) and [recommendation three] (distractors fitting the description) are violated . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 640. Furthermore, the authors note that the adoption of a sequential procedure without the adoption of double-blind testing actually could lead to a greater error rate than that realized with a simultaneous procedure without double-blind testing. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The second document offered by the defendant; United States Dept, of Justice, Eyewitness Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement (1999);<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> contains a fairly brief section covering suspect identification proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>dures. Id., p. 29. Interestingly, although the report provides different instruction sets for conducting sequential and simultaneous lineups and photographic arrays, it does not make a recommendation favoring one procedure over the other. Moreover, the report makes no mention of the use of double-blind testing procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The third document on which the defendant relies is from the Canadian Journal of Police and Security Services. J. Turtle, R. Lindsay &amp; G. Wells, \u201cBest Practice Recommendations for Eyewitness Evidence Procedures: New Ideas for the Oldest Way to Solve a Case,\u201d 1 Canadian J. Police &amp; Security Serv. 5 (2003).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In addition to advocating that warnings be given to the witness to reduce the effect of the relative judgment process and providing practical guidelines for composing lineups, the article also recommends the use of blind, sequential identification procedures. Blind procedures are recommended because of the potential for an officer with knowledge of the investigation to transmit information or expectations inadvertently to the witness, thereby leading the witness to make a particular selection.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The article cites studies indicating that, although simultaneous identification procedures are three times more likely to yield misidentifications than sequential procedures, sequential procedures also yield lower cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>rect identification rates than simultaneous procedures. Moreover, the article highlights a number of circumstances in which the use of a sequential procedure \u201cmay be no better or even worse than the traditional simultaneous line-up.\u201d Such circumstances include (1) identifications by child witnesses, who can become confused by a sequential procedure, (2) scenarios in which a witness is asked to identify multiple perpetrators, and (3) situations involving \u201ccross-race identifications,\u201d in which a witness is asked to identify a person of a different race. Although the authors of this article clearly advocate the use of sequential procedures generally, the authors nevertheless conclude that \u201cthe sequential line-up has not been demonstrated to show its superiority under these conditions and, in fact, some data exist suggesting that there may be some disadvantage to using the procedure under these conditions. Until more and better data are available, we do not recommend using sequential line-ups in these particular situations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The defendant\u2019s final scientific document; see G. Wells &amp; E. Olson, \u201cEyewitness Testimony,\u201d 54 Ann. Rev. Psychol. 277 (2003); is a relatively brief review of much of the material discussed in connection with the previous documents. The authors strongly support the use of \u201cmight or might not be present\u201d instructions, which, they note, have been shown to reduce mistaken identification rates significantly in lineups in which the perpetrator is absent. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 286. The authors also show a preference for sequential line-up procedures, noting the tendency of such procedures to reduce \u201cthe chances of mistaken identifications in culprit-absent lineups by nearly one half\u2019 while also reducing \u201caccurate identification rates in culprit-present lineups.\u201d Id., 288. The authors discuss and support the use of double-blind testing procedures, although they stress that such procedures are especially necessary when a sequential identification procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>is utilized. Id., 289. The authors conclude by lamenting the paucity of \u201creal-world data\u201d in this field of research. Id., 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The state offers two documents presumably intended to highlight the lack of scientific consensus in the eyewitness identification field. The first document, which was a report to the Illinois legislature; see S. Mecklen-burg, Report to the Legislature of the State of Illinois: The Illinois Pilot Program on Sequential Double-Blind Identification Procedures (2006) (Mecklenburg Report); was the product of a year long pilot program conducted at three police departments in the Chicago area.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The results of this field study, which the author <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>characterized as surprising, were that \u201csequential, double-blind procedures resulted in an overall <em>higher </em>rate of known false identifications than did the simultaneous lineups.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) Id., p. iv. The author concluded that \u201cthe sequential, double-blind method [could not] be regarded as superior to the simultaneous method\u201d; id., p. 64; and emphasized the need for further study. Id., p. 65.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The second document that the state submits is a 2006 article from Psychology, Public Policy, and Law. See D. McQuiston-Surrett, R. Maipass &amp; C. Tredoux, \u201cSequential vs. Simultaneous Lineups: A Review of Methods, Data, and Theory,\u201d 12 Psychol., Pub. Policy &amp; L. 137 (2006). In this article, written after the release of the Mecklenburg Report, the authors maintain some reservations about the methodologies and significance of that report but nonetheless conclude that \u201cthe literature concerning [simultaneous lineups] versus [sequential lineups] may be underdeveloped in some important ways . . . .\u201d Id., 141. In addition, \u201cthe research base for [sequential lineups] may not be sufficiently developed from a methodological or theoretical point of view to . . . advocate for its implementation to the exclusion of other procedures.\u201d Id., 162.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Presented with the foregoing research, the trial court considered several factors in determining that the procedures used in this case were unnecessarily suggestive. First, the court concluded, in the abstract, that \u201cthe simultaneous showing of all photo[graphs] to each witness on a single . . . board created an unnecessary risk of producing irreparable misidentifications by enabling the witnesses to make side-by-side comparisons of the photo [graphs], and thus to select one of them simply by eliminating all the others in an unreliable exercise of relative judgment.\u201d The court based this judgment on the \u2018 \u2018unchallenged findings of the scientific research studies . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The trial court also was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the fact that Beaudin, the lead detective investigating the robbeiy, administered both identification procedures. The court expressed \u201cconcern . . . based [on] the undisputed judgment and recommendation of well respected scientific researchers\u201d that an officer with knowledge of the investigation, particularly, the identity of the suspect, runs the risk of intentionally or inadvertently \u201cinjecting bias into the identification process . . . and thus of producing irreparable misidentifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Contrary to the trial court, we conclude that the scientific evidence regarding the value of sequential procedures is more nuanced and uncertain than portrayed by the defendant, and, therefore, it cannot definitively answer the question of whether the procedures used in this case were unnecessarily suggestive.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>instance, the research indicates that, in multiple perpetrator scenarios, the use of sequential identification procedures may not be advisable, or even practical: \u201c[I]f multiple perpetrators were involved in the crime and more than one suspect is to be shown to the witness, it is not clear how a sequential procedure should be used, and traditional methods have not been shown to be inferior in such cases.\u201d J. Turtle, R. Lindsay &amp; G. Wells, supra, 1 Canadian J. Police &amp; Security Serv. 5. In this case, for example, the detectives knew from eyewitness statements that the robbery had been committed by two individuals. As a result, the value of using a sequential procedure is at least questionable. Moreover, although the scientific community recommends the use of a double-blind identification procedure, and such a procedure has intuitive appeal, we never have held that the failure to use such a procedure carries such a substantial risk of misidentification that its use must be <em>required </em>to avoid unnecessary suggestiveness.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Upon consideration of the scientific literature, we conclude that one thing is clear, namely, that the judgment of the relevant scientific community with respect to eyewitness identification procedures is far from universal or even well established, and that the research is in great flux.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Indeed, when the reported research was seemingly more uniform, we still found that \u201c[t]he scientific studies are not definitive.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>supra, 275 Conn. 568. The more recent research offered by the state muddies the water further and only confirms this view. Thus, this continues to be an issue particularly ill suited to generic, bright line rules. Indeed, we repeatedly have insisted that this inquiry be made on an ad hoc basis, and we affirm that the courts of this state should continue to evaluate \u201cwhether individual identification procedures are unnecessarily suggestive on the basis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the procedure, rather than replacing that inquiry with a per se rule.\u201d Id., 574. We agree with the Appellate Court that, until the scientific research produces more definitive answers with respect to the effects of various procedures, \u201c[d]ue process does not require the suppression of a photographic identification that is not the product of a double-blind, sequential procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>107 Conn. App. 666, 674, 946 A.2d 319, cert. denied, 288 Conn. 902, 952 A.2d 811 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Having concluded that the trial court overemphasized the significance of the scientific research and improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>erly applied a per se analysis to the challenged identifications, we now turn to an examination of the procedures at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The defendant made several claims of suggestiveness at the suppression hearing that were based on the factual context of this case. The defendant asserted that the photographic array itself was <em>in fact </em>unnecessarily suggestive insofar as the composition of the array unfairly highlighted him and was designed to promote his identification by the witnesses. Specifically, the defendant claimed that the array was unnecessarily suggestive because his photograph was distinctive. He specifically asserted that his photograph was somewhat brighter in appearance than the other photographs and had a white height scale in the background, whereas six of the other seven photographs contained visible height scales that were black in color. The defendant further argued that Beaudin\u2019s administration of the identification procedure was flawed because she knew which photograph represented the suspect. The defendant points to the confirmatory comment that Beaudin made to Clement after he selected the defendant\u2019s photograph as evidence of a bias on her part that must have tainted the entire process.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court addressed the defendant\u2019s claims and determined that the photographic arrays used in this case were fair and did not draw attention to the defendant\u2019s photograph. The court concluded that \u201cthe array used in this case did not unfairly highlight the defendant or promote his identification by the witnesses in any way.\u201d The trial court, however\u2014perhaps as a corollary to its finding with respect to the importance of utilizing double-blind procedures\u2014was impressed by the testimony regarding Beaudin\u2019s reaction to Clement\u2019s selection.

We conclude that any analysis of unnecessary suggestiveness must be conducted in light of the totality of the circumstances and must focus specifically on the presentation of the photographic array itself as well as the behavior of law enforcement personnel to determine if the procedure was designed or administered in such a way as to suggest to the witness that a particular photograph represents the individual under suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In evaluating the suggestiveness of a photographic array, \u201ca court should look to both the photographs themselves and the manner in which they were presented to the identifying witness.\u201d <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>45 Va. App. 735, 774, 613 S.E.2d 834 (2005), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 272 Va. 418, 634 S.E.2d 680 (2006). We consider the following nonexhaustive factors in analyzing a photographic array for unnecessary suggestiveness: \u201c(1) the degree of likeness shared by the individuals pictured ... (2) the number of photographs included in the array ... (3) whether the suspect\u2019s photograph prominently was displayed or otherwise was highlighted in an impermissible manner ... (4) whether the eyewitness had been told that the array includes a photograph of a known suspect . . . (5) whether the eyewitness had been presented with multiple arrays in which the photograph of one suspect recurred repeatedly . . . and (6) whether a second eyewitness was present during the presentation of the array.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>284 Conn. 328, 385-86, 933 A.2d 1158 (2007). It is important to note, however, that \u201c[pjhotographs will often have distinguishing features. The question ... is not whether the defendant\u2019s photograph could be distinguished from the other photographs . . . but whether the distinction made it unnecessarily suggestive.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nunez, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 828; see also <em>Hodges </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>supra, 774 (\u201c[a] valid lineup does not require that all the suspects or participants be alike in appearance and have the same description as long as nothing singles the accused out from the rest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We find it significant that the trial court\u2019s analysis essentially ignores the fact that both photographic arrays contained a conspicuous \u201cmight or might not be present\u201d warning, indicating to each witness that the perpetrator was not necessarily among those pictured and that the witnesses should not feel obligated to choose someone. The presence of such a warning is a consistent recommendation of the scientific literature that we have reviewed and is deemed to counteract effectively the tendency of witnesses to use relative judgment. See, e.g., G. Wells et al., supra, 22 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 629-30 (recommending warnings and explaining how they obviate need for sequential procedure); see also United States Dept, of Justice, supra, p. 31 (indicating importance and purpose of instructions). Moreover, this court expressly has endorsed, without mandating, the use of such warnings and has recognized their potential prophylactic effect against the dangers of the relative judgment process. \u201c[W]e recognize that [certain] studies . . . strongly militate in favor of an affirmative warning to witnesses that the perpetrator may or may not be among the choices in the identification procedure .... [T]rial court[s], as part of [their] analysis, should consider whether the identification procedure administrator instructed the witness that the perpetrator may or may not be present in the procedure . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 574-75. Significantly, we have concluded that, even when police not only fail to give such a warning but affirmatively inform the witness that the suspected culprit is in the lineup, there is no <em>presumption </em>of suggestiveness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 556. \u201c[E]ven if a court finds that the police expressly informed witnesses that the defendant would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>be in the array, our courts have found the identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive only when other factors exist that otherwise emphasize the defendant\u2019s photograph.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>38 Conn. App. 801, 811, 663 A.2d 1094, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 912, 665 A.2d 609 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In the present case, Clement testified at the suppression hearing that he remembered that Detective Beau-din had read him the warning before he viewed the photographic array. He further testified that the detectives did nothing to influence his decision or to direct his attention to any particular photograph, and that he selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array solely on the basis of his \u201cgut feeling.\u201d Moreover, the trial court credited Clement\u2019s testimony that \u201che was not at all sure that the true perpetrator would be in the array\u201d and observed that, \u201calthough [Clement] believed that the police would not have invited him to view photo [graphs] if they did not at least have a suspect in mind, he was not at all sure that the true perpetrator would be in the array, and so he commendably took his time in order not to implicate an innocent man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Valle testified that he did not remember reading the warning or having it read to him prior to identifying the defendant from the photographic array. His identification was unique, however, insofar as he originally had reported spotting the defendant at the parole office, and that it was this information that led to the defendant\u2019s inclusion in the photographic array in the first place. In light of this independent source for his identification, it is not surprising that Valle did not remember any warnings being given, or any other specifics about the identification procedure.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Although there is no evidence that Valle heeded the warning written on the photographic array, there is ample evidence that he needed no such warning. Under these somewhat unusual circumstances, including Valle\u2019s chance encounter with the defendant at the parole office and Valle\u2019s immediate selection of the defendant from the array, it is clear that Valle\u2019s selection of the defendant\u2019s photograph was not influenced by relative judgment because he simply did not have the time or the need to engage in a process of elimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Furthermore, as we previously stated, the failure to use a double-blind procedure does not automatically render an identification suspect, particularly when, as in the present case, there is no evidence that the detectives conducting the procedure influenced the witnesses in any discernible way prior to their making the identification.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Moreover, we agree with the Appellate Court, which has held that \u201c[t]he police officer\u2019s telling the victim that she had identified the suspect <em>after </em>she positively identified the defendant as her assailant does not render the identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 107 Conn. App. 675. Thus, although Beaudin\u2019s comment to Clement may affect the weight or even the admissibility of a subsequent <em>in-court </em>identification, it is irrelevant to our analysis regarding the suggestiveness of the procedure itself.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>In view of the totality of the circumstances, we are convinced that the trial court improperly concluded that the identification procedures used in this case were so flawed as to present \u201ca veiy substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 385. The detectives employed traditional procedures and proceeded in a neutral fashion. There is no evidence that they attempted to influence, consciously or subconsciously, the outcome of the identification process, and the witnesses\u2019 testimony bears this out. The photographic arrays themselves were not designed or presented in an unfair or suggestive manner. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of the warnings provided on the photographic arrays themselves or read aloud by the detectives, which served to counter any tendency of the witnesses to engage in the process of relative judgment. We conclude that the procedures employed in this case, although not ideal, were within the acceptable parameters of effective and fair police work, and satisfy the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Finally, we turn to the defendant\u2019s contention that this court should exercise its supervisory authority to mandate new identification procedures in the interests of justice. The defendant urges this court to implement three specific procedural changes: (1) the double-blind identification procedure; (2) the sequential display of live suspects or photographs; and (3) a prohibition on police informing witnesses, after they identify a suspect, that the individual that they chose is the person whom police believe is the culprit. We decline the defendant\u2019s request to exercise our supervisory authority in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>We first note the reluctance with which we have occasionally exercised our supervisory authority. \u201cOur supervisory powers are not a last bastion of hope for every untenable appeal. They are an <em>extraordinary </em>remedy to be invoked only when circumstances are such that the issue at hand, while not rising to the level of a constitutional violation, is nonetheless of utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 815, 709 A.2d 522 (1998), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 645, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989). \u201cWe ordinarily invoke our supervisory powers to enunciate a rule that is not constitutionally required but that we think is preferable as a matter of <em>policy State v. Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We are not persuaded that this case presents an appropriate forum for the exercise of our supervisory authority.

Our thorough review of the scientific research offered by the parties reconfirms the opinion we held in <em>Ledbetter, </em>namely, that \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding the various identification procedures present too many variables for us to conclude that a per se rule is appropriate.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 574. We believe that the development and implementation of identification procedures \u201cshould continue to be the province of the law enforcement agencies of this state.\u201d Id. We also reiterate that \u201cthe trial courts should continue to determine whether individual identification procedures are unnec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>essarily suggestive on the basis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the procedure, rather than replacing that inquiry with a per se rule.\u201d Id. Any residual element of suggestiveness or untrustworthiness that does not bear a \u201cvery substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 548; is \u201ccustomary grist for the jury mill. Juries are not so susceptible that they cannot measure intelligently the weight of identification testimony that has some questionable feature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v.

We emphasize that we have not created a per se rule approving of the procedures used in this case but, rather, have evaluated those specific procedures within the totality of the circumstances and have not found them to be unnecessarily suggestive. We would, of course, encourage the state\u2019s law enforcement agencies to maintain currency in the latest research in this field and to adapt their policies to implement the most accurate, reliable and practical identification procedures available. In fact, we believe that the scientific research and common sense suggest that the employment of double-blind procedures, whenever reasonably practicable, is preferable to the use of an interested administrator because such procedures avoid the possibility of influencing the witness, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and thereby tainting the accuracy of any resulting identification. At this time, however, we continue to review suggestiveness on a case-by-case basis using the established standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">In this opinion VERTEFEUILLE and SCHALLER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-11\"> The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . . ,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\"> In <em>Biggers, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that when there is a finding of unnecessary suggestiveness, the court considers \u201cwhether under the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 the identification was reliable ....

Nevertheless, we will consider this additional alternative ground for affirmance inasmuch as the defendant has not argued that he was prejudiced by the state\u2019s failure to include this claim in its statement. This determination is bolstered by the fact that the claim was fully briefed and argued before this court, and the defendant had the opportunity to, and did, respond to this issue. See, e.g., <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Mullaney, </em>284 Conn. 673, 682 n.4, 937 A.2d 667 (2007); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeLoreto, </em>265 Conn. 145, 152 n.11, 827 A.2d 671 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\"> Clement recalled drinking only one twenty-two ounce beer during the course of the evening, whereas Valle testified that he and the other three men shared 1he contents of a one-half pint bottle of Hennessy cognac and a small bottle of hypnotic liquor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b149-9\"> Delgado\u2019s girlfriend also was present, but she remained in the bedroom in the back of the apartment during the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\"> The arrays that Clement and Valle viewed differed only in that the position of the defendant\u2019s photograph in each array had changed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> In the literature, this process often is referred to as \u201cabsolute judgment.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\"> In my view, Justice Palmer\u2019s concurrence is based on a misunderstanding of the facts of this case and a misapplication of the standard set forth in <em>Ledbetter. </em>The crux of Justice Palmer\u2019s disagreement with the majority is his view that Beaudin\u2019s comment to Clement, although made <em>after </em>Clement had already confirmed his selection of the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array, \u201cgave rise to an undue risk that the extent or degree to which Clement was confident about the accuracy of his identification would be skewed in favor of the state.\u201d Suggestiveness, however, refers to the witness\u2019 <em>initial </em>selection of an individual from a photographic array or lineup. In other words, the term \u201csuggestive\u201d signifies that the police have done something <em>during the course </em>of the identification procedure to <em>suggest </em>that the witness should choose a specific individual. Once Clement chose the defendant\u2019s photograph, however, the procedure had ended, and it no longer was possible for Beaudin to <em>suggest </em>anything. The trial court recognized this when it concluded that Beaudin\u2019s \u201cutterance was not shown to have tainted the witness\u2019 identification when it was initially made.\u201d Justice Palmer strains to justify his position by improperly shifting the focus from the impact of police conduct on the out-of-court identification to the impact of the out-of-court identification on the subsequent in-court identification, thus unduly expanding the temporal and conceptual scope of what constitutes an identification procedure administered by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The problems inherent in Justice Palmer\u2019s view are manifest, as there are many events that may, and often do, occur prior to or during trial that may reinforce or otherwise affect the witness\u2019 level of confidence in his recollection. For instance, the witness may see a news report of the suspect\u2019s arrest, or he may disregard the warnings that police typically provide and compare notes with other witnesses about his identification of a particular suspect. Moreover, when a witness taires the stand, his recollection may be affected by his observation of the individual he selected during the identification procedure sitting at the defense table. All of these scenarios, and countless others, carry the potential for affecting the \u201cwitness\u2019 confidence in the strength of his photo [graphic] identification and the solidity of his basis in memory for it, thus making it harder for the defense to test the true certainty with which he made the identification on cross-examination . . . .\u201d None of these situations, however, presents a basis for excluding 1he identification. To the contrary, the defendant may elicit from the witness, on cross-examination, any factors that might have influenced the witness\u2019 confidence in the accuracy of his initial pretrial identification. The jury is then in the best position to weigh the probative value of the identification in light of these potential influences. This is truly \u201ccustomary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>grist for the jury mill.

Despite her best efforts, however, Justice Katz cannot highlight a single fact that the trial court relied on <em>in this case </em>to determine that the identification procedures were unnecessarily suggestive. Although the trial court expressed concern about Beaudin\u2019s confirmatory comment to Clement, it specifically found that this comment did not taint the accuracy of the initial identification, with which our suggestiveness analysis is concerned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\"> We have, however, set forth the standard of review for the reliability prong of the <em>Manson </em>test. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>227 Conn. 677, 631 A.2d 271 (1993), we stated that \u201cwe examine the legal question of reliability with exceptionally close scrutiny and defer less than we normally do to the related fact finding of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The defendant claims that the state has thus waived its ability to contest this point on appeal, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>269 Conn. 97, 106, 848 A.2d 445 (2004), for the principle that a party cannot challenge on appeal an alleged error that it has induced. Although we agree with this principle, we find it has no application in the present case. First, the state did generally contest the defendant\u2019s argument that the identification procedures used in this case were unnecessarily suggestive. Second, there is a distinct difference between inducing an error and failing to address a discrete argument that the court eventually relies on in making its decision. Finally, we note that the appropriate legal standard for determining unnecessary suggestiveness does not require that the court decide whether a particular procedure is more reliable or superior but, rather, whether the procedure employed is designed or administered in such a way as to suggest to the witness that a particular individual is the correct choice. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 656, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). Thus, the significance that the defendant attaches to the state\u2019s failure to address this argument is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> In her concurrence, Justice Katz appears to agree generally with our characterization of the trial court\u2019s analysis. The <em>sole </em>factual ground on which Justice Katz bases her disagreement with us that the trial court implemented a per se rule is her belief that \u201cthe trial court also reasonably relied on the fact that the detective in charge of the investigation not only administered the procedure but also conveyed approval of the identification made by one of the witnesses as a basis for its determination that the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive . . . .\u201d The concurrence, however, overlooks the fact that the court determined, unequivocally, that Beaudin\u2019s \u201cutterance was not shown to have tainted the witness\u2019 identification when it was initially made.\u201d This is the court\u2019s key finding relating to the suggestiveness of the procedure itself with respect to the use of an interested administrator. Justice Katz appears to misread the court\u2019s memorandum of decision when she declares that \u201c[t.]he trial court was particularly troubled by [Beaudin\u2019s utterance] because Clement noticeably had hesitated before selecting the defendant\u2019s photograph.\u201d This statement is flatly contradicted by the court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe only reason [Clement] felt such hesitation was his genuine concern, which was reasonable under the circumstances, that he not identify an innocent man. . . . [H]e was not at all sure that the true perpetrator would be in the array, and so he commendably took his time in order not to implicate an innocent man.\u201d The trial court concluded with a resounding endorsement of the quality of Clement\u2019s identification: \u201cThe court thus agrees with the state that his selection of the defendant was not made by the exercise of relative judgment . . . but by the process of positive selection based [on] his personal memory of the gunman\u2019s face.\u201d Moreover, when the court did examine the photographic arrays actually used in the present case, it determined that they \u201cdid not unfairly highlight the defendant or promote his identification by the witnesses in any way.\u201d It is, therefore, unsurprising that Justice Katz fails to point to <em>any </em>basis in fact for the trial court\u2019s determination that the procedures used in this case were so flawed as to present a \u201cvery substantial risk of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 555, 757 A.2d 482 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\"> Although similar language was employed by the court in <em>Stovall v.

In fact, we believe that our approach clearly evinces an open-mindedness with respect to the import of the continuing scientific debate, and that our adherence to <em>Ledbetters </em>ad hoc approach is the most conducive method for ensuring that the jurisprudence in this area does not become ossified. We believe that this opinion encourages trial courts to continue to consider the evolving scientific evidence, in light of the facts and circumstances of each individual case, to determine if a particular identification procedure is unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">In her concurrence, Justice Katz highlights several articles, the product of her own independent research, that she claims either supports the defendant\u2019s assertions or calls into question the methodology of the Mecklenburg Report. See footnotes 8 through 13 and accompanying text of Justice Katz\u2019 concurrence. Notwithstanding our belief that Justice Katz has cherry picked these articles and that their results and recommendations are much more ambivalent than Justice Katz portrays them to be, the very existence of these articles serves as further support for our conclusion that the science of eyewitness identification procedures is far too unsettled to support a per se approach. The additional research that Justice Katz presents simply adds more silt to the already muddy water. To the extent that Justice Katz cites further studies in support of the supremacy of sequential, double-blind procedures, we remain convinced that the very availability of such research emphasizes the uncertain state of the science. If the issue were definitively decided, the scientific debate would have ceased. Justice Katz has demonstrated that it has not. Thus, we remain tethered to the ad hoc approach mandated <em>by Ledbetter </em>until the scientific evidence reaches a point of uniformity with respect to the unnecessarily suggestive nature of simultaneous, single-blind procedures such that due process requires us to jettison such procedures in favor of a demonstrably superior alternative. We are not yet at that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\"> In <em>Ledbetter, </em>we engaged in a very thorough review of several aspects of the relevant scientific research, particularly, the validity of the fourth <em>Diggers </em>factor, namely, witness certainty, which we found to be a relatively unreliable measure of reliability, as well as the effect that a warning can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>have on procedures that are not double-blind and the process of relative judgment. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 566-75.

App. 666, 674, 946 A.2d 319, cert. denied, 288 Conn. 902, 952 A.2d 811 (2008), is clearly to the contrary. Holding that due process <em>does not require </em>a finding that procedures that are not sequential or double-blind are unnecessarily suggestive is quite different from declaring such procedures forever immune from challenge. We expressly leave open the possibility that, in a future case, under different circumstances, the procedures utilized by the police in the present case <em>could </em>violate due process. We are especially cognizant of the theoretical and commonsense value of utilizing a blind administrator whenever practical. The unequivocal intent of the court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Smith, </em>as well as the thrust of this entire opinion, however, is to reinforce our holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>Ledbetter </em>that each eyewitness identification scenario must be judged on its own facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\"> In his concurrence, Justice Palmer reads this statement and similar statements to signify that the trial court believed that Beaudin\u2019s comment was \u201cpart of the pretrial identification procedure\u201d and thus susceptible to review for suggestiveness. In fact, the entire basis for Justice Palmer\u2019s concurrence rests on the most slender of reeds. What Justice Palmer fails to recognize is that the trial court was responding to a motion to suppress two distinct pieces of evidence. The defendant sought exclusion of <em>both </em>the out-of-court identification, which was derived from the photographic identification procedure at issue, and Clement\u2019s subsequent in-court identification. The court confirmed this fact in the first paragraph of its memorandum of decision, referring to the defendant\u2019s \u201c[motion] to suppress as evidence all pretrial <em>and </em>in-court identifications\u201d on the grounds \u201cthat: (1) the procedure by which each <em>pretrial </em>identification was obtained was unnecessarily suggestive; [and] (2) that any <em>in-court </em>identification by a witness who previously identified him in an unnecessarily suggestive pretrial identification procedure would be irreparably tainted by the prior illegal identification . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In his concurrence, Justice Palmer asserts that \u201c[i]t is crystal clear . . . that the trial court concluded that Beaudin\u2019s comment had rendered Clement\u2019s pretrial identification of the defendant unnecessarily suggestive . . . .\u201d In fact, the record demonstrates precisely the opposite. After determining that the photographic identification procedure used by the police in this case \u201ccreated an unnecessary risk of producing irreparable identifications\u201d because of the use of a simultaneous photographic array the administration of which was not double-blind, the trial court explicitly found that \u201cBeaudin\u2019s utterance came <em>after </em>the witness had selected the defendant\u2019s photograph . . . [and] [t]hus . . . was not shown to have tainted the witness\u2019 identification when it was initially made.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although Justice Palmer places great emphasis on the word \u201cinitially,\u201d it is clear from the very next sentence that the court was using that word to refer specifically to the fact that Beaudin\u2019s remark did not affect the <em>out-of-court </em>identification. The court stated in that next sentence: \u201cWhat [Beaudin] risked by her conduct . . . was unfairly bolstering [Clement\u2019s] confidence in the strength of his photo [graphic] identification and the solidity of his basis in memory for it, thus making it harder for the defense to test the true certainty with which he made that identification . . . and correspondingly more difficult for the jury to assess the true strength and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>reliability of that identification . . . .\u201d This potential harm clearly refers to the prejudicial effect that Beaudin\u2019s comment might have on Clement\u2019s subsequent in-court identification of the defendant. As the trial court noted, however, the physical evidence derived from the photographic identification, i.e., the photographic array itself with Clement\u2019s initials next to a circled photograph of the defendant, was not in any way tainted by Beaudin\u2019s remark because it was produced before she made the remark. Clement\u2019s later memory of the procedure is simply irrelevant to a determination of whether the procedure itself was suggestive, and any suggestion to the contrary in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision is merely the product of a confusion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"A4v\">In making a determination of suggestiveness, we look to whether the allegedly suggestive aspect of the identification procedure unnecessarily emphasized the defendant\u2019s photograph or otherwise indicated which individual the police considered a suspect. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 656. This is not an inquiry into the potential in-court prejudice that a defendant may suffer because of police conduct or other events occurring <em>subsequent </em>to the witness\u2019 selection but, rather, a determination of whether the selection <em>itself </em>is suspect because it may be the <em>product </em>of the suggestive conduct or display. Moreover, although comments such as Beaudin\u2019s may not be a \u201charmless irrelevancy,\u201d we must be careful to pinpoint the potential harm and identify why that harm might be relevant. Only then can a court determine the appropriate remedy. To be clear, the purportedly prejudicial effect created by Beaudin\u2019s comment that the trial court identified was the potentially reduced efficacy of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Clement because of his allegedly heightened sense of certitude and <em>not </em>the inherent suggestiveness of the procedure leading to Clement\u2019s selection of the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array in the first place. Thus, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that Beaudin\u2019s remark had no bearing on the prior photographic identification. To the extent that Justice Palmer feels bound by some of the trial court\u2019s more equivocal statements that seemingly conflate these issues, however, we simply note that this court is not obliged to perpetuate a perceived error: \u201cOur oath is to do justice, not to perpetuate error.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mendillo </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 456, 507, 717 A.2d 1177 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\"> Justice Palmer not only fails to recognize the significance of this explicit finding but appears to ignore it entirely when he declares in his concurrence that \u201cthe trial court justifiably predicated its finding of unnecessary suggestiveness on [Beaudin\u2019s comment].\u201d It is patently contradictory to claim that the trial court \u201cpredicated its finding\u201d of suggestiveness on an impropriety that it found did <em>not </em>taint the witness\u2019 identification at the time it was made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The trial court actually predicated its finding of unnecessary suggestiveness on \u201cthe unchallenged findings of the scientific research studies . . . that the simultaneous showing of all photo [graphs] to each witness on a single photo [graphic] [array] created an unnecessary risk of producing irreparable misidentifications . . . Moreover, although the court expressed a concern on the basis of \u201cthe undisputed judgment and recommendation of well respected scientific researchers that the practice of having persons with special knowledge of a criminal investigation administer identification procedures\u201d was undesirable because the procedure might be biased and the subsequent identification tainted, the court found that, <em>in this case, </em>the identification was not tainted. Furthermore, the trial court also examined the photographic array itself and determined that it \u201cdid not unfairly highlight the defendant or promote his identification by the witnesses in any way.\u201d Although Justice Palmer decries \u201cthe majority\u2019s insistence on treating Beau-din\u2019s comment as entirely separate and distinct from the identification procedure,\u201d he fails to recognize that the basis for our treatment of Beaudin\u2019s statement is the trial court\u2019s determination that the comment did not infect Clement\u2019s initial selection of the defendant from the photographic array. It is this initial identification, and the procedure used to elicit that identification, with which our suggestiveness analysis is concerned. Police conduct occurring <em>after </em>the witness\u2019 definitive selection of a defendant\u2019s photograph from an array is more appropriately dealt with in cross-examination, where the credibility of the initial identification and the reliability of the witness\u2019 subsequent recollection of his level of confidence in that identification can be tested in the crucible of jury scrutiny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> The first case in which we used this language to describe the test for the constitutionality of pretrial identification procedures appears to be <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 371-72, which we decided in 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> Valle testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">\u201cQ.

Although I agree with the major-</p>\n<p id=\"AMn\">ity\u2019s conclusion that the judgment of conviction of the defendant, Julian Marquez, must be affirmed because the admission of the witness identifications in question did not violate due process, I disagree with its decision to affirm the conviction on the basis of the state\u2019s alternative ground for affirmance rather than, on the issue presented in the defendant\u2019s appeal. Like the majority, I recognize that the trial court\u2019s discussion of the simultaneous photographic array<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suggests that, despite the accompanying warnings, the array was unnecessarily suggestive. If, indeed, the trial court had reached that conclusion without the support of other factual findings, it would have been inconsistent with our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 580, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006), in which we held that, standing alone, a nonsequential procedure accompanied by appropriate warnings is not unnecessarily suggestive. I also agree with the majority that the trial court had no authority to issue what could be perceived as a directive to local police departments. Because, however, the trial court also reasonably relied on the fact that the detective in charge of the investigation not only administered the procedure but also conveyed approval of the identification made by one of the witnesses as a basis for its determination that the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, I would not conclude, as the majority does, that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that the identification procedure as a whole was unnecessarily suggestive. More importantly, this court need not decide this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>by rejecting the trial court\u2019s determination of unnecessary suggestiveness. Indeed, in my view, this approach is both unnecessary and unwise, as it signals our approval of the use of an interested administrator<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and closes off debate on witness identification procedures at a time when a clearer consensus about those procedures is just beginning to emerge from scientific research. Therefore, I would limit consideration to the trial court\u2019s determination that the identification was reliable based upon the totality of the circumstances, as presented by the posture of the defendant\u2019s appeal, and would affirm the judgment on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">More than three years ago, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 546-47, this court was asked to conclude that the failure to warn a witness that the perpetrator might not be present at an identification procedure renders that procedure per se unnecessarily suggestive, thereby overruling our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 556, 757 A.2d 482 (2000) (witness identification procedure utilizing photographic array not unnecessarily suggestive when witness had been informed that suspect was present in array). In support of this proposed conclusion, various amici curiae presented this court with academic research that underscored the dangers of misidentification inherent in the use of identification procedures, including lineups, show-ups and photographic arrays that contained no warning to the witness that the perpetrator may not be present. Id., 569-70. We declined to adopt such a per se rule, reasoning that \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding the various identification procedures present too many variables for us to conclude that a per se rule is appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>priate.\u201d Id., 574. Instead, we held that \u201ctrial courts should continue to determine whether individual identification procedures are unnecessarily suggestive on the basis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the procedure . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. In <em>Ledbetter, </em>we further directed trial courts, however, to consider the results of research concerning whether the identification administrator informs the witness that the perpetrator may or may not be present. Id., 574-75. Because of the import of the studies, we also invoked our supervisory authority to mandate that, if the administrator has not provided such a warning, trial courts must issue a jury instruction explaining that there may be an increased likelihood of misidentification under such circumstances. Id., 579. A necessary implication of our holding in <em>Ledbetter, </em>however, is that if a witness identification procedure employs a warning instruction, then, standing alone, it would not be considered unnecessarily suggestive, and that trial courts must continue to examine the facts and circumstances of each case to determine if other factors are present that would render the procedure improper. See id., 574-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Four months after we decided <em>Ledbetter, </em>the trial court in the present case was presented with the following identification procedure in the defendant\u2019s trial for, inter alia, felony murder and robbery in the first degree. Two witnesses separately were shown a simultaneous photographic array that contained a printed warning in conformity with our holding in <em>Ledbetter </em>from which they each identified the defendant as the perpetrator who possessed a firearm. The identification procedures were conducted by Detective Patricia Beaudin of the Hartford police department, the detective in charge of the criminal investigation, who informed the second of the two witnesses, Mark Clement, at the conclusion of the procedure that he \u201c \u2018did good\u2019 \u201d because he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>selected the same individual whom the other witness, Christopher Valle, had chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In support of his motion to suppress the identifications on the ground, inter alia, that these procedures were unnecessarily suggestive, the defendant introduced into evidence four scientific research papers that called into question both the use of an interested administrator and the use of a simultaneous photographic array because of the risks of misidentification they present. The state did not object to the introduction of this evidence and did not dispute the results of the studies. After considering the identification procedure, and in light of the scientific evidence that had been introduced, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the identifications, finding that, although the procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, it nevertheless was reliable under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In its analysis of the procedure, the trial court relied primarily on two factors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, the court reviewed the scientific research presented and concluded that using an interested lineup administrator<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> creates an \u201cunnecessary risk of injecting bias into the identification process, and thus of producing irreparable misidentifications.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court then found that, in the present case, those risks specifically had been realized when the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>trator, Beaudin, who also had served as the lead investigator in the case, contaminated the process by announcing to Clement during the identification procedure, in essence, that he correctly had identified the defendant, and that he had identified the same person that Valle had identified, thus reinforcing Clement\u2019s choice. The trial court was particularly troubled by this fact because Clement noticeably had hesitated before selecting the defendant\u2019s photograph. The court noted that, by commenting on Clement\u2019s choice, Beaudin unwittingly had bolstered Clement\u2019s confidence and rendered it impossible for the defense to test the accuracy of his memory and made it more difficult for the jury to assess the reliability of the identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Second, the trial court found, on the basis of the unchallenged studies,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the use of the simultaneous photographic array itself was unnecessarily suggestive, despite the inclusion of the printed warning, because it allowed Clement to engage in a \u201crelative judgment\u201d process, creating an unnecessary risk of a misidentification.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court then set forth the following cautionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>note to guide police in improving identification procedures: \u201cPolice personnel conducting photo [graphic] identifications should henceforth strive to eliminate the danger of misidentification arising from the simultaneous showing of multiple photo [graphs] by making all such showings sequentially.\u201d On the basis of these factors, the trial court concluded that the identification procedure as a whole was unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">I recognize that, although the trial court properly considered the studies as evidence and found potential risks inherent in the use of the simultaneous (nonse-quential) array, it failed to make specific findings that such risks were present in the present case. Therefore, to the extent that the trial court may have predicated its finding of unnecessary suggestiveness <em>solely </em>on the use of the simultaneous photographic array, such a determination would be contrary to our holding in <em>State </em>v. Ledbetter, supra, 275 Conn. 575. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s admonition to police department personnel may be read as an attempt to establish a per se rule requiring sequential identification procedures as an exercise of supervisory authority. Although the research suggests that sequential identification procedures are superior to nonsequential ones, except in certain circumstances; see footnotes 11 and 12 of this concurring opinion; it is well established that trial courts are not empowered to bind police departments, much less their sister tribunals, by virtue of their rulings. See <em>J. M. Lynne Co. </em>v. <em>Geraghty, </em>204 Conn. 361, 369, 528 A.2d 786 (1987); <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>43 Conn. App. 39, 43, 682 A.2d 542 (1996); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>255 Conn. 425, 438, 773 A.2d 287 (2001) <em>(\u201c[appellate </em>courts possess an inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice\u201d [emphasis added]). Accordingly, I would reject any attempt made by the trial court to establish a per se rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>In my view, however, the trial court made its determination of unnecessary suggestiveness by examining the procedure as a whole, such that the use of the simultaneous array was evaluated in concert with the other factors present. With respect to the use of the interested administrator, the research presented clearly indicated substantial risks of misidentification, which the state chose not to address, and those risks specifically were realized when Beaudin praised Clement as essentially having made the correct choice in identifying the defendant. Moreover, Beaudin\u2019s comment occurred immediately after the identification had been made, thus having an indelible effect on Clement\u2019s memory. For the reasons set forth by Justice Palmer in his concurring opinion, it is clear that the trial court viewed Beaudin\u2019s comment as having contaminated the identification procedure by \u201cunfairly bolstering the witness\u2019 confidence in the strength of his photo [graphic] identification and the solidity of his basis in memory for it. . . .\u201d Because I cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that it rendered the procedure as a whole unnecessarily suggestive; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 548 (noting abuse of discretion standard required to review decisions on admitting witness identifications); I would decide the case on the basis of the issue presented in the defendant\u2019s appeal, namely, whether the identifications nevertheless were reliable under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Additionally, I would confine the resolution of this case to the defendant\u2019s appeal for another reason\u2014my concern that, by approving the procedures at issue in the present case, we may discourage, if not halt, development of jurisprudence surrounding witness identification procedures. I am mindful that our holding in <em>Ledbetter </em>was predicated on the state of the research as it then existed. Since that time, however, a great deal of research has been done on the effects of various factors on the accuracy of witness identifications. From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the research presented to this court and my own independent review of available scientific literature, it is clear that science has uncovered a number of flaws in current identification procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">For example, research studies clearly support the hypothesis that using an individual who is aware of the identity of the suspect to conduct the identification process contaminates the process, even when the individual makes no conscious effort to influence the witness\u2019 identification.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Researchers have documented a number of mechanisms by which a lineup administrator unintentionally may influence the outcome of the results.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, experimental evidence has demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>strated that, when a lineup administrator erroneously believes that a particular member of the lineup is the perpetrator, witnesses tend to select that member rather than the true perpetrator. G. Wells &amp; D. Quinli-van, \u201cSuggestive Eyewitness Identification Procedures and the Supreme Court\u2019s Reliability Test in Light of Eyewitness Science: 30 Years Later,\u201d 33 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 1, 8 (2009). Although further analysis of real-world data should be completed, and the use of blind administrators; see footnote 2 of this concurring opinion; may be impractical to implement in certain situations,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it is clear that, when reasonably possible, it is preferable to employ a blind administrator to avoid inadvertent contamination of the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Additionally, research indicates that sequential identification procedures generally appear to be superior to simultaneous identification procedures, and some studies go so far as to recommend that they be adopted by law enforcement agencies. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>research has identified specific situations in which sequential identification procedures may produce fewer accurate results than simultaneous identification procedures,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and therefore these situations should be studied to determine the extent to which they render sequential procedures inadvisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Although the state chose not to dispute the research in the proceedings in the trial court, it presented to this court a report that cast doubt on the value of sequential, blind identification procedures and concluded that field experiments did not replicate the favorable results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>obtained when utilizing such procedures in a controlled laboratory environment. S. Mecklenburg, \u201cReport to the Legislature of the State of Illinois: The Illinois Pilot Program on Sequential Double-Blind Identification Procedures\u201d (March 17, 2006) pp. i-ii (hereafter Illinois Report). Ultimately, however, the conclusions in that report have been discredited as the product of an unsound, unscientific methodology that does not support the conclusions reached therein.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The report\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>author later conceded that \u201cthe purpose of the Illinois field study was not to isolate the effect of one factor upon lineup results,\u201d and reiterated the need for further field studies to evaluate those factors in greater detail. S. Mecklenberg, \u201cAddendum to the [Illinois Report]\u201d (June 19, 2006), pp. 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">It is therefore clear that witness identification research, although evolving, is converging toward a consensus. It is equally clear that, in light of the evolving research, this court should avoid closing off debate on witness identification procedures by signaling its approval of procedures on which research currently casts doubt, especially when there is no need to do so. Ultimately, as science progresses and is able to offer more concrete recommendations, witness identification procedures may need to be revised to ensure that they produce accurate results in accordance with due process guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In light of these concerns, I would reaffirm the case-by-case approach that we endorsed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 575, allowing trial courts to examine the studies presented to them and to consider those studies under the particular facts as they arise in any given case. I would limit the court\u2019s consideration in this appeal to the trial court\u2019s determination that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>identification was reliable based upon the totality of the circumstances, as presented by the posture of the defendant\u2019s appeal. Accordingly, I turn to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The defendant contends that the trial court improperly determined that the identifications made by the two witnesses, Valle and Clement, were reliable under the totality of the circumstances. Specifically, the defendant notes that, with respect to their ability to see the perpetrator at the time of the crime, the lighting was \u201cquite poor\u201d because the light in the dining room of the victim\u2019s apartment was off. The defendant also points out that, although the descriptions provided by the witnesses generally matched his appearance, they lacked specific descriptions of facial features, including hair and eye color, and he contends that his photograph was highlighted with respect to others in the photographic array. In light of this court\u2019s acknowledgment in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 576, that \u201cthe correlation between witness confidence and accuracy tends to be weak, and witness confidence can be manipulated,\u201d the defendant suggests that the confidence level of Valle and Clement should be given little weight. The defendant also asserts that the studies he submitted to the trial court indicated that the identification procedures themselves rendered the identification unreliable. Finally, he maintains that Clement\u2019s identification was biased directly by the postidentification statement by Beaudin confirming that Clement had identified the same individual that Valle had identified. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the identifications were reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The standard of review and legal principles for decisions to admit witness identifications is well settled: \u201c[W]e will reverse the trial court\u2019s [evidentiary] ruling . . .' only where there is an abuse of discretion or where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>an injustice has occurred . . . and we will indulge in every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . Because the inquiry into whether evidence of pretrial identification should be suppressed contemplates a series of factbound determinations, which a trial court is far better equipped than this court to make, we will not disturb the findings of the trial court as to subordinate facts unless the record reveals clear and manifest error.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 548. The admission of a witness\u2019 identification into evidence, however, implicates a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, and thus \u201cwe are obliged to examine the record scrupulously to determine whether the facts found are adequately supported by the evidence and whether the court\u2019s ultimate inference of reliability was reasonable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">If the trial court has determined that the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, as in the present case, it must then determine \u201cwhether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on an examination of the totality of the circumstances. . . . The defendant bears the burden of proving both that the identification procedures were unnecessarily suggestive and that the resulting identification was unreliable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>252 Conn. 533, 553, 747 A.2d 487 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201c[Reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony .... <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977). To determine whether an identification that resulted from an unnecessarily suggestive procedure is reliable, the corruptive effect of the suggestive procedure is weighed against certain factors, such as the opportunity of the [witness] to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the [witness\u2019] degree of attention, the accuracy of [the witness\u2019] prior description of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the [identification] and the time between the crime and the [identification].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>262 Conn. 825, 836-37, 817 A.2d 670 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Turning to the first two factors of reliability in the present case, the trial court made several factual findings that support its determination that, at the time of the crime, the witnesses had ample opportunity to view the perpetrator with a sufficient degree of attention. Valle first observed the perpetrator with the gun just before the robbery as the perpetrator stood in a lighted common hallway of the apartment building talking to the victim. He next observed the peipetrator during the course of the robbery over a period of several minutes in the living room from a distance of one to two feet as they sat facing each other. Clement first saw the peipetrator as he entered the victim\u2019s game room, which was well lit, and next saw him as Clement sat with Valle on the living room couch for several minutes. The living room was lit adequately by light coming from adjacent rooms, once the witnesses\u2019 eyes had adjusted to the admittedly low light level,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the trial court found that \u201cthe light from the kitchen must have illuminated the faces of the robbers, helping to fix them in [the witnesses\u2019] memory.\u201d Both witnesses had stated to the police that based on their observations, they would be able to identify the perpetrator if they saw him again. Thus, the record supports the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>finding that they had adequate opportunities to view the defendant with a sufficient degree of attention. This conclusion is consistent with this court\u2019s previous holdings that a witness may make a reliable identification based on a brief interval when the witness was able to view the criminal clearly; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>274 Conn. 790, 804-805, 877 A.2d 739 (2005) (identification reliable when witness \u201cgot a good look\u201d at perpetrator as he ran past her and pulled down his mask); and when the witness had observed the criminal over a period of several minutes from a sufficiently close distance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosswell, </em>223 Conn. 243, 268, 612 A.2d 1174 (1992) (identification reliable when witnesses observed masked perpetrator for several minutes with their attention directed at perpetrator).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Turning to the third factor of reliability, both witnesses gave consistent, detailed descriptions of the perpetrator, which matched that of the defendant. Valle described the perpetrator with the gun as a Hispanic male in his early twenties, taller and slimmer than his companion, with braids in his hair and dressed entirely in black. Clement described the gunman as tall, Hispanic, in his early twenties, wearing all black clothing, with \u201ccom rows\u201d and a medium build. Although neither witness included certain facial features, such as eye or hair color, in their descriptions, the descriptions were consistent, both with each other and with the appearance of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">With respect to the fourth factor of reliability, the trial court found that both witnesses\u2019 level of certainty was high. Valle had informed the police investigators immediately after the robbery that he would be able to identify the perpetrator again, and he later recognized the defendant at a chance encounter at the office of Valle\u2019s parole officer. At the subsequent photographic identification procedure, he made the identification \u201cimmediately and with great confidence.\u201d Clement testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>fled that, when he was shown the photographic array at the identification procedure, his eyes immediately were drawn to the defendant\u2019s photograph. Although he did not identify the defendant as the perpetrator at that moment, Clement testified that he had hesitated only because he wanted to be sure that he identified the correct individual. The trial court found that Clement\u2019s hesitation reasonably stemmed from his \u201cgenuine concern . . . that he not identify an innocent man,\u201d and that he was nevertheless confident in his identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Finally, Valle\u2019s identification occurred only four days after the crime, while Clement\u2019s occurred eight days after the crime. In light of both witness\u2019 opportunity to view the perpetrator and their confidence levels, it was unlikely that the witnesses\u2019 memories would have faded in that short period of time. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 555 (three month period reliable in light of witness\u2019 opportunity to view defendant and witness\u2019 level of certainty); <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>221 Conn. 447, 454, 604 A.2d 1294 (1992) (two and one-half month period reliable when witnesses had ample opportunity to view assailants and their prior physical descriptions matched).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">To the extent that the defendant in the present case points to some facts that could have cast some doubt on the reliability of the identifications, the trial court gave adequate consideration to them in making its determination. With respect to the effect of the statements by Beaudin to Clement confirming that he had identified the same individual that Valle had selected, the trial court reasonably found that \u201cClement is a particularly credible, forthcoming witness . . . [and the] court has every confidence that his ability to recall and relate such details honestly will remain unaffected by . . . Beaudin\u2019s unfortunate mistake . ...\u201d In light of its findings, the trial court reasonably concluded that the identifications were reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Accordingly, I concur in the judgment concluding that the admission of the identifications did not violate due process.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\"> A simultaneous photographic array displays multiple photographs together on a single page to be shown to a witness, in contrast to a sequential identification procedure in which individual photographs are displayed to a witness one at a time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> I use the term \u201cinterested administrator\u201d to indicate an individual who knows the identity of the suspect in a lineup or photographic array and the term blind or disinterested administrator to indicate an individual who does not possess that knowledge. See footnote 4 of this concurring opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\"> The court, also discussed, but ultimately rejected, the defendant\u2019s claim that his photograph had been highlighted unfairly in the photographic array. It examined the features of the photographs, with particular focus on the details of the background of the photographs, finding that all of the photographs therein were consistent with each other and with the descriptions previously provided by the witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\"> The research generally refers to the individual responsible for conducting an identification procedure as a \u201clineup administrator\u201d or an \u201cadministrator,\u201d irrespective of whether the procedure involves a photographic array, a live group of persons presented together, or individuals presented one at a time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b193-10\"> As I explain further in footnote 8 of this concurring opinion, the research submitted by the defendant universally indicates that the use of an interested administrator; see footnote 2 of this concurring opinion; contaminates the process, even when the individual makes no conscious effort to influence the identification, substantially increasing the likelihood of misidentification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> As I explain in more detail in footnote 11 of this concurring opinion, the scientific studies indicate that, as a general matter, sequential identification procedures are significantly more accurate than simultaneous identification procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> As we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 572, to which the trial court in the present case referred in its analysis, the relative judgment process allows a witness to compare each lineup participant to his memory of the perpetrator and determine which lineup participant most closely resembles the perpetrator. We stated then that \u201cthe relative judgment process exerts a significant influence in eyewitness identifications. . . . The problem with the relative judgment process . . . is that it includes no mechanism for deciding that the culprit is none of the people in the lineup.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Consequently, in lineups that do not contain the actual perpetrator, witnesses invariably make a mistaken identification, choosing some participant in the lineup rather than realizing that the perpetrator is not present. See id., 572-73 (noting that in experiments, when witnesses were shown lineup containing actual perpetrator, 92 percent of witnesses correctly identified perpetrator, but when lineup did not contain actual perpetrator, <em>100 percent of witnesses identified someone other than actual perpetrator).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> See, e.g., G.

I therefore concur in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The trial court concluded that the identification procedures employed by the police in the present case were unnecessarily suggestive for two reasons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first reason on which the trial court relied was the fact that the witness, Mark Clement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was shown a simulta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>neous rather than a sequential photographic array; that is, the photographs were displayed to him all at the same time rather than one at a time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The second reason on which the trial court based its finding of unnecessary suggestiveness was comprised of two components: First, the police did not employ a double-blind identification procedure,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, second, the detective who conducted the procedure commended Clement on his selection of the defendant\u2019s photograph because a second witness, Christopher Valle, previously had selected that same photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">With respect to the trial court\u2019s first finding, I agree with the majority and the state that, under our holding <em>m State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006), the trial court improperly concluded that the nonsequential identification procedure used by the police in this case was unnecessarily suggestive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>deed, the procedure that the police used in the present case was <em>less </em>suggestive than the procedure that we approved of in <em>Ledbetter </em>because Clement, in contrast to the witness in <em>Ledbetter, </em>was expressly advised that he \u201cshould not conclude or guess that the photographs contain the person who committed the offense under investigation. You are not obligated to identify anyone. It is just as important to free innocent persons from suspicion as to identify guilty parties.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because there is nothing in the record of this case relating to the use of the nonsequential identification procedure that, following our opinion in <em>Ledbetter, </em>may be deemed to be unduly suggestive, the trial court\u2019s contrary finding is unsupportable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The trial court\u2019s second reason for concluding that the procedure was unnecessarily suggestive is based on the fact that the procedure was conducted by the lead investigator in the case, namely, Detective Patricia Beaudin. As the trial court explained, it is \u201cthe undisputed judgment and recommendation of well respected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>scientific researchers that the practice of having persons with special knowledge of a criminal investigation administer identification procedures in the course of it must not be permitted in order to ensure against biasing those procedures and tainting any identifications to which they lead.\u201d Indeed, in the present case, Beaudin did, in fact, improperly advise Clement that he had \u201c [done] good\u201d by identifying the same person Valle identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">I would not decide whether the failure of the police to use a double-blind identification procedure, at least without good cause for not doing so, is sufficient, standing alone, to warrant a finding of unnecessary suggestiveness. Because of the real risk that an investigator who, like Beaudin, knows the identity of the suspect may consciously or unconsciously \u201ctransmit information or expectations inadvertently to the witness, thereby leading the witness to make a particular selection,\u201d it is clear\u2014in fact, it appears to be undisputed\u2014 that use of a double-blind procedure is preferable to the approach that the police followed in the present case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For purposes of this case, however, we need not decide whether the use of the double-blind approach, when practicable, may be required to avoid a finding of unnecessary suggestiveness, because, in the present case, the failure of the police to employ that approach resulted in the very harm that its use is designed to prevent: Beaudin, knowing the identity of the actual suspect, effectively relayed that information to Clement. Thus, as the trial court aptly explained, \u201c[h]ere . . . the risk of unfairness due to administrator bias was not just hypothetical, but real, for on at least one proven occasion . . . Beaudin acted [on] her bias <em>in a clear and inexcusably prejudicial </em>manner\u2014specifically, when she reacted to . . . Clement\u2019s identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>tion of the defendant by commending him on choosing the defendant\u2019s photo [graph] and informing him that . . . Valle had selected the same person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In fact, she did so despite the following admonition on the photographic array itself: \u201cPlease do not discuss this case with other witnesses nor indicate in any way that you have, or have not identified someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">It is true, of course, that Beaudin improperly conveyed this information to Clement after Clement had selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array. Thus, as the trial court stated, that information \u201cwas not shown to have tainted the witness\u2019 identification when it was initially made.\u201d As the trial court further observed, however, \u201c[w]hat [Beaudin] risked by her conduct, however, was unfairly bolstering the witness\u2019 confidence in the strength of his photo [graphic] identification and the solidity of his basis in memory for it, thus making it harder for the defense to test the true certainty with which he made that identification on cross-examination, and correspondingly more difficult for the jury to assess the true strength and reliability of that identification in the totality of the circumstances.\u201d In other words, Beaudin\u2019s remark gave rise to an undue risk that the extent or degree to which Clement was confident about the accuracy of his identification would be skewed in favor of the state. The record, therefore, fully supports the finding of the trial court that Beaudin\u2019s statement was \u201cclear[ly] and inexcusably prejudicial . . . .\u201d This is particularly significant because, even without such improper reinforcement, witnesses often are more confident of their identification after the fact. E.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>522 F.3d 809, 812 (7th Cir. 2008). Moreover, \u201c[p]eople confuse certitude with accuracy and so are led astray.\u201d Id., 811. Because Clement\u2019s level of confidence in his identification of the defendant cannot be separated from the identification itself\u2014an identification is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>as valuable as the witness\u2019 confidence in it\u2014Beaudin\u2019s comment affected Clement\u2019s identification in a very real sense. That fact is not altered merely because the extent of Beaudin\u2019s influence on the identification may not become manifest until Clement\u2019s testimony at trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, therefore, I agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cBeaudin\u2019s violation of the warning printed on her own photo [graphic] [array] cannot simply be treated as a harmless irrelevancy.\u201d Consequently, I believe that the trial court justifiably predicated its finding of unnecessary suggestiveness on this impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The majority maintains that Beaudin\u2019s statement did not render the identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive because the statement was made after Clement\u2019s initial identification of the defendant. According to the majority, once that initial identification had been made, the identification procedure was over, and nothing that occurred thereafter can be deemed to bear on the issue of whether the procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. For several reasons, I disagree with this narrow view of when a police administered eyewitness identification procedure ends. Before setting forth my reasons for reaching this conclusion, however, I first address a second, threshold point of disagreement with the majority, namely, the majority\u2019s assertion that the trial court itself did not treat Beaudin\u2019s comment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Clement as part of the pretrial identification procedure. As the following explication of the trial court\u2019s decision reveals, that decision leaves no room for doubt that the trial court viewed Beaudin\u2019s comment as occurring during the identification procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">At the outset of its decision, the trial court set forth with specificity the claims that the defendant raised in connection with his motion to suppress: \u201c[T]he defendant moved this court, under [Practice Book \u00a7] 41-13 . . . the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article [first], [\u00a7] 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, to suppress as evidence all pretrial and in-court identifications of him as a perpetrator of the crimes charged against him in this case.\u201d Thus, the two identifications involving Clement that the defendant moved to suppress were (1) the pretrial identification of the defendant that Clement made in connection with the out-of-court procedure administered by Beaudin, and (2) any in-court identification of the defendant that Clement might make during the course of the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The trial court then explained the legal bases of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress: \u201cAs grounds for [his] motion, the defendant has alleged, more particularly, that: (1) the procedure by which each challenged pretrial identification was obtained was unnecessarily suggestive; (2) . . . any in-court identification by a witness who previously identified him in an unnecessarily suggestive pretrial identification procedure would be irreparably tainted by the prior illegal identification and, thus, would have no independent basis; and (3) . . . each challenged identification . . . must be suppressed for failure to meet minimum constitutional standards of reliability for procedurally tainted identification evidence, as announced by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1972), and enforced under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the due process clauses of our state and federal constitutions.\u201d Thus, with respect to the pretrial identification procedure that Beaudin administered, the defendant claimed that that procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. With respect to any subsequent in-court identification, the defendant claimed that it would be irreparably tainted due to the fact that the earlier, pretrial identification was unnecessarily suggestive. Finally, with respect to both identifications, the defendant maintained that they were unreliable and, therefore, must be suppressed. It is readily apparent, therefore, that <em>all </em>of the defendant\u2019s claims relate directly to the allegedly improper <em>pretrial identification procedure </em>that Beau-din administered; the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress contains no other claims, and the trial court did not purport to address any other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">After making extensive factual findings, the trial court set forth the applicable law in a section entitled \u201cThe Controlling Legal Standard.\u201d This section is relatively brief, and provides in relevant part: \u201cTo prevail on a motion to suppress identifications under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution or its Connecticut constitutional counterpart, in article [first], [\u00a7] 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, the defendant must prove by a fan-preponderance of the evidence both that a government administered pretrial identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive and, if it was, that any subsequent identification to which it led or may lead in the future was or will be unreliable in the totality of the circumstances. . . . The reliability of an identification procedure is considered under various factors, such as the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of [his] prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>. . . Reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of the identification testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">This is the only legal standard that the trial court mentions in its decision; at no time does the decision refer to a different legal test. Thus, consistent with the claims that the defendant raises in his motion to suppress, the law that the trial court applied pertains <em>only </em>to the allegedly unlawful pretrial identification procedure conducted by Beaudin and its effect on any subsequent in-court identification of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The trial court then set forth in detail the parties\u2019 claims and responses. Thereafter, the court analyzed the defendant\u2019s claims concerning the pretrial identification of the defendant that Clement had made during the procedure administered by Beaudin. As I noted previously, the trial court concluded that the procedure was unnecessarily suggestive because of Beaudin\u2019s use of a nonsequential photographic array and because it was administered by a police officer who (1) had knowledge of the investigation and the suspect, and (2) commended Clement on his identification of the defendant immediately after Clement had made it.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The state claimed that Beaudin\u2019s comment to Clement did not render the identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive because (1) it occurred after Clement\u2019s identification of the defendant, and (2) in any event, the comment did no more than apprise Clement of what he ultimately would have learned prior to trial anyway, that is, that a second witness also had identified the defendant. In response to the state\u2019s first contention, the trial court acknowledged that \u201c[t]he state correctly asserts that . . . Beaudin\u2019s utterance came after the witness had selected the defendant\u2019s photo [graph]. Thus, the utterance was not shown to have tainted the witness\u2019 identification when it was initially made.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>court nevertheless was unpersuaded that the comment had not adversely affected the identification procedure, explaining: \u201cWhat [Beaudin] risked by her conduct, however, was unfairly bolstering [Clement\u2019s] confidence in the strength of his photo [graphic] identification and the solidity of his basis in memory for it, thus making it harder for the defense to test the true certainty with which he made that identification on cross-examination, and correspondingly more difficult for the jury to assess the true strength and reliability of that identification in the totality of the circumstances.\u201d In the trial court\u2019s view, therefore, Beaudin\u2019s comment had infected the identification procedure with unfairness due to the fact that the comment created an undue risk that Clement\u2019s trial testimony about his photographic identification of the defendant would be skewed in favor of the state because the comment improperly had bolstered his confidence in <em>that </em>identification. The trial court next addressed, and also rejected, the state\u2019s argument that Clement inevitably would have found out about the second witness\u2019 identification of the defendant in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Having concluded that various \u201caspects of the procedures by which the challenged photo [graphic] identifications were obtained were unnecessarily suggestive,\u201d the trial court then applied the second prong of the applicable two part test for determining the constitutionality of identifications, namely, the reliability prong. The court determined that neither Clement\u2019s pretrial identification nor any subsequent in-court identification \u201cwas thereby rendered unreliable in the totality of the circumstances in which it was made.\u201d Turning to Clement\u2019s <em>pretrial </em>identification of the defendant, the trial court stated in relevant part: \u201cIn reference to . . . Clement, <em>although the unnecessary suggestiveness of . . . Beaudin\u2019s postidentification commendation of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>him for selecting the [correct photograph] is well established on this record, </em>it is equally well established that he [like the second witness, Valle] had a reliable independent basis for making his challenged photo [graphic] identification of the defendant based solely [on] his memory of the gunman\u2019s face.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The italicized language demonstrates beyond any doubt that the trial court found that Beaudin\u2019s comment had rendered the pretrial identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive. Moreover, unless the trial court had made such a finding, it would have had no reason to explain why Clement\u2019s identification of the defendant was <em>reliable notwithstanding </em>Beaudin\u2019s comment. Indeed, as I noted previously, all of the defendant\u2019s claims, including his claim concerning Beaudin\u2019s comment, emanated directly from the allegedly improper pretrial identification <em>procedure </em>that Beaudin administered, and there is nothing in the trial court\u2019s decision to suggest that the court treated the comment as representing an issue separate and apart from that procedure. In fact, the contrary is true: The record definitively establishes that the court considered the comment as part of the procedure itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The fact that the court treated the comment as having been made during that pretrial procedure is again confirmed by its analysis and resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim that any <em>in-court </em>identification by Clement should be suppressed on the ground that it merely would be the product of the unnecessarily suggestive pretrial identification procedure. With respect to this issue, the trial court stated: \u201cAs for future in-court identifications of the defendant by . . . Clement, <em>whose confidence </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>in his own identification may well have been bolstered by </em>. . . <em>Beaudin\u2019s postidentification comment to him, </em>the court agrees with the state that . . . Clement is a particularly credible, forthcoming witness . . . who still appears to be quite capable of explaining the mental processes by which he made his challenged identification. The court has every confidence that his ability to recall and relate such details honestly <em>will remain unaffected by </em>. . . <em>Beaudin\u2019s unfortunate mistake . . . and thus will be sufficiently reliable in the totality of the circumstances not to require their suppression as evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added,) The court\u2019s express references to Beaudin\u2019s comment in its analysis of the reliability prong reflects the court\u2019s earlier finding that the comment had rendered the pretrial identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive. Finally, once again, if the trial court had not made such a finding, there would have been no reason for the court to have turned to the <em>reliability </em>of the in-court identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">It is crystal clear, therefore, that the trial court concluded that Beaudin\u2019s comment had rendered Clement\u2019s pretrial identification of the defendant unnecessarily suggestive, and that the comment had affected both that identification and any subsequent in-court identification of the defendant by Clement. Of course, as a practical matter, the unnecessarily suggestive nature of the procedure and its effect on Clement was likely to manifest itself in Clement\u2019s trial testimony about his pretrial identification of the defendant and, in particular, in his testimony about <em>his level of confidence in that identification. </em>Insofar as the administration of the identification procedure unfairly bolstered Clement\u2019s confidence in his pretrial identification of the defendant, that unfairness also was likely to manifest itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>in Clement\u2019s testimony at trial about his <em>level of confidence in any in-court identification of the </em>defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The trial court\u2019s determination that Beaudin\u2019s comment was part of the pretrial identification procedure and, therefore, must be analyzed under the two part test applicable to claims concerning the constitutionality of such identification procedures, is amply supported by the record. Beaudin, the procedure administrator, made her improper comment immediately after Clement had selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array and while he was continuing to interact with Beaudin about the subject matter of the procedure, that is, his identification of a suspect. The comment, therefore, occurred toward the end of the identification procedure but not before it finally had concluded. As long as the witness remains with the police and is discussing his identification of the suspect with the officer in charge of administering the procedure, there is no legitimate reason to presume that the identification procedure has concluded. Indeed, such interaction between the witness and the police may serve to taint the witness\u2019 identification, as it did in the present case, by bolstering the witness\u2019 confidence that he had, in fact, identified the actual perpetrator. As I stated previously, the confidence that a witness has in his identification is a critical aspect of the identification itself; indeed, the two are inextricably interrelated. Thus, Beaudin\u2019s improper comment to Clement concerning the identification that Clement had just made rendered the identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive because of the high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>likelihood that Beaudin\u2019s remark would serve to bolster Clement\u2019s confidence in his <em>identification\u2014the very same identification that had been the subject of the procedure at issue. </em>Under the circumstances presented, the majority\u2019s insistence on treating Beaudin\u2019s comment as entirely separate and distinct from the identification procedure makes little sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Furthermore, to the extent that this court must decide precisely when an identification procedure is complete, there are strong policy reasons to conclude that it has not ended when, as in the present case, the police and the witness are discussing the witness\u2019 identification immediately after the witness identifies the suspect. In <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 111-13, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977), the United States Supreme Court identified several considerations that it deemed relevant to the determination of how best to deal with pretrial identification evidence when the police have obtained that evidence by use of a procedure that is unnecessarily suggestive.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court characterized the first such factor as its \u201cconcern [generally] with the problems of eyewitness identification. Usually, the witness must testify about an encounter with a total stranger under circumstances of emergency or emotional stress. The witness\u2019 recollection of the stranger can be distorted easily by the circumstances or by later actions of the police.\u201d Id., 112. The court identified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>second factor as police deterrence, that is, discouraging the police from engaging in conduct that is likely to lead to an unreliable identification. Id. The third and final factor is the effect that a particular approach will have on the administration of justice, including the extent to which the fact finder may be denied access to reliable evidence. Id., 112-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">I believe that all of these considerations are advanced by a determination that the identification procedure in the present case had not concluded before Beaudin commended Clement on his identification of the defendant. With respect to the first such consideration, the present case exemplifies how the \u201clater actions of the police\u201d; id., 112; can have an unfair distorting effect on the original identification by altering the witness\u2019 confidence in that identification in a manner favorable to the state. Viewing the identification procedure more broadly to include Beaudin\u2019s improper comment to Clement also would promote the strong public interest in deterring misconduct by the police in their interactions with eyewitnesses at the very time that the police are engaging those eyewitnesses in identification procedures. Finally, a determination that the identification procedure had not concluded before Beaudin made her comment would result in no adverse effect on the administration of justice because the state still would have the opportunity to establish that the comment did not so taint the procedure, under the totality of the circumstances, as to require suppression of Clement\u2019s identification of the defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The majority contends that \u201c[t]he problems inherent\u201d in the view that I advocate \u201care manifest, as there are many events that may, and often do, occur prior to or during trial that may reinforce or otheiwise affect the witness\u2019 level of confidence in his recollection.\u201d Footnote 11 of the majority opinion. The majority further observes that \u201c[n]one of these situations, however, presents a basis for excluding the identification\u201d; id.; rather, they provide \u201ccustomary grist for the jury mill.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. I fully agree with the majority that examples abound of postidentification events that may influence the witness\u2019 confidence in his identification; indeed, it is equally possible to conceive of circumstances in which a witness\u2019 recollection of a particular suspect is influenced by events that occur <em>prior </em>to his participation in the procedure administered by the police. I also agree with the majority that such influences generally are addressed through cross-examination only. These examples, however, in no way undermine the fact that special steps must be taken to ensure that <em>police sponsored identification procedures </em>are undertaken with care, and that they are administered in an unbiased, evenhanded manner. This is true for obvious reasons, including the fact that witnesses are likely to place great weight on what the police have to say about who committed the crime under investigation. Furthermore, under the controlling two-pronged test pursuant to which reliability is the overriding consideration, it is highly unlikely that a comment of the kind made by Beaudin, standing alone, ever will result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>in suppression of the identification.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Both the state and the defendant, however, have a strong interest in seeing to it that police administered identification procedures are fair, neutral and do not skew either the witness\u2019 initial identification of a suspect or the witness\u2019 confidence in <em>that </em>identification. Unfortunately, the approach that the majority adopts does not advance that objective. Nevertheless, for the reasons set forth by Justice Katz in her concurring opinion, I agree that the trial court properly determined that the photographic identifications at issue in the present case were reliable under the totality of the circumstances and, therefore, admissible at trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">I note, finally, that, despite the significant weight that juries tend to give eyewitness identification testimony, all too often, those identifications are inaccurate. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recently has stated, \u201c[i]t is widely accepted by courts, psychologists and commentators that \u2018[t]he identification of strangers is proverbially untrustworthy.\u2019 [F.

The hazards of such testimony are established by a formidable number of instances in the records of English and American trials. These instances are recent\u2014not due to the brutalities of ancient criminal procedure.\u2019); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 228, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L.

The recent availability of post-conviction DNA tests demonstrate [s] that there have been an overwhelming number of false convictions stemming from uninformed reliance on eyewitness misidentifications. In 209 out of328 cases [64 percent] of wrongful convictions identified by a recent exoneration study, at least one eyewitness misidentified the defendant. [S.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 570 n.23. Although I agree with Justice Katz that, with certain exceptions, sequential identification procedures are superior to nonsequential identification procedures, I do not believe that the scientific research in this area is sufficiently clear or compelling that we now are required to revoke our approval of the land of nonsequential procedure employed in <em>Ledbetter </em>and in the present case, especially in view of the fact that, in the present case, the witnesses were fully advised that they should not assume that the suspect\u2019s photograph was included in the array, that they should feel no obligation to identify anyone and that it is no less important to clear innocent persons of suspicion than it is to identify guilty persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\"> Of course, there may be times when the use of such a procedure is impossible or impracticable in light of the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\"> Although the majority finds that Clement \u201cfelt fairly confident\u201d about his choice, the trial court noted that Clement had testified that \u201cthe sole basis for his identification of the defendant as the gunman was his own \u2018gut feeling,\u2019 based [on] his personal observations of the gunman during the robbery.\u201d Clement also testified that the police never had told him that he had to identify someone in the photographic array and never had indicated to him that he should give special consideration to any particular photograph.

Footnote 34 of the majority opinion. The majority\u2019s explanation for its assertion reveals that there simply is nothing in the record to substantiate it. Indeed, in reaching its unfounded conclusion, the maj ority ignores the relevant portions of the record that I have identified and hypothesizes that \u201cany suggestion\u201d in the decision of the trial court that the court was treating Beaudin\u2019s comment as part of the pretrial identification procedure was \u201cmerely the product of a confusion of the issues [by the trial court].\u201d Id. This latter assertion, along with the majority\u2019s reference to \u201cthe trial court\u2019s more equivocal statements that seemingly conflate [the relevant] issues\u201d; id.; is wholly unwarranted. The trial court,\u2019s thirty-four page memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is characteristically scholarly, thoughtful and thorough, and most definitely not the product of any confusion. The fact is that, in seeking to justify its own faulty analysis, the majority, which first describes the court\u2019s decision as \u201c \u2018clearly\u2019 \u201d reaching one conclusion and then, when it suits its purpose to do so, reverses course and characterizes the trial court\u2019s statements as \u201cequivocal\u201d and \u201cthe product of . . . confusion\u201d; id.; unfairly maligns the perfectly logical analytical approach taken by the trial court</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The majority\u2019s fundamental misunderstanding of the trial court\u2019s decision is exemplified by the majority\u2019s mistaken reading of that decision as containing a finding by the trial court that the prejudice attributable to Beaudin\u2019s comment did not affect Clement\u2019s pretrial identification of the defendant. In support of this conclusion, the majority specifically relies on the following language from the trial court\u2019s decision: \u201cWhat [Beaudin] risked by her conduct . . . was unfairly bolstering [Clement\u2019s] confidence in the strength of his photo[graphic] identification and the solidity of his basis in memory for it, thus making it harder for the defense to test the true certainty with which he made that identification on cross-examination, and correspondingly more difficult for the jury to assess the true strength and reliability of that identification . . . .\u2019\u2019On the basis of this language, the majority asserts: \u201cThis potential harm clearly refers to the prejudicial effect that Beaudin\u2019s comment might have on Clement\u2019s subsequent in-court identification of the defendant,\u201d and <em>not </em>on \u201cClement\u2019s later memory of the [pretrial identification] procedure . . . .\u201d Footnote 34 of the majority opinion. The majority\u2019s conclusion is manifestly and demonstrably wrong, as it is readily apparent <em>from the very </em>language of the trial court\u2019s decision\u2014on which the majority itself relies\u2014that the trial court was concerned about the defendant\u2019s memory of and confidence in <em>his pretrial identification </em>of the defendant. In fact, the language of the trial court\u2019s decision could not be clearer in this regard. The trial court determined that Beaudin\u2019s comment created an undue risk of \u201cunfairly bolstering [Clement\u2019s] confidence in the strength of <em>his photo [graphic] identification </em>and the solidity of his basis in memory for <em>[that </em>identification],\u201d thereby making it more difficult \u201cfor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the defense to test the trae certainty with which he made <em>that identification on cross-examination </em>(Emphasis added.) In other words, Beaudin\u2019s comment gave rise to an unfair risk of affecting Clement\u2019s trial testimony <em>about his pretrial identification </em>of the defendant because that comment likely would have a distorting effect on his memory of <em>that out-of-court identification </em>of the defendant. There is absolutely nothing in the language on which the majority relies to suggest that the trial court was referring to the prejudicial effect that Beaudin\u2019s comment was likely to have on any in-court identification of the defendant; rather, it is perfectly clear from the language of the trial court that the court was referring to the effect that the comment would have on Clement\u2019s <em>in-court trial testimony about his pretrial, out-of-court identification </em>of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\"> The court in <em>Manson </em>considered these factors in deciding whether to adopt a per se test pursuant to which a court would be required to exclude identification evidence that had been obtained by the use of unnecessarily suggestive procedures or, alternatively, a totality of the circumstances test pursuant to which the use of an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure by the police would not require suppression of the identification unless that identification was unreliable upon consideration of all of the relevant circumstances. <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>supra, 432 U.S. 109-13. The court ultimately concluded that, because \u201creliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony\u201d; id., 114; the proper test requires an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances.

Under the test adopted by the majority, however, the fact that the witness\u2019 confidence in his identification is likely to have been affected significantly by virtue of the kind of comment that Beaudin had made in the present case is insufficient even to move the court\u2019s inquiry forward to a consideration of the totality of the circumstances. I do not believe that this approach is consistent with the test for determining the reliability of the identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> Indeed, suppression will be required only if such a comment, when considered with any other police impropriety that occurs during the identification procedure, renders the identification manifestly suspect under the totality of the circumstances.

I therefore disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that a comment such as the one that Beaudin made can never be more than grist for cross-examination. In the overwhelming number of cases\u2014the present one included\u2014that is exactly what it ultimately will be. But when such a comment, in combination with some other unnecessarily suggestive police conduct that occurs at the identification procedure itself, results in an identification that is unreliable under the totality of the circumstances, the state should be precluded from using that identification at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\"> Because I conclude that Valle\u2019s pretrial identification of the defendant also was reliable, I do not address the issue of whether the failure of the police to use a double-blind identification procedure with respect to Valle rendered that procedure unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> In contrast to Justice Katz, I do not read the majority opinion as signaling a contrary view.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b227-7\">SCHALLER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0\">concurring. I concur and join in the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the judgment of the trial court. I write separately, however, to highlight several points, in the hope that doing so will provide some benefit to the trial bench and bar. Because eyewitness identification issues involving pretrial procedures arise frequently, our trial courts deserve guidance from this court in such matters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to maximize the usefulness of the combined opinions, I will attempt to synthesize the basic consensus.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">First, I agree with the majority\u2019s decision to decide this appeal by addressing the state\u2019s alternative ground for affirmance, namely, that the trial court improperly determined that the identification procedures used by the police were unnecessarily suggestive, rather than to decide this appeal by addressing the reliability issue raised by the defendant, Julian Marquez. It would be feasible\u2014and, in some respects, simpler\u2014to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision by determining that the court properly concluded that the identifications were reliable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>under the totality of the circumstances test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1972), and <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977). The rationale for a determination of reliability is concisely set forth in part II of Justice Katz\u2019 concurring opinion. Although I do not disagree with that rationale, affirming on that basis is not prudent, in my mind, because it would fail to address the trial court\u2019s disregard of the test set forth in <em>State </em>v. Ledbetter, 275 Conn. 534, 574, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006). Although the trial court conceivably may have been able to ground its conclusion on the totality of the circumstances test, it did not do so. Instead, it chose to base its decision solely on the research material presented to it. If there is a single important message to be gleaned from the present case, it is that trial courts are bound to apply the totality of the circumstances test in these situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Second, I emphasize my agreement with the majority opinion that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the identification procedures employed in the present case were unnecessarily suggestive. I do not find it useful, however, to establish whether the trial court <em>purported </em>to establish a per se rule or whether the trial court\u2019s admonition to the police was, in fact, a <em>directive. </em>The trial court, in my view, was persuaded by the scientific literature presented by the defendant, which supported his claim that simultaneous lineups administered by an official who was directly involved in the investigation are unnecessarily suggestive. Although I appreciate that much of the recent research raises very serious questions about the use of simultaneous photographic arrays and the use of an interested administrator, the trial court failed to provide a totality of the circumstances analysis establishing that either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>of those methods rendered the identification procedures in the present case unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Finally, and again in light of the different viewpoints expressed in the majority and concurring opinions, I emphasize that this controversy does not alter the essential holding of <em>Ledbetter, </em>that is, that the inquiry for determining whether an identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive is still a case-by-case, factually intensive, totality of the circumstances standard. See id. In other words, none of the opinions in this case should be read to establish any per se rules, either universally authorizing or universally disapproving of <em>any </em>identification procedure. My goal, in this concurring opinion, is to highlight precisely what I see as the trial court\u2019s misstep in this case, and to offer general guidance to trial courts to help them avoid making similar missteps.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Preliminarily, I wish to emphasize what I consider to be the strongest argument in favor of deciding this case on the presented ground for appeal, rather than on the state\u2019s alternative ground for affirmance. The question raised by the alternative ground, whether the trial court improperly concluded that the identification procedures were unnecessarily suggestive, requires that we address two features of identification procedures, the validity and reliability of which are currently called into question by scientific studies. See, e.g., G. Wells &amp; D. Quinlivan, \u201cSuggestive Eyewitness Identification Procedures and the Supreme Court\u2019s Reliability Test in Light of Eyewitness Science: 30 Years Later,\u201d 33 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 1, 8 (2009) (describing ways interested photographic lineup administrator can unintentionally or intentionally influence eyewitness identification); Technical Working Group for Eyewitness Evidence, United States Dept, of Justice, \u201cEyewitness Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement\u201d (October, 1999) p. 9 (interested administrator\u2019s \u201cunintentional cues [e.g., body lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>guage, tone of voice] may negatively impact the reliability of eyewitness evidence\u201d); see also sources cited in footnote 11 of Justice Katz\u2019 concurring opinion (standing for proposition that sequential identification procedures are significantly more accurate than simultaneous identification procedures). Both the majority opinion and Justice Katz\u2019 concurring opinion acknowledge that the evidence in this area of study is in a state of flux. In light of the evolving nature of the scientific research on this issue, it can be argued that it is unhelpful to reach the issue of the propriety of these procedures in the present case, when doing so may run the risk of suggesting that the identification procedures at issue in this case provide a reference point or <em>model </em>for conducting future identification procedures. Put simply, <em>the jury is still out </em>on the continued validity of those procedures, especially the interested administrator feature.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, because the factual scenario involving the identification procedures in this case does not provide any helpful guidance to trial courts in judging the propriety of the procedures generally, I believe that this case does not provide an appropriate reference point or model for future investigations. The majority opinion, however, calls attention to this point and carefully avoids indicating either approval or disapproval of these two identification procedures. The majority analysis focuses on the specific factual circumstances of the present case, and highlights the fact that the trial court failed to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">1 offer a few observations regarding the trial court\u2019s ruling that the identification procedures employed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the present case were unnecessarily suggestive, first explaining why, in my view, the trial court\u2019s decision constituted an abuse of discretion. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision regarding the admissibility of identification evidence under the abuse of discretion standard, \u201cwe will indulge in every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Ledbetter, supra, 275 Conn. 548. We clearly have stated that \u201ctrial courts [must] determine whether individual identification procedures are unnecessarily suggestive on the basis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the procedure, rather than replacing that inquiry with a per se rule.\u201d Id., 574. Such a determination, therefore, necessarily must be grounded on a factually intensive inquiry, not on generalizations, and not solely on scientific literature. This is the principle that the trial court overlooked in arriving at its conclusion that the identification procedures in the present case were unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The trial court did not support its determination that the identification procedures at issue in the present case were unnecessarily suggestive by reference to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the procedures, but instead relied solely on the facts that: (1) both procedures involved simultaneous photographic lineups rather than sequential lineups; and (2) both lineups were conducted by an interested administrator, rather than in a double-blind manner, by an uninterested person who did not know who the suspect was and whether the suspect was present in the lineup. In concluding that these features alone rendered the procedures unnecessarily suggestive, the court relied exclusively on scientific literature that criticizes both types of procedures. See, e.g., G. Wells, M. Small &amp; S. Penrod et al., \u201cEyewitness Identification Procedures: Recommendations for Lineups and Photospreads,\u201d 22 Law <em>&amp; </em>Hum. Behav. 603, 614 (1998) (explaining c\u00f3rrela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tion between simultaneous photographic lineups and relative judgment); J. Turtle, R. Lindsay &amp; G. Wells, \u201cBest Practice Recommendations for Eyewitness Evidence Procedures: New Ideas for the Oldest Way to Solve a Case,\u201d Can. J. of Police and Security Services (March, 2003) pp. 5-19 (same); G. Wells &amp; E. Olson, \u201cEyewitness Testimony,\u201d 54 Ann. Rev. Psychol. 277, 289 (February, 2003) (risk of misidentification due to unconscious bias of interested administrator of identification procedure). Other than noting that the procedures employed involved a simultaneous photographic array and an interested administrator, the trial court pointed to no particular facts that would support a determination that the procedures \u201c[gave] rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>262 Conn. 825, 832, 817 A.2d 670 (2003). In fact, the factual circumstances highlighted by the trial court tend to lead to the opposite conclusion. Specifically, the court found that the array did not unfairly highlight the defendant, and that both photographic arrays contained the instruction recommended by <em>Ledbetter, </em>that the suspect may or may not be included in the lineup. <em>Stale </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">I emphasize that I am not convinced that the trial court created a per se rule by concluding that the procedures at issue in this case were unnecessarily suggestive. Rather, it was the trial court\u2019s failure to ground its determination on the totality of the circumstances that, in my view, constituted an abuse of discretion. The one distinguishing factual circumstance noted by the trial court, that the detective who administered the photographic arrays remarked to one of the witnesses, Mark Clement, after he had identified the defendant from the photographic array, that he had \u201c[done] good\u201d because he identified the same person picked out by the other witness, is irrelevant because the detective\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>validation of Clement\u2019s identification occurred after the fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the absence of some reference to particular aspects of the identification procedures that rendered them unnecessarily suggestive, I believe that the trial court abused its discretion in relying solely on scientific studies, rather than grounding its decision on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the identification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Finally, in light of the different perspectives offered by the majority opinion and the concurring opinions, I offer the following guidance to trial courts as they undertake to discern a route through the virtual forest of opinions in the present case. The problem is twofold: what to do when confronted with an identification procedure that employs one of these two methods; and how to deal with scientific literature discussing identification procedures. As to the first question, the answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>remains the same as it was following <em>Ledbetter. </em>In determining whether an identification procedure is unnecessarily suggestive, the court must make its inquiry \u201con the basis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the procedure, rather than replacing that inquiry with a per se rule.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 574. In other words, the inquiry remains what it always has been, a factually intensive, case-by-case determination made on the basis of the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">As to the second issue, <em>Ledbetter </em>specifically authorized the trial court to consider scientific studies concerning an instruction to a witness that the perpetrator may or may not be present. Id. Beyond that, although <em>Ledbetter </em>did not preclude trial courts from reviewing scientific studies that are offered by the parties regarding the admissibility of identification testimony, it is clear that trial courts are not authorized to rely on scientific studies in order to create new rules. See, e.g., id., 568 (defendant not obligated to present to trial court scientific studies in support of argument that Connecticut should abandon <em>Biggers </em>factors on state constitutional grounds because \u201cthe trial cpurt was bound to apply the <em>Biggers </em>factors in its analysis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Finally, the mere fact that persuasive scientific literature may be presented to the trial court does not relieve the court of its obligation to ground its decision as to whether the procedure was unnecessarily suggestive on the <em>factual circumstances </em>surrounding the identification procedure. In <em>Ledbetter, </em>the court left no doubt that \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding the various identification procedures present too many variables for us to conclude that a per se rule is appropriate.\u201d Id., 574. The court, however, did identify one circumstance as giving rise to the need for an instruction by the trial court warning the jury of the risk of misidentification, namely, when an administrator indicates that a suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>is present in the identification procedure. Id., 579. It seems likely that, as scientific knowledge increases in the field of eyewitness identification, other elements also will be identified as requiring remedial steps. It is noteworthy that the remedial instruction would be unnecessary if disinterested, double-blind administrators were required in such procedures. Although the court in <em>Ledbetter </em>was reluctant to restrict the province of the law enforcement agencies of the state in their application of the processes of eyewitness identifications, consensus in research studies may lead to such restrictions in the future. Although the court in <em>Ledbet-ter </em>did not establish any safeguards against the \u201c \u2018relative judgment process,\u2019 \u201d it was aware of the dangers of such a process. Id., 572 (research indicating that eyewitnesses tend to identify person from lineup who looks most like culprit relative to other members of lineup).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u201cThe vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-known; the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification. Mr. Justice Frankfurter once said: What is the worth of identification testimony even when uncontradicted? The identification of strangers is proverbially untrustworthy. The hazards of such testimony are established by a formidable number of instances in the records of English and American trials. These instances are recent\u2014not due to the brutalities of ancient criminal procedure.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 577. This reinforces the idea that the appellate courts of this state must remain vigilant to developments in this field of inquiry by engaging in careful study of the scientific literature.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further developments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>may require the exercise of supervisory authority. Until that time, each challenge to an identification procedure must be addressed in accordance with our well established rule requiring that atrial court conduct a factually intensive inquiry, focusing on the totality of the circumstances, to determine whether the procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, and, if so, whether the identification was nevertheless rehable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-10\"> When the court speaks in multiple voices rather than a single voice, the usefulness of the decision, apart from deciding the particular case, is limited. Even though all of the opinions in this case are in accord as to affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, each opinion reaches the result by a different route.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> Although the studies are mixed as to the benefits of simultaneous and sequential procedures under varying circumstances, there is no research literature that supports the use of an interested administrator. No matter how expedient it may be for law enforcement agencies to use interested investigators in this role, that practice imperils the integrity of the identifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\"> In any event, I disagree with Justice Katz\u2019 conclusion that the trial court did <em>not </em>abuse its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\"> disagree with Justice Palmer\u2019s conclusion in his concurring opinion that the detective\u2019s remark rendered the procedure unnecessarily suggestive. When the detective made the remark, Clement already had identified the defendant, without any information as to the result of the other witness\u2019 identification. Although it is possible that the detective\u2019s remark may have bolstered Clement\u2019s confidence in the accuracy of his identification of the defendant during testimony at trial, that possibility properly would be raised during cross-examination of Clement, and used to impeach his testimony, rather than to render the identification inadmissible. As the majority opinion notes, the rationale offered to support that conclusion has the effect of improperly shifting the focus of attention from the impact of police conduct on the pretrial identification to the impact of the pretrial identification on the in-court identification. Moreover, it unnecessarily causes potential confusion about the <em>boundary </em>of the police identification procedure, a factor that is not an issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\"> The trial court also stated in its memorandum of decision that \u201c[p]olice personnel conducting photographic identifications should henceforth strive to eliminate the danger of misidentification arising from the simultaneous showing of multiple photographs by making all such showing sequentially.\u201d The majority opinion characterizes this statement as a directive. My reading of the statement, however, is that, while it <em>could </em>be read to issue a directive to police personnel, it need not be accorded that meaning. It is possible to interpret this statement as the court merely indicating its opinion as to what procedures would be most prudent for police personnel to employ. To the extent, however, that the statement <em>could </em>be read to issue a directive to police personnel, it would, of course, exceed the authority of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"> The <em>Ledbetter </em>opinion has been criticized for failing to give appropriate effect to the evidence of scientific studies that question the reliability of eyewitness identification.
