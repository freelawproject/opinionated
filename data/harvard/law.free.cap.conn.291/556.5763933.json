The state appeals <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court dismissing juvenile delinquency proceedings brought against the respondent, Juan L., on the ground that he was not competent to stand trial, and that \u00a7 54-56d (m) did not apply in this case. Because we conclude that \u00a7 54-56d (m) applies to juvenile matters delinquency proceedings, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The respondent was bom on May 3, 1992. The state charged him with sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a, risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21, and unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95, in connection with an incident that had occurred on or about April 15, 2007, in which he allegedly had engaged in sexual contact with an eight year old male child. The respondent moved pursuant to \u00a7 54-56d (c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for a determination of his competency to stand trial. Noting that the court had found the respondent not competent to stand trial on similar charges that had been filed two years earlier,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court granted his motion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ordered further evaluation to determine whether there had been any changes to his mental status. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (d). <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following an evaluation by Sarah Xavier, a psychiatrist, the trial court held a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 54-56d (e),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and found that the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>had proven by a preponderance of the evidence; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (b);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that he was not competent to stand trial, and that there was \u201cno substantial probability that [the respondent] will regain competence [within the] maximum period allowed by the law.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (f) and (g).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court then continued the matter for ninety days so that the department of children and families and the department of mental retardation<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> could create a final plan for supervising and treating the respondent, who remained on release, but under continuous supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Thereafter, the trial court raised the question of whether it had authority under \u00a7 54-56d (m) to transfer the respondent to the custody of the department of mental retardation or the department of children and families. After hearing argument, the court concluded that \u00a7 54-56d (m) did not apply to delinquency proceedings because it does not contain the word \u201cjuvenile,\u201d and references to the department of children and families therein pertained to persons whose cases are han-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>died by the adult criminal courts, but nevertheless remain under that department\u2019s statutory jurisdiction. The trial court noted that the only provision relating specifically to competency determinations in juvenile matters proceedings is Practice Book (2007) \u00a7 31a-14,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which does not set forth a procedure for resolving the case of ajuvenile who has been found to be incompetent and nonrestorable. The trial court then concluded that, \u201csince [the respondent] is incompetent, not restorable, and the likelihood that even with services, of that ever changing, it would not be in his best interest to proceed with a delinquency matter at this time.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the delinquency proceedings. This appeal followed. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On appeal, the state claims that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 54-56d (m) does not apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings, and therefore, it did not have the authority under that statute to transfer the respondent to the custody of the department of children and families or the department of mental retardation. Specifically, the state argues that the word \u201cdefendant\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>in \u00a7 54-56d (m) includes respondents in juvenile delinquency proceedings because it is a \u201cbroad, generic term that does not denote only adult criminal defendants,\u201d and the commitment statutes cross-referenced by \u00a7 54-56d (m), particularly with respect to the department of children and families, are applicable only to juveniles. Finally, the state notes the relevant legislative history and long-standing juvenile matters practice, and contends that, because juveniles have the same constitutional rights as adults with respect to competency to stand trial in delinquency proceedings, which are quasi-criminal in nature,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> construing \u00a7 54-56d (m) to apply only in adult criminal court would leave courts without a procedure to aid, and to prevent from reoffending, juveniles who are incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In response, the respondent claims that the trial court properly dismissed the case because \u00a7 54-56d (m) clearly and unambiguously does not apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings. The respondent argues specifically that \u00a7 54-56d is a rule of criminal procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>that is not included within the separate statutory scheme that governs the more flexible juvenile matters courts. The respondent emphasizes that, under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (6),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> juvenile delinquency proceedings are fundamentally different from criminal proceedings because they encompass violations of municipal or local ordinances, in addition to federal and state laws, and do not include the offense classifications and mandatory minimum sentences that are applicable in criminal proceedings. The respondent further argues that the references to the department of children and families in \u00a7 54-56d (m) do not mean that the statute must apply to juvenile delinquency respondents, but rather, refer to incompetent, nonrestorable defendants in adult criminal proceedings who remain under that department\u2019s jurisdiction under General Statutes \u00a7 17a-3 (a),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> namely, \u201c \u2018[y]outh[s]\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 17a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>1 (6);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or juveniles whose cases are transferred to the adult criminal docket for prosecution under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, the respondent contends that, even if \u00a7 54-56d is held inapplicable to juvenile matters proceedings, the court still has remedies to address an incompetent, nonrestorable child, namely: (1) referral to the appropriate Probate Court under General Statutes \u00a7 17a-76 et seq. to determine whether he should be committed civilly as a danger to himself or others; or (2) an order issued, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to the department of children and fami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>lies to investigate whether the respondent is a child who is abused, neglected or has unmet special needs. We agree with the state, and conclude that \u00a7 54-56d (m) applies in delinquency proceedings in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cThe issue in this case . . . raises a question of statutory construction, which is a [question] of law, over which we exercise plenary review. . . . The process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable inteipretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsh &amp; McLennan </em>Cos., 286 Conn. 454, 464-65, 944 A.2d 315 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We begin with the language of \u00a7 54-56d (m), the subsection directly at issue in this appeal. Section 54-56d (m) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf at any time the court determines that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period of treatment allowed by this section, or if at the end of such period the court finds that the defendant is still not competent, the court shall consider any recommendation made by the examiners pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and any opinion submitted by the treatment facility pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subsection (j) of this section regarding eligibility for, and the appropriateness of, civil commitment to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities and shall either release the defendant from custody or order the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services, the commissioner given custody, or the commissioner\u2019s designee, shall then apply for civil commitment in accordance with sections 17a-75 to 17a-83, inclusive, or 17a-270 to 17a-282, inclusive. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>court shall hear arguments as to whether the defendant should be released or should be placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services. If the court orders the release of a defendant charged with the commission of a crime that resulted in the death or serious physical injury, as defined in section 53a-3, of another person, or orders the placement of such defendant in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the court may, on its own motion or on motion of the prosecuting authority, order, as a condition of such release or placement, periodic examinations of the defendant as to the defendant\u2019s competency. ... A defendant who is not civilly committed as a result of an application made by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services pursuant to this section shall be released. A defendant who is civilly committed pursuant to such an application shall be treated in the same manner as any other civilly committed person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The question in this appeal is whether a respondent in a juvenile delinquency proceeding is a \u201cdefendant\u201d who is subject to \u00a7 54-56d (m). The term \u201cdefendant\u201d is not defined by the juvenile matters statutes contained in chapter 815t of the General Statutes, or by the criminal procedure statutes contained in chapters 959 and 960 of the General Statutes, or within the specific confines of \u00a7 54-56d. Thus, \u201c[ujnder the rules of statutory construction . . . words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language .... If a statute or regulation does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>283 Conn. 644, 656, 931 A.2d 142 (2007). The dictionary defines \u201cdefendant\u201d as \u201ca person required to make answer in a legal action or suit . . . .\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 2001); see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) (defining \u201cdefendant\u201d as \u201c[a] person sued in a civil proceeding or accused in a criminal proceeding\u201d). Although a respondent in a juvenile delinquency proceeding clearly is \u201ca person required to make answer in a legal action\u201d; Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 2001); the \u201ctest to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, <em>when read in context, </em>is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., </em>supra, 286 Conn. 464-65. Thus, we note that the remainder of the language of \u00a7 54-56d (m) supports the state\u2019s reading of the statute, particularly the court\u2019s authority to order the defendant placed in the custody of the department of children and families, with a directive to the \u201ccommissioner ... or the commissioner\u2019s designee . . . [then to] apply for civil commitment in accordance with sections 17a-75 to 17a-83, inclusive . . . .\u201d Indeed, the cross-reference to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-75 through 17a-83, which govern the commitment of a mentally ill <em>child, </em>defined thereunder as \u201cany person less than sixteen years of age\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-75; further indicates that the legislature intended \u00a7 54-56d (m) to apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings because the age limitation set forth in those statutes is exactly the same as that contained in the General Statutes pertaining to the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-120 (1) and 46b-121 (a); see also footnotes 12 and 16 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">This statutory language is not, however, clear and unambiguous when viewed in the complete context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the \u201cunambiguous statutory framework\u201d providing that criminal and juvenile proceedings are governed by separate procedures, which \u201ccounsels against interpolating into our juvenile justice system a single statute from the laws governing adult criminal procedures.\u201d <em>In re Prudencio </em>O., 229 Conn. 691, 698, 643 A.2d 265 (1994); see id., 699-701 (sixty day period for provision of probable cause hearing under General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a is not applicable to juvenile proceedings, and begins to run only when case is transferred to adult criminal docket); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>263 Conn. 1, 13, 818 A.2d 1 (2003) (\u201cit is axiomatic that delinquency proceedings in juvenile court are fundamentally different from criminal proceedings\u201d); <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>140 Conn. 650, 665-66, 103 A.2d 535 (1954) (considering specific placement of statute in codification as indicative of legislative intent). Thus, given the respondent\u2019s explanation for the references in \u00a7 54-56d (m) to the department of children and families, we conclude that the statute is ambiguous, which permits us to consider extratextual sources in its construction.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">A review of the legislative history with respect to the amendment of \u00a7 54-56d, and specifically subsection (m), to include references to the department of children and families<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> eliminates any doubt that the legislature intended the statute to apply in juvenile delinquency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>proceedings. First, we note that Public Acts 1983, No. 83-183, \u00a7 4, which amended \u00a7 54-56d (m) to involve the department of children and families in these proceedings, was entitled: \u201cAn Act Concerning Juvenile Competency to Stand Trial.\u201d This is significant, as \u201c[t]he title of legislation when it is acted upon by the legislature is significant and often a valuable aid to construction . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pondi-Salik, </em>262 Conn. 746, 755, 817 A.2d 663 (2003); id. (noting that General Statutes \u00a7 5-192p pertaining to state employees retirement system \u201chas since been amended twice and the titles of the amending bills further reflect that the legislature considered this statute part of a retirement scheme\u201d); see also <em>Small </em>v. <em>Going Forward, Inc., </em>281 Conn. 417, 425-26 n.5, 915 A.2d 298 (2007) (noting that title of public act may be considered, but that statute\u2019s \u201cboldface catchline . . . is not an appropriate tool for the construction of a statute\u201d because it is prepared by revisors of General Statutes for readers\u2019 convenience).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Second, the legislative history of Public Act 83-183 indicates that it was enacted to fill a procedural void that earlier revisions of \u00a7 54-56d had left with respect to juvenile matters proceedings. Attorney Patricia DeNuzze, a juvenile matters public defender, testified before the judiciary committee in support of the bill enacted as Public Act 83-183, and emphasized that the \u201cpurpose of this bill is to provide a procedure for <em>determining [the] competency of the juvenile </em>to stand trial and I want to just emphasize to provide a procedure. <em>There is no procedure now and, as a result, there\u2019s often a jurisdictional gap </em>and other abuses seem to flow from that, both the [c]ourt and the lawyers and the children in the [c]ourts are looking for some sort of guidance as to a standard to determine whether or not a child should be found competent or incompetent to stand trial and to <em>provide a .. . clear reliable mech</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>anism to get that child some services.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2,1983 Sess., p. 408. Attorney DeNuzze\u2019s testimony is significant because \u201c[i]t is now well settled that testimony before legislative committees may be considered in determining the particular problem or issue that the legislature sought to address by the legislation.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jim\u2019s Auto Body </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>285 Conn. 794, 812, 942 A.2d 305 (2008). Thus, the legislative history demonstrates that the legislature intended for the amendments to \u00a7 54-56d, including subsection (m), to fill a statutory gap, namely, the lack of a procedure to address competency issues arising in juvenile matters court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Finally, the application of \u00a7 54-56d (m) in juvenile matters proceedings is consistent with the public policy expressed by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121h,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201cthat the juvenile justice system provide individualized supervision, care, <em>accountability and treatment in a manner consistent with public safety </em>to those juveniles who violate the law. The juvenile justice system shall also promote prevention efforts through the support of programs and services designed to meet the needs of juveniles charged with the commission of a delinquent act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Indeed, the legislature has further emphasized that it is a goal of the juvenile justice system to \u201c[pjrovide secure and therapeutic confinement to those juveniles who present a danger to the community\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121h (2); and to \u201c[adequately protect the community and juveniles . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121h (3). A conclusion that the assessment and commitment mechanisms of \u00a7 54-56d apply in juvenile matters proceedings certainly is consistent with the legislature\u2019s vision for a juvenile justice system that encompasses the continued monitoring and treatment of juveniles who appear to pose a risk to themselves or their communities, but are incompetent to stand trial.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the relevant provisions of \u00a7 54-56d, and particularly subsection (m), govern competency questions arising in juvenile matters proceedings. We, therefore, agree with the state that the trial court improperly dismissed this case, rather than conducting a disposition hearing pursuant to \u00a7 54-56d (m).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (m) provides: \u201cIf at any time the court determines that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period of treatment allowed by this section, or if at the end of such period the court finds that the defendant is still not competent, the court shall consider any recommendation made by the examiners pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and any opinion submitted by the treatment facility pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subsection Q) of this section regarding eligibility for, and the appropriateness of, civil commitment to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities and shall either release the defendant from custody or order the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services, the commissioner given custody, or the commissioner\u2019s designee, shall then apply for civil commitment in accordance with sections 17a-75 to 17a-83, inclusive, or 17a-270 to 17a-282, inclusive. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the court may order the commissioner, or the commissioner\u2019s designee, to apply for civil commitment in accordance with sections 17a-495 to 17a-528, inclusive, or order the commissioner, or the commissioner\u2019s designee, to provide services to the defendant in a less restrictive setting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>provided the examiners have determined in the written report filed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section or have testified pursuant to subsection (e) of this section that such services are available and appropriate.

If the court orders the release of a defendant charged with the commission of a crime that resulted in the death or serious physical injury, as defined in section 53a-3, of another person, or orders the placement of such defendant in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the court may, on its own motion or on motion of the prosecuting authority, order, as a condition of such release or placement, periodic examinations of the defendant as to the defendant\u2019s competency. Such an examination shall be conducted in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. Upon receipt of the written report as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the court shall, upon the request of either party filed not later than thirty days after the court receives such report, conduct a hearing as provided in subsection (e) of this section. Such hearing shall be held not later than ninety days after the court receives such report. If the court finds that the defendant has attained competency, the defendant shall be returned to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction or released, if the defendant has met the conditions for release, and the court shall continue with the criminal proceedings. Periodic examinations ordered by the court under this subsection shall continue until the court finds that the defendant has attained competency or until the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, as provided in section 54-193 or 54-193a, has expired, whichever occurs first. The court shall dismiss, with or without prejudice, any charges for which a nolle prosequi is not entered when the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, as provided in section 54-193 or 54-193a, has expired.

See General Statutes \u00a7 46b~120 (10) (\u201ca child or youth may be found \u2018uncared for\u2019 who is homeless or whose home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>cannot provide the specialized care that the physical, emotional or mental condition of the child requires\u201d). Indeed, the respondent notes that, in the present case, such proceedings presently are underway, as the trial court has appointed a guardian ad litem and neglect petitions were filed on the civil docket of the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters. Although the respondent\u2019s representations regarding the status of his civil proceedings are somewhat reassuring, we nevertheless conclude the goals of the juvenile justice system are best effectuated by our conclusion that the orderly procedure set forth in \u00a7 54-56d applies to juvenile matters delinquency cases that raise competency issues. This conclusion gives the court greater immediate control over the disposition of an incompetent, and potentially dangerous, juvenile; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (m) (granting court authority to place juvenile in custody of commissioner of children and families, who <em>\u201cshall </em>then apply for civil commitment\u201d [emphasis added]); and also provides options for the court to order the supervision and continued treatment of a juvenile charged with a crime resulting in death or serious bodily irqury who has been released.
