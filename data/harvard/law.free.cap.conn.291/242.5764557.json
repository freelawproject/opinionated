The plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) their challenge to the board\u2019s summary suspensions had been rendered moot; (2) the board had not abused its discretion or otherwise acted unlawfully in the procedures leading to the revocation of the license and certificate; and (3) the board had not abused its discretion in imposing the penalties of revocation and an excessive fine. We conclude that the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal and, therefore, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The record discloses the following undisputed facts and procedural history. At all relevant times prior to November 15,2005, Moraski held an embaimer\u2019s license and both owned and operated Colonial, which held a certificate that permitted it to operate its business in Hamden. On November 15, 2005, based on allegations of misconduct in connection with the funeral of Robert Foley, the department of public health (department), pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-182 (c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 19a-17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>(c), <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed motions, along with supporting affidavits, seeking summary suspension of Moraski\u2019s license and Colonial\u2019s certificate on the ground that their \u201ccontinued practice . . . represents a clear and immediate danger to the public health and safety.\u201d The department also filed a statement of charges against each plaintiff, alleging violations of General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 7-65<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>62b,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 7-64,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 20-230a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 20-230b,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and claiming that these violations constituted grounds for disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 20-227, including but not limited to subdivisions (2), (4) and (5).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>same day, the board issued orders summarily suspending the license and certificate, to be effective pending a final determination regarding the allegations contained in the statement of charges. The board therein scheduled a hearing for November 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">On November 23, 2005, the department filed motions to amend the statements of charges to add allegations involving a new out-of-state witness, to which the plaintiffs objected on the ground that they would not be able to subpoena this witness. On November 29, 2005, the day hearings commenced, the board granted the motions to amend with the stipulation that, should the witness involved not return if requested by the plaintiffs, his or her testimony would be stricken from the record. That same day, the department requested permission to file second amended statements of the charges to add a second count concerning Moraski\u2019s alleged misconduct with regard to the funeral of another decedent, Judith Jimenez. Over the plaintiffs\u2019 objection, the board thereafter granted the request, with the caveat that the new allegations would be heard at a later date to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to prepare a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Broadly characterized, the department alleged in the statements of charges as to both funerals that Moraski had failed to give the decedents\u2019 relatives a signed statement of goods and services provided and had engaged in verbally abusive behavior toward the decedents\u2019 families when they attempted to resolve the disposition of their loved ones\u2019 remains. With respect to Foley specifically, the department alleged, inter alia, that the plaintiffs had: refused to release his remains to another funeral director for burial, failed to cremate his corpse in a timely fashion; stored his unrefrigerated remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>outside the embalming room such that the storage constituted a public health risk; and misled and abused his family members when they asked for his corpse or cremains.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The board commenced hearing evidence on the first count pertaining to Foley on November 29, 2005. The board thereafter continued hearing evidence on both counts over the course of several months, specifically, on January 10, January 24, February 27, March 7 and April 11, 2006. In written decisions dated September 12,2006, the board concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 actions with respect to the handling of the Foley and Jimenez funerals constituted grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to \u00a7 20-227 (2), (4) and (5). In a comprehensive twenty page decision, the board set forth each of the department\u2019s allegations, cited evidence relevant to each allegation and made findings of fact and conclusions of law relevant to each of the charges. When there was conflicting testimony between Moraski and the department\u2019s witnesses, the board consistently found the department\u2019s witnesses to be more credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Specifically, with respect to the handling of Foley\u2019s remains and funeral, the board found that the plaintiffs had not given the family members an itemized price list and the method of payment required for the services actually selected, as required by statute. The board found that, although the plaintiffs were required by statute to have buried or cremated the decedent\u2019s remains within a reasonable time after death pursuant to \u00a7 7-64, the plaintiffs had not had the decedent\u2019s remains cremated, but left them instead unrefrigerated in Colonial\u2019s basement for forty-nine days after his death, such that the odor of decomposition was present in the garage of the building. The board credited testimony that the plaintiffs had demanded cash payment and had refused to release Foley\u2019s body to Graham, Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors of Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>(Graham) for burial in that state until such payment was provided. The board further concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to obtain a burial transit removal permit and a death certificate within the five day period prescribed by statute. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 7-65 and General Statutes \u00a7 7-62b (a). It determined that the plaintiffs had failed to comply both with Probate Court orders regarding the filing of the cremation certificate and with the proper preparation of the cremains. The board also credited the testimony of Foley\u2019s mother and his former wife, both of whom were involved in the funeral arrangements, that Moraski had yelled at them and called them insulting names, specifically, that Moraski had called Judith Sullivan, Foley\u2019s mother, a \u201cscam artist,\u201d a \u201cpsycho case,\u201d a \u201cbitch\u201d a \u201ccon-artist\u201d and a \u201cshyster,\u201d and had called Lori Foley, the decedent\u2019s former wife, a \u201cbitch\u201d and an \u201casshole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The board did find, however, that the department had not met its burden of proof with respect to all of its allegations regarding Foley\u2019s remains. Most significant was the allegation that the storage of Foley\u2019s unrefrigerated remains had constituted a public health risk and hazard, which the board rejected because expert testimony had established that, despite improper storage, the storage of the body in a polyethylene bag eliminated any possibility of direct physical contact between the body and the food or water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">With respect to the second count of the statement of charges, pertaining to Jimenez, the board made the following findings. In February, 2005, Jimenez died in Florida. Jimenez\u2019 daughter, Carmen Torres, authorized Moraski to transfer her mother\u2019s body from Florida to Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks and met with Moraski to make funeral arrangements. Moraski failed to give Torres either a general price list itemizing the prices of all available goods and services or a written statement itemizing the prices of the services and mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>chandise that she had selected. Shortly thereafter, Torres retained Washington Memorial Funeral Home (Washington) to handle Jimenez\u2019 funeral and authorized it to remove Jimenez\u2019 remains from Colonial. John Iaco-bucci of Washington immediately informed Colonial that Torres had retained Washington and that calling hours would be the following evening. Moraski then contacted Torres, demanded that she meet with him alone and told her that he would not release her mother\u2019s remains from Bradley International Airport unless she paid him $350. At some point during these negotiations, Moraski stated to Torres \u201c \u2018why are you fucking calling me if you don\u2019t have the money\u2019 \u201d and yelled at Iacobucci to get \u201c \u2018the fuck off his property\u2019 \u201d when Iacobucci came to retrieve Jimenez\u2019 body.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">On the basis of these previous findings, the board concluded that the plaintiffs had violated \u00a7\u00a7 7-62b, 7-64, 7-65,20-230a and 20-230b, and that license and certificate revocation and a $50,000 civil penalty were warranted under \u00a7 \u00a7 19a-17 and 20-227. The board concluded that revocation of Moraski\u2019s license and Colonial\u2019s certificate was appropriate in light of their \u201cblatant disregard for the laws governing [funeral homes] funeral directors and embalmers in Connecticut, the lack of respect [they] demonstrated toward [their] clients and the deceased, and the potential danger [Moraski individually and as Colonial\u2019s manager] posed to the general public . . . .\u201d Moreover, because of the egregiousness of Moraski\u2019s conduct and the nature of the violations, the board found that a significant civil penalty was fully supported by the record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Claiming bias and procedural impropriety, the plaintiffs jointly appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), challenging both the summary suspension and the permanent revocation and fine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After briefing and oral argument, the trial court dismissed the appeal. The trial court determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the summary suspension was unlawful was moot because the revocation of Moraski\u2019s license and Colonial\u2019s certificate had superseded the suspension. The court further concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to substantiate the grounds for their appeal of the license and certificate revocations and the fine imposition. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The plaintiffs raise five claims. They first assert that the trial court improperly dismissed their appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the summary suspension of the license and certificate. Next, they claim that the trial court improperly rejected: their challenge to the board\u2019s decisions allowing the department to amend the charges against them; their contention that board members were biased; and their claim that certain findings of fact by the board were clearly erroneous. Finally, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the board did not abuse its discretion in imposing a substantial fine and revoking Moraski\u2019s license and Colonial\u2019s certificate. We reject all the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The first issue is whether the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the board\u2019s summary suspensions of their license and certificate. Because the board thereafter permanently revoked the plaintiffs\u2019 license and certificate, the trial court determined that there was no practical relief available to them, and, accordingly, their appeal from the summary suspensions was moot. The plaintiffs claim that, because the board is authorized by statute to suspend summarily a practitioner\u2019s license only if it \u201cfinds that a practitioner . . . represents a clear and immediate danger to the public health and safety if he is allowed to continue to practice\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17 (c); due process required a hearing to make such a finding before suspension. Because the board failed to hold a hearing to make such findings, and therefore unlawfully deprived the plaintiffs of their property interest in the continued practice of the profession and business, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court\u2019s dismissal was improper. The board responds that revocation of the plaintiffs\u2019 license and certificate after an evidentiary hearing superseded the summary suspensions and rendered moot the propriety of the suspensions because no practical relief could follow from a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>reversing the summary suspensions. We agree with the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We readily can resolve the issue of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is moot, beginning with the fundamental principles that underlie justiciability. \u201cBecause courts are established to resolve actual controversies, before a claimed controversy is entitled to a resolution on the merits it must be justiciable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 111, 445 A.2d 304 (1982). \u201cJusticiability requires (1) that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute ... (2) that the interests of the parties be adverse ... (3) that the matter in controversy be capable of being adjudicated by judicial power . . . and (4) that the determination of the controversy will result in practical relief to the complainant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Education </em>v. Naugatuck, 257 Conn. 409, 416, 778 A.2d 862 (2001). A case is considered moot if an appellate court cannot grant the appellant \u201cany practical relief through its disposition of the merits . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Commission, </em>284 Conn. 268, 279, 933 A.2d 256 (2007); see <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Region One Board of Education, </em>261 Conn. 475, 481, 803 A.2d 318 (2002). \u201cMootness implicates this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, raising a question of law over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Commission, </em>supra, 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In the present case, when asked directly by the trial court what relief it could afford the plaintiffs given that the summary suspensions were followed by permanent revocation prior to which the plaintiffs did receive a hearing, the plaintiffs simply reasserted their contention that they should have been given a hearing prior to the suspensions. Thus, even had the plaintiffs succeeded in demonstrating that the summary suspensions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>were unlawful, there would have been no practical relief that they could have achieved as a result. The suspension was superseded by the revocation; see <em>In re Michael A., </em>47 Conn. App. 105, 108, 703 A.2d 1146 (1997) (\u201cany issues involving the order of temporary custody are now moot because that order was subsumed by the permanent order\u201d); and no relief could have been afforded from any procedural deficiencies in the former proceedings. See <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>227 Conn. 829, 837-38 n.13, 633 A.2d 296 (1993) (expired suspension not moot only because of collateral consequences); <em>Schallenkamp </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>29 Conn. App. 576, 579, 616 A.2d 1157 (1992) (expired suspension not moot only because it falls within \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception), aff'd, 229 Conn. 31, 639 A.2d 1018 (1994); <em>Dragan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>24 Conn. App. 662, 669, 591 A.2d 150 (1991) (challenges to procedures attendant to consent order permitting plaintiff to continue medical practice while license suspension held in abeyance pending resolution of criminal action against plaintiff was rendered moot because period of abeyance ended and medical examining board rendered final judgment revoking license), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 223 Conn. 618, 613 A.2d 739 (1992); see also <em>Marilyn T., Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>803 F.2d 1383, 1384 (5th Cir. 1986) (holding that plaintiffs appeal from denial of preliminary injunctive relief against suspension of commercial lessor\u2019s license on ground that procedural due process had not been afforded was rendered moot once license permanently was revoked; noting that plaintiff still could pursue constitutional claim in pending action for damages); <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Dept. of Registration &amp; Education, </em>103 Ill. App. 3d 654, 662, 431 N.E.2d 1112 (1981) (concluding that plaintiff pharmacists\u2019 contention that summary suspension procedures violated their right to due process was moot because plaintiffs received notice and hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>administrative complaint that resulted in license revocation); <em>Oglesby </em>v. <em>Toledo, </em>92 Ohio App. 3d 432, 437 n.1, 635 N.E.2d 1319 (1993) (appellants\u2019 procedural due process arguments arising from manner in which their massage technician\u2019s and establishment operator\u2019s licenses were suspended rendered moot by subsequent revocation of licenses because, even \u201c[i]f this court found error in the procedure for suspension, no relief would be available in this procedural context\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly dismissed the appeal from the summary suspensions as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Next, the plaintiffs assert that the trial court improperly rejected their challenges to the revocation hearing, specifically, that the board had acted improperly: by allowing the department to amend the statement of charges, by acting with bias and by finding facts that were clearly erroneous. We begin with the appropriate standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">As we previously have noted herein; see footnote 10 of this opinion; the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is taken pursuant to the UAPA, General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq. \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the [UAPA] establishes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>restricted scope of judicial review of the [board\u2019s] final decision and order. . . . [The] plaintiff has the burden of proving that the [board], on the facts before [it], acted contrary to law and in abuse of [its] discretion .... The law is also well established that if the decision of the [board] is reasonably supported by the evidence it must be sustained.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>American Car Rental, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Consumer Protection, </em>273 Conn. 296, 307-308, 869 A.2d 1198 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The plaintiffs claim that the board acted improperly by allowing the department to amend the statement of charges. Specifically, they contend that allowing the department twice to amend the statement of charges constituted an abuse of discretion because the amendments caused them unfair surprise and denied them the right of cross-examination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The record reflects the following procedural history. With respect to the first amendment, on November 23, 2005, the department filed motions seeking to amend the statement of charges in each case to add allegations involving a new out-of-state witness. The witness was identified as Peter Stefan, a licensed embalmer at Graham, a funeral home in Massachusetts. The board granted that motion with the stipulation that, if the witness involved did not return if requested by the plaintiffs, his testimony would be stricken from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">On November 29, 2005, the first day of the hearings, Stefan testified on direct examination that, pursuant to Sullivan\u2019s request, he had contacted Moraski to discuss the transfer of Foley\u2019s remains to Graham. On January 10, 2006, Stefan returned to court, and the plaintiffs cross-examined him. On the basis of Stefan\u2019s testimony, the board found that the plaintiffs had refused to release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Foley\u2019s remains to Graham prior to receiving payment for goods and services they had provided for Foley.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">With respect to the second amendment, on November 29, 2005, the department presented motions to amend the statements of charges, specifically, to add a second count pertaining to Jimenez\u2019 funeral. The department stated that it was \u201casking to include that [count] in this hearing process but not today because it would obviously be unfair to expect the [plaintiffs] to be able to respond to something that they simply have been presented [with] this morning.\u201d The department explained to the board that, because the allegations regarding Jimenez\u2019 family had some similarities with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 treatment of Foley\u2019s family, the department thought it would be a better use of the board\u2019s time to consider the counts together. The plaintiffs responded that bringing this additional matter forward was \u201cfundamentally unfair and prejudicial to [their] case . . . .\u201d The board decided that the new information would not be addressed at that time to allow both the plaintiffs and the board the opportunity to examine it.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Before the hearings proceeded on January 10, 2006, the plaintiffs expressed some confusion as to whether the board had rendered a decision on whether to allow the second amendment. After the board confirmed that it had granted the motions, the chairperson of the board twice offered to wait until January 24 to go forward with the witnesses in connection with the Jimenez matter. The plaintiffs declined to delay the matter, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. We can proceed.\u201d As we previously noted, the hearings thereafter continued on January 24, February 27, March 7, and April 11, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">This court previously has explained in an analogous context that the scope of our review of a decision to allow an amendment is limited. As with our review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>a trial court\u2019s decision to allow the amendment of a complaint, \u201c[factors to be considered in passing on a motion to amend are the length of the delay, fairness to the opposing parties and the negligence, if any, of the party offering the amendment. . . . The motion to amend is addressed to the trial court\u2019s discretion which may be exercised to restrain the amendment of pleadings so far as necessary to prevent unreasonable delay of the trial. . . . Whether to allow an amendment is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. This court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling on a proposed amendment unless there has been a clear abuse of that discretion. ... It is the [opponent\u2019s] burden in this case to demonstrate that the trial court clearly abused its discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>259 Conn. 114, 128, 788 A.2d 83 (2002). \u201cIf an amendment is allowed at trial and the opponent wants to raise an abuse of discretion issue on appeal, he should immediately move for a continuance in the trial in order to defend against the new issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dow &amp; Condon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brookfield Development Corp., </em>266 Conn. 572, 584, 833 A.2d 908 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Because the plaintiffs failed to move for a continuance, and indeed declined an offer to delay hearing evidence on certain charges, we reject their unspecified prejudice claim out of hand.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, in connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tion with their claim regarding their inability to cross-examine Stefan, the plaintiffs did have an opportunity to cross-examine him when he returned to court. Therefore, any claim that the plaintiffs were deprived of this right is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The plaintiffs also claim that their due process rights were impaired by bias of the board\u2019s individual members. Specifically, they claim that, because board members also are directors of funeral parlors in Connecticut, and in some cases in the same geographic region as the plaintiffs, the board members necessarily will gain from eliminating the plaintiffs as competitors. As evidence of the board members\u2019 bias, the plaintiffs point to various findings and credibility assessments with which they disagree. Finally, they claim that the board\u2019s summary suspension reflects that the board had prejudged the charges against the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In response, the board contends that the status of some of its members as competitors is not enough to establish actual bias, as is required, and that the evidence cited by the plaintiffs does not reflect such bias. The board further contends that the plaintiffs waived this claim by failing to raise it at the hearing before the board and to ask for the recusal of the allegedly biased board members. Although we are mindful that the trial court overlooked the board\u2019s waiver argument and reached this issue on the merits, we agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>board that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to raise this claim before the board precludes our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We begin with certain established principles. \u201cThe applicable due process standards for disqualification of administrative adjudicators do not rise to the heights of those prescribed for judicial disqualification. . . . The mere appearance of bias that might disqualify a judge will not disqualify an arbitrator. . . . Moreover, there is a presumption that administrative board members acting in an adjudicative capacity are not biased. ... To overcome the presumption, the plaintiff . . . must demonstrate actual bias, rather than mere potential bias, of the board members challenged, unless the circumstances indicate a probability of such bias too high to be constitutionally tolerable. . . . The plaintiff has the burden of establishing a disqualifying interest.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Clisham </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>223 Conn. 354, 361-62, 613 A.2d 254 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u201cA claim of bias must be raised in a timely manner. The failure to raise a claim of disqualification with reasonable promptness after learning the ground for such a claim ordinarily constitutes a waiver thereof. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>[Dept.] of Motor Vehicles, </em>202 Conn. 453, 462, 521 A.2d 1040 (1987). One court has noted that a challenge to a judge for bias and prejudice must be made at the first opportunity after discovery of the facts tending to prove disqualification. ...

Thus, the plaintiffs in the present case have failed to undertake the steps necessary to have this court review their bias claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the board\u2019s determinations of fact were clearly erroneous \u201cin view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record, or arbitrary or capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or a clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\u201d \u201cIn determining whether an administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence, the reviewing court must defer to the agency\u2019s assessment of the credibility of witnesses. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>reviewing court must take into account contradictory evidence in the record . . . but the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>228 Conn. 651, 668, 638 A. 2d 6 (1994). Upon our thorough review of the record, guided by the board\u2019s comprehensive recitation of the evidence supporting each of the findings of fact and by its well founded determination of numerous statutory violations, we are convinced that the trial court correctly determined that the board acted properly. See <em>American Car Rental, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Consumer Protection, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 308 (\u201c[a]n administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In their final claim, the plaintiffs assert that the trial court improperly rejected their contention that the board abused its discretion in imposing the penalties in this case, namely, revoking their licenses and assessing a $50,000 fine. Harkening back to their other claims of bias and prejudice, they claim that \u201c[t]he intent of this punishment is to ruin, rather than correct.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 claim lacks merit in light of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Under the well established standard of review, \u201c[i]f the penalty meted out is within the limits prescribed by law, the matter lies within the exercise of the [board\u2019s] discretion and cannot be successfully challenged unless the discretion has been abused. . . . Sentencing is an inherently fact bound inquiry. In an administrative appeal, a reviewing court can do no more, on the factual questions presented, than to examine the record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>determine whether the ultimate findings were supported, as the statute requires, by substantial evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Pet v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 677-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The board is authorized under \u00a7 20-227; see footnote 8 of this opinion; to take any disciplinary action set forth in General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 19a-17<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>license holder acts negligently, incompetently or wrongfully in the conduct of his profession. Our task is not to second-guess the agency\u2019s choice of sanction. We look to whether evidence existed that gave the agency the discretion to impose the penalty of revocation and we will not restrict the deference we are statutorily bound to give administrative decisions in the absence of statutory authority. We previously concluded that the board acted within the scope of its discretion in finding the facts it relied upon to impose the fine and to revoke the license and certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Mindful of the board\u2019s purpose of protecting the public\u2019s interest in proper funeral, burial and embalming services, we cannot conclude that the board exceeded its authority or abused its discretion in revoking the plaintiffs\u2019 license and certificate. In the analogous context of reviewing a board of education\u2019s exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>discretion in terminating a teacher\u2019s contract following one incident of misconduct, we affirmed that board\u2019s decision, noting that \u201c[w]hether termination is justifiable on the basis of a single incident is a qualitative not quantitative analysis; one serious incident can suffice.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>252 Com. 753, 771, 749 A.2d 1173 (2000). In the present case, the board found that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201crepeated and systematic failure to comply with . . . statutory requirements . . . demonstrated a complete disregard and lack of respect for the law, [their] clients, and the general public.\u2019\u2019The facts clearly support this assessment. The board\u2019s decision as to which penalty to assess does not appear to rest on any one particular finding, but on the cumulative effect of all of the board\u2019s findings. See footnote 9 of this opinion. The board was free to find, on the evidence presented, that the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct betrayed the trust that is reposed in them as a licensed embalmer or funeral home operator and compromised the integrity of their profession. The legislature vested in the board the power to evaluate the competency of embalmers and funeral directors in this state and to adjudicate complaints and impose proper sanctions when warranted. The board found that the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct deviated from the standard of care to such an extent that it warranted the revocation of Moraski\u2019s license and Colonial\u2019s certificate. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that the board\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">With regard to the claim that the fine against Moraski was excessive, we again conclude that the board acted within the scope of its discretion. At the time of the violations at issue, \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6) permitted a fine of $10,000 per violation. See footnote 17 of this opinion. The board found that the department had sustained its burden of proof as to nearly all of the fifty-two para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>graph complaint as to each plaintiff that alleged more that a dozen allegations. See footnote 9 of this opinion. As we previously concluded, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s decisions. The trial court therefore properly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c) provides: \u201cNo revocation, suspension, annulment or withdrawal of any license is lawful unless, prior to the institution of agency proceedings, the agency gave notice by mail to the licensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and the licensee was given an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license. If the agency finds that public health, safety or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, summary suspension of a license may be ordered pending proceedings for revocation or other action.

General Statutes \u00a7 20-208 (a). It further has prescribed that \u201c[a] majority of the members of the board shall constitute a quorum.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-208 (b). Although the scheme governing the board does not provide a procedure for disqualification and substitution of members with direct or indirect financial interests, as it has for numerous other types of boards; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 8-11 (zoning boards); General Statutes \u00a7 8-21 (planning commission); General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (c) (wetlands boards or commissions); General Statutes \u00a7 22a-354o (a) (aquifer protection commission); see also General Statutes \u00a7 31-237\u00cd (providing for disqualification of employment security board of review members for \u201cany direct or indirect interest\u201d without specifying financial interest); the plaintiffs have not advanced any argument that the absence of such statutory provisions would preclude board members from voluntarily recusing themselves if a persuasive conflict of interest argument had been advanced timely. Thus, even if we were to assume that a minimum of three board members are required to preside over license suspension and revocation proceedings, the complaint against the plaintiffs could have proceeded even if two of the five board members had to be recused due to a conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Moreover, given the speculative nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, we need not reach the thorny issues of whether, in the absence of procedures for alternate board members, the board would have been able to conduct proceedings if there was evidence of actual bias as to a <em>majority </em>of its members; see <em>Federal Home Loan Bank Board </em>v. <em>Long Beach Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>295 F.2d 403, 408-409 (9th Cir. 1961) (concluding that majority could not disqualify itself on ground of bias); <em>Marquette Cement Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commission, </em>147 F.2d 589, 592-94 (7th Cir. 1945) (same); see also <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>170 Conn. 520, 524, 368 A.2d 125 (1976) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(applying rule of necessity); and whether presumptively disqualifying facts as to a majority of the board would implicate the principle that a party need not pursue a course of action that would be futile.
