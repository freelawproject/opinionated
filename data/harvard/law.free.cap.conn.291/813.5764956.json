App. 274, 276, 913 A.2d 505 (2007). On appeal to this court, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct pursuant to the rape shield statute, General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not violate the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>constitutional right to confrontation and to present a defense against charges of sexual assault and risk of injury to a child. We conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct was proper because the defendant\u2019s offer of proof lacked the specificity necessary to establish that the evidence was relevant. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following facts, which reasonably could have been found by the jury. \u201cThe defendant had been a member of the male victim\u2019s household and had been in a relationship with the victim\u2019s mother from the time the victim was two years old. The household also included the victim\u2019s mother, brother and two half-brothers. On an unspecified, snowy vacation day dining the 1998-1999 school year, the nine year old victim was at home playing video games with his two younger half-brothers, M and A. The defendant asked the victim to step out of the living room with him and to go into the bathroom. Although the victim initially resisted going there, when he was threatened with a beating, he did as he was told.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">\u201cAfter closing the bathroom door, the defendant ordered the victim to pull down his pants and to lean over the bathtub. Once the defendant had pulled his own pants down, he held the victim in place and anally penetrated him. Hearing the apartment door open, the defendant warned the victim not to say anything. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>victim\u2019s mother overheard this warning and saw the victim and [the] defendant pulling up their pants. Although she inquired about what was going on, the victim responded that nothing had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">\u201cAfter an altercation between the defendant and the victim\u2019s mother, the defendant left. Examining the victim\u2019s rectal area, the mother found it to be red and swollen. The mother called the family\u2019s pediatrician to express her concern that the victim might have been sexually abused. Although she was advised to take the victim to a hospital, she did not do so because the pediatrician would not confirm, over the telephone, that the victim had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">\u201cAfter this incident, the victim slept more often on the couch in the living room. Some nights, he would wake up to see the defendant running away. He would then become aware of the fact that his pants were down and sometimes would experience pain in his face or his anus.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">\u201cAt some time subsequent to these incidents, the victim was sent away from his home to live at the Stetson School in Massachusetts. During one of the victim\u2019s therapy sessions at the school, the victim\u2019s mother asked him what he thought about the defendant. The victim answered that the defendant was a sexual predator. Asked by his therapist to clarify what he meant by that, he declined to do so orally but wrote his answer down. He explained that he was still too nervous about what had happened to be able to talk about the events out loud.\u201d Id., 277-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">\u201cIn a three count amended information, the state charged the defendant . . . with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of ... \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1), sexual assault in the first degree in violation of ... \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 (2). After accepting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>verdict of the jury finding the defendant guilty on all three counts, the court sentenced him to seventeen years of incarceration and five years of special parole.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Thereafter, the defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had excluded testimony relating to the victim\u2019s sexual conduct with two of his siblings. The Appellate Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction, concluding that the trial court had properly excluded evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct pursuant to the rape shield statute, \u00a7 54-86f. This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review. \u201c \u2018We review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit [or exclude] evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law ... for an abuse of discretion.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 218, 926 A.2d 633 (2007). \u2018We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Snelgrove, </em>288 Conn. 742, 758, 954 A.2d 165 (2008). \u201cThe trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy [and admissibility] of evidence . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>289 Conn. 437, 462, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>958 A.2d 713 (2008). \u201cIn order to establish reversible error on an evidentiary impropriety . . . the defendant must prove both an abuse of discretion and a harm that resulted from such abuse.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>261 Conn. 156, 175, 801 A.2d 788 (2002).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In this appeal, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct did not violate his sixth amendment right of confrontation. More specifically, the defendant asserts that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s alleged misapplication of the factors enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>257 Conn. 156, 183-84, 777 A.2d 604 (2001), to the defendant\u2019s offer of proof seeking to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual abuse by an older brother.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In response, the state asserts that the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>late Court properly affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the trial court correctly determined that the evidence relating to the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct was not relevant in light of the factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 183-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Prior to trial, the state filed a motion in limine seeking, inter alia, to preclude the defendant from offering evidence related to the victim\u2019s prior sexual abuse by his older brother. The defendant objected, claiming that the evidence was relevant to the issue of the victim\u2019s knowledge of sexual matters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In his offer of proof in support of this claim, the defendant asserted that the victim had been subjected to sexual abuse by his older brother during the time period of 1998 through 1999, which overlapped with the time period for the charges against the defendant. The defendant acknowledged, however, that he had no evidence of an actual incident of sexual abuse of the victim by his older brother and could not provide a time or place when any particular incident of sexual abuse had occurred. The trial court precluded the defendant from offering any evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual abuse by his older brother \u201c[a]bsent a more detailed proffer . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Despite the trial court\u2019s earlier ruling on the motion in limine, during the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the victim at trial, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>victim if he had had sex with his older brother and whether he had admitted to having sex with his older brother during an interview with the department of children and families (department). The state then objected. After the jury was excused, the trial court asked the defendant\u2019s counsel to explain the relevance of the evidence sought to be elicited by those questions. Defense counsel again replied that the evidence was relevant to show another source for the victim\u2019s sexual knowledge. See footnote 12 of this opinion. The trial court again precluded the defendant from offering such evidence in the absence of a more specific offer of proof. The trial court later clarified its ruling, stating that the defendant had failed to make the necessary offer of proof under <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 183-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we briefly review our jurisprudence regarding the sixth amendment right to confrontation. \u201cIt is well established that a defendant has the right to confront witnesses against him as guaranteed by the confrontation clauses of both our federal and state constitutions. U.S. Const., amends. VI, XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L.

The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one\u2019s own behalf have long been recognized as essential to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>due process.\u2019 . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Stange, </em>212 Conn. 612, 624-25, 563 A.2d 681 (1989), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>210 Conn. 631, 644, 556 A.2d 1013 (1989); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Mas-tropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 520, 400 A.2d 276 (1978), quoting <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\u201cWe are mindful, however, that \u2018the right to confront and to cross-examine is not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u2019 . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>254 Conn. 290, 298, 755 A.2d 868 (2000), quoting <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 410 U.S. 295; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonello, </em>210 Conn. 51, 55, 554 A.2d 277, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1082, 109 S. Ct. 2103, 104 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 693. For example, the trial court has a \u2018right, indeed, [a] duty, to exclude irrelevant evidence.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 521; <em>State </em>v. <em>Taiton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 283-85, 497 A.2d 35 (1985). The rules excluding evidence from criminal trials, however, may not be \u2018arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.\u2019 . . . <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S. Ct. 1261, 140 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1998), quoting <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 56, 107 S. Ct. 2704, 97 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 174-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">We next set forth some fundamental principles regarding the rape shield statute, \u00a7 54-86f. The rape shield statute was \u201cenacted specifically to bar or limit the use of prior sexual conduct of an alleged victim of a sexual assault because it is such highly prejudicial material. . . . Our legislature has determined that, except in specific instances, and taking the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights into account, evidence of prior sexual conduct is to be excluded for policy purposes. Some of these policies include protecting the victim\u2019s sexual privacy and shielding her from undue harassment, encouraging reports of sexual assault, and enabling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>victim to testify in court with less fear of embarrassment. . . . Other policies promoted by the law include avoiding prejudice to the victim, jury confusion and waste of time on collateral matters.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>228 Conn. 456, 469-70, 637 A.2d 382, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 821, 115 S. Ct. 83, 130 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">\u201cHowever, [although the state\u2019s interests in limiting the admissibility of this type of evidence are substantial, they cannot by themselves outweigh the defendant\u2019s competing constitutional interests. . . . We must remember that [t]he determination of whether the state\u2019s interests in excluding evidence must yield to those interests of the defendant is determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case. ... In every criminal case, the defendant has an important interest in being permitted to introduce evidence relevant to his defense. Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative. . . . Whenever the rape shield statute\u2019s preclusion of prior sexual conduct is invoked, a question of relevancy arises. If the evidence is probative, the statute\u2019s protection yields to constitutional rights that assure a full and fair defense. ... If the defendant\u2019s offer of proof is sufficient to show relevancy, and that the evidence is more probative to the defense than prejudicial to the victim, it must be deemed admissible at trial. . . . When the trial court excludes defense evidence that provides the defendant with a basis for cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses, [despite what might be considered a sufficient offer of proof] such exclusion may give rise to a claim of denial of the right to confrontation and to present a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>defense.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 176-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Section 54-86f provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any prosecution for sexual assault under sections 53a-70, 53a-70a, and 53a-71 to 53a-73a, inclusive, no evidence of the sexual conduct of the victim may be admissible unless such evidence is (1) offered by the defendant on the issue of whether the defendant was, with respect to the victim, the source of semen, disease, pregnancy or injury, or (2) offered by the defendant on the issue of credibility of the victim, provided the victim has testified on direct examination as to his or her sexual conduct, or (3) any evidence of sexual conduct with the defendant offered by the defendant on the issue of consent by the victim, when consent is raised as a defense by the defendant, or (4) otherwise so relevant and material to a critical issue in the case that excluding it would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. . . . [E]vidence [admissible under one of these exceptions] shall be admissible only after a hearing on a motion to offer such evidence containing an offer of proof. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 185-86, we recognized \u201cthe critical nature of prior sexual abuse evidence in the defendant\u2019s effort to rebut the inference that [the defendant] is the source of [the victim\u2019s] sexual knowledge or behavioral characteristics. [I]f the jury is not allowed to learn of the [prior sexual] offenses against [the victim], then [it] will inevitably conclude that the [victim\u2019s] highly age-inappropriate sexual knowledge could only come from [the] defendant having committed such acts. . . . Without that evidence, [t]he inference that [a victim] could not possess the sexual knowledge he [or she] does unless [the defendant] sexually assaulted [him or her] greatly bolsters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>[a victim\u2019s] allegations. ... In order to rebut that inference, [the defendant] must establish an alternative source for [the victim\u2019s] sexual knowledge . . . [as] a necessary and critical element of [his] defense. . . . Simply put, the prior sexual conduct must account for how the child could provide the testimony\u2019s sexual detail without having suffered [the] defendant\u2019s alleged conduct.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">\u201cA clear statement of the defendant\u2019s theory of relevance is all important in determining whether the evidence is offered for a permissible purpose.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>244 Conn. 640, 647, 712 A.2d 919 (1998). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 183-84, we concluded that in order for evidence of a victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct to be admissible under \u00a7 54-86f to show a source for the victim\u2019s sexual knowledge, \u201c[p]rior to trial the defendant must make an offer of proof showing: (1) that the prior acts clearly occurred; (2) that the acts closely resembled those of the present case; (3) that the prior act is clearly relevant to a material issue; (4) that the evidence is necessary to [the] defendant\u2019s case; and (5) that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">In the present case, the defendant sought to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual abuse by his older brother through the testimony of a therapist at the Stetson School, the testimony of the victim and the testimony of the defendant. During both a pretrial hearing on the state\u2019s motion in limine relating to this evidence and on multiple occasions during the trial, the trial court afforded the defendant an opportunity to make an offer of proof regarding the admissibility of this evidence. On each of these occasions, when making his offer of proof that this evidence should be admitted under \u00a7 54-86f (4) to show another source of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>sexual knowledge,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the defendant proffered only that the victim had engaged in sexual conduct with his older brother during the years 1998 and 1999. The trial court determined that the defendant had failed to make the necessary offer of proof as required under <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 183-84, and that the evidence therefore was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court misapplied <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 183-84, and that his offer of proof was sufficient to establish the relevance of the evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual abuse by his older brother. In support of his claim, the defendant asserts that because the proffer demonstrated that the victim was engaged in same sex sexual conduct during a time frame that overlapped with the allegations of abuse by the defendant, his proffer was sufficient under <em>Rolon. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The defendant\u2019s offer of proof was utterly lacking in specificity and, therefore, failed to satisfy the five part showing required under <em>State v. Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 183-84. Despite numerous efforts by the trial court to elicit both a clearly articulated theory of relevance of the victim\u2019s prior sexual abuse by his older brother and details regarding the alleged prior sexual abuse, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>defendant failed to provide the required details.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Instead, the defendant asserted only that the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>sexual abuse by his older brother occurred during 1998 and 1999, which was during the same general time frame of the alleged sexual abuse by the defendant. Without more, the assertion that the victim was sexually abused by his older brother during a time period that overlapped the allegations of sexual abuse against the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>dant was insufficient. Even if we assume that the defendant met the first prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 184, in that he established that the prior abuse of the victim by his older brother did occur, the defendant\u2019s proffer did not establish that the prior incident of abuse closely resembled the allegations of abuse against the defendant. The defendant failed to satisfy all the prongs of <em>Rolon, </em>and we therefore conclude that the Appellate Court properly affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person, or (2) engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is under thirteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who ...

If the proceeding is a trial with a jury, such hearing shall be held in the absence of the jury.

The defendant asserts that, instead, the Appellate Court should have engaged in plenary review of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling in this case. In support of his position, the defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 218, wherein we concluded that, \u201c[t]o the extent atrial court\u2019s admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary.\u201d We further explained, however, that \u201c[w]e review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. In the present case, the parties do not dispute that the admissibility of the evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct is governed by the legal standard enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>257 Conn. 156, 178-79, 777 A.2d 604 (2001), and that the trial court properly identified this legal standard when determining the admissibility of the evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct in the present case. The parties\u2019 dispute, therefore, focuses on the trial court\u2019s application of the correct legal standard to the evidence proferred in the present case. We therefore conclude that the Appellate Court properly applied the abuse of discretion standard to tire trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\"> The defendant also claims in this appeal that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence regarding the victim\u2019s subsequent sexual conduct with a younger brother was proper. Our careful review of the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, the state\u2019s objection to the petition, and our order granting the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>petition, demonstrates that the certified question was intended to be limited to the exclusion of evidence of <em>prior </em>sexual conduct, consistent with the defendant\u2019s petition for certification, which only addressed the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct. We therefore conclude that the admissibility of evidence of the victim\u2019s <em>subsequent </em>sexual conduct is beyond the scope of the certified question, and we will not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b842-14\"> Although the defendant\u2019s language was not precise, our review of the transcripts leads us to conclude that the defendant intended to offer the evidence to show a basis for the victim\u2019s sexual knowledge other than the alleged sexual assault committed by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\"> See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\"> In this appeal, the defendant also asserts that the evidence regarding sexual abuse of the victim by his older brother was also admissible under \u00a7 54-86f (1) because it is relevant to show another source of both the victim\u2019s psychological <em>and </em>physical injury. A careful review of the trial court record reveals that the defendant did not raise either of these grounds for admissibility before that court. Indeed, the defendant raises his claim regarding its relevance to the victim\u2019s physical injury for the first time on appeal to this court. Therefore, we decline to review these claims on appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (\u201ccourt shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial\u201d); <em>Yale University </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>225 Conn. 32, 36 n.4, 621 A.2d 1304 (1993) (issue not reviewed because not raised at trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b849-6\"> For example, during the trial, the trial court engaged in the following colloquy with the defendant\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-7\">\u201cThe Court: ...

And the difficulty with your claim and the reason why I . . . sustained an objection to it being admitted is it falls far . . . short of the necessary proffer that you must make under the rape shield statute and from your comments, and you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it\u2019s pretty clear to me that you don\u2019t have any specific . . . information; that you don\u2019t have hard, credible evidence to introduce regarding the nature of any sexual conduct that the victim may have had with his siblings in terms of the proximity to the date that the defendant is alleged to . . . have had sexual contact with the victim or any other matter and that . . . [the] failure of you to be able to make such a proffer is why I must exclude this evidence under the rape shield statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlY3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes.

Upon such a showing the court may then afford the state an opportunity to secure the consent of the witness for the court to conduct an in camera inspection of the claimed information and, if necessary, to turn over to the defendant any relevant material for the purposes of cross-examination. If the defendant does malee such showing and such consent is not forthcoming then the court may be obliged to strike the testimony of the witness. If the consent is limited to an in camera inspection and such inspection, in the opinion of the trial judge, does not disclose relevant material then the resealed record is to be made available for inspection on appellate review. If the in camera inspection does reveal relevant material then the witness should be given an opportunity to decide whether to consent to release of such material to the defendant or to face having her testimony stricken in the event of refusal.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemah, </em>289 Conn. 411, 425-26, 957 A.2d 852 (2008).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"adh-dedup-0\">Furthermore, \u201c[w]ith respect to a trial court\u2019s consideration of whether to allow a defendant access to requested confidential materials, we have held that, upon a proper showing and after an in camera review, [ajccess to confidential records should be left to the discretion of the trial court which is better able to assess the probative value of such evidence as it relates to the particular case before it . . . and to weigh that value against the interest in confidentiality of the records. . . . When a defendant seeks access to confidential records for impeachment purposes, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>must determine whether [the records] sufficiently disclose material especially probative of the [witness\u2019] ability to comprehend, know, and correctly relate the truth .... Moreover, we have held that [t]he determination of materiality . . . [is] inevitably fact-bound and like other factual issues is committed to the trial court in the first instance.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>268 Conn. 382, 403, 844 A.2d 810 (2004); id., 402-403 (concluding that trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant access to department records of complainant after reviewing sealed documents and determining that they did not \u201ccontain exculpatory or impeachment evidence or evidence relating to [complainant\u2019s] ability to comprehend, know or correctly relate the truth\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"AszL\">This court has held that \u201cif the trial court discovers material exculpatory evidence in the course of an in camera inspection, it has a duty to disclose it to the defense and the defendant has a due process right to its disclosure. . . . The defendant [is] not entitled, however, to an unlimited inspection of [confidential documents] in the hope of discovering material evidence. Access to confidential records should be left to the discretion of the trial court which is better able to assess the probative value of such evidence as it relates to the particular case before it . . . and to weigh that value against the interest in confidentiality of the records.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>227 Conn. 751, 762, 631 A.2d 309 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">If the defendant in the present case believes that the department\u2019s records contained evidence favorable to his case and that the trial court improperly failed to disclose that evidence to him, it was incumbent on him to object to the redaction of the records at the time of trial and to raise that claim on appeal. See id., 761 (defendant objected to court\u2019s limited disclosure of personnel file after in camera review and challenged that action on appeal). In the absence of any such claim, we must presume that the trial court applied the proper legal standard to the redacted materials and concluded that the evidence was not exculpatory because any sexual conduct between the victim and his older brother was not similar to the conduct at issue in the present case and, therefore, would not explain the victim\u2019s sexual knowledge. See, e.g., <em>Elm City Cheese Co. </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>251 Conn. 59, 72, 752 A.2d 1037 (1999) (in absence of contrary evidence, \u201cwe presume that the trial court . . . undertook the proper analysis of the law and the facts\" [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
