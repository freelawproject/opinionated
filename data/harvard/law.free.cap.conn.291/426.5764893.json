The defendant, Jewu Thomas Richardson, appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. We conclude that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">The record discloses the following relevant facts and procedural history. The defendant was arrested on January 5, 2006, and charged by substitute information with possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 2 la-278 (b), and possession of narcotics with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a school in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b). The defendant pleaded not guilty, and the case eventually proceeded to jury selection. On March 14, 2007, prior to the jury being sworn, the state requested a four week continuance, which the trial court, <em>Keegan, J., </em>granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two days later, on March 16,2007, the assistant state\u2019s attorney informed the court, <em>Blawie, J.,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s main witness has become legally unavailable, and the state is therefore entering a missing witness nolle pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 54-56b.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel, who had waived the defendant\u2019s appearance at the March 16 proceeding, averred that he knew \u201cof no valid basis to object\u201d to the nolle, and the court declared that the nolle was \u201cnoted on that basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In a pro se motion dated March 29, 2007, the defendant sought to have the charges dismissed with prejudice. In his motion to dismiss, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that the \u201ccharges against him [should] be dismissed with prejudice\u201d because the state had failed to show that the nolle was based on the death, disappearance or disability of a material witness as Practice Book \u00a7 39-30 requires.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court held a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>April 9, 2007, and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the denial of his motion to dismiss, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On appeal, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss, claiming that the state failed to satisfy the specific requirements of \u00a7 54-56b when it entered the missing witness nolle. We need not reach this issue, however, because we agree with the state that the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss inasmuch as the defense had not timely objected to the entering of the nolle.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">We begin with a brief discussion of the general principles of jurisdiction that bear on our resolution of this appeal. \u201c[T]he question of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law . . . and, once raised, either by a party or by the court itself, the question must be answered before the court may decide the case. . . . We have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Rocky Mountain, LLC, </em>277 Conn. 696, 703, 894 A.2d 259 (2006). \u201cThe Superior Court is a constitutional court of general jurisdiction. ... In the absence of statutoiy or constitutional provisions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the limits of its jurisdiction are delineated by the common law.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>230 Conn. 427, 431, 646 A.2d 85 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u201cThe Superior Court\u2019s authority over criminal cases is established by the proper presentment of the information . . . which is essential to initiate a criminal proceeding.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>111 Conn. App. 397, 401-402, 960 A.2d 1040 (2008). \u201cThe effect of a nolle is to terminate the particular prosecution of the defendant without an acquittal and without placing him in jeopardy.\u201d Id., 402. \u201cTherefore, the nolle places the criminal matter in the same position it held prior to the filing of the information. Indeed, no criminal matter exists until, and if, the prosecution issues a new information against the defendant. As our rules explain, [t]he entry of a nolle prosequi terminates the prosecution and the defendant shall be released from custody. If subsequently the prosecuting authority decides to proceed against the defendant, a new prosecution must be initiated. Practice Book \u00a7 39-31. The defendant is accused of no crime, is released from custody unconditionally and is no longer under the authority of the court. It follows that, generally, a court does not have jurisdiction over the case after the entry of a nolle.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>supra, 402-403. Although this court has recognized a narrow exception to this general rule,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that exception is not applicable in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>In this case, defense counsel waived the defendant\u2019s appearance at the March 16, 2007 proceeding in which the state entered the nolle. At the beginning of the proceeding, the assistant state\u2019s attorney asked if defense counsel would \u201c[wjaive [the defendant\u2019s] appearance,\u201d to which counsel replied: \u201cYes, I\u2019ll waive his appearance. . . . It\u2019s my understanding . . . that what\u2019s going to happen here doesn\u2019t require his appearance.\u201d Immediately after this exchange, the assistant state\u2019s attorney informed the court that he was \u201centering a missing witness nolle pursuant to [\u00a7] 54-56b\u201d because \u201cthe state\u2019s main witness ha[d] become legally unavailable . . . .\u201d Immediately thereafter, the court asked defense counsel whether he \u201cwish[ed] to be heard,\u201d to which defense counsel replied: \u201cNo, Your Honor. I know of no valid basis to object [to the entry of the nolle] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">On appeal, the defendant does not raise a claim with respect to the propriety of defense counsel\u2019s waiver of the defendant\u2019s appearance at the March 16 proceeding. In fact, in his reply brief, the defendant concedes that \u201c[w]aiver of the defendant\u2019s presence by his attorney on March 16, 2007, is a nonissue in this case . . . Nevertheless, the defendant contradictorily asserts, for the first time in his reply brief, that he had a constitutional right to be present at the proceeding in which the state entered the nolle and that he had not agreed to a waiver of that right. Because the defendant failed to raise this issue in his main brief, it is abandoned. See, e.g., State v. <em>Lopez, </em>280 Conn. 779, 816 n.25, 911 A.2d 1099 (2007) (\u201c[i]t is a well established principle that arguments cannot be raised for the first time in a reply brief\u2019 [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Czarnecki </em>v. <em>Plastics Liquidating Co., </em>179 Conn. 261, 262 n.l, 425 A.2d 1289 (1979) (\u201c[t]hose claims of error not briefed are considered abandoned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Thus, we begin with the premise that the defendant\u2019s presence at the nolle proceeding was effectively and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>properly waived by defense counsel. It is incontrovertible that the defendant, through his counsel, acquiesced in the entry of the missing witness nolle on March 16, 2007. Once the state entered the nolle and the proceeding ended, the trial court was divested of jurisdiction to take any further action in the case. For all intents and purposes, the case had ceased to exist once the nolle was entered, and, thus, there was nothing for the court to exert jurisdiction over. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">To the extent that the defendant attempts to overcome this obstacle by pointing to the existence of the April 9, 2007 hearing, and several statements made by the trial court at that proceeding, we need merely note the firmly established principle that a court cannot arrogate jurisdiction to itself by its own fiat. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 431 (trial court\u2019s jurisdiction defined by constitution, statute and common law). Because the nolle was properly entered on March 16,2007, the April 9, 2007 proceeding was undertaken without jurisdiction and represents a legal nullity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The denial of the motion to dismiss is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\"> Neither defense counsel nor the defendant took a position on the requested continuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\"> Hereinafter, all references to the trial court are to <em>Blawie, J.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56b provides in relevant part: \u201cA nolle prosequi may not be entered as to any count in a[n] . . . information if the accused objects to the nolle prosequi and demands either atrial or dismissal, except with respect to prosecutions in which a nolle prosequi is entered upon representation to the court by the prosecuting official that a material witness has died, disappeared or become disabled or that material evidence has disappeared or has been destroyed and that a further investigation is therefore necessary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\"> We note that Practice Book \u00a7 39-30, which tracks the language of General Statutes \u00a7 54-56b, is somewhat unclear regarding the state\u2019s burden when entering a missing witness nolle, as the rule appears to require only a \u201crepresentation to the judicial authority by the prosecuting authority that a material witness has . . . become disabled . . . .\u201d We have previously concluded, however, that \u201c[t]he trial court ha[s] no obligation to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>whether the complaining witness [is] in fact truly disabled. . . . The proper test is whether there has been a manifest abuse of prosecutorial discretion. The court must accept the entry of the nolle prosequi for the record unless it is persuaded that the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of discretion is clearly contrary to manifest public interest.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>185 Conn. 199, 204, 440 A.2d 867 (1981). Although we need not revisit this standard because we do not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s substantive claims, we take this opportunity to note our continued adherence to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>185 Conn. 199, 440 A.2d 867 (1981), we determined that the trial court retains jurisdiction after the entry of a nolle prosequi over the defendant\u2019s objection when the defendant has a motion to dismiss on other grounds pending before the court prior to the entry of the nolle. See id., 205-206; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaston, </em>198 Conn. 435, 443, 503 A.2d 594 (1986) (\u201ceven after the entry of a nolle the court retains limited jurisdiction over the case to hear such matters as the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the alleged denial of the right to a speedy trial\u201d). No such circumstances exist in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\"> Recently, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Das, </em>291 Conn. 356, 370, 968 A.2d 367 (2009), we clarified that there is no \u201cconstitutional violation\u201d exception to the rule depriving a trial court of jurisdiction over a defendant once his sentence has been executed. To the extent that the defendant\u2019s argument implicitly suggests that there is a similar exception that would confer jurisdiction to consider a motion to dismiss after the entry of a nolle, the logic of <em>Das </em>is equally applicable in the present case and forecloses the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
