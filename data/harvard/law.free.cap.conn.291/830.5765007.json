J.</author>\n<p id=\"azk-dedup-0\">The petitioner, Rafael Fernandez, appeals from the judgment of the habeas court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In this appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the petitioner asks us to determine whether the habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>court properly found that the actions of the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel, William T. Gerace, in obtaining the trial court\u2019s permission to withdraw from representing the petitioner at his criminal trial, did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The following relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in our decision on the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal from his convictions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>254 Conn. 637, 758 A.2d 842 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 913, 121 S. Ct. 1247, 149 L. Ed. 2d 153 (2001). On May 29, 1998, a three judge panel found the petitioner guilty of arson in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (1) and murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). Id., 646. The petitioner thereafter was sentenced to a total effective term of fifty-five years imprisonment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">On direct appeal from his conviction, the petitioner claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in granting Gerace\u2019s pretrial oral motion to withdraw and that, as a result, he was deprived of his rights to the assistance of counsel and to counsel of choice under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and under the sixth<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and fourteenth<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution. Id., 646-47. This court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 649-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Approximately eighteen months after this court affirmed his conviction, the petitioner filed a habeas petition. See <em>Fernandez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>86 Conn. App. 42, 43, 859 A.2d 948 (2004). The habeas court dismissed that petition on the ground that the petitioner\u2019s claims were identical to those discussed and ruled on by this court in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, and the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the habeas court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">On April 1, 2005, the petitioner initiated the habeas action that underlies the present appeal. In his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner claims that Gerace rendered ineffective assistance by virtue of the manner in which he withdrew as the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel. Specifically, the petitioner alleges that Gerace never discussed with the petitioner his intent to withdraw or his reasons for doing so and failed to return the petitioner\u2019s retainer. The petitioner further claims that Gerace\u2019s conduct deprived him of his constitutional rights to counsel and to counsel of choice during critical stages of the criminal proceedings. Finally, the petitioner claims that his attorney during the first habeas trial, Timothy Aspinwall, rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the first habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">After a hearing on the habeas petition that is the subject of this appeal, the habeas court denied the petition. In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court found no concrete evidence that Gerace\u2019s performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>had been deficient, notwithstanding his failure to file a written motion to withdraw. The habeas court further found that Gerace\u2019s actions, even if they had been deficient, had not deprived the petitioner of his sixth amendment right to counsel or rendered the result of the criminal trial unreliable in any other way. The habeas court also found that, in light of its conclusions with respect to Gerace\u2019s representation, Aspinwall had not been deficient in failing to raise the present claims in the first habeas action.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">On appeal from the judgment of the habeas court, the petitioner challenges the habeas court\u2019s finding that Gerace did not render ineffective assistance. Citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 126 S. Ct. 2557, 165 L. Ed. 2d 409 (2006), the petitioner argues that Gerace\u2019s withdrawal constituted structural error that is per se prejudicial, and that \u201conce it is determined that . . . Gerace was ineffective in the manner in which he withdrew and was allowed to withdraw as counsel of choice . . . the petition should be granted without further consideration of harm or whether the outcome would have been different had Gerace remained as counsel.\u201d We reject the petitioner\u2019s claim. Consequently, we also reject his claim that the habeas court improperly failed to find that Aspinwall\u2019s performance was constitutionally defective by virtue of his failure to raise the claims included in the present habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">\u201cThe habeas court is afforded broad discretion in making its factual findings, and those findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . The application of the habeas court\u2019s factual findings to the pertinent legal standard, however, presents a mixed question of law and fact, which is subject to plenary review. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">\u201cA criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance of counsel at all criti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>cal stages of criminal proceedings. . . . This right arises under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. ... As enunciated in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>[466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)], this court has stated: It is axiomatic that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel. ... A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel consists of two components: a performance prong and a prejudice prong. To satisfy the performance prong . . . the petitioner must demonstrate that his attorney\u2019s representation was not reasonably competent or within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law. ... To satisfy the prejudice prong, a claimant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. . . . The claim will succeed only if both prongs are satisfied.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>290 Conn. 502, 509-10, 964 A.2d 1186 (2009). \u201c[A] reviewing court can find against a petitioner on either ground, whichever is easier.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>287 Conn. 792, 832-33, 950 A.2d 1220 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>supra, 548 U.S. 146-48, the United States Supreme Court distinguished the right to counsel of choice from the right to effective assistance of counsel. \u201cThe earliest case generally cited for the proposition that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel, <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, [771 n.14, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763] (1970), was based on the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause rather than on the [s]ixth [a]mendment .... And even our recognition of the right to effective counsel within the [s]ixth [a]mendment was a consequence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>our perception that representation by counsel is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results. <em>Strickland </em>[v. Washington, supra, 466 U.S. 685]. Having derived the right to effective representation from the purpose of ensuring a fair trial, we have, logically enough, also derived the limits of that right from that same purpose. . . . The requirement that a defendant show prejudice in effective representation cases arises from the very nature of the specific element of the right to counsel at issue there\u2014effective (not mistake-free) representation. Counsel cannot be ineffective unless his mistakes have harmed the defense (or, at least, unless it is reasonably likely that they have). Thus, a violation of the [s]ixth [a]mendment right to effective representation is not complete until the defendant is prejudiced. [Id.]</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">\u201cThe right to select counsel of one\u2019s choice, by contrast, has never been derived from the [s]ixth [a]mendment\u2019s purpose of ensuring a fair trial. It has been regarded as the root meaning of the constitutional guarantee. . . . Where the right to be assisted by counsel of one\u2019s choice is wrongly denied, therefore, it is unnecessary to conduct an ineffectiveness or prejudice inquiry to establish a [s]ixth [a]mendment violation. Deprivation of the right is complete when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants, regardless of the quality of the representation he received. To argue otherwise is to confuse the right to counsel of choice\u2014which is the right to a particular lawyer regardless of comparative effectiveness\u2014with the right to effective counsel\u2014 which imposes a baseline requirement of competence on whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>supra, 548 U.S. 147-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">In light of the foregoing discussion, it is clear that a petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>continues to bear the burden of proving prejudice under <em>Strickland. </em>The fact that trial counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance resulted in his withdrawal as the petitioner\u2019s attorney of choice does not eliminate the necessity, under both <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>that the petitioner demonstrate that he was <em>\u201cerroneously </em>prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 148. Thus, the petitioner\u2019s synthesis of <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>and <em>Strickland </em>is simply an attempt to bootstrap his ineffective assistance of counsel claim into a claim that he improperly was deprived of his constitutional right to counsel of choice\u2014a claim that we already have rejected. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 649-53 (trial court did not abuse discretion in granting trial counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw; granting of motion did not deprive defendant of right to counsel or counsel of choice). The petitioner cannot circumvent the prior decision of this court by replacing the label \u201cabuse of judicial discretion\u201d with the label \u201cdeficient performance\u201d as the cause of Gerace\u2019s withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The habeas court concluded that, despite having eaten twice from the same apple, the petitioner failed to demonstrate that he improperly had been denied his right to be assisted by Gerace or that he improperly had been prevented from being represented by Gerace. The habeas court\u2019s conclusion is consistent with our decision in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal. See id. Accordingly, we conclude that the habeas court properly denied the petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-13\"> The habeas court granted the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, and the petitioner appealed from the judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court. This court thereafter transferred the appeal to itself pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself and by counsel . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b854-9\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d The sixth amendment right to counsel is made applicable to state prosecutions through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. See <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 342, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L.
