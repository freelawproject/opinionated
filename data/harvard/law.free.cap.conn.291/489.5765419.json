The defendant claims that the trial court violated its due process right to fair and adequate notice sufficient to afford it a meaningful opportunity to prepare a defense. We agree with the defendant and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Additionally, the defendant claims that a second gag order imposed by the court on February 9,2007, following the finding of contempt, was unjustified and unconstitutional. Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court: (1) abused the discretion afforded by Practice Book \u00a7 9-10<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> when it entered the gag order; (2) violated the defendant\u2019s first amendment rights by imposing an overly broad gag order; and (3) irreparably harmed the defendant by preventing it from complying with its statutory disclosure obligations. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-263. The record, however, shows that the trial court entered the gag order as a sanction for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>contempt finding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because our reversal of the judgment of contempt necessarily vacates the associated sanction, it is unnecessary to address this claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. During the course of this litigation, the plaintiffs filed a motion for relief for improper communications, alleging that a member of the defendant\u2019s board of directors (board) had sent to the plaintiffs, via a November 15, 2006 letter and a November 16, 2006 e-mail, misleading information suggesting that the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] the power to bring this suit to a halt and avert this situation.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 motion requested, inter alia, that the court restrain the defendant and its officers and directors from further communication, without approval of the court, with the plaintiffs regarding the litigation. On November 20,2006, the court ordered that \u201c[the defendant] and its officers and directors shall desist from any further communications with [the plaintiffs] regarding this lawsuit except upon prior approval of the court.\u201d Upon request, the court clarified that it was \u201ctrying to tailor the relief as narrowly as possible\u201d and if the parties \u201chave to conduct other business, that\u2019s between them, but nothing is to be mentioned or said about this [litigation].\u201d The defendant did not appeal from the court\u2019s November 20, 2006 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">A court trial was held between November, 2006, and January, 2007. On February 1, 2007, prior to the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>rendering judgment, the defendant posted on its website a statement entitled \u201cUPDATE ON NEW HARTFORD <em>v. </em>[CONNECTICUT RESOURCES RECOVERY AUTHORITY]\u2014FEBRUARY 1, 2007,\u201d which included a discussion of the three year lawsuit, and statements such as \u201c[t]he suit was originally filed because the [named plaintiff] didn\u2019t like the fact that [the defendant] had to raise disposal fees after the Enron bankruptcy,\u201d and \u201c[t]his lawsuit boils down to the conflict between prudence and recklessness .... It\u2019s hard to imagine that the couple of first selectmen who are driving this case would run their towns as recklessly as they want us to run [the defendant].\u201d The website posting also included and contested three \u201cclaims\u201d that it attributed to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt on February 8,2007, which the defendant\u2019s attorneys did not receive until nearly 5 p.m. The motion for contempt alleged that the defendant\u2019s website posting was an improper attempt to contact the plaintiffs in violation of the November 20, 2006 order and that Paul Nonnenmacher, the defendant\u2019s director of public affairs, had admitted as much in an e-mail to a representative of the named plaintiff. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">When the parties appeared before the court on February 9, 2007, less than one day after the defendant had received the motion, for a previously scheduled hearing,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the court indicated that it recently had received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for contempt. Counsel for the plaintiffs stated that the defendant\u2019s attorney \u201cindicated that he needs time to respond to [the motion for contempt]. We wanted to get that in front of the court, but we don\u2019t object to scheduling that for a hearing at a subsequent date if the court wishes to do that.\u201d The court responded that it was \u201cconcerned about what\u2019s transpired, so the court wishes to address that.\u201d After discussing other issues, including another allegedly improper communication sent to the plaintiffs by the defendant around January 26,2007,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the court indicated that it wanted to address the motion for contempt. When the court asked defense counsel about the website posting, he responded: \u201cYour Honor, we didn\u2019t get these papers until almost 5 o\u2019clock last night, and it\u2019s just not fair to have any hearing on that. We haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to . . . Nonnenmacher [the author of the communications at issue] . . . [Thomas] Kirk [the defendant\u2019s president] or anybody else about [anything] raised in the motion for contempt. We saw this issue for the first time last night at almost 5 [p.m.].\u201d Defense counsel admitted that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>had brought the website posting to his attention earlier in the week, but stated that he was unaware that it would be viewed as a contemptuous act until he received the motion for contempt and that he had not had a chance to read the entire website posting. Defense counsel stated that \u201cfrankly, I was busy last night getting ready for this hearing [on other matters], and I still haven\u2019t read all three pages of this, and it\u2019s just unfair to go forward on a motion for contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The court responded: \u201cWell, isn\u2019t it unfair to the court when the court has entered an order that there be no communication between the parties regarding the lawsuit to have something posted on the website that goes point by point regarding the very lawsuit? . . . [I]t\u2019s pretty obvious to the court that it\u2019s a blatant violation of the court order.\u201d At that point, the attorneys and the court discussed the merits of the motion for contempt. During that discussion, defense counsel stated that the website posting was \u201ca mistake in my view. I\u2019d like to have a chance to look at it and talk to . . . [Nonnen-macher] about why he did this.\u201d The court did not respond directly to defense counsel\u2019s request. The court stated that the website posting \u201ctalks about the trial. It talks about the witnesses testifying. It contradicts testimony. . . . What if we had a jury case on this and some jurors saw it? We\u2019d probably have to start all over again.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Defense counsel stated that both parties had been contacted by the press, and the court replied that it was \u201cgoing to take care of that today.\u201d The court stated: \u201cThe court finds that certainly the website posting is in direct contravention of the [November 20,2006] court order. The [January 26, 2007] letter is right on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the edge.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is also in violation of the court order. So the court finds [the defendant] in contempt of the prior court order. The court is going to order that the posting on the website be removed immediately, and if not removed, the court will impose a fine of $5000 per day for every day it is on the website. The court is further going to order that . . . from this day forward there is a gag order as to all parties in this case. There is to be no discussion of anything remotely relating to payments to the [plaintiffs], the lawsuit, anything that could be conceived other than between counsel and their clients in private, which is not to be released to the press or any other entity, only within attorney-client privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">After further discussion on other matters, the court stated: \u201cJust to be clear on the motion for contempt, the court finds [the defendant] in contempt of its order of November 20, 2006. [The defendant] is ordered to remove the [website] posting . . . dated February 1, 2007, by closing of business today, Friday, February 9, 2007. There will be a $5000 fine imposed upon [the defendant] for each day said posting is on the website after today, February 9, 2007. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u201cThe court further imposes upon all parties a gag order. They are not to have any communication. There will be no communication between [the plaintiffs and the defendant] . . . regarding this litigation, or any ramification of this litigation, or what to do with pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>posed settlement funds that are coming in. That includes any and all communication on a website, letters, e-mails, any type of communication between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u201cThe court wants to make it very clear. This is not a close call. This was a direct violation of the court order. Further violations, the court will not hesitate to bring the person in who violates and [will recommend that] further actions in the form of fines or . . . criminal proceedings take place against that person.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court also clarified that the board could still function in public and try to carry out its recovery plan.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>As a preliminary matter, we set forth the legal principles that guide our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims and identify the applicable standard of review. \u201cOur case law classifies civil contempt as conduct directed against the rights of the opposing party . . . while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>criminal contempt consists of conduct that is directed against the dignity and authority of the court.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ullmann </em>v. <em>State, </em>230 Conn. 698, 707, 647 A.2d 324 (1994). Because an alleged act of contempt may interfere with the rights of the opposing party <em>and </em>offend the dignity and authority of the court, \u201c[t]he determination of the interest to be addressed and the method of addressing it ... is left to the sound discretion of the court. . . . Accordingly, a court\u2019s power to hold a party in civil or criminal contempt is not limited by the nature of the offense. Rather, it is the nature of the relief itself that is instructive in determining whether a contempt is civil or criminal. A contempt fine is civil if it either coerce[s] the defendant into compliance with the court\u2019s order, [or] . . . compensate [s] the complainant for losses sustained.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 708-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u201cContempts of court may also be classified as either direct or indirect, the test being whether the contempt is offered within or outside the presence of the court. ... A refusal to comply with an injunctive decree is an indirect contempt of court because it occurs outside the presence of the trial court. . . . The question then becomes how conduct, alleged to be in contempt of a court order, that occurred outside of the trial court\u2019s presence is proved to be a contempt. Established principles of both constitutional and common law . . . are implicated in this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u201cWe recognize that there are constitutional safeguards that must be satisfied in indirect contempt cases. It is beyond question that due process of law . . . requires that one charged with contempt of court be advised of the charges against him, have a reasonable opportunity to meet them by way of defense or explanation, have the right to be represented by counsel, and have a chance to testify and call other witnesses in his behalf, either by way of defense or explanation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>197 Conn. 141, 150, 496 A.2d 476 (1985). \u201cNotice, to comply with due process requirements, must be given sufficiently in advance of scheduled court proceedings so that reasonable opportunity to prepare will be afforded, and it must set forth the alleged misconduct with particularity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 33, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967). \u201cWhether the defendant was deprived of his due process rights is a question of law, to which we grant plenary review.\u201d <em>State v. T.R.D., </em>286 Conn. 191, 210, 942 A.2d 1000 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The defendant claims that it was denied due process of law when the court required the defendant to defend the February 8, 2007 motion for contempt. Specifically, the defendant claims that it was not afforded adequate notice of the contempt motion and a meaningful opportunity to prepare a defense because its counsel had received the motion just before 5 p.m. on February 8, 2007, while preparing for the matters previously scheduled, and was required to defend it on the morning of February 9, 2007.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">It is well established that \u201c[i]t is fundamental in proper judicial administration that no matter shall be decided unless the parties have fair notice that it will be presented in sufficient time to prepare themselves upon the issue.\u201d <em>Osterlund v. State, </em>129 Conn. 591, 596, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>30 A.2d 393 (1943). The defendant was given less than one day to consider a motion for contempt, which consisted of four pages of allegations, four exhibits totaling in excess of a dozen pages and a request for sanctions that included a statement on the defendant\u2019s website disavowing its prior posting and stating that its posting was improper and in violation of the court\u2019s order. In addition, when he received the motion for contempt, the defendant\u2019s attorney was in the midst of preparing for a previously scheduled hearing before the court. The defendant\u2019s attorney stated that he had not read the full text of the posting, that he had not been able to speak to the persons responsible for the website posting or anyone else and that he would like to speak to them about why they had posted the article. Finally, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney acknowledged that the defendant\u2019s counsel needed more time to respond and stated that he did not object to scheduling the motion for contempt for a hearing at a subsequent date. It is clear that the defendant\u2019s attorney was not afforded sufficient time to investigate, much less to prepare, a defense.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is unclear whether a different result would have been reached had the defendant\u2019s attorney been given time to prepare a defense to the motion for contempt, but a denial of due process of law cannot be justified by that uncertainty. See id., 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The judgment finding the defendant in contempt is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to vacate the contempt finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\"> The trial court certified the case as a class action on behalf of the named plaintiff, the town of New Hartford, and sixty-nine similarly situated municipalities, which comprise the entire membership of the Mid-Connecticut Project.

Consequently, we will confine our review to the rights afforded by the federal constitution. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>280 Conn. 686, 689 n.2, 911 A.2d 1055 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>278 Conn. 620, 623-24 n.4, 899 A.2d 1 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> The defendant also argues that the court improperly found that it had violated the terms of the November 20, 2006 order by employing an overly broad understanding of that order and held the defendant in contempt without first making a finding of wilful violation. Because we reverse the judgment of contempt on due process grounds, we decline to address these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 9-10 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe judicial authority at any stage of an action under this section may require such security and impose such terms as shall fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class in whose behalf the action is brought or defended. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\"> The court issued the gag order and the contempt finding contemporaneously, after a hearing at which the defendant was found in contempt of a prior gag order. The court never mentioned Practice Book \u00a7 9-10 as the source of its authority. In addition, when the court addressed the defendant\u2019s subsequent motion to stay the gag order on March 22, 2007, it clarified that the gag order was imposed as a sanction for the contempt finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> The defendant asks only that we vacate the gag order and does not suggest that any further remedy is warranted. In light of the defendant\u2019s limited request and the absence of any indication that the gag order affected the result of the trial, which already had concluded when the order was imposed, we need not address the claim that the gag order was unjustified and unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b515-5\"> The plaintiffs argue that the three claims were taken from a report issued to the plaintiffs by a class action advisory committee and falsely were attributed to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney on the defendant\u2019s website.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b515-6\"> The motion for contempt was accompanied by four exhibits: (1) a transcript of the court\u2019s November 20, 2006 order; (2) the class action advisory committee report and a letter from the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to the defendant\u2019s attorney regarding the prejudgment remedy; (3) the February 1,2007 website posting; and (4) the e-mail from Nonnenmacher to a representative of the named plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> The hearing was scheduled to determine whether the defendant could distribute certain moneys to the plaintiffs before the court rendered judgment. The court also dealt with a motion for prejudgment remedy filed by the plaintiffs. See New <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery </em>Authority, 291 Conn. 502, 970 A.2d 578 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b516-4\"> The letter, which also was a press release, is dated January 25, 2007, and outlines a proposed plan of distribution to the plaintiffs of certain settlement funds and indicates that the funds would be distributed. The plaintiffs, however, were seeking to attach those funds and the defendant had agreed that it would give prior notification to the court of any planned distribution of the funds so that the plaintiffs would have an opportunity to object. The letter was introduced as a court exhibit for identification without objection. Defense counsel accepted the unsworn representations of a representative of the city of Hartford, one of the plaintiffs, that the letter had been sent by facsimile to the city\u2019s chief operating officer. Normally we would find the court\u2019s reliance on unsworn testimony in determining contempt improper, but we will not do so when, as in the present case, the attorney of the alleged contemnor induces the error by encouraging the court not to swear in a witness. Cf. <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>197 Conn. 141, 152-54, 496 A.2d 476 (1985); id., 155 (\u201cwe cannot countenance a finding of contempt based upon unsworn \u2018testimony\u2019 \u201d); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>54 Conn.

We have recognized that \u201ca contempt finding has collateral consequences, even when no longer \u2018active,\u2019 unless or until it is vacated or rendered invalid. See <em>Scalo </em>v. <em>Mandanici, </em>179 Conn. 140, 146-47, 425 A.2d 1272 (1979); <em>Sgarellino </em>v. <em>Hightower, </em>13 Conn. App. 591, 594-95, 538 A.2d 1065 (1988).\u201d <em>Kendall v.

In light of the continuing litigation between the parties and the continuing imposition of gag orders on the parties, the court\u2019s contempt finding may well impact the defendant in the future. See <em>Sgarellino </em>v. <em>Hightower, </em>supra, 594-95 (\u201c[A] future citation for contempt, given the first finding of contempt which is the subject of this case, would make the defendant appear more recalcitrant than he might be, in fact.

During that hearing, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201cThe Court: I mean, by definition, any gag order is going to have a certain chilling effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Right, but I interpreted your gag order to mean the parties shouldn\u2019t have direct communications with each other about this or with the press, but you know, [the plaintiffs] may be talking about this with their town councils, [the defendant] may be talking about this at our board meetings, and I didn\u2019t think that would be drawn into the gag order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I don\u2019t\u2014I mean, you\u2019re going to have to explain to me why you really .... The litigation\u2019s pending. There\u2019s been a trial. There\u2019s now an order for a [prejudgment remedy] on these moneys. I understand there has to be additional planning for the budget and there has to be talk about how you\u2019re going to set the tip fees and whatnot, but why does there need to be a conversation on the pending litigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, one simple reason would be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201cThe Court: It is what it is. It is what it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEe\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Right. But . . . what would happen is\u2014and this is what they fear\u2014is that all right, [the defendant\u2019s chief financial officer] makes a presentation to the board about the present budget that was adopted by the finance committee and he says, \u2018The budget as adopted by the finance committee has to be changed because of the [prejudgment remedy] ruling. We\u2019re not defeasing. That\u2019s worth $1 a ton. We have to figure out if we can defease with some [other] money . . . .\u2019 Now, that\u2014I didn\u2019t think that was a discussion that would fall within your order, but you\u2019re . . . suggesting it might be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajz\">\u201cThe Court: Well ... let me say this: What you said before\u2014what you just described\u2014is fine with the court, but if you start going\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyO\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: But how do I know where the line is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A83\">\u201cThe Court: ... I think what the court\u2019s going to have to do is you have your meeting, you do up your minutes, the court\u2019s going to have to approve it before it goes out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABBG\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: So you\u2019re comfortable with a broad range of discussion at the meeting, but the\u2014it's the minutes themselves that get posted on the website that might have to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apn-dedup-1\">\u201cThe Court: Well . . . as . . . [the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] mentioned, I mean, the problem is if the press is there, it\u2019s going to get out. The court has entered an order. I think the order is\u2014is pretty clear. When I said obviously you have to do business, obviously, I\u2019m not going to stop you from doing business, but the reason for the order was what this court perceived was a clear violation of a prior order of the court. There was no question in the court\u2019s mind that it was a violation and it was used through a posting on your website and the court doesn\u2019t want to see a violation through a posting of the minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avr-dedup-0\">\u201cYou know ... if they want to discuss it, why can\u2019t they go into executive session to discuss it? What you said about the lawsuit you\u2019ve got these funds, you can\u2019t use the funds because of the [prejudgment remedy], therefore, you have to have a discussion of what to do with the tip fee and setting the tip fee, period. Why is there a need to discuss the litigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqo\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019m not saying there is, but it\u2019s hard for me to predict what board members will want to talk about when they get into the boardroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhW\">\u201cThe Court: Well, the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av1\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And\u2014and you know, I don\u2019t want them to be reluctant or afraid to talk because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADZ\">\u201cThe Court: Well, they have to be reluctant to talk about the litigation. The order is the order. They cannot talk about the litigation. That\u2019s it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b522-6\"> Although the defendant <em>challenged its opportunity to prepare and not its opportunity to present a defense, </em>it should be noted that the court found the defendant in contempt after accepting the plaintiffs\u2019 exhibits and hearing argument from the attorneys, but without providing an opportunity for the defendant to put on evidence to support a claim that it had not wilfully violated the court\u2019s order. \u201cDue process of law requires that one charged with contempt of court be advised of the charges against [it and] have a reasonable opportunity to meet them by way of defense or explanation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>228 Conn. 630, 637, 637 A.2d 1111 (1994). Thus, the defendant was denied an opportunity to prepare and to present a defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b523-6\"> We are not unsympathetic to the court\u2019s desire to maintain the integrity of its order and to protect the interests of the plaintiffs, especially in light of what the court perceived as a blatant violation. The court, however, had the power to immediately order the defendant to remove the offending website posting and to postpone the hearing on contempt to another day. See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>13 Conn. App. 355, 367, 536 A.2d 985 (1988) (\u201cin a contempt proceeding, even in the absence of a finding of contempt, a trial court has broad discretion to make whole any party who has suffered as a result of another party\u2019s failure to comply with a court order\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
