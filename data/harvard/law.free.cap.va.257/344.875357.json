(Gordonsville) entitle Virginia Power to recover liquidated damages for an 11-day period in which Gordonsville\u2019s electric power plant was \u201cshut down\u201d due to a mechanical failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Under the parties\u2019 \u201cPower Purchase and Operating Agreement\u201d (the Contract), Gordonsville agreed to build a $200 million electric power facility capable of producing electricity for sale exclusively to Virginia Power. The Gordonsville facility consists of two identical electric generating plants, designated as Unit 1 and Unit 2. The outage at issue in this dispute involves Unit 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Article 8 of the Contract, entitled \u201cInterconnection,\u201d provides in \u00a7 8.2 that Gordonsville \u201cshall be responsible for the design, construction, installation, maintenance and ownership of the Facility.\u201d \u201cThe Facility\u201d is defined as including \u201call energy producing equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Gordonsville facility began operating in June 1994. When Virginia Power requires electricity from Gordonsville, Virginia Power \u201cdispatches\u201d Gordonsville by notifying it of the number of kilowatts required. Gordonsville responds by producing the electricity and supplying it to Virginia Power\u2019s distribution system. Since the Gordonsville facility went into service in 1994, Virginia Power has \u201cdispatched\u201d Gordonsville only about 15 to 20 percent of the time. A typical dispatch of the Gordonsville facility lasts four to six hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Virginia Power makes two types of payments to Gordonsville under the Contract. The first type is made for Gordonsville\u2019s' \u201cNet Electrical Output,\u201d or the net amount of kilowatt hours of electricity actually delivered by Gordonsville to Virginia Power. This payment amount varies from month to month.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The second type of payment, termed \u201cCapacity Payments,\u201d is a fixed monthly payment for Gordonsville\u2019s \u201cDependable Capacity,\u201d which represents the amount of electricity available for dispatch at Virginia Power\u2019s request from the Gordonsville facility. The Capacity Payments were designed to compensate Gordonsville for the costs incurred in building its facility, as well as the fixed costs related to operating and maintaining the facility. At the time this dispute arose, Virginia Power was obligated under the Contract to make Capacity Payments of about $1.2 million per month, or $40,000 per day, for each of the two units in the Gordonsville facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The Contract defines two types of \u201coutages\u201d that may occur when either unit of Gordonsville\u2019s facility is unavailable for a potential dispatch request from Virginia Power. A \u201cScheduled Outage\u201d is a planned interruption in the operation of a unit of the facility that has been coordinated in advance with Virginia Power for the purpose of conducting inspections or routine maintenance. During Scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Outages, Virginia Power remains obligated to make Capacity Payments to Gordonsville.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">A \u201cForced Outage\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1.18 of the Contract as \u201c[a]n occurrence where: (i) any or all of [a unit\u2019s] Dependable Capacity is not available for Dispatch; or (ii) [a unit\u2019s] delivery of Net Electrical Output deviates from Virginia Power\u2019s Dispatch level by greater than \u00b15%.\u201d Section 1.20 defines a \u201cForced Outage Day\u201d as \u201c[a] continuous twenty-four (24) hour period (a) beginning with the start of a Forced Outage, regardless of the number of actual outages that may occur during such twenty-four (24) hour period(s), and (b) designated by [Gordonsville] as a Forced Outage Day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">A \u201cForce Majeure Day\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1.19 as \u201ca Forced Outage Day that is both (i) excused under the provisions of Article 14 and (ii) . . . designated as a Force Majeure Day by [Gordonsville].\u201d Section 14.1 of the Contract provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">[N] either Party shall be responsible or hable for or deemed in breach hereof because of any delay or failure in the performance of their respective obligations hereunder to the extent that such delay or failure is <em>due solely to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Party experiencing such delay or failure, including but not limited to </em>acts of God; unusually severe weather conditions; strikes or other labor difficulties; war; riots; requirements, actions or failures to act on the part of governmental authorities preventing performance; inability despite due diligence to obtain, maintain or renew required licenses; accident; fire; <em>damage to or breakdown of power generation materials and equipment that is not caused by normal wear and tear, </em>or transportation delays or accidents. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Under the Contract, Gordonsville is allowed a specified number of Forced Outage Days during the facility\u2019s initial six months of operation and for each one-year period thereafter throughout the 30-year term of the Contract. The Contract further provides in \u00a7 10.18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">The Parties agree that Virginia Power will be substantially damaged in amounts that will be difficult or impossible to determine if . . . the Facility exceeds the allowance for Forced Outage Days . . . Therefore, ... the Parties have agreed on sums which the Parties agree are reasonable as liquidated damages for such occurrences. It is further understood and agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>that the payment of the liquidated damages is in lieu of actual damages for such occurrences. [Gordonsville] hereby waives any defense as to the validity of any liquidated damages stated in this Agreement as they may appear on the grounds that such liquidated damages are void as penalties or are not reasonably related to actual damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">For each Forced Outage Day in excess of the allowed number, \u00a7 10.15 of the Contract directs that Virginia Power\u2019s Capacity Payments will be reduced by $600,000 per day as liquidated damages. The Contract also states that this liquidated damages provision does not apply if a Forced Outage Day qualifies as a Force Majeure Day. However, the Contract relieves Virginia Power of its obligation to make Capacity Payments to Gordonsville for such Force Majeure Days.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In September 1995, while Unit 1 was operating under a dispatch from Virginia Power, an alarm indicated an electrical short circuit inside the Unit\u2019s 100-ton steam turbine generator. The generator had been manufactured for Gordonsville by General Electric Company (General Electric), one of two manufacturers of that type generator in the United States. Gordonsville personnel performed tests on the generator for several days, but were not able to determine the cause of the short circuit. On September 9, 1995, Kenneth Nieman, the executive director of the Gordonsville facility, decided to \u201cshut down\u201d Unit 1 and \u201ctake it off line\u201d so that the generator problem could be diagnosed and repaired. On September 12, 1995, Gordonsville notified Virginia Power that Unit 1 was experiencing an event of Force Majeure and was unavailable for dispatch until further notice. Personnel from General Electric and Gordonsville disassembled the generator and shipped its 17-ton rotor to a General Electric facility in Richmond, where it was determined that a copper \u201cpole-to-pole\u201d connector inside the rotor had failed. Unit 1 was returned to service on September 20, 1995, 11 days after it had been \u201cshut down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Avk\">Virginia Power concluded that the 11 outage days in September 1995, did not qualify as Force Majeure Days and informed Gordonsville that, for this reason, those days constituted unexcused Forced Outage Days under the Contract. Virginia Power also informed Gordonsville that it previously had exhausted its allowance of Forced Outage Days. Virginia Power asserted a claim against Gordonsville for a total of $6.6 million in liquidated damages under the Contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>for the 11-day period, and began withholding $600,000 per month from its payments to Gordonsville.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Gordonsville filed a motion for judgment against Virginia Power in the trial court, alleging breach of contract based on Virginia Power\u2019s \u201cwrongful assessment of liquidated damages\u201d as a result of the September 1995 outage. In Count I, Gordonsville alleged that all 11 days of the September 1995 outage were Force Majeure Days and that, therefore, Virginia Power was not entitled to liquidated damages. Gordonsville alleged in the alternative in Count II that even if the September 1995 outage did not result from a Force Majeure event, Gordonsville was entitled to count three of the outage days as allowed Forced Outage Days. Thus, Gordonsville alleged that Virginia Power was not entitled to $1.8 million of the $6.6 million claimed in liquidated damages. In Count V, Gordonsville essentially alleged that the liquidated damages clause of the Contract was an unenforceable penalty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The trial court sustained Virginia Power\u2019s demurrer and plea of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel addressed to Count V, holding that it was bound by its ruling on the same issue in an earlier action between the parties, which arose from two unrelated outages at the Gordonsville facility in June-July 1994, and February 1995. In that earlier action, the court had ruled that the liquidated damages provision of the Contract was not an unenforceable penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The trial court ruled in the alternative that even if this issue was not barred by <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel, Virginia Power was entitled to summary judgment on Count V. Based on its assumption that the evidence in the pending case concerning the liquidated damages clause would not differ from the evidence presented in the prior action, the court awarded summary judgment for Virginia Power on Count V for \u201creasons of judicial economy,\u201d but permitted Gordonsville to submit a written offer of proof for the court\u2019s consideration. Following Gordonsville\u2019s submission of the offer of proof, the trial court entered an order affirming its award of summary judgment for Virginia Power on Count V.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The trial court then considered the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment on Count II. In the prior action between the parties, the jury had found that the June-July 1994 and February 1995 outages were caused by Force Majeure events. Gordonsville argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>that because of that finding, those outage days could not be counted toward the number of Forced Outage Days allowed under the Contract. Gordonsville argued, therefore, that it still had three allowed Forced Outage Days available to be applied to the September 1995 outage. The trial court ruled that although the earlier 1994 and 1995 outage days constituted Force Majeure Days, they also constituted Forced Outage Days under the terms of the Contract, and that these outage days must be counted in computing Gordonsville\u2019s allowed number of Forced Outage Days. The trial court awarded summary judgment for Virginia Power on Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The claims asserted in Count I were tried before a jury. Thomas Butler, who qualified as an expert in mechanical engineering, testified that the pole-to-pole connector in the generator rotor of Unit 1 failed because it had been improperly brazed, or soldered, during its manufacture and assembly. Butler further testified that the connector did not fail due to normal wear and tear, and that there was nothing Gordonsville \u201ccould [have] or should have done\u201d to prevent failure of the connector.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Robert Hamilton, a retired mechanical engineer who had worked for General Electric for about 36 years, also testified as an expert witness. He explained that the General Electric workers who manufactured and assembled the pole-to-pole connector used in the Gordonsville generator were required to follow detailed drawings. In essence, Hamilton testified that one of the drawings contained a mistake and deviated from the actual design requirements because the drawing showed a rigid, brazed piece, rather than a flexible piece, extending into an area of the connector. Hamilton concluded that the Gordonsville generator failed due to the inability of the defective pole-to-pole connector to withstand normal wear and tear. He further testified that a properly manufactured pole-to-pole connector should not wear out, but should \u201clast forever.\u201d In Hamilton\u2019s opinion, if the Gordonsville pole-to-pole connector had been manufactured in accordance with General Electric\u2019s own design requirements, the generator failure would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In contrast to Hamilton\u2019s testimony, Robert Fenton, a retired electrical engineer who was formerly a general manager of generator design and engineering at General Electric, testified that there was nothing General Electric could have done differently that would have prevented the failure of the pole-to-pole connector in Gordonsville\u2019s generator. In Fenton\u2019s opinion, the failure of the Gordonsville generator was a \u201crandom, unexpected failure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Over Gordonsville\u2019s objection, the trial court gave the jury Instruction No. 10, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">Gordonsville Energy is responsible to Virginia Power under the parties\u2019 contract for the design and construction of Gordonsville Energy\u2019s electric generating facility, including the steam turbine generator, its rotor and the rotor\u2019s component parts that failed in September, 1995. Although Gordonsville Energy relied on General Electric Company to design and construct the rotor, Gordonsville Energy is responsible to Virginia Power for General Electric\u2019s performance of those activities just as if Gordonsville Energy had performed them itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The jury returned its verdict in favor of Virginia Power, finding that \u201cthe [September 1995] outage was not a <em>force majeure </em>event.\u201d The trial court entered final judgment in favor of Virginia Power, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Gordonsville first argues that the trial court erred in granting Instruction No. 10 because the instruction improperly directed the jury to impute to Gordonsville any act of negligence by General Electric. Gordonsville also asserts that, as a matter of law, the outage in September 1995 was a Force Majeure event under the terms of the Contract because there was no evidence of negligence by Gordonsville. Thus, it contends that the jury was required by the evidence to find that the September 1995 outage was \u201cbeyond the control\u201d of Gordonsville and resulted in Force Majeure Days under the Contract. We disagree with Gordonsville\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In granting Instruction No. 10, the trial court ruled that the Contract did not excuse Gordonsville\u2019s failure to perform under the Contract if the failure was caused by the negligence of a subcontractor retained by Gordonsville to perform functions for which Gordonsville was responsible. Under familiar principles of contract interpretation, we reach the same conclusion and hold that the trial court did not err in granting Instruction No. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">It is the duty of the court, not the jury, to interpret a contract when its terms are clear and unambiguous. <em>D.C. McClain, Inc. v. Arlington County, </em>249 Va. 131, 135, 452 S.E.2d 659, 662 (1995); <em>Winn v. Aleda Const. Co., </em>227 Va. 304, 307, 315 S.E.2d 193, 194 (1984). The court must interpret the contract as a whole to determine the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Westmoreland-LG&amp;E Partners v. Virginia Elec. and Power Co., </em>254 Va. 1, 11, 486 S.E.2d 289, 294 (1997). Since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>interpretation of plain and unambiguous terms of a contract is a question of law, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s determination and are afforded the same opportunity as the trial court to review the contract provisions. <em>C.F. Garcia Enterprises, Inc. v. Enterprise Ford Tractor, Inc., </em>253 Va. 104, 107, 480 S.E.2d 497, 498-99 (1997); <em>Tuomala </em>v. <em>Regent Univ., </em>252 Va. 368, 374, <em>477 </em>S.E.2d 501, 505 (1996); <em>Langman v. Alumni Ass\u2019n of the Univ. of Va., </em>247 Va. 491, 498, 442 S.E.2d 669, 674 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">In \u00a7 8.2 of the Contract, the parties agreed, in plain and unambiguous language, that Gordonsville was \u201cresponsible for the design, construction [and] installation\u201d of the Facility, which is defined in \u00a7 1.16 of the Contract as \u201call energy producing equipment.\u201d In a later section of the Contract, \u00a7 14.1, the parties agreed that an outage would be excused if it was \u201cdue solely to circumstances beyond [Gordonsville\u2019s] reasonable control. . . including . . . damage to or breakdown of power generation materials and equipment that is not caused by normal wear and tear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The provisions of \u00a7 14.1 do not override or alter the allocation of responsibilities set out in \u00a7 8.2. By its plain terms, \u00a7 14.1 does not purport to address the duties of parties to the Contract. Instead, that section addresses the circumstances under which the failure of performance of contractual duties will be excused as Force Majeure days. Thus, under the Contract, Gordonsville remained responsible for the contractual obligations it subcontracted to General Electric and was excused from performance only if an outage also was \u201cbeyond the reasonable control\u201d of any subcontractors hired to perform Gordonsville\u2019s duties set forth in \u00a7 8.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The evidence did not establish as a matter of law that the September 1995 outage was beyond Gordonsville\u2019s reasonable control. The evidence showed that the failure of the pole-to-pole connector was either a random, unexpected occurrence or the result of negligence by General Electric. In returning its verdict in favor of Virginia Power, the jury necessarily rejected the proposition that the failure was a random, unexpected occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Gordonsville next contends that the trial court erred in holding that the Force Majeure Days from the previous 1994 and 1995 outages should be counted against Gordonsville\u2019s allowance of Forced Outage Days. Gordonsville argues that summary judgment on Count II should have been entered in its favor, because a Force Majeure day is an <em>excused </em>\u201cForced Outage Day\u201d for which Gordonsville merely loses its Capacity Payment under \u00a7 10.15 of the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>In response, Virginia Power argues that the Contract specifically designates Force Majeure Days as Forced Outage Days. Thus, Virginia Power contends that the trial court properly concluded that the earlier Force Majeure Days had to be included in Gordonsville\u2019s allotment of Forced Outage Days. We disagree and hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Virginia Power on Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">As the trial court correctly noted, \u00a7 1.19 of the Contract defines a Force Majeure Day as \u201ca Forced Outage Day that is . . . excused under the provisions of Article 14.\u201d When contract terms are clear and unambiguous, the words used by the parties must be given their plain and ordinary meanings. <em>Hutter v. Heilmann, </em>252 Va. 227, 231, 475 S.E.2d 267, 270 (1996); <em>Marina Shores, Ltd. v. Cohn-Phillips, Ltd., </em>246 Va. 222, 225-26, 435 S.E.2d 136, 138 (1993). In the context of the Contract provisions, the usual and customary meaning of the term \u201cexcuse\u201d is \u201cto grant [an] exemption ... to or from.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 794 (1993). The Contract only limits the scope of the exemption for Force Majeure Days by eliminating the Capacity Payment of about $40,000 to Gordonsville for each such day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the Contract does not otherwise limit the exemption provided for Force Majeure Days, such days are excused, or exempted, under the Contract from being counted toward the number of allowed Forced Outage Days.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">This conclusion also is supported by the plain language of \u00a7 14.4, which provides that \u201ceach Day of a Forced Outage excused under this Article 14 shall be considered a Forced Outage Day unless [Gordonsville] appropriately designates such Day as a Force Majeure Day.\u201d This language compels the conclusion that a day that <em>is </em>appropriately designated as a Force Majeure Day and is excused under Article 14 is not \u201cconsidered a Forced Outage Day\u201d under the terms of the Contract. Thus, the trial court erred in ruling that the earlier 1994 and 1995 Force Majeure Days were Forced Outage Days chargeable to Gordonsville in computing the number of Forced Outage Days allowed under the Contract. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court erred in awarding summary judgment for Virginia Power on Count II and in failing to award summary judgment for Gordonsville on that Count.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Finally, Gordonsville argues that the trial court erred in dismissing Count V of the motion for judgment because Gordonsville\u2019s offer of proof established that the liquidated damages clause of the Contract constituted an unenforceable penalty. Virginia Power responds, in part, that Gordonsville is barred from contesting the reasonableness of the liquidated damages clause since it waived in the Contract the right to raise such an objection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Contract provides in \u00a7 10.18 that Gordonsville \u201cwaives any defense as to the validity of any liquidated damages stated in this Agreement as they may appear on the grounds that such liquidated damages are void as penalties or are not reasonably related to actual damages.\u201d Nevertheless, Gordonsville argues that it should be relieved from this contractual obligation because such a waiver violates public policy. We disagree with Gordonsville\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">This Court has recognized that a liquidated damages provision may constitute a penalty and, therefore, be unenforceable when the amount agreed to is \u201cout of all proportion to the probable loss.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Bankson, </em>248 Va. 197, 208, 445 S.E.2d 473, 479 (1994); <em>Taylor v. Sanders, </em>233 Va. 73, 75, 353 S.E.2d 745, 746-47 (1987). Such a provision also may constitute an unenforceable penalty if the agreed amount is \u201cgrossly in excess of actual damages.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brian v. Langley School, </em>256 Va. 547, 551, 507 S.E.2d 363, 365 (1998). However, it is equally well-settled that a term of the parties\u2019 contract becomes the law of the case unless such term is repugnant to public policy or to some rule of law. <em>Rash </em>v. <em>Hilb, Rogal &amp; Hamilton Co. of Richmond, </em>251 Va. 281, 285, 467 S.E.2d 791, 794 (1996); <em>D.C. McClain, Inc., </em>249 Va. at 135, 452 S.E.2d at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We decline to hold that Gordonsville\u2019s contractual waiver of the right to object to a liquidated damages clause is \u201crepugnant to public policy.\u201d We long have recognized that a party may enter into an agreement in which he waives a significant right. <em>See e.g., Blue Cross of Southwestern Va. </em>v. <em>McDevitt &amp; Street Co., </em>234 Va. 191, 196-97, 360 S.E.2d 825, 828 (1987) (waiver of right to claim dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ages); <em>Flintkote Co. v. W.W. Wilkinson, Inc., </em>220 Va. 564, 570, 260 S.E.2d 229, 232 (1979) (waiver of right to jury trial on amount of attorney\u2019s fees); <em>VNB Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Lone Star Indus., Inc., </em>215 Va. 366, 369, 209 S.E.2d 909, 912 (1974) (waiver of right to file mechanic\u2019s lien).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Generally, a party may waive by contract any right conferred by law or contract. <em>See Roenke </em>v. <em>Virginia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>209 Va. 128, 135, 161 S.E.2d 704, 709 (1968); <em>Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Soc. v. Grant, </em>185 Va. 288, 299, 38 S.E.2d 450, 454 (1946). If the party being charged with relinquishment of a right had knowledge of the right and intended to waive it, the waiver will be enforced. <em>Roenke, </em>209 Va. at 135, 161 S.E.2d at 709; <em>Woodmen, </em>185 Va. at 299, 38 S.E.2d at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Gordonsville raised no allegation at trial and presented no evidence that it entered into \u00a7 10.18 of the Contract under duress, or as the result of fraud or mistake, or under any other circumstances that might serve as a basis for declaring the waiver unenforceable. Instead, the evidence at trial established that the entire Contract resulted from extended, \u201carms-length\u201d negotiations between two sophisticated corporate entities, both represented by counsel. Therefore, we conclude that Gordonsville\u2019s contractual waiver is enforceable and bars its claims alleged in Count V.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">For these reasons, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Virginia Power on Counts I and V. We will also reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment on Count II and enter final judgment in favor of Gordonsville on that Count.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-9\"> Gordonsville alleged two other Counts in its motion for judgment that are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"> This limitation of exemption is contained in \u00a7 10.15(b) of the Contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\"> Virginia Power argues on appeal that an additional, independent basis exists for affirming the trial court\u2019s award of summary judgment in its favor on Count n. Virginia Power argues that Gordonsville\u2019s motion for judgment alleged that the <em>last </em>three days of the September 1995 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>outage should be counted as allowed Forced Outage Days, when Gordonsville should have alleged that the <em>first </em>three days of the outage were allowed. Since this claim was not raised before the trial court, we will not address it for the first time on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5:25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b375-11\"> We find no merit in Gordonsville\u2019s contention that Virginia Power is procedurally barred from asserting that Gordonsville waived its objection to the Contract\u2019s liquidated damages provision, because Virginia Power did not assign cross-error to an alleged ruling by the trial court that the waiver was unenforceable. The trial court did not rule on this issue in this action and did not expressly adopt such a ruling from the earlier action. Thus, an assignment of cross-error was not required under Rule 5:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\"> Since Gordonsville waived any objection to the reasonableness of the liquidated damages clause, we do not address Gordonsville\u2019s assignment of error concerning the trial court\u2019s application of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel to bar relitigation of the validity of the liquidated damages provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
