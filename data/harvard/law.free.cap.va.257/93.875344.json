Hussen was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County of the rape and forcible sodomy of Donyala G. Hucaby and sentenced to serve 15 years in the penitentiary. The circuit court confirmed the verdicts, and the Court of Appeals denied the defendant\u2019s petition for appeal. The defendant filed a habeas corpus petition and asserted that his former appellate counsel failed to seek an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The Commonwealth agreed, and we held that the defendant was entitled to pursue a delayed appeal to this Court. We awarded the defendant an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">We will summarize the relevant facts and inferences deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below. <em>See Davidson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 129, 132, 419 S.E.2d 656, 658 (1992). The defendant met Hucaby during a party at Howard University in September 1993. The defendant, who was a stranger to Hucaby, approached her at the party while she was conversing with friends. The defendant told Hucaby that he was a member of an entertainment group and inquired whether she was interested in working for the group. The defendant asked Hucaby her name, address, and telephone number, which she provided to him. The defendant told Hucaby that he \u201cfound [her] attractive\u201d and asked if they could \u201cgo out to dinner sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The next evening, the defendant made a telephone call to Hucaby, who was not in her dormitory at the time of the call. The defendant left a message on her answering machine. The defendant called Hucaby later that night, around 12:15 a.m., and asked if he could see her. She decided to go out with him because she thought they might have a late dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">The defendant arrived at Hucaby\u2019s dormitory room and informed her that his roommate had given him a ride there. He asked if they could go to his house. In response to Hucaby\u2019s question, \u201cwhy are we going to your house?\u201d, the defendant replied that his sister had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>prepared a meal and he wanted to \u201cget to know [Hucaby] better.\u201d Hucaby told the defendant that she did not intend to \u201cdo anything [of a sexual nature], if that was his intention\u201d and further stated, \u201cI\u2019m practicing abstinence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The defendant\u2019s roommate drove the defendant and Hucaby to the defendant\u2019s house in Fairfax. They arrived at the house about 2:00 a.m. Hucaby told the defendant that she needed to return to her dormitory no later than 4:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Upon arrival at the defendant\u2019s house, Hucaby used a telephone to call her roommate to let her know that Hucaby had arrived safely. After she finished speaking to her roommate, Hucaby talked to the defendant in the kitchen for a while. There, he made an effort to kiss her, but she rejected his advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The defendant suggested that Hucaby accompany him to his bedroom because he did not have any furniture in other rooms in the house. She went to his bedroom which contained a mattress on the floor adjacent to a wall, a box spring adjacent to another wall, and a lamp. The defendant closed the bedroom door, and Hucaby sat on the mattress. They conversed for a while and, during the conversation, the defendant repeatedly asked Hucaby for a kiss. Eventually, they kissed for about \u201cfour seconds,\u201d and they began to talk some more.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">During this conversation, Hucaby informed the defendant that she was a virgin. Subsequently, Hucaby looked at her watch and realized that the time was about 3:40 a.m., and she told the defendant she needed to return to her dormitory. The defendant, who had previously promised Hucaby that his roommate would drive her home, responded that his roommate had gone, but that he would be back. The defendant\u2019s roommate, however, never returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Hucaby, who felt \u201cstranded\u201d at the defendant\u2019s house, told him that she was very sleepy and she needed to go home. The defendant responded that she could go to sleep at his home until someone was able to take her back to her dormitory.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Hucaby, who was fully clothed, got into the defendant\u2019s bed. She told him that she was going to go to sleep. After about 10 seconds, the defendant told her that he wanted to be affectionate. She tried to move away from him, and she told him that she did not \u201cwant to be affectionate.\u201d He grabbed her arm and told her \u201cnot to be foul.\u201d She tried to push him away. He tried to kiss her as she tried to push him away. He put his hand around her throat and said, \u201c[y]ou came into this house under your own free will, and I can make it seem as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>though you were never here. And no one will say you were here.\u201d He also told her that \u201cI have something under the bed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The defendant told Hucaby to remove her clothes. When she refused, he removed her clothes and raped her. After he raped her, he forced her to perform an act of oral sodomy upon him. Then, he raped her again. After he raped Hucaby, the defendant went to sleep. Hucaby went to sleep, and when she awakened, it was still dark outside. She called her roommate and obtained directions to the nearest location of the public transportation system. She went to the public transportation system and rode a subway to her dormitory.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Hucaby did not inform anyone that she had been raped and sodomized until three days later, when she went to the Howard University Medical Center. She was examined by Dr. Jean Williams, who determined that Hucaby had sustained a laceration approximately one-half centimeter just below her vaginal introitos, which is the area just below the vaginal opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">During the trial, Suzanne L. Brown, a sexual assault nurse examiner at Fairfax Hospital, qualified as an expert witness. She was permitted, over the defendant\u2019s objection, to give the following testimony which is at issue in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">\u201cQ Now that you\u2019ve been qualified as an expert. You have received medical information concerning Donyala Hucaby, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">\u201cA Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">\u201cQ With that information can you form a professional opinion based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty as what would be consistent with an injury such as that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">\u201cA Yes, I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">\u201cQ Knowing what you know about the injury and knowing \u2014 let\u2019s talk now about the female response, normal female response. Is there a term for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-13\">\u201cA Yes, the human sexual response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-14\">\u201cQ And tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury please what it is, this human sexual response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>\u201cA The human sexual response is a [sic] involuntary what happens during or just prior to sexual intercourse and a lot of it has to do with \u2014 the first phase is when the person is sexually excited causing lubricant to form in the vaginal area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">\u201cThe second part of that causes some actual structural changes to the entire vaginal area. One of the changes that occurs is that the labia majora which are the outer lips of the vaginal opening actually thin out and flatten against the wall of the vagina. After \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\u201cQ Where was this injury with respect to where you\u2019re speaking of now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u201cA Just below the vaginal opening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">\u201cQ Okay. After the outer labia majora flattens out then the smaller lips, the labia minora, will engorge and actually move away from the vaginal opening to allow for a penis to enter the vagina. The vagina will also elongate causing a little bit of a shelving area to guide the penis into the vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">\u201cQ Now, with what you know about the human sexual response and with what you know about the injuries that Donyala Hucaby received can you give \u2014 let me add something to that hypothetical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">\u201cSuppose for these questions that Donyala Hucaby was a virgin and that she had had sexual intercourse several days prior to being examined. Can you give an opinion as to whether or not these injuries were consistent with a first time intercourse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">\u201cMR. DEVINE: Your Honor, for the reasons I stated earlier I will object to that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: .... Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-13\">\u201cProceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">\u201cQ Please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury whether these injuries were consistent with a woman having sex for the first time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-15\">\u201cA They are not consistent with a virgin having sex for the first time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-16\">\u201cQ Are these injuries \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-17\">\u201cA JUROR: I didn\u2019t hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-18\">\u201cQ Could you please repeat that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u201cA I said that the injuries, when a virgin has sex for the first time this is not a typical area for an injury to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201cQ And we\u2019re speaking of consensual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u201cA Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The defendant, relying principally upon <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 534, 311 S.E.2d 769 (1984), and <em>Llamera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 262, 414 S.E.2d 597 (1992), argues that the trial court erred in allowing Brown to testify that the complaining witness\u2019 injury was not consistent with consensual sex because consent was an ultimate issue of fact at trial, and Brown\u2019s testimony impermissibly invaded the province of the jury. We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">We have held consistently that the admission of expert testimony upon an ultimate issue of fact is impermissible because it invades the function of the fact finder. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 333, 336, 492 S.E.2d 131, 132 (1997); <em>Llamera, </em>243 Va. at 264, 414 S.E.2d at 598; <em>Bond, </em>226 Va. at 538, 311 S.E.2d at 771-72; <em>Cartera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978); <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 24, 33, 129 S.E.2d 22, 29 (1963); <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 245, 250, 105 S.E.2d 155, 158 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">In <em>Bond, </em>we considered whether the circuit court misapplied this rule by permitting an expert witness to testify about the cause of the victim\u2019s death. The defendant had been charged with murder, and one of the issues that the Commonwealth was required to prove was whether the victim\u2019s death \u201cwas brought about by the criminal agency of another,\u201d which was an ultimate issue of fact. 226 Va. at 537, 311 S.E.2d at 771. The expert witness testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that he had \u201cmade a determination that [the victim\u2019s] death was as a result of a homicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the expert witness\u2019 testimony invaded the province of the jury because the ultimate factual issue to be decided by the jury was whether the victim jumped intentionally to her death, fell accidentally to her death, or was thrown to her death. <em>Id. </em>at 539, 311 S.E.2d at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">In <em>Llamera, </em>we also considered whether a circuit court improperly permitted an expert witness to express an opinion upon an ultimate fact in issue. There, a police detective, who had qualified as an expert witness on the subject of the sale, distribution, marketing, packaging, and effects of narcotics, opined that cocaine, which had been seized in the defendant\u2019s store, \u201cwas packaged that way for distribution.\u201d The detective testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>that the quantity of cocaine found \u201cwould suggest that the owner of the cocaine was a person who sold cocaine\u201d and that such quantity was inconsistent with personal use. <em>Llamera, </em>243 Va. at 264, 414 S.E.2d at 598. We held that the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant possessed the cocaine and that the defendant did so with the intent to distribute and that these elements were ultimate issues of fact to be resolved by the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 265, 414 S.E.2d at 599. We concluded that the challenged testimony was inadmissible because the detective expressed an opinion upon an ultimate issue of fact when he testified that the owner of the cocaine was a person who sold cocaine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The present appeal, however, is clearly distinguishable from, and is not controlled by, our decisions in <em>Llamera </em>and <em>Bond. </em>It is true, as the defendant here asserts, that the Commonwealth was required to prove, among other things, that he forced the victim to engage in sexual intercourse against her will. However, Brown\u2019s testimony was not an opinion that the sexual intercourse between the defendant and the victim was against her will. Rather, Brown\u2019s testimony, which must be viewed as a whole, reflects her opinion that the unique nature of the victim\u2019s laceration, particularly the location of the injury, was not <em>consistent </em>with consensual, first time intercourse. Such an opinion by this expert witness is not a comment on one of the ultimate issues of fact to be determined by the jury, that is, whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was against the victim\u2019s will. <em>See Davis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 728, 731-32, 406 S.E.2d 922, 923-24 (1991) (detective\u2019s testimony that a certain quantity of drugs was not consistent with personal use did not constitute an opinion that the defendant intended to distribute marijuana and, thus, did not invade the province of the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b119-8\">SENIOR JUSTICE POFF, with whom JUSTICE LACY and JUSTICE KEENAN</author>\n<p id=\"ARe\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The issue before this Court turns upon the testimony of a registered nurse employed by a hospital as a \u201cSexual Assault Nurse Examiner\u201d. The nurse qualified in the trial court as an expert in the examination of victims of sexual assault. Asked to explain the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u201chuman sexual response\u201d, the witness testified that \u201cthe first phase is when the person is sexually excited causing lubricant to form in the vaginal area\u201d and that the \u201csecond part of that causes some actual structural changes\u201d that enlarge access through \u201cthe vaginal opening\u201d. Basing her testimony on a doctor\u2019s report of his examination, the nurse said that Hucaby had sustained a \u201chalf a centimeter laceration just below ... the vaginal opening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Responding to questions posed by the prosecutor, the nurse then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">Question: Please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury whether these injuries were consistent with a woman having sex for the first time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">Answer: They are not consistent with a virgin having sex for the first time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">Question: Could you please repeat that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">Answer: I said that the injuries, when a virgin has sex for the first time this is not a typical area for an injury to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">Question: And we\u2019re speaking of consensual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">Answer: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">The trial judge overruled Hussen\u2019s objection to that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">The nurse\u2019s statement that the situs of Hucaby\u2019s injury was \u201cnot a typical area for an injury to be\u201d and her acknowledgement that she was \u201cspeaking of consensual\u201d was an expression of her expert opinion that the injury was the result of a sexual assault. The import of that language was reinforced by the nurse\u2019s further testimony when she agreed that \u201cwhen the human sexual response is triggered . . . injuries do not occur.\u201d Clearly, a lay juror would conclude that such testimony reflects the opinion of a witness, a witness qualified by the trial judge as an expert, that Hucaby\u2019s injury was one suffered by a person whose sexual response had not been triggered, <em>i.e., </em>that the sexual conduct was not consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">\u201cWe consistently have held that the admission of expert opinion upon an ultimate issue of fact is impermissible because it invades the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>function of the fact finder.\u201d <em>Llamera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 262, 264, 414 S.E.2d 597, 598 (1992) (holding inadmissible expert\u2019s opinion that quantity of cocaine seized was inconsistent with personal use and consistent with intent to distribute). Such an invasion of the function of the fact finder \u201cimplicates the due process and fair trial guarantees of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 333, 336, 492 S.E.2d 131, 132 (1997) (error in admission of expert opinion that child had been sexually abused was not harmless). As we said in <em>Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978), \u201cit was improper to permit the doctor to express his opinion that the girls had been raped. Whether rape had occurred was the precise and ultimate issue in the case.\u201d <em>See also Bond v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 534, 537, 311 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1984) (murder conviction reversed because expert \u201cruled out\u201d possibility of suicide and accident and classified victim\u2019s death as \u201cresult of a homicide\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Notwithstanding our decisions in these cases, the Commonwealth contends that \u201cthe Court of Appeals has held it proper for an expert to opine that a quantity of drugs in a defendant\u2019s possession was not consistent with personal use.\u201d The Commonwealth relies upon <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 728, 406 S.E.2d 922 (1991). But <em>Davis </em>did not hold that such testimony is \u201cproper\u201d if it constitutes an expert opinion on an ultimate fact in issue. Rather, the court held that the testimony was admissible only because it had not \u201cviolated this long-established rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731, 406 S.E.2d at 924. Specifically, the court said that \u201cwe find that [the expert\u2019s] testimony . . . did not constitute an opinion that Davis had an intent to distribute the marijuana found in his house.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 732, 406 S.E.2d at 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Citing ten other decisions of the Court of Appeals in criminal drug cases<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, the Commonwealth also argues that \u201cas a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>practice such [expert] testimony is routinely received.\u201d But the <em>admissibility </em>of expert opinion was no t in issue in those cases. In each, the issue was sufficiency of the evidence; expert testimony was discussed only as an adjunct to the circumstantial evidence underlying the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Here, as in <em>Cartera, </em>\u201c(w)hether rape had occurred was the precise and ultimate issue in the case.\u201d 219 Va. at 519, 248 S.E.2d at 786. The nurse\u2019s testimony on that question was an opinion of an expert. That opinion was patently prejudicious. I would hold that the trial judge erred in admitting that evidence, annul the conviction, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals denying Hussen\u2019s petition for appeal, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals with direction to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> The marijuana was found in the basement of Davis\u2019 house, and he was one of three occupants of the dwelling. Davis\u2019 cousin, one of the occupants, testified that he had purchased the marijuana and hidden it in the basement. The Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[a] given quantity of a controlled substance can be possessed jointly by several individuals. ... In such a case, that amount might be inconsistent with an individual\u2019s personal use, and yet not establish an intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 406 S.E.2d at 924. The Court concluded that the detective\u2019s testimony, considered in context with the facts and the jury instructions, was appropriate for the jury\u2019s consideration because it was not the ultimate issue in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\"> <em>Welshman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.
