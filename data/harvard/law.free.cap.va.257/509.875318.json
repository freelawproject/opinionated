The incident occurred at the Boys and Girls Club of Hampton Roads (the Club). Mooring, through his next friend, sued Braley and his employer, Virginia Wesleyan College. The trial court dismissed Mooring\u2019s motion for judgment finding that Braley was a volunteer at the Club and entitled to charitable immunity as a result of the Club\u2019s status as a charity. Because we find that Braley was not engaged in the charity\u2019s work at the time of the alleged negligence, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing Mooring\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Braley is a professor at Virginia Wesleyan College, teaching in a recreation and leisure studies program. The Club contacted Braley seeking volunteers to work in its programs. In response, Braley established a program with the Club in which students in Braley\u2019s recreation programming class were required to spend six hours observing the children and volunteering at the Club. The students were required to return to the classroom, design recreation programs for the children they observed, and then implement those programs at the Club. Braley would go to the Club to observe the students conducting the programs and would \u201chelp the students out\u201d when they needed it. The students were not graded directly on the basis of their work at the Club, but on the basis of a report they submitted to Braley describing their learning experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On the day Mooring was injured, one of Braley\u2019s students was conducting a wellness and body-conditioning program for thirteen to eighteen-year-olds in the Club\u2019s weight room. The student was giving a talk to the participants and Braley was observing her. At the student\u2019s request, Braley went to the door to keep younger children not involved in the student\u2019s program out of the room. While Braley was tending the door, Mooring was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss. The parties stipulated that the Club was a charity entitled to charitable immunity and that Mooring was a beneficiary of the charity. The trial court held that because Braley received no extra compensation from the Club or Virginia Wesleyan College for the services he rendered, and because Braley\u2019s role at the Club was both supervising his students and \u201chelping the Club perform its good work,\u201d he was \u201ca volunteer at the Club\u201d and thus entitled to charitable immunity under <em>Moore v. Warren, </em>250 Va. 421, 463 S.E.2d 459 (1995).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In <em>Moore, </em>an American Red Cross volunteer was sued for negligence allegedly committed while transporting the injured party to a routine medical visit in a car owned by the Red Cross. Providing transportation for such medical visits was a service of the Red Cross. The driver contended that he was \u2018\u201ccloaked with the immunity of the charity\u2019\u201c and that charitable immunity was not limited to the charity itself. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 463 S.E.2d at 459. In resolving this issue of first impression, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Like any organization, a charity performs its work only through the actions of its servants and agents. Without a charity\u2019s agents and servants, such as the volunteer here, no service could be provided to beneficiaries. Denying these servants and agents the charity\u2019s immunity for their acts effectively would deny the charity immunity for its acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 423, 463 S.E.2d at 460. Based on this rationale, we included the driver in the immunity of the charity and held that he was immune from liability to the charity\u2019s beneficiaries for negligence while he was \u201cengaged in the charity\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 463 S.E.2d at 461. Thus, <em>Moore </em>requires an individual seeking the cloak of a charity\u2019s immunity to establish that he was an agent or servant of the charity at the time of the alleged negligence and that the alleged negligence for which he seeks immunity occurred while he was actually doing the charity\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that the \u201crole\u201d Braley had at the Club identified by the trial court satisfied the requirement that Braley be an agent or servant of the Club, Braley qualifies for protection under the Club\u2019s charitable immunity only if the alleged negligence occurred while he was doing the charity\u2019s work. Mooring contends that at the time of the injury Braley\u2019s \u201cpresence did not directly benefit the Club,\u201d and that Braley presented no evidence that \u201che was doing anything in particular for the Club at the time of the incident.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">While Braley testified that he \u201chelped out\u201d at the Club whenever he could, the record shows that at the time of his alleged negligence, Braley was at the Club to observe the activities of his student. He was not there to directly perform any of the Club\u2019s work; rather he was carrying out his duties as a professor at Virginia Wesleyan College. He was observing his student and acting as \u201cdoorkeeper\u201d at the student\u2019s request to allow his student to properly conduct the wellness class. Under these facts, we conclude that Braley was not entitled to charitable immunity because he was not engaged in the work of the charity at the time of his alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\"> In dismissing the motion for judgment against both defendants, the trial court did not specifically address whether Virginia Wesleyan College was entitled to charitable immunity, and this issue is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
