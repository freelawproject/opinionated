The preamble to the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">The Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility consists of three separate but interrelated parts: Canons, Disciplinary Rules, and Ethical Considerations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">The Canons are statements of axiomatic norms, expressing in general terms the standards of professional conduct expected of lawyers in their relationships with the public, with the legal system, and with the legal profession. They embody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the general concepts from which the Disciplinary Rules and the Ethical Considerations are derived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">The Disciplinary Rules, unlike the Canons and Ethical Considerations, are mandatory in character, as stated in DR 1-102(A)(1). The Disciplinary Rules state the minimum level of conduct below which no lawyer can fall without being subject to disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia, Pt. 6, \u00a7 II.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In a hearing before a three-judge court conducted under the provisions of Code \u00a7 54.1-3935, the court concluded that El-Amin had committed 15 violations of 9 of the disciplinary rules in his representation of Annie H. Fant, Grace R. Williams, and Vernon El-Amin, and the court suspended his license to practice law for a period of four years. El-Amin exercised his statutory right to appeal eight of those findings involving his alleged misconduct, competence and promptness, causing prejudice to a client, failure to refund advanced fees, and failure to avoid the appearance of professional impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">In reviewing the findings of a three-judge court in an attorney disciplinary proceeding, we use the same standard that we apply to the findings of disciplinary boards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">[O]n review we will make an <em>independent examination of the whole record, giving the factual findings . . . substantial weight and viewing them as prima facie correct. </em>While not given the weight of a jury verdict, those conclusions will be sustained unless it appears they are not justified by a reasonable view of the evidence or are contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-10\"><em>Myers v. Virginia State Bar, </em>226 Va. 630, 632, 312 S.E.2d 286, 287 (1984) (quoting <em>Blue v. Seventh District Committee, </em>220 Va. 1056, 1061-62, 265 S.E.2d 753, 757 (1980) (appeal from disciplinary board)). And, consistent with well-established appellate principles, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the State Bar, the prevailing party in the trial court. <em>Gunter v. Virginia State Bar, </em>238 Va. 617, 619, 385 S.E.2d 597, 598 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">\n<em>I. The Fant Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">Considering the cases arising under El-Amin\u2019s representation of each client, we begin with his representation of Fant. Fant employed El-Amin in June 1994 to represent her in an employment discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>tion case. El-Amin agreed to begin working on the case immediately and required Fant to advance a retainer fee of $4,000, which she did by check. He indicated to Fant that he would withdraw funds as he worked on the case and told Fant that he would deposit the retainer in an escrow account. Instead, El-Amin cashed the check and produced no record of having deposited the proceeds in any account.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">During the following five months, El-Amin had little contact with Fant, despite her numerous telephone calls, letters, and visits to his office. Because of El-Amin\u2019s failure to respond to her inquiries, Fant wrote him a letter in late November 1994 discharging him as her counsel and asking for a refund of the retainer. El-Amin telephoned Fant several days later and, admitting to her that he had not done certain work on the case as promised, agreed to refund \u201cthe money\u201d by mail on December 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Fant testified that when El-Amin did not refund the money as promised, she sued him in the General District Court and mailed him a copy of the warrant. Thereafter, El-Amin contacted Fant and promised to pay \u201c$4,000 on December the 20th, 1994, at 11 a.m.\u201d Fant went to El-Amin\u2019s office at the specified time and he told her that because his wife, who was his law partner, had been hospitalized, he had \u201ctaken [his wife\u2019s] load,\u201d and further that he could not charge Fant any money because he had done no work on her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">However, El-Amin refunded only $1,000 at that time. In response to Fant\u2019s question of why the payment was in that amount in view of the fact that the $4,000 deposit was \u201csupposed to be in escrow,\u201d El-Amin said \u201cI don\u2019t have the money.\u201d El-Amin promised to pay the additional $3,000 on January 11, 1995 at 11:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">When El-Amin failed to refund the remaining $3,000 on January 11, Fant wrote to the State Bar asking for its help in getting her refund. Although Fant delivered a copy of her letter to El-Amin\u2019s office on January 12, she received no response from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">On January 17, Fant retained attorney Bradley O. Wein to collect the balance. El-Amin agreed to see Wein at a fixed time on January 23, 1995 in El-Amin\u2019s office and to pay the $3,000 balance to Wein at that time. However, El-Amin was not at his office at the appointed time and did not refund the promised sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Only after Wein had generated a file of over 1,000 pages, expended more than 100 hours during a period of 18 months, and incurred costs of $754.72 did El-Amin refund $2,500 of the $3,000 balance in settlement of Fant\u2019s claim. After the deduction of Wein\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>fee and expenses, Fant realized only $911.95 of the $3,000 balance of her deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">El-Amin has not appealed three of the court\u2019s four findings in the Fant matter. They are that he violated the following disciplinary rules: (1) DR 9-102(A)(2), which requires that client funds be deposited in an identifiable trust account; (2) DR 9-102(B)(3), which requires that a lawyer maintain \u201ccomplete records of all funds, securities, and other property of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his client regarding them\u201d; and (3) DR 9-102(B)(4), which requires that an attorney \u201c[promptly pay or deliver to the client . . . funds ... in the possession of the lawyer which such person is entitled to receive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">El-Amin contends, however, that the evidence is insufficient to establish, clearly and convincingly, that he violated DR 1-102(A)(3), which proscribes a lawyer\u2019s commission of a \u201cdeliberately wrongful act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law.\u201d We disagree with El-Amin.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In our opinion, the evidence that El-Amin cashed Fant\u2019s $4,000 retainer check, used the proceeds without earning the fee, and delayed refunding the retainer fee, sufficiently supports the finding that he committed \u201ca deliberately wrongful act that reflects adversely on [his] fitness to practice law,\u201d in violation of DR 1-102(A)(3). Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s finding on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\n<em>II. The Williams Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">We next consider the charges relating to El-Amin\u2019s representation of Williams, which began in early May of 1994. Williams, like Fant, employed El-Amin to represent her in an employment discrimination case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">As in the Fant matter, El-Amin appeals only one of the findings of disciplinary rule violations in his representation of Williams. He has not appealed the court\u2019s findings that, in representing Williams, he violated the pertinent provisions of the following disciplinary rules: (1) DR 2-108(D), which provides that, \u201c[u]pon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take reasonable steps for the continued protection of a client\u2019s interests, including . . . refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned.\u201d; (2) DR 6-101(B), which states that a \u201clawyer shall attend promptly to matters undertaken for a client\u201d; (3) DR 6-101(C), which provides that a \u201clawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about matters in which the lawyer\u2019s services are being rendered.\u201d; and (4) DR 9-102(B)(4), which requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>that a lawyer promptly pay to a client funds the client is entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Thus, the appeal in the Williams matter is limited to the court\u2019s finding that El-Amin violated DR 1-102(A)(4). It prohibits a lawyer from engaging \u201cin conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation which reflects adversely on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">At the initial consultation, El-Amin told Williams his fee would be $7,000. When she told him that she did not have \u201cthat kind of money,\u201d but would ask her relatives to help her make payments on the fee, El-Amin agreed that he would begin working on the case. Williams and her relatives paid El-Amin over $1,700. However, despite numerous office visits and telephone calls, Williams was unsuccessful in her attempts to see or talk to El-Amin about what he had done during the ensuing five-month period. Consequently, Williams wrote El-Amin on November 2, 1994, discharging him as her counsel and asking for a refund of the amounts paid on the fee. The letter was delivered by certified mail to El-Amin\u2019s office and signed for by his secretary on November 3, 1994. El-Amin did not respond to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">El-Amin testified that his secretary neither gave him the certified letter nor told him of Mrs. Williams\u2019 office visits and that he did not know he \u201chad a problem with Mrs. Williams until after [he] received a complaint from the Virginia State Bar.\u201d Although El-Amin claimed he had done some research on the Williams case, he produced no records to substantiate his testimony and admitted that \u201cthe entire situation fell through the cracks. And it just did. And I don\u2019t have an explanation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Yet when interviewed during a preliminary investigation about his failure to refund the fee, El-Amin told a State Bar investigator that he had not refunded the money because \u201che felt like he had earned the fees\u201d up to the time of his discharge. Although El-Amin denied making this statement to the investigator and claimed that the money was still in an escrow account, at trial El-Amin produced no records of any such account and could only say that he \u201cassume[d]\u201d the money was still there.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">In our opinion, this evidence clearly and convincingly supports the conclusion that El-Amin violated DR 1-102(A)(4) by using the retainer without earning it and by attempting to deceive the investigator in claiming the retainer had been earned. That is \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>reflects adversely on [El-Amin\u2019s] fitness to practice law\u201d. DR 1-102(A)(4). Hence, we will affirm this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">\n<em>III. The Vernon El-Amin Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Finally, we consider El-Amin\u2019s dealings with his client Vernon El-Amin (Vernon), who is of no relation to him. At the time of their contract in 1990, Vernon was incarcerated following his convictions for four murders. Vernon was represented by other counsel in those criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">El-Amin and Vernon agreed that if Vernon\u2019s pending appeal of those convictions was unsuccessful, El-Amin would represent him in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. In the meantime, El-Amin was to secure the release of Vernon\u2019s 1986 Lincoln Continental from police impoundment, have the car put into condition to sell, deduct the cost thereof, and hold the net proceeds of sale as a retainer fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">As it turned out, the appeal by other counsel was successful and El-Amin did little work on this matter. However, Vernon was again convicted on retrial, remained in confinement, and asked El-Amin to keep the retainer as a credit for future representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">El-Amin obtained the car, had it repaired, and began using it himself. He later decided to trade the car for a newer one and received a credit of $4,636.04 on the purchase price of the newer car. The newer car was titled in El-Amin\u2019s name and he eventually executed a lien on that car in favor of another client. El-Amin did not note in his records or on the title to the newer car that he held either the 1986 car or Vernon\u2019s interest in the proceeds, <em>i.e., </em>the credit, in trust. Nor did El-Amin deposit funds in his trust account once he received the credit. Although El-Amin testified in another proceeding in July 1991 that the agreed value of the car was \u201c$10,000, less any amounts necessary to repair it and put it in marketable condition,\u201d he testified before the three-judge court in 1988 that the agreed value was $6,500 less the cost of repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">El-Amin contends that the court erred in finding he had violated six disciplinary rules during his representation of Vernon El-Amin. We do not agree with El-Amin. We conclude that clear and convincing evidence supports all of the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Dealing first with violations of DR 1-102(A)(3) and DR 1-102(A)(4), discussed above, involving a \u201cdeliberately wrongful act,\u201d deceit and misrepresentation, we reject El-Amin\u2019s argument that there is a distinction between his activities and the activities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>other lawyers who committed crimes and were disciplined. As we pointed out in <em>Gunter, </em>238 Va. at 621, 385 S.E.2d at 600, \u201cconduct may be unethical, measured by the minimum requirements of the Code of Professional Responsibility, even if it is not unlawful.\u201d The evidence shows that El-Amin not only personally used Vemon\u2019-s car, but he also traded it for a newer one without reflecting the resulting $4,636.04 credit on the title to the newer car. In our opinion, this sufficiently supports the trial court\u2019s findings of violations of both of these disciplinary rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">We also conclude that the evidence was sufficient to show that El-Amin prejudiced Vernon\u2019s rights by using and disposing of the car in violation of DR 7-101(A)(3). That disciplinary rule provides that a lawyer shall not intentionally \u201c[prejudice or damage his client during the course of the professional relationship.\u201d A comparison between El-Amin\u2019s 1991 testimony and his 1998 testimony concerning the value of the car, coupled with his decision not to reflect the unearned retainer or Vernon\u2019s consequent interest in the newer car, sufficiently indicates that Vernon\u2019s rights were prejudiced in this matter. It is of no consequence that El-Amin later earned the fee by handling other matters for Vernon, as he argues. The fact is that at the time in question, Vernon\u2019s rights were prejudiced by El-Amin\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The final group of charges arises under Canon 9, which provides: \u201cA Lawyer Should Avoid Even the Appearance of Professional Impropriety.\u201d One of the charges under this canon involves a violation of DR 9-102(A), which requires a lawyer to deposit \u201c[a]ll funds received or held by the lawyer or law firm on behalf of a client ... in one or more identifiable trust accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">El-Amin contends that he had no obligation to deposit funds to reflect the credit in question since the word \u201cfunds\u201d as used in the rule refers to money and that, since he did not obtain money from the trade, but only obtained a credit, there could be no violation of DR 9-102(A). We reject this contention for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The form of the retainer fee changed when El-Amin, who held Vernon\u2019s car as a bailee for the purpose of securing the payment of legal fees to be incurred in the future by Vernon, converted the car into a credit, which El-Amin received on the purchase of his new car. Vernon had an interest in that credit because it took the place of his car as the retainer fee, or fund, for the payment of the future legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The terms \u201cfund or funds\u201d have been defined in part as \u201c[a]n asset or group of assets set apart for a specific purpose.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 673 (6th ed. 1990). Because the credit represented the retainer fee, it became a \u201cfund\u201d set aside for a specific purpose, the payment of fees to be billed by El-Amin in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Considering the scope and purpose of the Code of Professional Responsibility, we do not think that the term \u201cfunds\u201d as used in DR 9-102(A) is confined to items such as \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201ccash,\u201d as El-Amin contends. Indeed, we have not limited the term to money or cash, but, instead, have used the term \u201cfund\u201d or \u201cfunds\u201d in a generic sense in a number of situations. <em>See, e.g., Somers </em>v. <em>Godwin, </em>182 Va. 144, 147, 27 S.E.2d 909, 910 (1943) (applying word \u201cfunds\u201d to intangible personal property); <em>Fireman\u2019s Mutual Aid Assoc. v. Commonwealth, </em>166 Va. 34, 36, 184 S.E. 189, 190 (1936) (applying word \u201cfunds\u201d to \u201cbonds, notes, etc., and money\u201d); <em>Rixey's Ex'rs v. Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 337, 343-44, 99 S.E. 573, 574 (1919) (describing intangible property held by executor as \u201cfunds arising from ... the sales of real and personal property to others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In sum, given the context and purpose of the disciplinary rules, and our previous uses of the words \u201cfund\u201d and \u201cfunds,\u201d it is our opinion that, under the facts of this case, the credit El-Amin received upon trading Vernon\u2019s car became \u201cfunds\u201d within the meaning of DR 9-102(A)(2) and that the rule required El-Amin to deposit a sum representing that credit into his trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The evidence also supports the conclusion that El-Amin violated DR 9-102(B)(2), which requires that a lawyer \u201c[i]dentify . . . properties of a client. . . and place them in a . . . place of safekeeping as soon as practicable.\u201d El-Amin testified that \u201cat first I was going to drive the vehicle. However, and I drove it.\u201d But after an encounter with a man who \u201clook[ed] very angry\u201d and asked him if the car was Vernon\u2019s and if El-Amin was related to him, El-Amin decided, \u201cI don\u2019t want to have anymore parts of this. So I rapidly ran out to Capital Lincoln and said, \u2018What will you give me for this vehicle.\u2019 \u201d El-Amin\u2019s personal use of the car and his failure to document Vernon\u2019s interest in the credit El-Amin received for selling the car sufficiently show that El-Amin failed to identify the car or the proceeds from its sale as Vernon\u2019s property or keep either in \u201ca place of safekeeping,\u201d all in violation of DR 9-102(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Finally, we consider the violation of DR 9-102(B)(3). It requires a lawyer to \u201c[m]aintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his client regarding them.\u201d El-Amin simply argues that \u201c[t]he evidence established that El-Amin maintained records regarding the car given by Vernon El-Amin,\u201d but El-Amin does not say what those records were.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">El-Amin was the only witness who testified about the records regarding Vernon\u2019s car. El-Amin\u2019s testimony indicated that he regarded his record-keeping obligation to Vernon as limited to accounting for the repair expenditures and that this obligation was discharged by notations of Vernon\u2019s name on the checks he had written on his attorney trust account to pay for the repairs to Vernon\u2019s car. Although no monies had been deposited in the trust account in Vernon\u2019s name, El-Amin said he charged the amounts of these checks against other clients\u2019 retainer fees that had been earned by El-Amin. El-Amin says nothing about his obligation to keep a record of the agreed amount of the retainer or the work El-Amin had done to earn the retainer. We conclude that this evidence sufficiently supports the conclusion that El-Amin violated the provisions of DR 9-102 (B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\n<em>TV. Length of Suspension</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">El-Amin argues that \u201c[t]he trial court abused its discretion in failing to consider El-Amin\u2019s mitigating circumstances.\u201d He overlooks the following statement made by the court at the time the sanctions were imposed. \u201cWe have taken into account the evidence in aggravation and the evidence in - and argument in mitigation.\u201d Accordingly, we reject El-Amin\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Even so, El-Amin contends that the four-year suspension was unwarranted in view of the mitigating evidence of his wife\u2019s and daughter\u2019s illnesses during the periods in question, the revision of his office procedures to provide that he alone would sign for certified letters addressed to him, his remorse, and his refunds to Fant despite having done considerable work for her. The State Bar responds that El-Amin\u2019s \u201crevision\u201d of his office procedures was merely an avoidance of future responsibility, and that his alleged remorse was put in question because even after protracted litigation he refunded only a portion of Fant\u2019s retainer. These considerations may well have diminished the effect of any mitigating evidence presented by El-Amin.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">El-Amin also contends on brief that \u201c[t]here was no evidence of a pattern of misconduct by El-Amin.\u201d In response, the State Bar notes the evidence in the record of his \u201cprior record since 1987 including] no less than seven founded disciplinary violations relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ing, like [these], to client neglect; failure to keep clients informed; failure to account for fees collected; and failure to refund unearned fees, among other things.\u201d We think this evidence is sufficient to establish a pattern of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In sum, our independent review of the entire record discloses that the court did not abuse its discretion in suspending El-Amin\u2019s license for four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">\n<em>V. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Finding no merit in El-Amin\u2019s assignments of error, we will affirm the judgment of the court below suspending El-Amin\u2019s license to practice law for a period of four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
