Steele, Jr. The truck was traveling westbound on Route 53, a two-lane highway in Fluvanna County. White was severely injured when the truck left the highway, traveled along a ditch line until it struck a rock, became airborne, and landed upside down between two trees. White and Steele were hospitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">White filed a motion for judgment against Steele and an unidentified John Doe, seeking recovery for the damages he sustained in the accident. White alleged that Steele was reckless and negligent for failing to maintain proper control of his vehicle and that John Doe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>negligently drove his vehicle across the center of the highway, forcing Steele\u2019s vehicle off the highway. White also served Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(E) because he was an insured under the uninsured motorist provisions of a motor vehicle liability policy issued by Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of both defendants. On White\u2019s motions and over Allstate\u2019s objections, the trial court set aside the verdict as to Doe, entered judgment against Doe on the issue of liability pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-430, and dismissed the motion for judgment against Steele. The parties agreed to submit the issue of damages to the trial court. Relying on the evidence produced at trial, the trial court entered judgment against Doe in the amount of $250,000 with interest. Allstate appealed, seeking reinstatement of the jury verdict in Doe\u2019s favor or, in the alternative, a new trial on the issues of Doe\u2019s liability and damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">On appeal, Allstate first contends that the trial court erred in setting aside die jury verdict because the jury reasonably could have inferred from the evidence that either Doe did not exist or that he had not been negligent. In reviewing Allstate\u2019s contention, we apply familiar principles. Code \u00a7 8.01-430 authorizes a trial court to set aside a jury verdict if it is plainly wrong or without credible evidence to support it. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>220 Va. 578, 581, 260 S.E.2d 238, 240 (1979). On appeal, the judgment of a trial court setting aside a jury verdict will be sustained if the record contains no credible evidence to support the jury verdict, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the facts in the light most favorable to the party receiving the jury verdict. <em>Rogers v. Marrow, </em>243 Va. 162, 166, 413 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The evidence relating to the cause of the accident comes primarily from White\u2019s testimony. Although Steele pled guilty to a charge of improper driving in connection with the incident, he has no memory of the accident. There were no other witnesses to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">At the time of the accident, it was raining and dark and the road was wet. The posted speed limit was 55 miles per hour; White testified he thought Steele was driving 50 to 55 miles per hour. According to White, as Steele\u2019s vehicle came out of a curve, White suddenly saw the glare of the headlights of a vehicle traveling east that \u201clooked like\u201d it was coming toward them in the westbound lane. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>White testified that, to avoid a collision, Steele veered to the right, causing the truck to leave the highway, become airborne and eventually land upside down between two trees. White could not estimate the speed of the Doe vehicle, did not know whether it was a truck or a car, or where it was located on the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">White also testified that he had been drinking beer before he and Steele got into the truck. He testified that he could not remember precisely how many beers he had consumed in the two-hour span before the accident, but that it might have been as many as three. The state trooper who investigated the accident testified that there were no skid marks or debris on the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">According to Alstate, White\u2019s admitted consumption of alcohol supports a conclusion that White\u2019s perception of the details surrounding the accident was impaired by the alcohol he had consumed and, thus, that his testimony was not reliable. White\u2019s inability to identify anything about the Doe vehicle and Steele\u2019s guilty plea to improper driving, Allstate asserts, entitled the jury to conclude that there was no vehicle driven by a John Doe and that the accident was not caused by the negligence of an unidentified motorist. Either conclusion required a verdict in favor of Doe, and, therefore, Allstate concludes, the trial court erred in setting aside the jury verdict in favor of Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Citing <em>Ragland v. Rutledge, </em>234 Va. 216, 219, 361 S.E.2d 133, 135 (1987), White responds that his testimony regarding the cause of the accident and the existence of a vehicle driven by John Doe was positive, uncontroverted, and credible and, therefore, could not be disregarded by the jury. However, that principle is not applicable in this case. It is true that there was no positive testimony controverting White\u2019s statements regarding the events surrounding the accident. The evidence relied upon by Alstate addresses the reliability of White\u2019s testimony. As White notes, the trial judge determined that White had \u201ca reputation for truth and honesty.\u201d The evidence relating to impaired perception because of alcohol consumption does not impeach White\u2019s character trait for telling the truth. Such evidence affects the probative value of White\u2019s testimony by suggesting that, at the time of the accident, his perception of the details and events may have been impaired, and, therefore, that the testimony was not reliable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Having reviewed the record, we agree with Allstate and conclude that the trial court erred in setting aside the jury verdict. Based on the evidence recited above, the jury was entitled to infer that White\u2019s perception of the circumstances of the accident was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Furthermore, assuming that there was a Doe vehicle, there is no direct evidence that Doe was negligent. The only evidence bearing on the issue of Doe\u2019s negligence was White\u2019s statement that, as the Steele vehicle came around the curve, White saw the glare of the Doe vehicle\u2019s headlights, and \u201c[i]t <em>looked like </em>he was on our side of the road considerably.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although there was an accident, there was no collision between two vehicles which could provide evidence of the location of the Doe vehicle. Nor were there any skid marks or debris identifying the location of the Doe vehicle. And finally, White\u2019s statement regarding the location of the Doe vehicle was subject to the inference of impaired perception stemming from White\u2019s alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">As noted by the trial court in refusing White\u2019s motion to strike Allstate\u2019s evidence and to find Doe liable as a matter of law, it was \u201ca matter for the jury to decide whether or not there \u2014 there was a John Doe driver at that particular scene . . . and, if so, what came from that.\u201d We conclude that there was evidence in this record to support a jury verdict in favor of John Doe either because there was no John Doe vehicle or because White failed to establish that John Doe was negligent and that his negligence resulted in White\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment reinstating that portion of the jury verdict in favor of John Doe. In light of this determination, we need not address Allstate\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-9\"> White filed a notice of appeal from the judgment in favor of Steele, but did not pursue that appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> White also argues that the evidence of his alcohol consumption was not admissible because Allstate failed to provide a proper foundation showing the level of consumption which would result in impairment of White\u2019s perception. However, while White objected to questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>relating to alcohol consumption, that objection was overruled and White has not assigned cross-error to that ruling. Therefore, we treat the evidence as properly before the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
