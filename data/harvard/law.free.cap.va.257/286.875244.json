Conner was terminated by her employer, the National Pest Control Association, Inc. (NPCA), in September of 1995. She filed a common law cause of action for wrongful termination against NPCA, alleging that her termination \u201cconstituted discrimination . . . based on her gender\u201d and that it violated the public policy against retaliation for complaints of discrimination in employment as articulated in the VHRA and other provisions of Virginia and federal law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Conner sought $1,000,000 in compensatory damages, $350,000 in punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">NPCA filed a demurrer claiming that Conner\u2019s motion for judgment failed to state a cause of action because the common law cause of action asserted was eliminated by the 1995 amendments to the VHRA. NPCA, relying on <em>Doss </em>v. <em>Jamco, Inc., </em>254 Va. 362, 492 S.E.2d 441 (1997), contended that the 1995 amendments to the VHRA restricted the remedy for wrongful termination of employment based on a violation of a public policy found in the VHRA to a statutory remedy. The trial court agreed and entered an order dismissing Conner\u2019s motion for judgment for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">On appeal Conner asserts, as she did in the trial court, that even if the 1995 amendments to the VHRA as interpreted in <em>Doss </em>\u201ceffectively prohibited a victim of discrimination from relying on the public policy articulated in the VHRA\u201d as the basis for a common law action, they do not prohibit reliance \u201cupon other state or federal laws, or upon the public policies enunciated elsewhere.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The plaintiff in <em>Doss, </em>relying on <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>State Bank of Keysville, </em>229 Va. 534, 331 S.E.2d 797 (1985), and <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Education Systems, </em>247 Va. 98, 439 S.E.2d 328 (1994), filed a common law action against her employer claiming that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>termination violated Virginia\u2019s public policy against discrimination on the basis of gender as enunciated in the VHRA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>She maintained that the 1995 amendments to the VHRA did not alter her common law cause of action. In response to a question certified to us by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, we held that the plain meaning of the 1995 amendments required the conclusion that the General Assembly abrogated the common law action for wrongful termination based upon a violation of the public policies contained in the VHRA. <em>Doss, </em>254 Va. at 372, 492 S.E.2d at 447. Although the decision in <em>Doss </em>was limited to a cause of action for wrongful termination relying on the VHRA as the source of the public policy allegedly violated, <em>id. </em>at 366, 492 S.E.2d at 443, the rationale of that decision controls the disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Our decision in <em>Doss </em>centered on the application of subsection D of Code \u00a7 2.1-725, which was added to the VHRA in 1995. That subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">Causes of action based upon the public policies reflected in this chapter shall be exclusively limited to those actions, procedures and remedies, if any, afforded by applicable federal or state civil rights statutes or local ordinances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We concluded that this subsection plainly manifested the General Assembly\u2019s intent to alter the common law and to limit actions based on violations of the policies reflected in the VHRA to applicable statutory causes of action and remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 371, 492 S.E.2d at 446. Thus, we held that the plaintiff in <em>Doss </em>could not maintain her common law action based on alleged violations of policy stated in the VHRA, because allowing her to do so would circumvent and render meaningless the mandate of subsection D that the actions for violations of such policies be \u201cexclusively limited\u201d to statutory causes of action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In this case, just as in <em>Doss, </em>subsection D\u2019s exclusivity requirement would be circumvented and rendered meaningless if Conner could maintain her common law action based upon an alleged violation of a policy enunciated in the VHRA by simply citing a different Code section or other source of public policy which enunciated the same policy. Furthermore, the General Assembly did not limit the exclusivity provision to those causes of action relying on the VHRA itself as the source of the public policy statements. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Rather, it made statutory causes of action the exclusive avenues for pursuing a remedy for an alleged violation of any public policy \u201creflected in\u201d the VHRA. Therefore, we conclude that the General Assembly, in enacting the 1995 amendments to the VHRA, eliminated a common law cause of action for wrongful termination based on any public policy which is reflected in the VHRA, regardless of whether the policy is articulated elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrer of NPCA and dismissing Conner\u2019s motion for judgment for failure to state a cause of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\"> Specifically Conner relied on art. 1, \u00a7 1 of the Virginia Constitution, Chapter 11, \u00a7 11-1-1 <em>et seq. </em>of the Fairfax County Code, Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-374, 8.01-42.1, 11-44, 11-51, 15.1-37.3:8 (repealed and reenacted in substance as \u00a7 15.2-965 (1997)), 15.1-48.1 (repealed and reenacted in substance as \u00a7 15.2-1604 (1997)), 36-96.1, 38.2-2212(C1), 38.2-2213, 38.2-4312(3)(E) (1994), <em>as amended </em>38.2-4312(D) (1998), 59.1-21.21:1 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq..</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-10\"> We do not consider Conner\u2019s assignment of error that the trial court erred in holding that the 1995 amendments to the VHRA do not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, because the trial court\u2019s order does not reflect such a holding, and the issue of the constitutionality of a statute is not properly before us on review of an order sustaining a demurrer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b310-6\">JUSTICE HASSELL, with whom JUSTICE KEENAN</author>\n<p id=\"A8Q\">joins, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Gender discrimination should not be countenanced in any manner and victims of such discrimination should be accorded a tort remedy that fully and fairly compensates them for injuries caused by an employer\u2019s repugnant conduct. As this Court recognized in <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Educ. Sys., </em>247 Va. 98, 105, 439 S.E.2d 328, 331 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">\u201cWithout question, it is the public policy of this Commonwealth that all individuals within this Commonwealth are entitled to pursue employment free of discrimination based on race or gender. Indeed, racial or gender discrimination practiced in the work place is not only an invidious violation of the rights of the individual, but such discrimination also affects the property rights, personal freedoms, and welfare of the people in general.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">However, the General Assembly of this Commonwealth has chosen to impose limitations on the right of a woman to recover damages against an employer who discriminates against her because of her gender. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-714, <em>et seq. </em>And, this Court, which does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>not, and constitutionally cannot, act as a super-legislative body, is required to apply these restrictions as expressed by the General Assembly. For this reason solely, I am compelled to concur with the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
