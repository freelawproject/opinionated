Medical Center Hospitals, </em>237 Va. 87, 376 S.E.2d 525 (1989). Two other issues involving the cap become pertinent if we reaffirm <em>Etheridge. </em>Because we conclude that the medical malpractice cap does not violate any constitutional guarantees, we will uphold the cap\u2019s constitutionality and reaffirm <em>Etheridge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">In a motion for judgment filed below, the plaintiff, Karl B. Pulliam, Executor of the Estate of Elnora R. Pulliam, sought damages of $2,000,000 from the defendants, Coastal Emergency Services of Richmond, Inc. (Coastal) and its agent, Dr. Thomas Anthony DiGiovanna (Dr. DiGiovanna), for his alleged negligence in the death of Mrs. Pulliam.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>against both defendants in the sum of $2,045,000, plus interest from the date of Mrs. Pulliam\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Upon motion of the defendants, the trial court reduced the verdict to $2,000,000, the amount sued for, and, applying the medical malpractice cap, further reduced the verdict to $1,000,000 and entered judgment against both defendants in that amount. Holding that prejudgment interest is subject to the cap, the trial court disallowed the jury\u2019s award of interest running from the date of Mrs. Pulliam\u2019s death. We awarded the plaintiff this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The record shows that Coastal was created to provide emergency physicians to staff emergency departments in hospitals and that it contracts with hospitals for this purpose. On October 27, 1989, Coastal contracted with Southside Regional Medical Center (South-side Regional) in Petersburg to provide \u201cat least five Physicians . . . to render professional and administrative services in [Southside\u2019s Emergency] Department on a full-time basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Coastal recruits doctors to work in emergency departments \u201cfrom a number of avenues.\u201d On October 12, 1994, Coastal contracted with Dr. DiGiovanna \u201cto provide services on and during the days and hours scheduled by [Coastal]\u201d and assigned him to Southside Regional.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The record shows further that about 3:55 a.m. on December 15, 1995, Mrs. Pulliam arrived at the emergency room of Southside Regional complaining of \u201clegs aching.\u201d She had been diagnosed with influenza two days earlier in the office of her private physician. At Southside Regional, she was examined by Dr. DiGiovanna. About 5:00 a.m., Dr. DiGiovanna discharged Mrs. Pulliam after prescribing a muscle relaxant and giving her printed instructions on influenza and additional instructions concerning bed rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Shortly after 11:00 a.m. the same day, Mrs. Pulliam returned to the emergency room of Southside Regional complaining of general weakness, particularly in her lower extremities. Following a physical examination by Dr. Boyd Roy Wickizer, Jr., Mrs. Pulliam was started on intravenous fluids and subjected to a CT scan and a lumbar puncture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, she was transferred to the intensive care unit, where her condition worsened. She was pronounced dead at 9:08 p.m. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was bacterial pneumonia and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>bacteremia. She was survived by her husband, who is the executor of her estate, and a son.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\n<em>A. Constitutionality of Medical Malpractice Cap.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s assignment of error on this point states that \u201c[a]s a matter of law, the trial court erred in failing to conclude that the cap on medical malpractice awards is unconstitutional <em>as applied </em>to Coastal and to Dr. DiGiovanna.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In considering this assignment of error,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">we adhere to the well-settled principle that all actions of the General Assembly are presumed to be constitutional. This Court, therefore, will resolve any reasonable doubt regarding a statute\u2019s constitutionality in favor of its validity. Any judgment as to the wisdom and propriety of a statute is within the legislative prerogative, and this Court will declare the legislative judgment null and void only when the statute is plainly repugnant to some provision of the state or federal constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-8\"><em>Supinger </em>v. <em>Stakes, </em>255 Va. 198, 202, 495 S.E.2d 813, 815 (1998) (citations and interior quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">In <em>Etheridge, </em>we rejected challenges to the constitutionality of the medical malpractice cap based upon contentions that the cap \u201cviolates the Virginia Constitution\u2019s due process guarantee, jury trial guarantee, separation of powers doctrine, prohibitions against special legislation, and equal protection guarantee, as well as certain parallel provisions of the Federal Constitution.\u201d 237 Va. at 92, 376 S.E.2d at 527. The plaintiff makes the same challenges here, but amplifies the arguments in several respects.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">It is clear that we cannot grant the plaintiff relief without overruling <em>Etheridge. </em>Immediately, therefore, the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>is implicated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>In Virginia, the doctrine of stare decisis is more than a mere cliche. That doctrine plays a significant role in the orderly administration of justice by assuring consistent, predictable, and balanced application of legal principles. And when a court of last resort has established a precedent, after full deliberation upon the issue by the court, the precedent will not be treated lightly or ignored, <em>in the absence of flagrant error or mistake.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. </em>Dean, 233 Va. 260, 265, 355 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1987) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The inquiry becomes, therefore, whether flagrant error or mistake exists in the <em>Etheridge </em>decision. The plaintiff contends that such error does exist and, therefore, that \u201c[t]he doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>should not deter this Court from reversing Etheridge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The plaintiff argues that the medical malpractice cap is unconstitutional on each of seven independent grounds. We will consider these grounds seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\n<em>1. Right to Trial by Jury.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia provides \u201c[t]hat in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, trial by jury is preferable to any other, and ought to be held sacred.\u201d In <em>Etheridge, </em>we noted that, at the time the Constitution was adopted, the jury\u2019s sole function was to resolve disputed facts, that this continues to be a jury\u2019s sole function,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the jury\u2019s fact-finding function extends to the assessment of damages. 237 Va. at 95-96, 376 S.E.2d at 529. We stated, however, that \u201c[o]nce the jury has ascertained the facts and assessed the damages, ... the constitutional mandate is satisfied [and thereafter], it is the duty of the court to apply the law to the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 376 S.E.2d at 529. The medical malpractice cap, we said, does nothing more than establish the outer limits of a remedy; remedy is a matter of law and not of fact; and a trial court applies the remedy\u2019s limitation only after the jury has fulfilled its fact-finding function. <em>Id. </em>Hence, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>concluded, the cap does not infringe upon the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at 97, 376 S.E.2d at 529.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">The plaintiff says, however, that the Court in <em>Etheridge </em>\u201cerred by failing to conclude that the mandate of Article I, \u00a7 11 includes the right to receive the amount of damages awarded by a jury after a proper jury trial.\u201d In this connection, the plaintiff cites two recent Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In <em>Hetzel </em>v. <em>Prince William County, </em>523 U.S. 208, 118 S.Ct. 1210 (1998), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit set aside as grossly excessive a jury verdict for damages the plaintiff had been awarded in district court. The Fourth Circuit remanded the case for recalculation of the award and the entry of judgment for a lesser amount. The district court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial. The Fourth Circuit then granted the defendant\u2019s petition for mandamus and stayed the scheduled retrial. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Fourth Circuit had imposed a remittitur without the option of a new trial and that this action \u201ccannot be squared with the Seventh Amendment.\u201d 523 U.S. at 211, 118 S.Ct. at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\"><em>Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., </em>523 U.S. 340, 118 S.Ct. 1279 (1998), involved an action by Columbia, a copyright owner, against Feltner, the owner of television stations that continued to broadcast programs after Columbia terminated their licenses. A statute gave Columbia the option of seeking actual damages or statutory damages, the latter permitted in an amount \u201cas the court considers just.\u201d 523 U.S. at 345, 118 S.Ct. at 1282. Columbia chose the statutory route and made a request for a jury trial, which the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>court denied. The trial judge awarded Columbia a total of $8,800,000, and Feltner appealed. Applying the Seventh Amendment, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that, although the statute was silent on the subject, \u201cthe Seventh Amendment provides a right to a jury trial, which includes a right to a jury determination of the amount of statutory damages.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The plaintiff says that these two decisions support his conclusion that the medical malpractice cap violates his right to a jury trial. We do not agree. In relying on <em>Hetzel, </em>the plaintiff attempts to equate remittitur with the medical malpractice cap and argues that, since remittitur without the option of a new trial violates the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, application of the cap likewise violates Virginia\u2019s right to a jury trial. However, the plaintiff\u2019s initial premise is faulty because remittitur and the cap are not equivalent and do not come into play under the same circumstances. Remittitur, as well as additur, is utilized only after a court has determined that a party has not received a fair and proper jury trial. <em>Supinger, </em>255 Va. at 203, 495 S.E.2d at 815. The cap, however, is applied only after a plaintiff has had the benefit of a proper jury trial. In the latter situation, there is no right to a new trial, and the constitutional mandate has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Feltner </em>is also misplaced. There, the Court dealt primarily with whether Columbia was entitled to a jury trial even though it elected to seek statutory damages. The Court concluded that Columbia had the right to a jury trial because the common law afforded copyright owners causes of action for infringement, and these actions were tried before juries. The Court recognized that \u201c[t]he Seventh Amendment . . . applies not only to common-law causes of action, but also to \u2018actions brought to enforce statutory rights that are analogous to common-law causes of action ordinarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th century, as opposed to those customarily heard by courts of equity or admiralty.\u2019\u201d <em>Feltner, </em>523 U.S. at 348, 118 S.Ct. at 1284. The Court did not address the validity of a cap on the recovery of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Furthermore, while it does not appear that the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of the validity of state statutory caps, it has noted the decisions of two circuit courts of appeals on the subject. <em>See Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., </em>518 U.S. 415, 429 n.9 (1996) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>(citing <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Omitowoju, </em>883 F.2d 1155, 1161-65 (3rd Cir. 1989), and <em>Boyd v. Bulala, </em>877 F.2d 1191, 1196 (4th Cir. 1989), as instances where courts of appeals have held that district court application of state statutory caps in diversity cases, post verdict, does not violate the Seventh Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><em>Boyd v. Bulala </em>dealt directly with Virginia\u2019s medical malpractice cap. Noting that this Court recently had decided <em>Etheridge </em>and upheld the constitutionality of the cap against assertions, <em>inter alia, </em>that it denies the right of trial by jury, the Fourth Circuit held that, with respect to the Virginia Constitution, our decision in <em>Etheridge </em>was \u201cabsolutely binding.\u201d 877 F.2d at 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Concerning the right of trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment, the Fourth Circuit followed our reasoning that it is not the role of the jury but of the legislature to determine the legal consequences of the jury\u2019s factual findings. <em>Id. </em>However, the Fourth Circuit assigned this additional reason for upholding the validity of the cap against an assertion that it violated the right of trial by jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">It is by now axiomatic that the Constitution does not forbid the creation of new rights, or the abolition of old ones recognized by the common law, to attain a permissible legislative object. Indeed, the district court conceded that a legislature\u2019s outright abolition of a cause of action would not violate the seventh amendment. If a legislature may completely abolish a cause of action without violating the right of trial by jury, we think it permissibly may limit damages recoverable for a cause of action as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Id. at 1196 (citations and interior quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Furthermore, the rule that a plaintiff may not recover more than the amount of an <em>ad damnum </em>clause is akin to a cap on damages. Yet, the plaintiff in this case has not challenged the trial court\u2019s reduction of his $2,045,000 jury verdict to $2,000,000, the amount sued for, and it is doubtful that such a challenge would meet with success.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Nor can it be disputed that, in addition to abolishing a cause of action, a legislature may extinguish a cause of action by the imposition of a statute of limitations, for example, two years from the date of death in the case of an action for wrongful death. Code \u00a7 8.01-244. If it is permissible for a legislature to enact a statute of limitations completely barring recovery in a particular cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>without impinging upon the right of trial by jury, it should be permissible for the legislature to impose a limitation upon the amount of recovery as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The courts of other states have upheld medical malpractice caps against assertions that they violate the right to a jury trial. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>St. Vincent Hospital, Inc., </em>404 N.E.2d 585, 601-02 (Ind. 1980); <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>601 A.2d 102, 118 (Md. 1992); <em>English </em>v. <em>New England Medical Center, Inc., </em>541 N.E.2d 329, 331-32 (Mass. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The plaintiff cites several out-of-state cases declaring medical malpractice caps unconstitutional, but we find them inapposite. <em>Moore v. Mobile Infirmary Ass\u2019n, </em>592 So.2d 156 (Ala. 1991), criticized our decision in <em>Etheridge </em>but distinguished it, stating that Virginia\u2019s constitutional provision respecting the right to a jury trial \u201cis materially distinguishable\u201d from Alabama\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 163. <em>Sofie v. Fibreboard Corp., 771 </em>P.2d 711 (Wash. 1989), also criticized <em>Etheridge, </em>but stated that Virginia\u2019s constitutional provision relating to trial by jury is \u201cquite different\u201d from Washington\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 724. <em>Smith v. Department of Insurance, </em>507 So.2d 1080 (Fla. 1987), involved an assertion that a medical malpractice cap violated a constitutional provision guaranteeing a right of access to the courts. Florida law prohibits the legislature from abolishing a common law right without providing a \u201creasonable alternative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1088. The cap was declared unconstitutional because the legislature had \u201cprovided nothing in the way of an alternative remedy or commensurate benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1089. Virginia law does not impose such a quid-pro-quo requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The plaintiff does cite two out-of-state decisions that are directly opposed to the <em>Etheridge </em>view with respect to trial by jury. <em>Tenold v. Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>873 P.2d 413 (Or. 1993); <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>St. Francis Hosp., </em>No. 97-CV-007107 (Cir.Ct. Milwaukee County Wis. 1998). We disagree with both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">In summary, we advert to the plaintiff\u2019s argument, <em>supra, </em>that \u201cthe mandate of Article I, \u00a7 11 includes the right to receive the amount of damages awarded by a jury after a proper trial.\u201d We point out, however, that \u201cthe jury trial guarantee secures no rights other than those that existed at common law [and] the common law never recognized a right to a full recovery in tort.\u201d <em>Etheridge, </em>237 Va. at 96, 376 S.E.2d at 529 (citing <em>Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., </em>438 U.S. 59, 88-89 n.32 (1978), and <em>Phipps Adm\u2019r v. Sutherland, </em>201 Va. 448, 452, 111 S.E.2d 422, 425 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>(1959)). It follows, therefore, that the medical malpractice cap does not impinge upon the right to trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">2. <em>Special Legislation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Article IV, \u00a7 14 of the Constitution of Virginia provides that \u201c[t]he General Assembly shall not enact any local, special, or private law . . . (18) [granting to any private corporation, association, or individual any special or exclusive right, privilege, or immunity.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Etheridge, </em>we noted that we had previously held that laws may be made to apply to a class only, even though the class may be small, provided the classification is reasonable, not arbitrary, and the law is made to apply to all persons in the class without distinction. 237 Va. at 102, 376 S.E.2d at 533. We also noted that if the classification bears a reasonable and substantial relation to the object sought to be accomplished, it will survive a special-laws constitutional challenge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">We then pointed out that, in enacting the Medical Malpractice Act, the General Assembly, after a careful and deliberate study, had determined health care providers faced increasing difficulty obtaining affordable malpractice coverage in excess of $750,000, thus reducing the number of such providers available to serve Virginia\u2019s citizens. We also pointed out that the General Assembly had determined that this significant problem adversely affected the public health, safety, and welfare and necessitated the imposition of a limitation upon the liability of health care providers in medical malpractice actions. <em>Id. </em>at 102-03, 376 S.E.2d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">We observed that the General Assembly had decided that damage awards in medical malpractice cases should not exceed $750,000 (now $1,000,000), and we stated that the limitation applied to all health care providers and all medical malpractice patients. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 376 S.E.2d at 533. We found that the classification was not arbitrary, that it bore a reasonable and substantial relation to the object sought to be accomplished, and that it applied to all persons belonging to the class without distinction. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we concluded that the legislation did not violate the prohibition against special legislation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>When we get to the plaintiff\u2019s arguments on this subject, we encounter considerable difficulty. Aside from an \u201cas applied\u201d argument involving Coastal only, which we will consider shortly, the plaintiff stated during oral argument there were two reasons that the statute imposing the medical malpractice cap constituted special legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The first reason, the plaintiff said, is set forth in the dissent in <em>Fairfax Hospital System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nevitt, </em>249 Va. 591, 457 S.E.2d 10 (1995), a case not involving a special legislation question but an issue concerning the interaction between the medical malpractice cap and Code \u00a7 8.01-35.1, which provides that the amount recovered against one tortfeasor shall be reduced by the amount paid in settlement by another tortfeasor. In the portion of the dissent upon which the plaintiff relies, the dissenters accuse the majority of using the medical malpractice cap, as it interacts with the release statute, in a manner \u201cforeign to its purpose and consequent constitutional justification of fostering affordable medical malpractice insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600, 457 S.E.2d at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s second reason for saying the cap constitutes special legislation is based upon a statement made in a report prepared by the State Corporation Commission in 1975 on \u201cMedical Malpractice Insurance in Virginia.\u201d This report was attached as an exhibit to Senate Document 29, which consists of the 1976 interim report of a legislatively created Commission to Study the Costs and Administration of Health Care Services. 3 <em>House and Senate Documents </em>(1976 Session). On page 92 of its report, the State Corporation Commission stated: \u201cIn fact, existing evidence indicates that several of the more popular solutions (e.g., a $500,000 limit on the amount recovered) will not reduce the cost of malpractice premiums in a jurisdiction like Virginia where awards or settlements seldom exceed $250,000.\u201d This proves, the plaintiff said during oral argument, that the cap does not bear a reasonable and substantial relation to the object sought to be accomplished and, therefore, constitutes special legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The difficulty with these two arguments is that they first surfaced during oral argument before this Court. They do not appear in the record below, in the plaintiff\u2019s petition for appeal, or in his appellate briefs. Consequently, we will not consider them. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s \u201cas applied\u201d argument concerning Coastal stems from the fact that, in 1994, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1 by adding new entities to the definition of \u201c[h]ealth care provider,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>(vi) a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or any other entity, except a state-operated facility, which employs or engages a licensed health care provider and which primarily renders health care services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The plaintiff argues that the 1994 amendment contained no statement of purpose and, therefore, that it fails the test that a statutory scheme, as applied, must bear a reasonable and substantial relationship to the object sought to be accomplished by the legislation. There is a reasonable inference, however, that the General Assembly intended the amendment to serve the same purpose as the original enactment of the medical malpractice cap, <em>i.e., </em>to provide \u201ca remedy for a perceived social problem, the unavailability of medical malpractice insurance at affordable rates.\u201d Etheridge, 237 Va. at 108, 376 S.E.2d at 536 (Russell, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The plaintiff also argues that in <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Brownlee, </em>253 Va. 159, 482 S.E.2d 827 (1997), we said that the purpose in the enactment of the Medical Malpractice Act was to enable <em>licensed </em>health care providers to secure medical malpractice insurance at affordable rates and that it \u201cwould not serve that purpose to extend the protection of the cap to non-health care providers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 482 S.E.2d at 832. From this, the plaintiff argues that because Coastal is not a <em>licensed </em>health care provider, extension of the cap to Coastal does not bear a reasonable and substantial relationship to the object sought to be accomplished by the medical malpractice cap, and the 1994 amendment, therefore, constitutes special legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">But the language in <em>Schwartz </em>was limited to licensed health care providers because, at the time the injury in <em>Schwartz </em>occurred, the cap was applicable only to licensed health care providers. We noted that the 1994 amendment had been enacted, but pointed out that the enactment occurred subsequent to the injury. <em>Id. </em>at 164 n.3, 482 S.E.2d at 830 n.3. While we stated it would not serve the purpose of the medical malpractice cap to extend its protection to non-health care providers, entities like Coastal are no longer non-health care providers as a result of the 1994 amendment and, as to them, the statement is now irrelevant. And it may be added that, under its contract with Southside Regional, Coastal is required to be covered by professional liability insurance with limits of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence and $3,000,000 annual aggregate, so Coastal has a direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>interest in the availability of professional liability insurance at affordable rates and fits within the class the cap is intended to protect.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The remainder of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cas applied\u201d argument is confined to the proposition that the medical malpractice cap concentrates the costs solely upon those whose losses are greatest while identifying \u201ca specific elite class, described as \u2018health care providers,\u2019 to which it accords special privileges and immunities that are given to no other tortfeasors in this Commonwealth.\u201d And the plaintiff indicates his agreement with the dissent in <em>Etheridge </em>that the General Assembly acted arbitrarily in restricting the cap so that it did not apply to \u201call plaintiffs and all defendants regardless of their identities.\u201d <em>Etheridge, </em>237 Va. at 112, 376 S.E.2d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The difficulty with the plaintiff\u2019s argument and, indeed, with the dissent in <em>Etheridge, </em>is that both place much greater emphasis upon the classes affected by the cap than upon the real test for determining whether a statute withstands a special-laws challenge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Classifications are relevant, of course, and should be given consideration in determining whether a particular legislative act constitutes special legislation. But the real test \u201cfor statutes challenged under the special-laws prohibitions in the Virginia Constitution is that they must bear \u2018a reasonable and substantial relation to the object sought to be accomplished by the legislation.\u2019\u201d <em>Benderson Development Co. v. Sciortino, </em>236 Va. 136, 147, 372 S.E.2d 751, 757 (1988) (quoting <em>Mandell v. Haddon, </em>202 Va. 979, 991, 121 S.E.2d 516, 525 (1961)). And, while we think that the classification involved in this case is reasonable, not arbitrary, and that the medical malpractice cap is made to apply to all the persons within a particular class without distinction, \u201cthe necessity for and the reasonableness of classification are primarily questions for the legislature. If any state of facts can be reasonably conceived . . . that would sustain it, that state of facts at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the time the law was enacted must be assumed.\u201d <em>Martin\u2019s Ex\u2019rs v. Commonwealth, </em>126 Va. 603, 612-13, 102 S.E. 77, 80 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Here, however, we do not have to assume a set of facts that would sustain the medical malpractice cap. The actual facts were as stated in Etheridge: \u201cThe General Assembly concluded [after careful and deliberate study] that escalating costs of medical malpractice insurance and the availability of such insurance were substantial problems adversely affecting the health, safety, and welfare of Virginia\u2019s citizens.\u201d 237 Va. at 94, 376 S.E.2d at 528. Given these facts, we think the cap bears a reasonable and substantial relation to the General Assembly\u2019s objective to protect the public\u2019s health, safety, and welfare by insuring the availability of health care providers in the Commonwealth. Accordingly, we conclude that the medical malpractice cap does not constitute special legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\n<em>3. Taking of Property.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. Under art. I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia, private property shall not be taken or damaged for public uses without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Here, the argument is that the effect of the medical malpractice cap is to take the property of the plaintiff and his son in violation of these constitutional provisions. As the statutory beneficiaries of Mrs. Pulliam, the argument goes, the plaintiff and his son \u201chad a property interest in the full measure of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">We disagree. In <em>Hess v. Snyder Hunt Corp., </em>240 Va. 49, 392 S.E.2d 817 (1990), we considered a challenge to the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 8.01-250, a statute of repose which, upon the expiration of a fixed time, \u201cextinguishes \u2018not only the legal remedy but also all causes of action, including those which may later accrue as well as those already accrued.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 392 S.E.2d at 819 (quoting <em>School Board </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>234 Va. 32, 37, 360 S.E.2d 325, 327-28 (1987)). The challenge to Code \u00a7 8.01-250 was that it deprived persons of life, limb, or property without due process of law in violation of amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 of the United States Constitution and art. I, \u00a7 11 of the Virginia Constitution. <em>Hess, </em>240 Va. at 52, 392 S.E.2d at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">We said in <em>Hess </em>that it is only when a right has accrued or a claim has arisen that it is subject to the protection of the due process clause. 240 Va. at 54, 392 S.E.2d at 821. We said further that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201cCode \u00a7 8.01-250 does not disturb a vested right, for \u2018[njobody has a vested right in the continuance of the rules of the common law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Munn v. </em>Illinois, 94 U.S. 113, 134 (1877)). Continuing, we stated that \u201cthe fourteenth amendment does not forbid a legislature from abolishing old rights recognized by the common law in order to attain a permissible legislative objective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 392 S.E.2d at 821. Finally, we said that \u201cif a legislature can abolish a cause of action for a legitimate legislative purpose, it also may prevent a cause of action from arising by enacting a statute of repose for such a purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">This rationale applies with equal force here. The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for wrongful death had not accrued at the time the cap was imposed upon recoveries in medical malpractice cases. One cannot obtain a property interest in a cause of action that has not accrued, and there was nothing to prevent the General Assembly from limiting the remedy, so far as unaccrued causes of action are concerned, to attain a permissible legislative objective without running afoul of the \u201ctaking\u201d clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. Accordingly, we find no violation of the \u201ctaking\u201d clauses in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\n<em>4. Due Process.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\n<em>5. Equal Protection.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">In oral argument, the plaintiff combined these two subjects and attempted to convince the Court that it should apply an intermediate level of scrutiny, rather than the lower-level rational basis test, in our due process and equal protection analysis of the medical malpractice cap.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, we ruled in <em>Etheridge </em>that, in a due process or equal protection analysis, the rational basis test applies unless a fundamental right or a suspect class is affected. 237 Va. at 97, 103, 376 S.E.2d at 530, 534. And we noted that those interests that have been recognized as \u201cfundamental\u201d include the right to free speech, the right to vote, the right to interstate travel, the right to fairness in the criminal process, the right to marry, and the right to fairness in procedures concerning governmental deprivation of life, liberty, or property. <em>Id. </em>at 98, 376 S.E.2d at 530. We noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>further that suspect classifications are those based upon race and national origin and that classifications based upon gender, alienage, and illegitimacy are entitled to receive a level of scrutiny between strict scrutiny and the rational basis test. <em>Id. </em>at 103 n.7, 376 S.E.2d at 534 n.7. Here, however, no fundamental right or suspect class is affected by application of the medical malpractice cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Accordingly, we are of opinion that <em>Etheridge </em>enunciated the correct level of scrutiny and that the rational basis test continues to provide the proper standard for determining whether there has been a denial of due process or equal protection in a case involving the medical malpractice cap. The rational basis test is satisfied from a due process standpoint if the challenged legislation has a reasonable relation to a proper purpose and is not arbitrary or discriminatory, <em>id. </em>at 97, 376 S.E.2d at 530, or, from an equal protection standpoint, if the legislature could reasonably have concluded that the challenged classification would promote a legitimate state purpose, <em>id. </em>at 104, 376 S.E.2d at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We think that the medical malpractice cap passes the test of constitutionality when judged against these standards, primarily for the reasons previously enunciated in Part A(2) of this opinion regarding special legislation. Accordingly, we hold that the plaintiff has suffered no denial of due process or equal protection from application of the cap to the jury verdict in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The plaintiff stated in oral argument, however, that, even if the rational basis test applies, there still would be a denial of due process and equal protection in this case for two reasons, one based upon the dissent in <em>Fairfax Hospital System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nevitt, supra, </em>and the other upon the statement in <em>Senate </em>Document No. 29 concerning the efficacy of the medical malpractice cap for its intended purpose. But, as we noted in Part A(2) of this opinion, arguments based upon the <em>Nevitt </em>dissent and the Senate Document statement cannot be considered because they were raised for the first time on appeal. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\n<em>6. Separation of Powers.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\n<em>7. Province of the Judiciary.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Because these two subjects are related, we will discuss them together. The plaintiff argues that the medical malpractice cap violates the separation of powers doctrine and also invades the province of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">In rejecting a separation of powers challenge in <em>Etheridge, </em>we pointed out that under art. VI, \u00a7 1 of the Virginia Constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the General Assembly, subject to provisions relating to the power and jurisdiction of this Court, has \u201cthe power to determine the original and appellate jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth.\u201d 237 Va. at 100, 376 S.E.2d at 532. We also noted that under art. IV, \u00a7 14 of the Constitution, the General Assembly\u2019s authority extends \u201cto all subjects of legislation not herein forbidden or restricted,\u201d and that the common law is one area in which the General Assembly\u2019s authority has not been forbidden or restricted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Accordingly, we said that the legislature has the power to provide, modify, or repeal a remedy. 237 Va. at 101, 376 S.E.2d at 532. And we concluded that \u201cwhether the remedy prescribed in Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15 is viewed as a modification of the common law or as establishing the jurisdiction of the courts in specific cases, clearly it was a proper exercise of legislative power.\u201d 237 Va. at 101, 376 S.E.2d. at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">This rationale applies with equal force here, and it should be sufficient to dispose of the plaintiff\u2019s arguments concerning separation of powers and the province of the judiciary, but the plaintiff disagrees. He says that art. VI, \u00a7 5 of the Constitution of Virginia establishes that \u201cthe judiciary, not the legislature, makes the rules applicable to jury verdicts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">On brief, the plaintiff quotes art. VI, \u00a7 5 as providing that this Court has \u201cthe authority to make rules governing ... the practice and procedures to be used in the courts of the Commonwealth. . . .\u201d However, what the plaintiff has omitted at the end of this quotation is of crucial importance. The full text of art. VI, \u00a7 5 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">The Supreme Corn! shall have the authority to make rules governing the course of appeals and the practice and procedures to be used in the courts of the Commonwealth, <em>but such rules shall not be in conflict with the general law as the same shall, from time to time, be established by the General Assembly.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">(Emphasis added.) In addition, Code \u00a7 8.01-3, which is listed in the cross-reference following art. VI, \u00a7 5, provides that, while this Court \u201cmay prepare a system of rules of practice and a system of pleading and the forms of process, . . . <em>[t]he General Assembly may, from time to time, by the enactment of a general law, modify, or annul any rules adopted or amended pursuant to this section </em>[and in] the case of any variance between a rule and an enactment of the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Assembly such variance shall be construed so as to give effect to such enactment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Thus, we find no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s arguments concerning separation of powers and the province of the judiciary. Accordingly, we reject the arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\n<em>B. Health Care Provider.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">As noted in Part A(2) of this opinion, Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1 defines a \u201c[h]ealth care provider\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">(vi) a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or any other entity, except a state-operated facility, which employs or engages a health care provider and which primarily renders health care services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The plaintiff contends that the medical malpractice cap does not apply to Coastal because the cap applies only to health care providers and \u201c[t]here simply is nothing in the trial record evidencing that Coastal \u2018primarily renders health care services,\u2019 an essential component of \u00a7 8.01-581.l\u2019s definition of \u2018health care provider.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff says that Coastal is nothing more than \u201ca specialized type of employment placement service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">However, the evidence shows that Coastal was quite different from an employment placement service. Coastal\u2019s senior vice-president testified that Coastal was created to provide emergency physicians to staff emergency departments of hospitals and that \u201c[i]s . . . what it in fact does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Coastal\u2019s contract with Southside Regional obligated Coastal to provide at least five physicians to render \u201cprofessional and administrative services in [Southside\u2019s Emergency] Department on a full-time basis ... 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\u201d Coastal agreed that the physicians would direct and supervise all medical services in the emergency department, participate in educational programs, and perform teaching functions. Coastal also agreed to provide information to Southside Regional regarding budgetary needs of the emergency department and to perform a number of other administrative tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">In addition, the contract required Coastal to designate one of its physicians, serving as its employee, to be \u201cthe Chief/Medical Director of the Department.\u201d This doctor\u2019s duties were to \u201cprovide overall medical direction in the continuing operation\u201d of the emergency department, \u201cassure that the quality, safety and appropriateness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>patient care in the Department are evaluated,\u201d and \u201csee that the performance of the Physicians is in accordance with\u201d the contract. The contract \u201centitled [Coastal] to bill patients for professional services rendered by the Physicians.\u201d The contract provided that Coastal\u2019s fees would be independent of Southside Regional\u2019s charges and that neither Coastal nor the physicians would receive any compensation from Southside Regional for services rendered pursuant to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Coastal owns no emergency room facility or equipment and employs no support personnel such as nurses or technicians. Instead, it enters into contracts with physicians and pays them for their services. In Dr. DiGiovanna\u2019s case, the contract stipulated that his professional services would be provided at designated medical institutions and that Coastal would pay a set fee for each hour during which he provided services pursuant to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The plaintiff says that, as a matter of law, the trial court erred in concluding that Coastal carried its burden of proving it primarily renders health care services within the meaning of the definition of \u201c[h]ealth care provider\u201d in Code \u00a7 8.01-581.l(vi). We disagree with the plaintiff. The contract between Coastal and Southside Regional clearly provided for the rendering of health care services in Southside Regional\u2019s emergency room. Coastal is a corporation created to provide emergency physicians to staff emergency departments of hospitals for the purpose of rendering health care services in such departments. A corporation can act only through its officers and agents. <em>Greenberg v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 594, 600, 499 S.E.2d 266, 269 (1998). It is a concession in the case that Dr. DiGiovanna was the agent of Coastal, and it was in this capacity that he rendered health care services to Mrs. Pulliam in the emergency room of South-side Regional on December 15, 1995. In our opinion, all the foregoing established at least a prima facie case that Coastal was an entity \u201cwhich primarily renders health care services\u201d within the meaning of the definition of \u201c[h]ealth care provider\u201d in Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1(vi). The trial court did not err, therefore, in holding that Coastal had carried its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\n<em>C. Prejudgment Interest.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">As noted previously, the jury allowed interest from the date of Mrs. Pulliam\u2019s death, but the trial court disallowed the award on the ground that prejudgment interest is subject to the medical malpractice cap. The plaintiff says this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The plaintiff points out that, under Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15, the total amount recoverable <em>for </em>any injury to, or death of, a patient shall not exceed one million dollars. The plaintiff says that interest is not \u201cfor\u201d such injury or death, and, quoting <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Finley, </em>215 Va. 700, 214 S.E.2d 129 (1975), the plaintiff argues that \u201c[t]he interest the law allows on judgments is not an element of \u2018damages\u2019 but a statutory award for delay in the payment of money due.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702, 214 S.E.2d at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">We disagree with the plaintiff. <em>Finley </em>involved <em>postjudgment </em>interest. <em>Id. </em>at 701, 214 S.E.2d at 130; <em>Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Douthat, </em>248 Va. 627, 632, 449 S.E.2d 799, 801 (1994). And we said in <em>Dairyland </em>that there is \u201can important distinction between prejudgment interest and postjudgment interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631, 449 S.E.2d at 801. \u201cUnderlying this distinction,\u201d we continued, \u201cis the principle that \u2018[p]rejudgment interest is normally designed to make the plaintiff whole and is part of the actual damages sought to be recovered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Monessen Southwestern Ry. v. Morgan, </em>486 U.S. 330, 335 (1988)). \u201cIn contrast,\u201d we said, \u201cpostjudgment interest is not an element of damages, but is a statutory award for delay in the payment of money actually due.\u201d 248 Va. at 632, 449 S.E.2d at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The plaintiff attempts to distinguish <em>Dairyland </em>on the basis of a concession made there by the parties sought to be charged that \u201cprejudgment interest is an element of compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630, 449 S.E.2d at 801. The plaintiff says that this concession eliminated \u201cthe need for this Court to reach that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">It is true that such a concession was made in <em>Douthat, </em>but this Court distinctly made the holding that \u201cprejudgment interest ... is part of the actual damages sought to be recovered,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 631, 449 S.E.2d at 801, and we cited <em>Monessen </em>as authority for the holding. If that was this Court\u2019s holding, then prejudgment interest is part of \u201cthe total amount recoverable for any injury to, or death of, a patient,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15, and subject to the medical malpractice cap of one million dollars. But if any question remains about the holding, the question will be eliminated by our affirmance of the trial court\u2019s judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\n<em>D. Conclusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In conclusion, we note that <em>Etheridge </em>has been cited in sixteen subsequent opinions of this Court without any indication to the bench, the bar, or the public that flagrant error or mistake exists in the decision. This underscores the significance of what we said in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Myers v. Moore, </em>204 Va. 409, 131 S.E.2d 414 (1963), a case involving the constitutionality of the Virginia Water and Sewer Authorities Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">The reason for the <em>[stare </em>decisis] principle is that in a well ordered society it is important for people to know what their legal rights are, not only under constitutions and legislative enactments but also as defined by judicial precedent, and when they have conducted their affairs in reliance thereon they ought not to have their rights swept away by judicial decree when at a later date other grounds may be conceived to attack the constitutionality of a statute. This is especially true where property rights are involved. Under the Authorities Act numerous improvement districts have been created and financed in reliance upon the pronouncement of this Court that it is free from constitutional objections. Thus the doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>one of the most important principles in the structure of our law, should here apply with all its force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 413, 131 S.E.2d at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-12\"> Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15 provides that \u201c[i]n any verdict returned against a health care provider in an action for malpractice[,] ... the total amount recoverable for any injury to, or death of, a patient shall not exceed one million dollars.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b27-13\"> It is a concession in the case that Coastal \u201cis liable in respondeat superior\u201d for the negligence of Dr. DiGiovanna.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b28-9\"> Dr. Wickizer was named originally as a defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment but was later nonsuited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b29-11\"> We emphasize the \u201cas applied\u201d language of the plaintiff\u2019s assignment of error because, in oral argument, the plaintiff contended that legislation adopted in 1994 adding entities like Coastal to the definition of \u201c[h]ealth care provider\u201d was <em>facially invalid, </em>and the assignment of error does not permit that argument. Rule 5:17(c). Furthermore, the argument is foreclosed because it was not made in the trial court, in the plaintiff\u2019s petition for appeal, or in his appellate briefs.

The plaintiff says that \u201cthe linchpin of the reasoning of the <em>Etheridge </em>majority [concerning trial by jury] was a statement in <em>[Forbes}, </em>taken out of context and given a broad meaning never intended by the <em>Forbes </em>court.\u201d This is the statement in <em>Forbes </em>the plaintiff cites: \u201cThe province of the jury is to settle questions of fact, and when the facts are ascertained the law determines the rights of the parties. This law is announced by the court or judge.\u201d 130 Va. at 260, 108 S.E. at 20. However, in the same paragraph, the <em>Forbes </em>court also said this: \u201cIf no . .. evidence is offered . . . that would warrant a jury ... in finding a verdict in accordance therewith, then the rights of the parties become a question of law, and there is no controversy to be determined by a jury, <em>and the constitutional guaranty does not apply.\u201d Id. </em>at 261, 108 S.E. at 20 (emphasis added). This is the conclusion we drew in <em>Etheridge </em>that attracted the plaintiff\u2019s criticism: \u201cOnce the jury has ascertained the facts and assessed the damages, ... the constitutional mandate is satisfied. Thereafter, it is the duty of the court to apply the law to the facts.\u201d <em>Etheridge, </em>237 Va. at 96, 376 S.E.2d at 529 (citations omitted). We think this conclusion was fully justified, and we reaffirm it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\"> The plaintiff acknowledges that the Seventh Amendment does not apply to procedures in state courts, but says that Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Seventh Amendment are highly instructive in defining the scope of the right to a jury trial in litigation in state courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b35-9\"> The plaintiff also contends that the medical malpractice cap \u201cviolates Article I, \u00a7 4 of the Constitution of Virginia and its prohibition against \u2018exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges.\u2019 \u201d However, as <em>Etheridge </em>points out, this clause is intended to shield against heredity in office and has no application to this type of case. 237 Va. at 101, 376 S.E.2d at 532.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> Coastal also agreed in its contract with Southside Regional that \u201ceach of [its] Physicians shall be covered by professional liability insurance with limits of at least $1,000,000.00 per occurrence and $3,000,000.00 annual aggregate.\u201d Coastal concedes that this provision only \u201cobligated [it] to ensure that the Physicians were covered by malpractice insurance,\u201d rather than obligating Coastal to provide the coverage itself. Even so, this gives Coastal at least an indirect interest in the availability of such insurance at affordable rates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b38-8\"> The dissenters in <em>Etheridge </em>were concerned that the Medical Malpractice Act left \u201cuncovered\u201d entities which rendered health care services but were not licensed in this Commonwealth. 237 Va. at 110, 376 S.E.2d at 537. This concern should be allayed, however, by the 1994 amendment to Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1, which added to the definition of \u201c[h]ealth care provider\u201d numerous unlicensed entities which employ or engage licensed health care providers and which primarily render health care services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> The plaintiff states on brief that he \u201cincorporates by reference the due process arguments considered and rejected by this Court in <em>Etheridge.\u201d </em>However, we do not consider arguments incorporated by reference; all arguments \u201cmust be made in the appellate briefs.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 528, 537, 450 S.E.2d 365, 372 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b46-8\">JUSTICE HASSELL, with whom JUSTICE KEENAN and JUSTICE KOONTZ</author>\n<p id=\"AR\">join, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">I believe that the result reached by the majority is compelled by the absence of a sufficient record in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Article IV, Section 14, of the Constitution of Virginia provides, in part, that: \u201c[t]he General Assembly shall not enact any local, special, or private law . . . [granting to any private corporation, association, or individual any special or exclusive right, privilege, or immunity.\u201d Va. Const, art. IV, sec. 14(18). Article IV, Section 15, Va.

Rather, the prohibitions require that such classifications be \u201cnatural and reasonable, and appropriate to the occasion.\u201d <em>Benderson Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Sciortino, </em>236 Va. 136, 140-41, 372 S.E.2d 751, 753 (1988); <em>King, </em>242 Va. at 409, 410 S.E.2d at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In <em>Mandell </em>v. <em>Haddon, </em>202 Va. 979, 989, 121 S.E.2d 516, 524 (1961), we observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">\u201c[W]e must determine in each case whether [a challenged act] makes an \u2018arbitrary separation,\u2019 and this depends upon the purpose and subject of the particular act and the circumstances and conditions surrounding its passage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201cThe necessity for and the reasonableness of the classification are primarily questions for the legislature. If any state of facts can be reasonably conceived that would support it, that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed. <em>Martin\u2019s Ex\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth . . . </em>126 Va.

The presumption is that the classification is reasonable and appropriate and that the act is constitutional unless illegality appears on its face.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">I can only conclude, based upon the record before this Court, that Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15 does not contravene Virginia\u2019s constitutional prohibition against special legislation. The determinative issue is whether the statute as applied \u201cbear[s] a reasonable and substantial relation to the object sought to be accomplished by the legislation.\u201d <em>Mandell, 202 </em>Va. at 991, 121 S.E.2d at 525. The record before this Court simply does not demonstrate that the challenged statute fails to bear a reasonable and substantial relationship to the object sought to be accomplished by the legislation. In other words, Karl B. Pulliam, executor of the estate of Elnora R. Pulliam, did not present evidence to rebut the presumption that the legislative classification limiting damages was reasonable. He failed to establish that the limitation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>damages was unsupported by any reasonably conceivable state of facts at the time the statute was enacted. Thus, he did not meet the standard that must be established before the statute can be declared constitutionally impermissible. I agree with the majority\u2019s resolution of the remaining issues.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b48-5\">JUSTICE KINSER,</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">I agree with the majority\u2019s rationale and decision that the medical malpractice recovery cap contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15 does not violate any provision of either the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of Virginia.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I reach this conclusion without considering the role that <em>stare decisis </em>should play in this case.
