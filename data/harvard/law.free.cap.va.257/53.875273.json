We conclude that the court was correct, and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Appellant Simbeck, Inc., filed a motion for judgment, twice amended, against appellees Dodd Sisk Whitlock Corp. and James H. Dodd seeking compensatory and punitive damages for alleged wrongful business practices in connection with procuring insurance coverage for plaintiff\u2019s trucking business. Plaintiff operates trucks nationwide from its base in Winchester. The corporate defendant is an insurance agency in Louisa employing the individual defendant, an insurance agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The plaintiff sought recovery against defendants on numerous theories. Following many pretrial rulings, the case was tried to a jury in September 1997 on allegations that defendants were guilty of tortious interference with a business expectancy and breach of fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">During the three-day trial, the jury found in favor of the plaintiff and awarded compensatory damages of $30,000 against both defendants. The trial court reduced this amount to $12,328, the amount of the <em>ad damnum. </em>The jury also awarded punitive damages against the corporate defendant in the sum of $17,700 and against the individual defendant in the sum of $60,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">The defendants filed motions to set aside the verdicts. Following argument of counsel, the trial court, in a detailed written opinion, denied the motion to set aside the compensatory damage verdict and granted the motion to set aside the punitive damage verdict. The court memorialized these rulings in a November 1997 judgment order, from which we awarded the plaintiff this appeal, limited to the foregoing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">When a plaintiff\u2019s verdict has been set aside by the trial court, the verdict is not entitled to the same weight upon appellate review as one that has received the trial court\u2019s approval. But in considering the facts under these circumstances, the appellate court will accord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the plaintiff benefit of all substantial conflicts in the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it. <em>Commercial Bus. Sys. </em>v. <em>Halifax Corp., </em>253 Va. 292, 296, 484 S.E.2d 892, 894 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">We shall summarize the pertinent evidence, much of which was conflicting, in accord with the foregoing principles. In July 1994, plaintiff entered into \u201can insurance relationship\u201d with the defendants (collectively, the defendant) for defendant to \u201cwrite\u201d plaintiff\u2019s business insurance coverage. As the result of defendant\u2019s efforts, plaintiff entered into a series of insurance contracts with several insurers to provide liability insurance, physical damage insurance, and related coverages (hereinafter, the insurance policy) necessary to conduct plaintiff\u2019s business. The policy remained effective for a period of one year, commencing July 20, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Defendant was \u201cthe retail producer or the seller of insurance\u201d to the plaintiff, the insured. Also involved in this type of transaction were \u201cintermediaries or wholesalers which were in between the retail insurance producers and the insurance companies.\u201d The wholesaler in this transaction was W. E. Love &amp; Associates, Inc., a North Carolina broker, with whom defendant had a written brokerage agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In early July 1995, as the insurance policy was \u201ccoming due for renewal,\u201d plaintiff, through its president Ronald Simkhovitch, sought renewal coverage with a number of companies, including Service Insurance Agency, a Richmond \u201cretail insurance agency\u201d and competitor of defendant. Simkhovitch \u201cindicated that he would like to do business with\u201d Service. Greg Pohler, the owner of Service, was aware that defendant had obtained \u201ca quote\u201d for a renewal premium from \u201cOccidental Insurance Company.\u201d Service then proceeded to obtain a premium quotation from Occidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Because defendant was first in obtaining a \u201cquote\u201d for plaintiff from Occidental, however, \u201cprofessional courtesy\u201d in the industry entitled defendant to a \u201c10-day hold\u201d on its Occidental quotation. This means that Service, the competing agency, could not write the renewal policy with Occidental until defendant released the \u201cquote\u201d that it previously had obtained for plaintiff from Occidental. Plaintiff\u2019s insurance policy was to expire July 20, 1995. This was two days before expiration of defendant\u2019s ten-day hold period on the Occidental quotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Defendant refused to release the \u201cquote\u201d to Service unless Service agreed to give defendant 50 per cent of its commission and unless plaintiff executed a promissory note payable to defendant, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>be personally guaranteed by Simkhovitch, in the sum of $84,000 bearing 10 per cent interest payable over a 30-day period. Plaintiff had been regularly late in submitting premium payments to defendant and owed defendant thousands of dollars, the exact sum being undetermined at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Service agreed to share its commission with defendant but plaintiff refused to execute the note. Because plaintiff apparently would not be able to obtain insurance coverage, and thus would lack \u201coperating authority,\u201d it began \u201cslowing down its operations\u201d on July 19. But at 5:17 p.m. on the 19th, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, one of the insurers plaintiff had contacted, notified plaintiff it was providing the necessary insurance coverage effective July 20. Thus, plaintiff did not suspend its operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Defendant James Dodd, called by plaintiff as an adverse witness, testified defendant\u2019s refusal to release the \u201cquote\u201d unless plaintiff executed the note was an effort to put \u201cthe squeeze\u201d on plaintiff. Dodd explained that his use of the \u201csqueeze\u201d term as it applied to plaintiff meant he was trying \u201cto get our money that was owed us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Expert testimony offered by the plaintiff established that defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201ctotally improper,\u201d and a deviation of established custom and practice in the trucking insurance industry. The witness also indicated that defendant owed fiduciary duties as insurance broker to its insured, the plaintiff, which were breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends the trial court erred in setting aside the punitive damage award and in entering judgment for compensatory damages only. The plaintiff dwells on the elements of causes of action for tortious interference with a contract and breach of fiduciary duty. Then, plaintiff argues it \u201cintroduced testimony of the intentional and improper interference\u201d by defendant with plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccontractual relationships.\u201d It says the evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s \u201cinterference\u201d prevented Service Insurance Agency from entering into \u201cthe prospective contract\u201d with the plaintiff and likewise prevented the plaintiff from obtaining insurance coverage through Service. Plaintiff notes that Dodd admitted his actions were meant to put the \u201csqueeze\u201d on plaintiff \u201cdespite the fiduciary duty\u201d he owed plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Finally, briefly addressing the law on punitive damages, the plaintiff contends defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cnot only malicious but it borders on extortion.\u201d Plaintiff argues a jury question was presented whether defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cwilful or wanton as to show a conscious disregard for others.\u201d It contends the trial court, in decid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ing the issue as a matter of law, \u201cdeprived the jury of its responsibility to analyze the facts and its verdict should be reinstated.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The broad rule governing the award of punitive damages, the purpose of which is not so much to compensate the plaintiff but to punish the wrongdoer and to warn others, is that such damages may be recovered only when there is misconduct or actual malice, or such recklessness or negligence as to evince a conscious disregard of the rights of another. <em>Hamilton Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Broad Rock Club, Inc., </em>248 Va. 40, 45, 445 S.E.2d 140, 143 (1994). <em>Accord Webb </em>v. <em>Rivers, </em>256 Va. 460, 464, 507 S.E.2d 360, 362-63 (1998); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Litten, </em>256 Va. 573, 578, 507 S.E.2d 77, 80 (1998). Under the allegations in this case of interference with a business expectancy and breach of fiduciary duty, however, punitive damages may be awarded only if the acts are done with malice or wantonness. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Litten, </em>256 Va. at 578, 507 S.E.2d at 80. <em>See Worrie </em>v. <em>Boze, </em>198 Va. 533, 543, 95 S.E.2d 192, 200 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Awards of punitive damages are not favored generally because they are in the nature of a penalty and should be assessed \u201conly in cases involving the most egregious conduct.\u201d <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Westvaco Corp., </em>244 Va. 139, 150, 419 S.E.2d 661, 668 (1992). This is not a case involving egregious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Of course, the jury\u2019s finding of compensatory damages, confirmed by the trial court, is a determination that defendant was guilty of both tortious interference with a prospective contract and a breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff established the elements of the former cause of action, <em>i.e., </em>that plaintiff had a contract expectancy of which defendant knew; that defendant intentionally interfered with the expectancy by using improper means or methods; and that plaintiff suffered loss. <em>See Maximus, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lockheed Info. Management Sys. Co., </em>254 Va. 408, 414, 493 S.E.2d 375, 378 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s losses resulting from its \u201cslowing down of operations\u201d on July 19 were reflected in the compensatory damage award. But awarding plaintiff damages for interference with a contract expectancy and for breach of fiduciary duty does not <em>ipso facto </em>support an award of punitive damages, as the plaintiff seems to argue. Rather, as we have said, under these circumstances there must be malicious or wanton conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">According the plaintiff benefit of all substantial conflicts in the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it, we conclude the trial court correctly ruled there was no evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>acts done with malice or wantonness. As the trial court noted, the defendant violated unwritten trade customs or ethical practices in the trucking insurance business in an effort to make the plaintiff pay a debt owed to defendant. The defendant requested plaintiff to execute a note for an underlying debt and refused to release an insurance \u201cquote,\u201d both of which were lawful acts, in an effort to make plaintiff pay defendant the sum it owed. If Simkhovitch had executed the note, plaintiff would have suffered no loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The plaintiff argues the amount of the note, $84,000, \u201cbore no resemblance to the amount demanded by [defendant] for payment. In fact, it was admitted by the [defendant] at trial that the debt paid was approximately $25,000.\u201d This is not an accurate summary of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Instead, the evidence shows that, based upon defendant\u2019s records, defendant reasonably believed plaintiff owed it more than $76,000 when the note was presented for Simkhovitch\u2019s signature. Because of the provisions of the brokerage agreement between defendant and W. E. Love, the North Carolina broker, defendant was liable to Love for plaintiff\u2019s insurance premiums, whether or not plaintiff paid defendant. At the time the note was presented for signature on July 18, 1995, the amount due defendant could only be estimated because no policy audits had been conducted, and because plaintiff, without defendant\u2019s knowledge, had made some premium payments directly to Love and Love had not credited defendant\u2019s account. Thus, defendant was confronted not only with large sums due it from plaintiff, but also with a possible debt due from defendant to Love on account of plaintiff\u2019s failures. In a letter attached to the note, however, defendant said the amount was only \u201can estimated figure\u201d and that when \u201cwe get the exact amount and audits are completed, we can then give credits . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In August 1995, defendant sued plaintiff in the Circuit Court of Louisa County for approximately $76,000 for unpaid premiums due on the 1994-1995 insurance policy. Following completion of the audits and when the exact amount due was determined, the Louisa action eventually was settled for $25,000 in July 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In sum, an accurate and complete review of the evidence shows that defendant\u2019s attempt to collect a debt due it by plaintiff by putting \u201cthe squeeze\u201d on plaintiff was not malicious or wanton, but merely an act of commercial \u201chard ball.\u201d Consequently, we hold the trial court did not err in concluding that, while defendant\u2019s violations of trade standards were the basis of both the tortious interference and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>breach of fiduciary duty rights of action, such violations were insufficient as a matter of law to justify imposition of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Thus, the trial court acted properly in setting aside the punitive damage verdict, and the judgment below will be</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
