Johnson, the claimant, sustained a compensable left ankle injury that arose out of and in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>her employment with appellant Amoco Foam Products Company, the employer. Following lengthy treatment and June 1994 surgery on the ankle, the claimant fell at home in August 1994 while recovering from the surgery when the ankle gave way, causing injury to her right knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">In a September 1995 opinion, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission affirmed a deputy commissioner\u2019s ruling that the 1994 right knee injury was a compensable consequence of the July 1992 industrial accident, and awarded compensation accordingly. The self-insured employer did not appeal this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The present case arises from the claimant\u2019s application seeking payment of compensation as a result of a further right knee injury that occurred in November 1995 when her right knee \u201cgave out\u201d at home causing her to fall. The claimant sought permanent disability benefits as a result of a 20% loss of use to the right leg caused by the August 1994 compensable consequence injury. The claimant also sought compensation for a period of total work incapacity of about 30 days during November-December 1995 as a result of the further right knee injury occurring in November 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In a January 1997 opinion, the Commission affirmed a deputy commissioner\u2019s decision awarding benefits. The deputy found that the claimant\u2019s November 1995 fall was a compensable consequence of her August 1994 accident, which, in the Commission\u2019s words, \u201cwas previously adjudged to be a compensable consequence of the claimant\u2019s original industrial injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Following the employer\u2019s appeal, a panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the Commission. <em>Amoco Foam Prod. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>26 Va. App. 267, 494 S.E.2d 169 (1997). In framing the issue, the Court of Appeals said: \u201cThe determination that the 1994 knee injury was a compensable consequence of claimant\u2019s ankle injury is <em>res judicata. </em>It is undisputed that claimant\u2019s original 1992 injury was not the immediate cause of her 1995 injury. Consequently, the issue before us is whether as a matter of law the commission may award benefits for an injury caused by a compensable consequence, or, in other words, whether a claimant may recover for a compensable consequence of a compensable consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 494 S.E.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Answering the question in the affirmative, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cIn the instant case, the evidence established that claimant\u2019s 1995 knee injury was causally related to her 1994 knee injury which was causally related to her initial ankle injury. This chain of causation is direct and natural, and there is no evidence of any intervening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>cause attributable to claimant\u2019s conduct. Furthermore, claimant\u2019s 1994 compensable consequence knee injury becomes a primary injury, and the injury it caused in 1995 is clearly a compensable consequence of it. We hold that claimant\u2019s November 1995 knee injury is a compensable consequence of her 1994 knee injury and of her 1992 ankle injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275-76, 494 S.E.2d at 173-74. The employer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The question is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in answering the foregoing question affirmatively. We hold that the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Any discussion of the doctrine of compensable consequences must recognize the basic concept that a disputed accidental injury must arise out of and be in the course of employment in order to be compensable. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (defining <em>\u201cInjury\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">This Court first addressed the compensable consequences idea in <em>Immer and Co. </em>v. <em>Brosnahan, </em>207 Va. 720, 152 S.E.2d 254 (1967). There, the question presented was \u201cwhether an employee who suffers a compensable injury may be awarded compensation for additional injuries suffered in an automobile accident occurring while the employee is en route from his place of employment to a doctor\u2019s office for further treatment of the original injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721, 152 S.E.2d at 255. The Court stated, regarding the second injury, \u201c[t]he struggle seems to be with determining whether such an additional injury \u2018arises out of the employment.\u2019 The eternal search in making the . . . determination is to find the presence or absence of a \u2018causal connection\u2019 between the incidents of employment and the additional injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 722, 152 S.E.2d at 255-56. Affirming the employee\u2019s award of compensation, the Court said the evidence in that case established such a causal connection. <em>Id. </em>at 728, 152 S.E.2d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Citing <em>Brosnahan, </em>the Court discussed the doctrine of compensable consequences in <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>218 Va. 210, 237 S.E.2d 97 (1977). There, a claimant was injured in a restaurant when he fell while on crutches required for treatment of an initial industrial injury. This Court pointed out that the \u201cdoctrine extends the canopy of the Workman\u2019s Compensation Act to the resulting injury . . . because the second injury is treated as if it occurred in the course of and arising out of the employee\u2019s employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214, 237 S.E.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Under the <em>Brosnahan </em>test, the crucial inquiry here is whether there is a causal connection between the incidents of employment giving rise to the 1992 ankle injury and the additional 1995 knee injury. The record in this case clearly establishes there is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The Court of Appeals stated: \u201cIt is undisputed that claimant\u2019s original 1992 injury was not an immediate cause of her 1995 injury.\u201d This conclusion is fully supported by the relevant medical testimony. The claimant\u2019s attending physician reported in April 1996: \u201cEssie Johnson fell originally in August of 1994. She had another fall in November 1995, but I tend to think that this was largely due to the injury of August 1994. She was having pain at the time of November 1995 following the injury of August 1994 and her knee \u2018buckled\u2019 on her. I tend to think that her continued pain is what actually caused her to buckle, and that this is all causily [sic] related to the August 1994 injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">In sum, the record fails to establish a causal connection between the original injury and the November 1995 injury, a requirement for compensability of the latter injury. In other words, the latter injury did not arise out of the employment because there is absence of a causal connection between the incidents of claimant\u2019s employment and the 1995 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Under these circumstances, contrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling, it does not logically follow that merely because the 1994 injury was causally related to the 1992 accident and the 1995 injury was causally related to the 1994 injury, then the 1995 injury was causally related to the 1992 accident. The link of causation must directly connect the original accidental injury with the additional injury for which compensation is sought. Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that claimant\u2019s November 1995 knee injury was a compensable consequence of her 1992 ankle injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the award of compensation for total work incapacity from November 13 through December 12, 1995, and will enter final judgment here dismissing the application for those benefits. This judgment, however, does not affect the award of compensation \u201cfor 20% permanent loss of the right leg.\u201d Those permanent disability benefits are not legitimately in question in this appeal because they were based on the ruling that the August 1994 injury was a compensable consequence of the 1992 injury, a ruling that was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
