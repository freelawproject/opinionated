Because the claimant\u2019s contact dermatitis was caused by a reaction to allergens in certain flowers and not by cumulative trauma induced by repetitive motion, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals that the condition is compensable under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">Elaine Ruth Webb has been employed by A New Leaf, Inc. (A New Leaf), as a florist since October 1993. In 1994, she became the store\u2019s senior florist. Her responsibilities included daily handling, cutting, and arranging of flowers. She was also in charge of weddings, preparing store designs, and compiling daily financial reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">In March 1995, Webb noticed blistered, splotchy areas on her right index finger and on the palm of her right hand. Webb described the condition as similar in appearance to a poison ivy rash. Initially, she believed that the problem was just an irritation and that she could treat it with nonprescription lotions. However, the blistering worsened.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Consequently, in August 1995, Webb decided to seek treatment from her family physician, Dr. John Carpenter. After examining Webb\u2019s hands, Dr. Carpenter diagnosed \u201cDermatitis\u201d but was \u201cunclear whether it [was] fungal or a contact type of dermatitis or a combination.\u201d Dr. Carpenter prescribed several medications for the dermatitis. After the medications did not alleviate Webb\u2019s problem, Dr. Carpenter recommended that she see a dermatologist. By then, the blistering had appeared on two of Webb\u2019s fingers and the thumb on her right hand. It was also present on the same fingers and thumb on her left hand. From there, the dermatitis had spread from her left wrist up to her elbow.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">In November 1995, Dr. Anna M. Magee, a dermatologist, examined Webb. Dr. Magee diagnosed Webb\u2019s condition as \u201cAllergic Contact Dermatitis to plants most likely.\u201d She also prescribed medications to treat the dermatitis, recommended that Webb wear gloves while performing her florist duties, and warned Webb about the risks of working with certain flowers. Dr. Magee eventually performed a patch test on Webb to determine which flowers were causing Webb\u2019s problem. On April 4, 1996, Dr. Magee reported that Webb\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was attributable to her interaction with tulips and alstroemeria.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In two letter reports, dated April 4, 1996, and July 5, 1996, Dr. Magee opined that Webb was allergic to alstroemeria and tulips and that, therefore, her condition was an occupational disease. She also stated that allergic contact dermatitis is a common problem for florists. Dr. Magee subsequently confirmed that Webb\u2019s contact dermatitis was \u201cmost likely caused by at least two and probably more physical contacts with the chemicals contained in alstro[e]meria and tulips during her employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Webb introduced into evidence two articles dealing with the relationship between contact dermatitis caused by allergens found in certain plants and the florist industry: Cindy Hoogasian, <em>Dermatitis Concerns Continue, </em>Florist, March 1990, at 75; Cindy Hoogasian, <em>Dermatitis Concerns Spark Industry Study, </em>Florist, Jan. 1988, at 95. In these articles, Hoogasian describes allergic contact dermatitis as a \u201creaction of the body\u2019s immune system to the substance to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>that person is sensitive . . . .\u201d (Hoogasian, 1990, <em>supra, </em>at 77). She states that flowers, such as the alstroemeria and tulip, contain chemicals or allergens that \u201ccause allergic skin reactions in some people with skin sensitivities.\u201d (Hoogasian, 1988, <em>supra, </em>at 96). Hoogasian further opines that \u201c[t]here is little or no fear\u201d the public will develop allergic sensitivity to the allergen in alstroemeria because \u201ctheir actual involvement with the flower is limited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98. \u201cOnly in cases where there is constant contact with the juice of the alstroemeria, such as a designer or a sales employee would have, is there cause for concern.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Webb filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits on May 15, 1996. A deputy commissioner of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (Commission) awarded benefits to Webb, finding that the contact dermatitis is an occupational disease under Code \u00a7 65.2-400. Upon review, the full Commission affirmed the award of benefits to Webb. A panel of the Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed the decision of the Commission. A <em>New Leaf, Inc. v. Webb, 26 </em>Va. App. 460, 495 S.E.2d 510 (1998). In explaining its decision, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">Credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s factual finding that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was not caused by \u201ccumulative traumatic insults resulting from repetitive motion.\u201d The record indicates that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was not causally linked to any repetitive motion that she performed at work. Allergic contact dermatitis is caused by the reaction of an individual\u2019s immune system with a substance, such as chemicals contained in certain flowers, to which that individual has developed a hypersensitivity. It is not caused by the wear and tear associated with a repetitive motion. Although [Webb\u2019s] duties included designing and constructing floral arrangements and \u201cprocessing\u201d flowers delivered to [A New Leaf\u2019s] store, no evidence linked the motions associated with these activities to the outbreak of dermatitis on [Webb\u2019s] hands and arms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 468, 495 S.E.2d at 514. (Citations omitted). A New Leaf appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>n.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Under the Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-100 to -1310, a claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence either an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d or an \u201coccupational disease.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101; <em>see also Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 584, 385 S.E.2d 858, 862 (1989). Webb filed her claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits on the basis that contact dermatitis is an occupational disease. The term \u201coccupational disease\u201d is defined as \u201ca disease arising out of and in the course of employment, but not an ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-400(A). Subsection B of Code \u00a7 65.2-400 specifies six factors that are necessary to establish a causal connection between a disease and a worker\u2019s employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">A disease shall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">1. A direct causal connection between the conditions under which work is performed and the occupational disease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">2. It can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">3. It can be fairly traced to the employment as the proximate cause;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">4. It is neither a disease to which an employee may have had substantial exposure outside of the employment, nor any condition of the neck, back or spinal column;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">5. It is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">6. It had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and flowed from that source as a natural consequence, though it need not have been foreseen or expected before its contraction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">A New Leaf concedes that Webb proved each of these factors. Nevertheless, A New Leaf contends that Webb\u2019s contact dermatitis is not compensable as an occupational disease because it was caused by repeated exposure to flowers and thus is the result of cumulative trauma. Relying primarily on this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>The Stenrich Group </em>v. <em>Jemmott, </em>251 Va. 186, 467 S.E.2d 795 (1996), and <em>Merillat Indus., Inc. v. Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 436 S.E.2d 600 (1993), A New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Leaf argues that Webb\u2019s repeated touching of the flowers gradually caused visible sores and wounds on her hands. According to A New Leaf, \u201c[t]he touching of the flowers caused Webb to develop physical wounds on her body, the manifestation of repeated trauma to her hands by the chemicals in the flowers.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A), an award of benefits by the Commission upon review \u201cshall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d However, \u201cwhether a worker has suffered an impairment that constitutes a compensable disease is a mixed question of law and fact\u201d <em>Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 192, 467 S.E.2d at 798. Thus, the Commission\u2019s finding on that question is not conclusive but is a proper subject for judicial review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">As in <em>Jemmott, </em>the factual part of the inquiry in this case is whether Webb suffered an impairment. <em>Id. </em>This portion includes any facts relevant to the nature and cause of the impairment sustained by Webb. The legal part of the mixed question is whether Webb\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis constitutes an occupational disease within the meaning of the Act. <em>Id. </em>As already stated, A New Leaf contests only the legal portion of the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We turn now to the two cases upon which A New Leaf relies in support of its position. In <em>Merillat, </em>we addressed whether a tom rotator cuff muscle sustained as a result of repetitive motion was compensable under the Act as an occupational disease. Upon examining the six factors in Code \u00a7 65.2-400(B) that are required to establish a causal connection between a disease and a worker\u2019s employment, we concluded that merely satisfying the causality test is not sufficient unless \u201cthe condition for which compensation is sought as an occupational disease . . . first qualifies] as a disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 436 S.E.2d at 601. We then stated that the Commission\u2019s finding of an occupational disease was \u201cnot a finding of fact that the tear was a disease rather than an injury, but a conclusion based solely on utilization of a causality analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 602. Thus, we concluded that the worker\u2019s rotator cuff tear was an injury, not an occupational disease, because it resulted from repetitive motion. We specifically refused \u201cto broaden the scope of the Act to include job-related impairments arising from repetitive motion or cumulative trauma.\u201d <em>Id., </em>436 S.E.2d at 601-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">In <em>Jemmott, </em>we again addressed the range of occupational diseases compensable under the Act and, in doing so, considered the claims of three workers who had suffered either carpal tunnel syndrome or \u201ctrigger thumb.\u201d The doctors who had treated the claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ants opined that the particular impairments at issue were diseases, but they also stated that the impairments were the result of cumulative trauma induced by repetitive motion. Accordingly, we concluded that each claimant\u2019s impairment must be classified as an injury, not a disease. <em>Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 198, 467 S.E.2d at 802. In reaching that decision, we stated that \u201cjust because a doctor opines that a particular impairment is a disease does not necessarily make it so.\u201d <em>Id., </em>467 S.E.2d at 801. We also emphasized, once again, \u201cthat job-related impairments resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion, however labeled or however defined, are, as a matter of law, not compensable under the . . . Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 467 S.E.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Since A New Leaf concedes that Webb proved the six factors contained in Code \u00a7 65.2-400(B), the dispositive inquiry is whether contact dermatitis \u201cqualifies] as a disease.\u201d <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 432, 436 S.E.2d at 601. In making that determination in <em>Merillat </em>and <em>Jemmott, </em>we considered the nature and cause of the impairments. For example, the tom rotator cuff muscle \u201cresulted from repetitive overhead lifting and manipulation with [the worker\u2019s] left arm.\u201d <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 430, 436 S.E.2d at 600. Similarly, in <em>Jemmot, </em>one of the doctors who diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome testified in a deposition that the repetitive motions involved in the worker\u2019s job caused \u201c \u2018micro trauma,\u2019 meaning \u2018a small amount of injury in a repetitive motion to the same area . . . occurring] in patients [who] flex their wrist and impinge the nerve as it courses through the carpal tunnel.\u2019 \u201d 251 Va. at 189-90, 467 S.E.2d at 797. Likewise, the doctor who diagnosed \u201ctrigger thumb\u201d attributed that impairment to \u201c \u2018the accumulation or the product of many repetitious minor injuries to a joint, in the case here of the thumbs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 467 S.E.2d at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In contrast to the evidence in <em>Merillat </em>and <em>Jemmott, </em>Dr. Magee stated that Webb is allergic to alstroemeria and tulips and that the contact dermatitis was caused by Webb\u2019s physical contact with the chemicals contained in those flowers. Contact dermatitis was described as a \u201creaction of the body\u2019s immune system to the substance to which that person is sensitive.\u201d (Hoogasian, 1990, <em>supra, </em>at 77). Although the sores and blisters appeared on Webb\u2019s hands after frequent handling of the flowers in question, there is no evidence in the record that Webb\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis resulted from cumulative trauma arising from repetitive motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">As the Commission stated in its opinion, \u201cthe evidence reveals exposure over time to a particular causative agent resulting in an adverse reaction in the form of contact dermatitis.\u201d The chemicals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>in alstroemeria and tulips triggered a dermatological reaction, which is distinct from the wear and tear resulting from a repetitive motion. Thus, allergic contact dermatitis, unlike carpal tunnel syndrome, \u201ctrigger thumb,\u201d or a tom rotator cuff muscle, \u201cqualifies] as a disease.\u201d <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 432, 436 S.E.2d at 601. Accordingly, we conclude that Webb\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis is a compensable occupational disease within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\"> Webb testified that she had never before experienced any dermatological problems to her hands. In fact, she had not previously worked with real flowers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> A New Leaf decided to stop stocking alstroemeria. It still uses tulips since they are in season for only a short period of time during the year, unlike alstroemeria, which is available throughout the year.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
