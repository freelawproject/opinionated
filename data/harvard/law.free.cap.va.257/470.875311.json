(Industrial Alloy) and Precision Components Corporation (Precision Components) from Williams Industries, Inc. (Williams Industries) and IAF Transfer Corporation (IAF Transfer). From a judgment in favor of Williams Industries and IAF Transfer, we awarded Industrial Alloy and Precision Components this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">Industrial Alloy is a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in Richmond, Virginia. At all relevant times, it has been engaged in the business of providing customers with design and production of custom pressure vessels, tanks, reactors, distillation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>columns, and other process equipment. Precision Components, which is also a Pennsylvania corporation, is \u201cthe majority holder\u201d of Industrial Alloy. Precision Components\u2019 principal place of business is in York, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Williams Industries is a Virginia corporation with its principal place of business in Fairfax County. IAF Transfer is also a Virginia corporation based in Fairfax County, and it is the wholly owned subsidiary of Williams Industries. IAF Transfer formerly was known as Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc. (a Virginia corporation), but changed its official corporate name to IAF Transfer Corporation (a Virginia corporation) about the time the parties entered into an \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d (the Agreement), which is at the heart of the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The Agreement is dated October 31, 1994. Pursuant to its terms, Precision Components and Industrial Alloy (the Buyers) agreed to purchase for $3,600,000 all the assets, including the corporate name, of the former Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc. from IAF Transfer and Williams Industries (the Sellers). The Agreement provided that it was to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In \u00a7 9.1 of the Agreement, the Sellers agreed to indemnify the Buyers \u201cagainst and in respect of, any and all claims, damages, actions, judgments, losses, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by [the Buyers] arising from or in connection with ... (a) all Liabilities of [the Sellers], whether accrued, absolute, fixed, contingent or otherwise, other than Assumed Liabilities.\u201d The Sellers further agreed in \u00a7 9.1(b) to indemnify the Buyers against \u201cany breach of any covenant or obligation of [the Sellers] incurred under this Agreement, or because any representation or warranty by [the Sellers] contained herein . . . shall be false or misleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">In \u00a7 2.2 of the Agreement, the Buyers assumed certain liabilities shown on an October 31, 1994 balance sheet as well as liabilities or obligations arising under certain contracts. Section 2.1 provided, however, that, except for the assumed liabilities, the Buyers would not be \u201chable for any debt, claim, responsibility, damages, fines, penalties, costs, expenses, liability or obligation of [the Sellers] . . . whether disclosed or undisclosed . . . fixed or contingent [and] whether due or to become due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Section 6.14 of the Agreement provided that the Sellers shall comply with the provisions of the Virginia Bulk Sales Act, Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 8.6-101 through -111, \u201cin connection with this sale of assets.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this section of the Agreement, the Sellers also warranted that \u201cthere are no creditors of any type or nature which have not specifically been disclosed by identity and amount\u201d to the Buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Section 9.3 of the Agreement required the \u201cIndemnified Party\u201d to notify the \u201cIndemnifying Party\u201d by registered mail whenever any claim for indemnification arises under the Agreement. Section 9.4 gives the \u201cIndemnifying Party\u201d the right to participate in the defense of any claim or demand by any third party against the \u201cIndemnified Party.\u201d And \u00a7 9.5 provided that <em>\u201cthe Indemnified Party shall make no settlement of any claim that would give rise to liability on the part of the Indemnifying Party under an indemnity contained in this Section 9 without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">At the time the parties entered into the Agreement in October 1994, there was pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina a products liability action which had been initiated on March 31, 1994, by Unitex Chemical Corporation against the former Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc. <em>Unitex Chemical Corp. v. Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc., </em>No. 2:94CV00164 (M.D. N.C., Greensboro Div.) (the North Carolina litigation). It was stipulated below that the Buyers, prior to their purchase of the assets in question, received a letter signed by counsel for the Sellers which provided a description and analysis of litigation pending against the former Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc., including the North Carolina litigation. It was further stipulated that the letter was incorporated by reference into the Agreement. However, it is undisputed that the claim asserted in the North Carolina litigation was not one of the liabilities assumed by the Buyers pursuant to \u00a7 2.2 of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Core States Bank, N.A. (the Bank), had agreed to finance the Buyers\u2019 acquisition of the assets, and the Bank wanted to protect the collateral that would act as security for the debt. Although the Agreement required the Sellers to furnish the Buyers a list of the Sellers\u2019 creditors and the Buyers had requested such a list, none had been furnished as the date approached for closing under the Agreement, and the Bank refused to release the funds. As a direct result, the parties and the Bank entered into an escrow agreement, which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>vided for the establishment of an escrow account to ensure the Sellers\u2019 compliance with the Virginia Bulk Sales Act. Although the Sellers believed the Bulk Sales Act did not apply to the transaction involved in the Agreement, they acquiesced in and agreed to the Buyers\u2019 publication of a notice in the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch </em>of the Buyers\u2019 intent to pay the Sellers\u2019 debts in full.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The notice, prepared by the Buyers\u2019 then counsel, stated that a bulk transfer was about to be made by the former Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc., as the seller, to the new Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc., as the buyer, and that \u201cBuyer has become bound by the terms of a certain agreement between it and Seller to pay Seller\u2019s debts in full.\u201d The notice appeared in the newspaper on November 3 and 10, 1994. The parties then proceeded to close the transaction for the asset purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">On September 18, 1995, Unitex Chemical Corporation, the plaintiff in the North Carolina litigation, filed a complaint against the Buyers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging a violation of the Bulk Sales Act for the Buyers\u2019 failure to give Unitex notice of the asset transfer. <em>Unitex Chemical Corp. v. Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc., </em>Civil Action No. 3:95CV777 (E.D. Va., Richmond Div.) (the Virginia Bulk Sales litigation). In their answer filed January 6, 1996, the Buyers responded that they \u201cwere not required to provide [Unitex notice] because the transaction was exempted, pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 8.6-103.\u201d Unitex then sought leave to amend its complaint to seek a declaratory judgment that the Buyers had assumed the debts of the former Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc. by virtue of the notice published in the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The district court never ruled on Unitex\u2019s motion to amend because, on March 20, 1996, the Buyers entered into a \u201cStipulation and Settlement Agreement\u201d with Unitex \u201cto settle all claims asserted\u201d in the Virginia Bulk Sales litigation. Pursuant to this agreement, Unitex dismissed the Virginia Bulk Sales litigation in exchange for the Buyers\u2019 agreement to pay any judgment returned for Unitex in the North Carolina litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The Sellers were aware of the filing of the complaint in the Virginia litigation and of the fact that depositions were scheduled to be taken in the case. However, the Buyers neither gave the Sellers prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>notice of the settlement of the litigation nor sought their consent to the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The Buyers participated in settlement discussions concerning the claim asserted in the North Carolina litigation and ultimately contributed $300,000 toward settlement of that claim. The parties to the litigation entered into a \u201cSettlement Agreement and Mutual Release of All Claims\u201d dated June 10, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The Buyers then made demand upon the Sellers to comply with the indemnification provisions of the Agreement. The Sellers made no response to the demand, and, on October 3, 1996, the Buyers filed in the court below a two-count motion for judgment against the Sellers seeking to recover the $300,000 the Buyers had contributed to settlement of the North Carolina litigation, plus attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In Count I of the motion for judgment, the Buyers alleged a breach of warranty by the Sellers for their failure to disclose all the creditors of the former Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc. In Count II, the Buyers sought to enforce the indemnification provisions of the Agreement. In their grounds of defense, the Sellers responded, <em>inter alia, </em>that they were not liable to the Buyers because the sums for which the Buyers sought indemnification \u201cwere the product of a settlement [of the Virginia Bulk Sales litigation] of which [the Sellers] were given no advance notice, and to which [the Sellers] did not consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Both the Buyers and the Sellers filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court denied the Buyers\u2019 motion and took the Sellers\u2019 motion under advisement. At a bench trial, the Sellers contended that the Buyers were not entitled to recover because they failed to give notice of, or obtain the Sellers\u2019 consent to, the settlement of the Virginia Bulk Sales litigation, as required by \u00a7\u00a7 9.3 and .5 of the Agreement. The Buyers contended that the notice and consent provisions of the Agreement were not applicable because the Sellers\u2019 liability to indemnify the Buyers did not arise from the settlement of the Virginia Bulk Sales litigation. Rather, the Buyers said, the Sellers\u2019 liability was a preexisting obligation arising from the publication in the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch </em>of the notice whereby the Buyers agreed to be bound to pay the Sellers\u2019 obligations in full, in which publication the Sellers acquiesced.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Upon conclusion of the trial, the court issued a letter opinion, which it incorporated into its final order by reference. The court rejected the Buyers\u2019 contention that the notice and consent provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>of the Agreement were not applicable and agreed with the Sellers that the Buyers\u2019 \u201cfailure to adhere to [the consent requirement of] Section 9.5 of the Asset Purchase Agreement will preclude the [Buyers] from obtaining indemnification for their contribution to the North Carolina litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">As noted previously, the Agreement provides that it is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In that Commonwealth, \u201cindemnification clauses are generally \u2018not favored by the law\u2019 and are subject to a strict construction compelling an interpretation \u2018against the party seeking their protection.\u2019\u201c <em>Lackie v. Niagara Mach. &amp; Tool Works, </em>559 F. Supp. 377, 378 (E.D.Pa. 1983) (quoting <em>Dilks </em>v. <em>Flohr Chevrolet, Inc., </em>192 A.2d 682, 687 (Pa. 1963)); <em>see also Kiewit Eastern Co. v. L &amp; R Constr. Co., </em>44 F.3d 1194, 1202 (3d Cir. 1995) (Pennsylvania law requires that an indemnity agreement be strictly construed against party asserting it.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In the interpretation of a contract, Pennsylvania law requires that \u201c \u2018each and every part of it must be taken into consideration and given effect, if possible, and the intention of the parties must be ascertained from the entire instrument.\u2019\u201d <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. MATX, Inc., </em>703 A.2d 39, 42 (Pa. Super. 1997) (quoting <em>Marcinak </em>v. <em>Southeastern Greene School District, </em>544 A.2d 1025, 1027 (Pa. Super. 1988)); <em>see also Department of Transp. v. Manor Mines, Inc., </em>565 A.2d 428, 432 (Pa. 1989) (when interpreting a contract, court must give effect to all its provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">With respect to indemnification, the common law of Pennsylvania requires that \u201c[w]hen a party settles a claim with .an injured individual, then sues the party primarily responsible for the harm for indemnity, the settling party must prove[, <em>inter alia,] </em>that proper notice was given to the party from whom it seeks indemnity.\u201d <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>v. <em>Youngstown Steel Door Co., </em>695 F. Supp. 1577, 1581 (E.D.Pa. 1988); <em>see also Tugboat Indian Co. </em>v. <em>A/S Ivarans Rederi, </em>5 A.2d 153, 156 (Pa. 1939) (one secondarily liable for injury may recover indemnity from one primarily responsible provided he has given proper notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">On appeal, the Buyers contend, as they contended below, that the notice and consent provisions of the Agreement did not apply to their settlement of the Virginia Bulk Sales litigation because that \u201csettlement did nothing more than recognize an obligation previously created [upon the Buyers] by virtue of the Bulk Sales Act public notice.\u201d The Buyers state that \u00a7 9.5 requires consent when a settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ment \u201cwould <em>give rise to liability </em>on the part of the Indemnifying Party.\u201d They then note that in <em>Plymouth Township </em>v. <em>Borough of Larksville, </em>110 A. 801 (Pa. 1920), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court defined the term \u201cliability\u201d as including \u201cevery kind of obligation, even obligations that are unascertained or imperfect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">From this, the Buyers argue that, \u201ceven though the monetary amount of the obligation to Unitex was unascertained at the time of the Agreement, liability still attached to Buyers at the time of the Bulk Sales Act public notice in November, 1994,\u201d and that it was this event, which had the Sellers\u2019 approval, and not the settlement of the Virginia Bulk Sales litigation, which \u201cgave rise to the Sellers\u2019 indemnification liability.\u201d Hence, the Buyers conclude, the settlement of the Virginia litigation \u201chad no legal significance,\u201d and the trial court erred when it selected the settlement \u201cas the triggering event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We disagree with the Buyers\u2019 conclusion. To adopt their view would, contrary to Pennsylvania law, require a strict construction of the indemnification provisions of the Agreement against the Sellers, rather than the Buyers, fail to give effect to each and every part of the Agreement, deny the Sellers the right to prior notice as provided by \u00a7 9.3 of the Agreement and Pennsylvania common law, and effectively write the consent provision of \u00a7 9.5 out of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Although we express no opinion on the subject, the Buyers may be correct in saying, as they say on brief, that upon publication of the Bulk Sales notice, they \u201cbecame unconditionally liable to pay the North Carolina product liability claim.\u201d However, as the Sellers point out, \u00a7 9.5 of the Agreement \u201cby its terms is not concerned with the time at which the basis of Buyers\u2019 liability . . . arose\u201d but, instead, \u201cthe event triggering the [Buyers\u2019] obligation to seek and obtain the [Sellers\u2019] consent is the [Buyers\u2019] \u2018settlement of any claim that would give rise to liability <em>on the part of the [Sellers] under an indemnity contained in [the </em>Agreement/.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In other words, \u00a7 9.5 contemplates that regardless of the point in time at which liability may arise against the Buyers for a claim within the intendment of the Agreement, it is not the attachment of such liability to the Buyers but the subsequent settlement of the claim that is decisive. Under the terms of \u00a7 9.5, not until that time arrives does there exist a \u201csettlement . . . that would give rise to liability on the part of the Indemnifying Party under an indemnity contained in [the Agreement].\u201d The settlement of the Virginia Bulk Sales litigation was such a settlement, the Sellers\u2019 consent thereto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>was required, and, in the words of the trial court, the Buyers\u2019 \u201cfailure to [obtain the consent] will preclude [them] from obtaining indemnification for their contribution to [settlement of] the North Carolina litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The Buyers, however, cite a statement in the trial court\u2019s letter opinion that \u201ca liability or debt cannot be \u2018pre-existing\u2019 if it has yet to be imposed.\u201d The Buyers then argue that if the publication of the Bulk Sales notice did not impose indemnification liability upon the Sellers then the liability was not imposed until the Buyers contributed the $300,000 toward settlement of the North Carolina litigation. This settlement, the Buyers say, occurred with the Sellers approval, as demonstrated by two letters written by the Sellers\u2019 corporate counsel shortly before the $300,000 was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">However, the trial court made the explicit finding that \u201c[n]either letter evinces \u2018consent\u2019 by the [Sellers] to the Virginia settlement nor is it a waiver of the consent requirement under the Agreement.\u201d Our reading of the two letters satisfies us of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s finding. Indeed, the first letter, addressed to the Buyers\u2019 counsel, while noting that the addressee earlier had been authorized to contribute $300,000 toward the effort to settle the North Carolina litigation, stated that \u201c[t]here has not been any waiver, settlement or other understanding between [the Buyers] and [the Sellers] regarding the efforts to settle or defend this case, and all rights have been reserved as asserted in the various correspondence or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The second letter, addressed directly to Precision Components, while urging the Buyers to settle the North Carolina litigation, stated that \u201c[the Sellers] believe that your voluntary assumption of the Unitex claim under [the agreement settling the Virginia Bulk Trades litigation], without notice to or consent by us, relieves us of any obligation to indemnify you for the claim and constitutes a violation of the Asset Purchase Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Finally, the Buyers argue that the trial court erred in denying them recovery on the breach of warranty claim alleged in Count I of their motion for judgment. The Buyers base this claim upon a purported violation by the Sellers of \u00a7 6.14 of the Agreement, which required the Sellers to furnish the Buyers a list of creditors as described by Code \u00a7 8.6-104 of the Bulk Sales Act and to warrant \u201cthat there are no creditors of any type or nature which have not specifically been disclosed by identity and amount to [the Buyers.]\u201d The Buyers complain that the Sellers did not provide them with a list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>of creditors and did not specifically disclose all creditors by identity and amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The Buyers assert that the trial court implicitly held that the Buyers\u2019 failure to comply with the consent provision of \u00a7 9.5 \u201ccut off their breach of warranty claim.\u201d However, we find nothing in the trial court\u2019s letter opinion or final order to support this argument. Rather, in its letter opinion, the trial court adopted the Sellers\u2019 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Included was a finding that any failure of the Sellers to furnish a list of creditors was not the proximate cause of any damage to the Buyers since they had sufficient information from \u201cthe due diligence performed on [the Sellers]\u201d to satisfy \u201cany obligations [the Buyers] had under \u00a7 8.6-104 [and -105] of the [Bulk Sales] Act to send notices to [the Sellers\u2019] creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Furthermore, as the Sellers point out, \u201cthe only creditor of [the former Industrial Alloy Fabricators, Inc.] relevant to this litigation is Unitex, and it is undisputed that Sellers specifically disclosed to Buyers the existence of Unitex\u2019s outstanding claim . . . well in advance of the closing date of the asset purchase.\u201d Hence, any discussion of the Sellers\u2019 failure to furnish a list of irrelevant creditors would be purely academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">For the reasons assigned, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> The Code sections formerly comprising the Bulk Sales Act, \u00a7\u00a7 8.6-101 through -111, were repealed in 1997 and replaced by Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.6A-101 through -110. 1997 Va.
