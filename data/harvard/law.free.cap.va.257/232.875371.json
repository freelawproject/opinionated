Shortridge, Sr. owns a 56.7 acre parcel in Powhatan County located on Judes Ferry Road (the Judes Ferry Property). The Judes Ferry Property lies in a portion of the county zoned as an Agricultural District (A-l). In 1990, the Powhatan County Board of Supervisors granted Shortridge a one-year Conditional Use Permit to operate a portable sawmill on the property. The permit was renewed for a five-year period in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Just after his permit expired in June 1996, Shortridge requested that the zoning administrator construe the term \u201clumbering\u201d as used in the zoning ordinance to include his sawmill activities. Such a construction would have rendered Shortridge\u2019s use a permitted use in the A-l district, obviating the need for a conditional use permit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>administrator denied the request because she concluded that Short-ridge\u2019s activities, cutting and sawing logs from sites other than the Judes Ferry Property, were not lumbering since lumbering was \u201cthe business of cutting or getting timber or logs from the forest for lumber.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Shortridge appealed the denial to the Board of Zoning Appeals (the BZA). In October, 1996, the BZA reversed the decision of the zoning administrator. It \u201crule[d] that what Mr. Shortridge is doing on his property is within the meaning of the term lumbering as it is used in the Powhatan County Zoning Ordinance today.\u201d On November 8, 1996, James E. Hardy and Adrienne Hardy, owners of property adjoining the Judes Ferry Property, petitioned the Circuit Court for a Writ of Certiorari to review the BZA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Ten days later, the Board of Supervisors amended the zoning ordinance. Lumbering was deleted as a permitted use. Article 5.2(5) created a new permitted use in the A-l district which it described as \u201c[tjimber harvesting which may include sawmill(s) used only for cutting timber harvested on site.\u201d In addition, Article 5.3 listed \u201csawmillfs]\u201d as a conditional use in the A-l district.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Upon the BZA\u2019s return of its records in response to the writ of certiorari, Shortridge filed a petition to intervene in the case and the BZA filed a response to the Hardys\u2019 petition. A short time later, the BZA filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss for Mootness.\u201d Noting the above amendments to the uses permitted in the A-l zone, the BZA\u2019s motion asserted that there was nothing further for the court to adjudicate, that the case should be dismissed as moot because the term \u201clumbering\u201d had been eliminated from the ordinance, and that \u201cShortridge\u2019s activities now must contend with some form of non-conforming use status.\u201d The Hardys opposed the motion on the ground that Short-ridge\u2019s continued operations as a nonconforming use depended upon the correctness of the BZA\u2019s construction of the former ordinance, an issue still to be determined in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Before considering either Shortridge\u2019s motion to intervene in the case or the Hardys\u2019 motion to take additional evidence in support of their claim, the court heard argument on and sustained the BZA\u2019s motion to dismiss. The Hardys appeal the consequent dismissal of their case as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">As the Hardys note, the correctness of the BZA\u2019s construction of the former ordinance will determine the Hardys\u2019 right to complain of Shortridge\u2019s continued operations on the Judes Ferry Property. If the BZA was in error, Shortridge\u2019s activities would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>been a lawful use of the property under the former ordinance and thus could not have created a right to continue those activities as a nonconforming use under the new ordinance. \u201cA nonconforming use may not be established through a use of land which was commenced or maintained in violation of a zoning ordinance.\u201d 1 Robert Anderson, <em>Anderson\u2019s Law of Zoning </em>\u00a7 6.14, pp. 517-18 (Kenneth H. Young revisor, 4th ed. 1996) We have referred to a nonconforming use as \u201ca <em>lawful </em>use existing on the effective date of the zoning restriction and continuing since that time in non-conformance to the ordinance.\u201d <em>Knowlton </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus. of Va., Inc., 220 </em>Va. 571, 572 n. 1, 260 S.E.2d 232, 234 n. 1 (1979); <em>C. &amp; C. Inc. v. Semple, </em>207 Va. 438, 439 n. 1, 150 S.E.2d 536, 537 n. 1 (1966) (both quoting 2 Yokley, <em>Zoning Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 16-2, at 212 (3rd ed. 1965) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">On the other hand, the BZA now recognizes that if it was correct in its interpretation of \u201clumbering\u201d under the old ordinance, \u201cthe Hardys are stuck with Shortridge as a non-conforming use.\u201d Article 32.4 of the amended ordinance preserves any right Shortridge had at the time of amendment to continue his operation as a nonconforming use.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Further, the BZA suggests: (1) that \u201c[t]here is not much likelihood that the trial court will overturn the BZA, given the governing standard of review\u201d; (2) that if the trial court determines that the BZA was wrong in its interpretation, Shortridge might' ask the Board of Supervisors for a conditional use permit and his \u201cchances of prevailing there appear excellent\u201d; and (3) that even if the courts ultimately hold that Shortridge cannot conduct his activities under the amended zoning ordinance, the issue \u201cwill ultimately be resolved by a board of supervisors adoption of ordinance revisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Even if the BZA\u2019s predictions have any validity, these predictions do not determine whether this case is moot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That determination depends upon whether the circuit court was asked to decide \u201cactual controversies injuriously affecting the rights of some party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the litigation.\u201d <em>Hallmark Personnel Agency, Inc. v. Jones, </em>207 Va. 968, 971, 154 S.E.2d 5, 7 (1967). Here, as noted, both the Hardys\u2019 success in causing the termination of Shortridge\u2019s activities or Short-ridge\u2019s right to continue those activities, depend upon the correctness of the BZA\u2019s ruling. For these reasons, we conclude that the court erred in dismissing the matter as moot before taking the further action required under Code \u00a7 15.1-497 (now Code \u00a7 15.2-2314).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-14\"> Even though a part of the amendment was shown to the court at oral argument, it was not introduced or marked as an exhibit as required by Rule 5:10, and therefore, it is not a part of the record. <em>See Old Dominion Iron and Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Virginia Electric and Power Co., </em>215 Va. 658, 660, 212 S.E.2d 715, 717-18 (1975) (applying the predecessor to Rule 5:10). Nevertheless, as authorized by Code \u00a7 8.01-386, we take judicial notice of the contents of both zoning ordinances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-15\"> Two years earlier, Shortridge made the same request to the administrator. It is not material in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> Article 32.4 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIf lawful use involving ... [a] structure and premises in combination with a replacement cost of $1,000 or more, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\"> In the BZA\u2019s only supporting citation for the consideration of its predictions, the mootness issue involved <em>prospective </em>uses of land. <em>Johansen </em>v. <em>City of Bartlesville, Okl., </em>862 F.2d 1423, 1425-27 (10th Cir. 1988). Note that these were not existing, continuing, and, arguably, nonconforming uses, as in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
