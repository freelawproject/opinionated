Under \u00a7 922(t)(5),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6SX\">If the licensee knowingly transfers a firearm to such other person and knowingly fails to comply with paragraph (1) of this subsection ... and, at the time such other person most recently proposed the transfer, the national instant criminal background check system was operating and information was available to the system demonstrating that receipt of a firearm by such other person would violate subsection (g) or (n) of this section ... the Attorney General may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing ... impose on the licensee a civil fine of not more than $5,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(t)(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this appeal, we are asked to determine whether \u00a7 922(t) dictates that the licensee is prohibited from transferring a firearm if the background check produces inaccurate information and the buyer is not actually forbidden from purchasing the firearm. We must also determine the level of mental culpability required to violate the statute. We conclude that the accuracy of the information at the time of the check is irrelevant for purposes of this statute, and that the government need only prove the licensee acted knowingly. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">R.E. Bankston was the sole proprietor of Buck and Bass Sporting Goods, a licensed firearms dealer. In 2006, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) inspected the shop and discovered five violations of federal firearms laws, including the failure to conduct background checks. Bankston was notified of the violations and received a warning conference, after which he assured ATF investigators that he would follow proper procedures in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">In 2008, ATF Industry Operations Investigator James Hithcock conducted another inspection of Buck and Bass, finding four violations in which Bankston had transferred a firearm without first conducting the required background check through the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). In particular, Bankston transferred a firearm to James Brooks on August 23, 2007, but the FDLE check was not performed until September 1, 2007. When he conducted the check, Bankston learned that Brooks was not approved to purchase a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\">The ATF issued Bankston a notice of imposition of a fine in connection with the transfer to Brooks. At a subsequent hearing, Hithcock testified that Bankston admitted knowing he was required to conduct the background check before he transferred the firearm. Hithcock confirmed that the FDLE site was operational on August 23, 2007, and that FDLE had confirmed that Bankston would have received a non-approval had he conducted the check that day. Hithcock could not disclose what criminal history rendered Brooks ineligible; he could only confirm that it involved a federal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-12\">In his own testimony, Bankston admitted that he knew he was required to perform the check but stated that the failure to do so in this case was a mistake. He stated that he did not do it knowingly. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>explained that when he learned Brooks was not approved, he called Brooks and retrieved the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\">The hearing officer concluded that the government had established the elements of \u00a7 922(t)(5) and that Bankston had violated the federal firearm requirements. Thereafter, the ATF imposed the $5,000 f\u00edne. Bankston then filed this petition for review under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(f)(3), arguing that the information in the system was incorrect because Brooks was not prohibited from owning a firearm. He submitted copies of Brooks\u2019s criminal record, which showed that Brooks had been convicted in 1971 of three misdemeanor federal offenses under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the statutory language did not require the information available through the background check to be accurate and that Bankston had acted knowingly. Bankston now appeals challenging the district court\u2019s conclusions that (1) the information in the background check did not have to be accurate, and (2) the government could, and did, prove that he had acted knowingly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-7\">A. Accuracy of Information</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-8\">Bankston argues that \u00a7 922(t)(5) prohibits the sale of a firearm to a transferee only if the receipt of that firearm by the transferee would actually violate \u00a7 922(g) or (n). Thus, if the information in the background check was not accurate, the transfer would not be illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-12\">We review questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Warshauer v. Solis, </em>577 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.2009). \u201c \u2018The starting point in statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ardestani v. INS, </em>502 U.S. 129, 135, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991)). \u201cIf the \u2018language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case,\u2019 and \u2018the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,\u2019 the inquiry is over.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997)). \u201cIn determining whether a statute is plain or ambiguous, we consider \u2018the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u2019\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1393-13\">Bankston\u2019s argument focuses on the language, <em>\u201cinformation was available </em>to the system demonstrating that receipt of a firearm by such other person <em>would </em>violate subsection (g) or (n) of this section.\u201d (emphasis added). He contends that the statute must be interpreted to mean that <em>accurate </em>information was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-14\">The plain language of the statute, however, includes no such modifier. Moreover, the statute uses the term \u201cat the time,\u201d indicating that it would not be relevant if the information later turned out to be incorrect. The focus is on the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>tion available when the dealer conducts the background check. Here, had Bankston conducted the check at the time of transfer, he would have received a non-approval. The fact that Brooks could later show he was eligible to own the gun does not change the information available at the time of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">We find support for this interpretation in Congress\u2019s decision to give purchasers, but not dealers, the ability to challenge non-approval status. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 25.10. This makes sense: because a dealer is never told the reason for the non-approval, only the individual purchaser would know his criminal history and be able to challenge his status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">We therefore conclude that the information transmitted during a background check need not be accurate at the time of the check to prohibit the firearm transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-6\">B. Whether the Licensee Must Act Knowingly</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-7\">Bankston next argues that the government had to prove his culpability by showing he acted wilfully rather than knowingly. Alternatively, he contends that the government did not prove he knowingly failed to conduct the background check. He further asserts that he cannot be held vicariously liable for his employee\u2019s failure to conduct the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-8\">We disagree. First, other sections of the Gun Control Act use the term \u201cwillful\u201d or \u201cwillfully.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(d)(1)(C), (D). But Congress chose to use \u201cknowingly\u201d in \u00a7 922(t)(5). This distinction indicates that Congress did not intend the standard for \u00a7 922(t)(5) to be willfulness. <em>See Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 173, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001) (\u201cIt is well settled that where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>DIRECTV, Inc. v. Brown, </em>371 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cAs we have previously stated, when Congress uses different language in similar sections, it intends different meanings.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, we will presume that Congress said what it meant. <em>In re Hedrick, </em>524 F.3d 1175, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Kehoe v. Fid. Federal Bank &amp; Trust, </em>421 F.3d 1209, 1216 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-10\">We further conclude that there was sufficient evidence to show Bankston acted knowingly. \u201cKnowingly\u201d is defined as \u201chaving an awareness or understanding; deliberate; conscious.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>7th Ed. (1999). Here, Bankston testified that he was aware of the background check requirements, had been counseled about the requirements previously, and had educated his staff about the requirements. Although Bankston testified that he did not knowingly ignore the requirements, he admitted that he was aware that he was required to perform the checks before transferring a firearm. He also admitted that he had signed off on the transfer to Brooks even though the check had not been done. This was sufficient to establish that Bankston knowingly violated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-11\">Moreover, contrary to Bankston\u2019s arguments, Bankston was liable for the acts of his employees. \u201cPure vicarious liability, such as respondeat superior liability, attributes liability to one party based on the actions of the other party regardless of any allegation of culpability on the party held vicariously liable.\u201d <em>Laperriere v. Vesta Ins. Group, Inc., </em>526 F.3d 715, 722 (11th Cir.2008). An employee\u2019s knowledge can be imputed to the employer \u201cwhen the employee acts for the benefit of the [employer] and within the scope of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>employment.\u201d <em>Grand Union Co. v. United States, </em>696 F.2d 888, 891 (11th Cir.1983) (discussing theory of vicarious liability in False Claims Act case in which supermarket cashiers allowed customers to buy ineligible items with food stamps). Here, the employee who actually sold the gun to Brooks was working within the scope of his employment and for Bankston\u2019s benefit. Bankston was the sole proprietor of the gun shop and thus was responsible for the acts of his employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">.
