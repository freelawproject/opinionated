Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 410. of one William James Morgan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>died of a single gunshot wound of the chest in the early morning hours of July 18,1970. Following denial of a motion for a new trial and from the imposition of life imprisonment Harrison appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. That court, in an unreported per curiam opinion, <em>Harrison v. State </em>[No. 904, September Term, 1973], affirmed his conviction on September 3, 1974. We granted a writ of certiorari limited solely to the questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">(1) whether the trial judge erred in allowing the State to call appellant\u2019s former attorney as a rebuttal witness to testify as to the disclosure or non-disclosure of a vitally important, controverted issue; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">(2) whether the trial judge\u2019s admission of prejudicial, incriminating evidence against the appellant, namely by showing unrelated misconduct of appellant with drugs, denied appellant a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">We shall reverse upon both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Officer Charles Shorman, of the Baltimore City Police Department, at about 3:30 a.m. on July 18, 1970, heard a gunshot and immediately drove to the scene in front of a small store at 1326 Pennsylvania Avenue. He found the victim in a sitting position with the \u201cwhole right side\u201d of his pants and his right pants pocket \u201cripped out.\u201d The officer testified that he could not determine whether or not at that time the victim \u201chad any money on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Counsel stipulated that if Morgan\u2019s girlfriend, Mary L. Hogan, were called as a witness she would testify that on Friday, July 17th at about 8:15 p.m. she had loaned Morgan $213 which he placed in his wallet and that when she last saw him that evening, his clothing was undamaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">The autopsy performed by the Assistant Medical Examiner was admitted into evidence by stipulation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The only other witness in the State\u2019s case-in-chief was William Strait, a former resident of Baltimore, then a member of the United States Air Force, stationed in Colorado but residing in San Antonio, Texas. He testified that he, Harrison, and one Tony Wilson had left Cicero\u2019s, a club on Forrest Street, about 2:45 a.m. on that date in an automobile driven by Harrison. After leaving Tony Wilson in the 900 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, he and Harrison drove to the 1300 block of that avenue. Upon arrival Strait became engaged in conversation with a group of people on the east side of the street; Harrison remained on the west side where he was conversing with a man; Strait saw the man pressing Harrison\u2019s arms against his sides, but concluded that there was \u201cno fight.\u201d Strait\u2019s conversation was interrupted when he heard a gun discharge, saw a flash, and then \u201ceveryone started running.\u201d From across the street, he stated he saw Harrison standing about four or five feet from the victim, with his right arm outstretched, holding what \u201cseemed to be a pistol in his hand.\u201d He also testified that he had seen the appellant with a pistol stuck down in the belt of his pants earlier that evening at Cicero\u2019s.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was Strait\u2019s testimony that he saw the appellant \u201cransacking the man\u2019s pockets\u201d \u2014 on \u201cthe lower part of the man\u2019s body.\u201d Thereafter, according to Strait, Harrison ran through an open space, Strait joined him in the automobile and they drove to the 900 block of Pennsylvania Avenue where they picked up Tony Wilson. All then drove to a night club on Harford Road, with none of them discussing the incident in any fashion during the entire ride. Strait, who did not contact the police until some 10 days later, explained the delay by stating that his life had been threatened by Gary Wilson <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the life of his girlfriend had been threatened, \u2014 the person threatening her going unidentified.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Strait testified that he had known the appellant \u201cfor about two weeks\u201d being employed with him by Gary Wilson, the manager of the Black Orchid club on Gay Street. He explained that Harrison at times drove Wilson, \u201cdanced\u201d at the club and occasionally tended bar. His employment was serving customers. Upon direct examination Strait stated that Gary Wilson was \u201cpushing narcotics\u201d (marijuana); on cross-examination he acknowledged, however, that he had never seen marijuana sold at the Black Orchid but had seen him sell it at Cicero\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">This was the sum and substance of the State\u2019s case against the appellant,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at the conclusion of which the trial court denied his motion for judgment of acquittal as to murder in the second degree and as to manslaughter, but \u201creserved ruling\u201d as to murder in the first degree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The first witness for the appellant was his friend Jeffrey Taylor. He testified that he had seen Harrison in the Baltimore City Jail while there serving a sentence for disorderly conduct and that he told Harrison, when he learned the charge upon which Harrison was confined that he had been a witness to the crime, that while walking from a nearby bar, had observed the incident from a distance of about 20 feet, and had seen the assailant run across the street, carrying a gun. He told Harrison that although he did not know the identity of the murderer, he knew that it was not Harrison.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In his own defense, the appellant testified that he had worked from 8 p.m., July 17th, until 2 a.m., July 18, 1970, at the Black Orchid, when he and his employer drove \u201cto East Baltimore\u201d to pay wages to \u201ca band leader;\u201d they then drove to Cicero\u2019s, arriving about 2:45 a.m., where he saw Tony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Wilson, Gary\u2019s brother, Gary\u2019s wife, and there for the first time met Strait.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He denied that he was at or near the scene of the crime and had remained at Cicero\u2019s until approximately 6 a.m., when, going outside, he again saw Strait, whom he had not seen in the interval, and that at about 6:15 a.m., at Strait\u2019s request, he drove him to the 1300 block Pennsylvania Avenue, leaving him off near the York Lounge.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Harrison was arrested at about 8:30 a.m. on August 2, 1970 (20 days after the homicide) at the Black Orchid. At the time of his arrest, several packets of marijuana were found in one of his boots which he stated had been left overnight behind the bar. He was separately indicted for possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Following his appearance before the District Court on August 3rd, Harrison rode in the same \u201cpaddy wagon\u201d with Strait (who had been committed as a State\u2019s witness) to the City Jail, and was there with him in the \u201cbull-pen.\u201d After several attempts to relate a conversation with Strait, to which objections were sustained, he ultimately testified, following a reversal by the trial court of its ruling, when re-called as a witness, that in the jail \u201cbull-pen,\u201d Strait had told him that he was a State\u2019s witness, that he knew that Harrison had been accused of the murder but that Harrison was not the assailant; that although Strait stated he knew \u201cwho did it,\u201d he was not going to disclose that fact to anyone and that the man killed \u201ccarried large sums of money.\u201d Harrison further testified that when he asked Strait why he was a witness against him, Strait \u201cwalked away;\u201d that thereafter he never saw Strait, nor had the opportunity to further talk with him since they were not put \u201con the same section\u201d in the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor was permitted to elicit over strenuous objection, that Harrison had been in possession of marijuana at the time of his arrest at the Black Orchid. He was further asked on cross-examination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>without objection, whether or not he had ever told his former attorney (Mr. Daneman) about this conversation with Strait at the jail, to which the appellant answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Strait, re-called as a rebuttal witness, acknowledged that he had been in the City Jail \u201cbull-pen\u201d with Harrison, but denied that he was ever alone with him, denied making such a statement and denied that he had ever been questioned concerning any such incident when deposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Although both sides had rested their cases, the prosecution, following a luncheon recess <em>in camera </em>moved to reopen its case to permit as additional rebuttal evidence the testimony of Donald Daneman, Esquire, who had been Harrison\u2019s counsel in December, 1970,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but who on December 20, 1971 had stricken his appearance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judge Harris granted the State\u2019s motion to re-open and over strenuous objection by counsel for the appellant (in the chambers conference) permitted Daneman to testify that during the period of time during which he represented him Harrison had never told him of such a conversation with Strait; that if he had, he surely would have questioned Strait about it upon the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\n<em>Attorney-Client Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Following a brief cross-examination about his conversation with Strait, the trial court addressed several questions to Harrison as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, if you were in the same jail with Mr. Strait such a long time, why didn\u2019t you go back to him and talk to him about the information that he had given you that he knew the person who had committed the murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Well, over there you are put in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>a section, and he wasn\u2019t put on the same section with me. So, you just can\u2019t go from, you know, different sections to different sections, and I didn\u2019t see him any more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: You never saw him in the ninety days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Until the day of the trial in November, the 20th. I haven\u2019t seen him since.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Didn\u2019t you think it was important to try to talk while you were there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, I did, <em>but they wouldn\u2019t let vie see him. I told my lawyer all about it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, yesterday you were asked this question by Mr. Kolman, and he was speaking of Mr. Strait. You were asked, \u2018Then he had nothing against you?\u2019 Your answer was, \u2018As far as I know,\u2019 from which I could infer that in your opinion Strait \u2022 had nothing against you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Why would you say he has nothing as far as you know against you when he told you that he knew who the real murderer was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. I have no further questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-14\">(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">The assistant prosecutor then re-questioned the appellant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-16\">\u201cMR. KOLMAN: Based on the Court\u2019s questions, I have one other. <em>Did you tell your attorney, Mr. Daneman, about this case?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-18\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-19\">\u201cBY MR. KOLMAN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-20\">Q <em>About this conversation?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">Q Did you tell him prior to November, 1970?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">Q Did he ask Mr. Strait about this when the deposition was taken in November of 1970?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">A I wouldn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">Q Isn\u2019t it a fact that there is no place in the 114 pages of this deposition that that is even mentioned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">\u201cMR. KOLMAN: No questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">In overruling objection to the proffered testimony of Daneman, Judge Harris, noting the holdings in <em>Morris v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 252, 242 A. 2d 559 (1968), was of the view that although communications with counsel were privileged, the lack of communications was not and ruled that the testimony to be elicited was \u201cnot the disclosure of a communication as such [but] it\u2019s merely testimony that no such communication was ever made between the client and the attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">The Court of Special Appeals in rejecting this asserted error by the appellant, after quoting from <em>Shawmut Mining Co. v. Padgett, </em>132 Md. 397, 404, 104 A. 40, 43 (1918); <em>Morris v. State, </em>supra; Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Evidence, </em>Vol. 3 \u00a7 561, and from Annot. 51 A.L.R.2d 521, \u00a7 5 [a] (1957), in its opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-15\">\u201cIt is obvious that the alleged conversation at the jail between the appellant and Strait, <em>if communicated by the appellant to his attorney, was not communicated in confidence, but for the very purpose of making it public at the trial. </em>Even if the communication had been made and was intended to remain confidential, that confidence was <em>waived </em>when the appellant related the conversation in his testimony, and said that he had told his attorney about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u201cThere was no error in permitting Mr. Daneman to testify, in rebuttal, that no such communication had been made to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The history of the attorney-client privilege dates back in the common law to at least the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603) and probably dates from the beginning of the compulsion of witnesses to testify. Until 1776, the privilege was not deemed to be that of the client but rather of the attorney as a \u201cpoint of honor,\u201d a part of the professional accouterment of the gentlemen of the law. In that year the House of Lords in the <em>Duchess of Kingston\u2019s Trial </em>(20 Howell, State Trials 355, 586, (1776)) ruled that her attorney, whom she had exempted from secrecy, was required to respond to questions about his conversations with her some three decades earlier, even though the attorney had demurred, raising the point of honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">From that time on, the genteel point of honor theory which would henceforth subordinate the attorney\u2019s claim to an order by the court came to an end. During the latter half of the Eighteenth Century, however, another theory was evolving concerning the privilege which protected the client from disclosure of secrets entrusted to the lawyer, rather than of simply allowing the lawyer to keep the client\u2019s confidences as a professional prerogative. On the dramatic collapse of the earlier conception of \u201cpoint of honor\u201d on the part of counsel, the newer theory came to the fore and gained acceptance over the succeeding decades. <em>See Rigolfi v. Superior Court, </em>215 Cal. App. 2d 497, 500, 30 Cal. Rptr. 317, 319-20 (1963); 8 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2290-91 (McNaughton Rev. 1961); C. McCormick, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 87 (2d ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Sir William Blackstone stated the rule this way: \u201c[a]nd no counsel, attorney . . . intrusted with the secrets of the cause by the party himself, shall be compelled, or perhaps allowed, to give evidence of such conversation or matters of privacy, as come to his knowledge by virtue of such trust and confidence <em>. ...\u201d 3 W. </em>Blackstone Commentaries 370 (Amer. ed. 1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>In 1862, in <em>Fulton v. Maccracken, </em>18 Md. 528, 542-43, our predecessors stated that \u201c[n]o rule is better established than \u2018that communication which a client makes to his legal adviser for the purpose of professional advice or aid shall not be disclosed, unless by the consent of the client for whose protection the rule was established.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In <em>Lanasa v. State, </em>109 Md. 602, 71 A. 1058 (1909), this Court, in holding that statements made, by one of three persons who were indicted for conspiracy, to counsel for a co-defendant were not privileged communications and thus were admissible in evidence, stated through Judge Burke who delivered the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\u201cThe result of the authorities is that to make the communications privileged they must be made during the existence of the actual relation of attorney and client, or during interviews and negotiations looking to the establishment of such a relationship between the parties, and must relate to professional advice and to the subject-matter about which such advice is sought. When such conditions exist the law <em>will not permit the counsel to divulge the communications without the consent of the client. </em>In <em>Chase\u2019s Case, </em>1 Bland, 222, the Chancellor said: \u2018The policy of the law does not permit a solicitor to divulge the secrets of his client. Such confidential communications are <em>root to be revealed at any period of time, either before or after the suit has been brought to an end, or in any other case; </em>for, as to all such matter, <em>his mouth is shut forever.\u2019 \u201d </em>109 Md. at 617-18, 71 A. at 1064.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">In <em>Huester v. Clements, </em>252 Md. 641, 250 A. 2d 855 (1969), in sustaining the ruling of the trial court which had taken testimony out of the presence of the jury, this Court found that an attorney-client relationship existed between Huester, the attorney, and Clements, upon their first meeting, that the privilege applied to Huester\u2019s testimony, and stated: \u201c[ojnce the relationship of attorney and client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>was established, <em>a fortiori, </em>the communication was confidential and inadmissible in evidence.\u201d 252 Md. at 646, 250 A. 2d at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Alexander v. United States, </em>138 U. S. 353 (1891), in holding that statements regarding the commission of a crime made by the party to an attorney, when consulting him were privileged communications, regardless of the payment of a fee, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201cIf he consulted him in the capacity of an attorney, and the communication was in the course of his employment, and <em>may be supposed to have been drawn out in consequence of the relations of the parties </em>to each other, neither the payment of a fee nor the pendency of litigation was necessary to entitle him to the privilege. <em>Williams v. Fitch, </em>18 N. Y. 546; <em>Britton v. Lorenz, </em>45 N. Y. 51; <em>Bacon v. Frisbie, </em>80 N. Y. 394; <em>Andrews v. Simms, </em>33 Arkansas, 771.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201cIn the language of Mr. Justice Story, speaking for this court in <em>Chirac v. Reinicker, </em>11 Wheat. 280, 294: \u2018Whatever facts, therefore, are communicated by a client to a counsel solely on account of that relation, such counsel are not at liberty, even if they wish, to disclose; and <em>the law holds their testimony incompetent.\u2019 \u201d </em>138 U. S. at 358. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">The privilege is an accommodation of competing public interests, the ascendency for compelling policy reasons of the protection from unauthorized disclosure of communications between an attorney and his client over the general testimonial duty and compulsion in the interest of truth and justice. The attorney-client privilege is basic to a relation of trust and confidence that, though not given express constitutional security, is nonetheless essentially interrelated with the specific constitutional guaranties of the individual\u2019s right to counsel and immunity from self-incrimination, the oldest of the privileges for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>confidential communications, going back to the reign of Elizabeth I where it stood unquestioned \u201cas a natural exception to the then novel right of testimonial compulsion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u201cThe essential policy of the privilege is grounded in the subjective consideration of the client\u2019s freedom from apprehension in consulting his legal advisor, assured by removing the risk of disclosure by the attorney even at the hands of the law.\u201d <em>See State v. </em>Kociolek, 23 N. J. 400, 415, 129 A. 2d 417, 425 (1957), citing J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 2291 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In <em>People v. Lynch, </em>23 N.Y.2d 262, 271, 244 N.E.2d 29, 35 (1968) Judge Breitel for the New York Court of Appeals expressed the view that the freedom of confidential communication between lawyer and client is \u201c[pjerhaps as valuable as the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In <em>Morris v. State, supra, </em>the Court of Special Appeals affirmed a conviction of obtaining welfare benefits under false pretenses of one using the name of George Chesnut, while gainfully employed as George Morris. The State had offered in evidence several documents produced by an attorney who formerly represented the appellant in a civil matter which bore the signature \u201cGeorge Morris.\u201d Over objection, the attorney\u2019s receptionist, testified that the appellant was known to her both as \u201cGeorge Morris\u201d and as \u201cGeorge Chesnut\u201d and that the office files indicated that he used both names.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">In holding that \u201cthe rule making communications between attorney and client privileged from disclosure ordinarily does not apply where the inquiry is confined to the fact of the attorney\u2019s employment and the name of the person employing him, since the privilege presupposes the relationship of client and attorney and therefore it does not attach to its creation,\u201d that court pointed out that the principle of the privilege was grounded in the common law and remained unchanged even in states which had enacted statutes since such statutes have been interpreted as reflecting the common law doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u201cProfessor Wigmore phrases the principle as follows (supra, Sec. 2292):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u2018 (1) Where legal advice of kind is sought (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his insistence permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be waived.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u201cIt is apparent from the foregoing statement that what is sought primarily to be protected are the communications between the client and the attorney, the modern theory being that an individual in a free society should be encouraged to consult with his attorney whose function is to counsel and advise him and he should be free from apprehension of compelled disclosures by his legal advisor.

Sess. enacted what is now codified in Maryland Code (1974), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article as \u00a7 9-108, which succinctly states that \u201cA person may not be compelled to testify in violation of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>When the privilege is invoked the existence of the attorney-client relationship and whether or not any such communication is privileged are questions in the first instance for the trial court. In order to make such determinations that court should make a preliminary-inquiry and hear testimony relative thereto out of the presence of the jury, looking at all the surrounding facts and circumstances. The threshold question of the existence of the privilege must be determined without first requiring disclosure of the communication. <em>Steiner v. United States, </em>134 F. 2d 931, 935 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>319 U. S. 774 (1943); <em>Miller v. Anderson, </em>30 Conn. Supp. 501, 294 A. 2d 344, 347 (1972). <em>In accord Huester v. Clements, supra, </em>at 646, 250 A. 2d at 859; <em>Bieber v. State, supra, </em>at 547, 261 A. 2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In its brief and argument before us the appellee has abandoned the premise postulated by the Court of Special Appeals when it stated that if the alleged conversation between the appellant and Strait was communicated to his attorney, it \u201cwas not communicated in confidence, but for the very purpose of making it public at the trial\u201d and argues exclusively that the privilege was waived by the appellant\u2019s responses to the prosecutor on cross-examination. The appellant, recognizing that generally when a client gives testimony concerning a communication with his attorney, the privilege may be waived contends nonetheless that waiver is inapplicable where the subject matter of the communication was elicited, as it was here, upon cross-examination when the appellant, asked whether he had told his attorney \u201cabout this conversation\u201d replied merely that \u201che had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Generally, the client\u2019s offer by his own testimony as to a specific communication with his attorney constitutes a waiver as to all other communications to the attorney on the same subject matter. The attorney\u2019s testimony concerning such communications thus becomes admissible by virtue of the client\u2019s voluntary testimony in that regard. <em>See </em>8 J. Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2327; C. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 93; 3 Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Evidence, </em>\u00a7 561 (13th ed. 1973); 58 Am. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Jur. <em>Witnesses, </em>\u00a7 526 (1938); Annot. 51 A.L.R.2d 521, 529-37, \u00a7 5 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">When these authorities speak of the client voluntarily revealing at trial communications to his attorney as constituting a waiver of the privilege of confidentiality such testimony has been generally shown to have been given by the client upon direct examination. <em>See </em>Annot. 51 A.L.R.2d, <em>supra, </em>at 531-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Dean Wigmore does not seem to make any distinction in connection with a waiver of the privilege between testimony-given by the client on direct examination or that educed upon cross-examination. Professor McCormick suggests that the \u201cusual rule\u201d as to waiver should apply, upon the client\u2019s failure to claim the privilege \u201cwhen to his knowledge testimony- infringing it is offered\u201d \u2014 \u201cunless there are some circumstances which show that the client was surprised or mislead.\u201d C. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>at 195. Although he further expresses the view \u201cthat the decisions treating such testimony on cross-examination as being involuntary- and not constituting a waiver\u201d are hardly supportable, he recognizes that \u201cit is arguable that a layman might not realize, upon cross-examination, when he anticipated making such an answer, that there was any occasion to claim the privilege.\u201d C. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>at 195 n. 20. Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Evidence </em>states: \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant testifies in its own behalf does not effect a waiver of the privilege. But if, in testifying he refers to a communication with his attorney, he thereby waives the privileged character of such communication.\u201d Similarly, the text makes no distinction as to whether the testimony by the client is given upon direct or cross-examination. <em>See </em>Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Evidence, supra, </em>at 82-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Although waiver by implication is universally recognized and even though it need not be expressed in writing nor in any particular form, the intent to waive must, however, be expressed either by word or act, or omission to speak out. Once the confidential matter has been disclosed, it is no longer secret and the privilege which might be claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>disappears. <em>See Chore-Time Equip., Inc. v. Big Dutchman, Inc., </em>258 F. Supp. 233, 234 (W.D. Mich. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">This Court in <em>Shawmut Mining Co. v. Padgett, supra, </em>relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals, in finding that there had been a waiver, and in recognizing that it may be by implication, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201cThe privilege resulting from communications between attorney and client is designed to secure the client\u2019s confidence in the secrecy of his communication, but it assumes, of course, that the communications are made with the intention of confidentiality. The moment confidence ceases, privilege ceases. <em>Wigmore on Evidence, </em>sec. 2311. If Yates did not recognize Hecht as his attorney the comm\u00fcnications were not made to him as his attorney, and consequently such circumstances were without the confidentiality that is requisite, under the rule, to make it a privileged communication. It may also be said that while the privilege is for the protection of the client, <em>he may waive the privilege, and this may be done by implication, </em>for instance, he can not be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, to withhold the remainder.\u201d 132 Md. at 404, 104 A. at 43. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Since a voluntary disclosure deprives a subsequent claim of privilege based upon confidentiality, and since traditionally waiver is described as the intentional relinquishment of a known right, <em>see Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938), in determining waiver by implication \u201cregard must be had to the double elements that are predicated in every waiver, <em>i.e., </em>not only the element of implied intention, but also the element of fairness and consistency.\u201d 8 J. Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2327 at 636; <em>Rigolfi v. Superior Court, supra, </em>at 502, 30 Cal. Rptr. at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">In those cases where courts have found a waiver of the privilege based upon the disclosure of the communications with counsel upon cross-examination, the disclosures have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>generally been substantive and detailed. <em>See Steen v. First Nat\u2019l. Bank, </em>298 F. 36, 41-42 (8th Cir. 1924) (where the bank president upon cross-examination at the appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing on a criminal charge, had, without claiming privilege, testified to the statements he had made to and conversations he had had with his attorney concerning the institution of the criminal charges against the appellant); <em>Pinson v. Campbell, </em>124 Mo. App. 260, 101 S. W. 621 (1907), (where the prosecutor, on cross-examination, without objection, had testified about his employment of an attorney to assist in the prosecution of Pinson and related all the conversations he had had with the attorney in respect to the institution of the criminal prosecution). Similarly, in <em>Raleigh &amp; C. R. Co. v. Jones, </em>104 S. C. 332, 88 S. E. 896 (1916), (the appellee-client, on cross-examination had testified extensively as to the transactions and communications between him and his attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><em>See also Hurley v. McMillan, </em>268 S.W.2d 229 (Tex. Civ. App. 1954) (where the appellee as an insured, had given a written statement to an adjuster concerning the happening of an automobile accident which was at variance with his trial testimony and was extensively cross-examined about the content of the statement, and the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, noting no claim of privilege by the witness, found that such statement was not a privileged communication between an attorney and client and further pointed out that \u201c[t]he policy of the Supreme Court of Texas has been to restrict the application of the rule of privilege, because it tends to prevent the full disclosure of the truth.\u201d 268 S.W.2d at 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\"><em>See, </em>however, <em>Key v. State, </em>235 Ind. 172, 132 N.E.2d 143 (1956) where, in the appellant\u2019s trial for burglary, the only evidence to connect him with the crime was that by an accomplice who admitted on cross-examination that he had made prior statements to his attorney Hayes, that the appellant \u201chad nothing to do with the crime.\u201d When appellant\u2019s counsel attempted to question Hayes about any such prior statements made to him by the accomplice, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>trial court excluded the evidence on the ground of attorney-client privilege. That court held that the exclusion of the attorney\u2019s testimony was erroneous since his client had waived the privilege. Finding that the ruling was prejudicial to the appellant-defendant that court pointed out that his conviction \u201ccould only rest on the crucial testimony of the accomplice sought to be attacked here by the appellant. With this sole witness\u2019 credibility at stake, we cannot conclude appellant\u2019s substantial rights were not affected.\u201d 235 Ind. at 178,132 N.E.2d at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The better-reasoned cases, as we see them, clearly hold a contrary view.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In <em>People v. Kor, </em>129 Cal.App.2d 436, 277 P. 2d 94 (1954), Kor and a co-defendant, Kaufman, were charged jointly with the possession of narcotics. They were arrested in an automobile, operated by Kor, with a package of heroin in the center of the front seat. On appeal, Kor contended that the relationship of attorney and client existed between him and Joseph Rosen, an attorney, and that the trial court erred in receiving, over objection, Rosen\u2019s testimony regarding confidential communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On <em>direct </em>examination Kor had testified that he contacted Rosen, told him \u201cwhat had happened and how it happened\u201d and made arrangements with him for payment of a counsel fee; that \u201call that was discussed was getting out on a writ\u201d and the attorney did get him so released. Upon <em>cross-examination </em>by counsel for Kaufman, Kor was asked if he had told Rosen that the package [of heroin] was his (Kor\u2019s) and that Kaufman knew nothing about it. He replied that \u201cI don\u2019t think I said that.\u201d He was then asked: \u201cIs it your testimony now that you made no such statement to Mr. Rosen?\u201d Kor replied \u201cI might have said it was mine, yes.\u201d Kaufman\u2019s counsel then asked Kor \u201cWere you still taking the blame for Mr. Kaufman?,\u201d to which he answered, \u201cYes, I had already told him I would take the blame.\u201d The deputy district attorney also cross-examined Kor about the conversation with Rosen and whether he had told Rosen that the package was his.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Kaufman\u2019s attorney subpoenaed Rosen as a witness; when asked to relate the conversation with Kor, Rosen refused on the ground that the communication was confidential. Kor\u2019s counsel also objected on the ground of privilege. The trial court directed Rosen to answer the question. When Rosen demurred, the trial court indicated that his refusal to testify would subject him to a penalty for contempt. Rosen then related virtually verbatim the account Kor had given him of the facts in connection with his arrest, and that he had told him that Kaufman had picked up the package at Kor\u2019s direction and that Kaufman \u201cdid not know what was in the package.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In reversing Kor\u2019s conviction and in holding that he had been denied \u201chis fundamental right to be protected against disclosure of confidential communications between him and his attorney and prevented him from having a fair trial,\u201d the court found that the testimony given on direct examination by Kor \u201cthat he had told the attorney \u2018what had happened and how it happened\u2019 was a general statement which did not disclose or purport to disclose, what words were used by Kor in telling him of the happening or what in substance was said to him;\u201d that such statement revealed nothing that was confidential and there thus appeared \u201cno basis in the direct examination of Kor for a claim that Kor waived his rights to object to his attorney testifying as to privileged communication.\u201d In further holding that his responses on cross-examination similarly did not constitute a waiver of the privilege, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201cThe answers of Kor on such cross-examination were responsive to the questions, did not include volunteered information as to privileged communications, and were not voluntary disclosures of privileged communications. It cannot be said that Kor, by so answering such questions of Kaufman\u2019s counsel and the deputy district attorney, <em>intended thereby to consent that his attorney might be examined </em>as to communications made in confidence by Kor to his attorney. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>answers did not constitute a basis for a claim that Kor waived his right to object to his attorney testifying as to privileged communications.\u201d 129 Cal.App.2d at 445, 277 P. 2d at 100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The court also rejected the argument made by the attorney general that the invocation of the privilege was being used as a shield to conceal the truth when the person claiming the privilege is falsely accusing another of crime. The court stated: \u201cThat statement assumes that Kor was falsely accusing Kaufman, ... it assumes that Kor\u2019s testimony \u2014 to the effect that he agreed to take the blame for Kaufman \u2014 was false. That statement is also susceptible of the interpretation that communications between attorney and client should not be regarded as privileged communications if the client, as a witness, is not telling the truth and is using the privilege as a shield to conceal the truth. Under that view of the relationship between attorney and client, the fundamental doctrine of privileged communications between attorney and client might become of no importance since the truth of the client\u2019s testimony could easily be brought into question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 277 P. 2d at 100. The court also reasoned that the \u201cstatement of the attorney general assumes that the truth would be revealed by the testimony of the attorney\u201d and that even though the attorney might testify precisely as to what Kor had told him, that statement by Kor to the attorney might not be the truth as to what actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Although <em>Kor </em>was decided under a California statute which provided that \u201c[a]n attorney can not without the consent of his client be examined as to any communication made by the client to him ...\u201d a virtually identical statute was held to be declarative of the common law. <em>See State v. Sullivan, </em>60 Wash. 2d 214, 217, 373 P. 2d 474, 475 (1962); <em>see also </em>Maryland Code (1974), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 9-108; <em>Morris v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">In <em>Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Parker, </em>65 Fla. 543, 62 So. 589 (1913) the appellee alleged that he had been \u201cruptured\u201d when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>as a passenger boarding a car of the appellant, the train was negligently moved. On cross-examination he testified, without objection, that he had made a statement about the accident to an attorney with a view to retaining him, but denied that he had told the attorney that he had suffered a rupture before the accident. The attorney who had been consulted but whose retention had been cancelled, called as a witness by the appellant was asked if the plaintiff had stated to him \u201cthat he had been ruptured before the accident complained of.\u201d The attorney requested the trial court to rule whether the matter was privileged and the court so ruled. On appeal, that ruling was held not to have been erroneous since the testimony on cross-examination was \u201cnot a waiver of the privilege that existed between the plaintiff and the attorney\u201d when the communication covered by the question may have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><em>People v. Moore, </em>42 App.Div.2d 268, 346 N.Y.S.2d 363 (1973) similarly involved the question of waiver as a result of responses on cross-examination in a criminal proceeding. Moore, on trial for assault, during cross-examination was asked by the assistant district attorney whether he had not previously made a written statement concerning the facts in the case. He replied that he had, that he had read the statement (apparently given to or prepared by counsel who had been consulted in connection with a civil suit) two months after the incident and had discarded it. Although no further attempts were made to produce the statement or the attorney to whom it had been given, the prosecutor in summation to the jury made issue that the defendant had failed to produce the pre-trial written statement and that therefore \u201cwe don\u2019t know what was in that statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The New York Court, recognizing that a defendant who testifies in his own behalf waives the constitutional and statutory protection against self-incrimination, but that such testimony, \u201cdid not constitute a waiver of the rules governing the competence and admissibility of evidence, and, in particular, those dealing with privileged communications between a defendant and his lawyer;\u201d held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>that although such privilege may be waived \u201cno waiver may be implied simply from the fact that a defendant in a criminal case takes the witness stand in his own defense (8 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 2327).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 346 N.Y.S.2d at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In holding that there had been no waiver, that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">\u201cUnder such circumstances, the fact that the defendant on <em>cross-examination acknowledged the prior existence of the statement does not constitute a waiver of the privilege hy implication </em>(cf. Wigmore, Evidence, <em>op. </em>cit.; Richardson, Evidence [9th ed.], \u00a7 434; Kaufman v. Rosenshine, 97 App.Div. 514, 90 N.Y.S. 205, aff'd., 183 N.Y. 562, 76 N.E. 1098). The grave error of the prosecutor in demanding production of the statement (People v. Gibson, 218 N.Y. 70, 75, 112 N.E. 730, 732) was made more egregious by the clear and necessarily intended implication in the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during summation that the statement contained incriminating information and that it was being improperly withheld because of that fact. This error was fundamental and substantial.\u201d 42 App. Div. at 272, 346 N.Y.S.2d at 368. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-8\"><em>Kaufman v. Rosenshine, </em>97 App. Div. 514, 90 N.Y.S. 205 (1904) <em>aff'd, </em>183 N. Y. 562, 76 N. E. 1098 (1906) and cited in <em>People v. Moore, supra, </em>was an action by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to recover money alleged to have been loaned the defendants. Upon cross-examination of the assignor the defendant asked her if she had, in a prior divorce proceeding, in which she had filed an affidavit stating that she had no separate property, told her attorneys anything concerning the $2,000 being on deposit with the defendants. She answered \u201cYes; I told him of my possessions.\u201d One of the attorneys who had represented her in those proceedings was called as a witness by the defense for the purpose of contradicting that testimony. He was not permitted to so testify on the ground that the communication was privileged. That court on the authority of <em>Tate v. Tate\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Executor, </em>75 Va. 522, 533 (1881) held that the response on cross-examination did not constitute a waiver of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In <em>Tate v.

James, </em>34 S. C. 49, 12 S. E. 657 (1891) involved a prosecution for murder. Scott, an accomplice, \u201cturned State\u2019s evidence\u201d and testified against James. Upon cross-examination Scott was queried as to whether he had been visited in jail by his attorney and then asked: \u201cDid you, in jail, tell Mr. Ward that you knew nothing about the murder of old man James, that young Joe James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>never spoke to you about killing his father, and that all you had said about his hiring you to do it was false, and you said it because you were afraid, that the sheriff had threatened you, and drawn his pistol on you, or words to that effect?\u201d Scott answered \u201cNo, sir. He asked me did the sheriff draw a pistol on me, and I told him \u2018No.\u2019 He asked me did Sheriff Cole draw a pistol on me, and I told him \u2018No, sir\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The defendant called attorney Ward, who testified that he had visited Scott at the jail. When asked to state the account which Scott had given him of the killing, the state objected and Ward stated that he regarded the conversation as confidential since as counsel he thought he could use such information to Scott\u2019s benefit. Ward declined to disclose the communications unless so ordered. The trial court refused to compel Ward to disclose the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In holding that Scott, by the answers given upon cross-examination, had not waived the privilege and that the ruling of the trial court was not erroneous, the Supreme Court of South Carolina stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201c[I]f we assume that Scott had the right to waive his protection against disclosure by his attorney, did he do so? In section 500 of Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence, it is said that \u2018while the privilege may be waived by the client, <em>the evidence of the waiver must be distinct and unequivocal.\u2019 </em>There was certainly no express waiver made by Scott; on the contrary, it is urged that by going on the stand himself, when called as an ordinary witness, he thereby \u2018waived\u2019 his right of protection, not only as to himself, but also so far as his attorney was concerned. <em>We do not see how that can be considered as \u2018unequivocal\u2019 evidence of consent. </em>The fact that the client, being a party, testifies in his own behalf, is generally held not to be such a waiver of his privilege as to compel him to disclose such communications.\u201d 34 S.C. at 58, 12 S.E. at 661. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Compare <em>Key v. State, supra; see also Raleigh &amp; C. R. Co. v. Jones, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We think that the rationale for holdings that there is no waiver of the privilege, where the subject matter of the communication with the witness\u2019 attorney has been first elicited upon cross-examination, was persuasively stated in <em>Burgess v. Sims Drug Co., </em>114 Iowa 275, 86 N. W. 307 (1901). In that case the appellee was sued for the negligent compounding of a prescription. The appellant upon cross-examination was questioned, and answered without objection as to what he had told his physician concerning the cause of the injury to his eye. When the appellee called the physician as a witness the trial court excluded his testimony on the ground that such communication was privileged. An Iowa statute precluded the disclosure by any attorney or physician of \u201cany confidential communication properly entrusted to him in his professional capacity.\u201d Finding that the Code provision extended to physicians the same \u201ccomplete protection\u201d which by common law was recognized as applicable to communications between client and attorney, the court held that there had been no waiver of the privilege, nor error in excluding the physician\u2019s testimony, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that the client or patient may waive his privilege, not merely by failing to make objection to the evidence of the attorney or physician when offered, but also by conduct from which a waiver may be imputed, \u2014 such as by himself testifying as to the subject-matter of such communications. People v. Gallagher, 75 Mich. 512, 42 N.W. 1063; State v. Tall, 43 Minn. 273, 45 N.W. 449; Hunt v. Blackburn, 128 U.S. 464, 9 Sup. Ct. 125, 32 L. Ed. 488; McKinney v.

But the <em>testimony of the client or patient as to the communication which will constitute a waiver of the privilege so as to admit the attorney or physician to testify with reference thereto must be voluntarily given; for the privilege </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>is that of the client or patient, and it exists in his favor until in some way abandoned. </em>No doubt, under this privilege, the <em>client </em>or patient <em>may refuse to answer on cross-examination </em>when asked with reference to the privileged communication.

W. 783 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In an excellent review of the law of evidence concerning the attorney-client privilege and its waiver, it is noted that when a privileged communication is disclosed merely through cross-examination the majority of the courts hold that there is no waiver of the privilege nor the right to insist upon a prohibition of testimony from the attorney. <em>See </em>Note, 16 Minn. L. Rev. 818 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Indeed, there is authority that the expounding upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>cross-examination of questions which inquire into communications between the witness and the attorney constitutes prejudicial error, when properly preserved. <em>See Rienzo v. Santangeb, </em>160 Conn. 391, 279 A. 2d 565 (1971) and <em>McConnell v. City of Osage, </em>80 Iowa 293, 45 N. W. 550 (1890). In <em>Rienzo, </em>in an action for damages claimed by the plaintiff to have been sustained upon the defendant\u2019s premises as a result of its negligence, counsel for the defendant, upon cross-examination asked: \u201cDid you tell your attorney where on the premises this accident occurred?\u201d The trial court, over objection of her counsel, ordered her to respond and she answered \u201cYes.\u201d The Connecticut court finding that it was \u201cclear that by asking this question the defense counsel was trying to create the inference in the minds of the jury that the plaintiff must have related to her attorney a location where her injuries occurred other than that to which she had testified,\u201d pointed out that the privilege, \u201cbeing for the protection of the client in his subjective freedom of consultation obviously would be defeated if the disclosure of the confidences, though not compellable from the attorney, was still obtainable from the client,\u201d and concluded that the purpose and effect of the question was to reveal a direct communication from client to attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">That court held that \u201cunder the circumstances of this case we consider no essential distinction between the question, \u2018What did you tell your attorney?\u2019 and the question in issue. The attorney-client privilege is not to be vitiated by a distinction in semantics. The resort to the question in issue went beyond the scope of proper cross-examination and was an improper invasion of privilege. It was clearly prejudicial and harmful.\u201d 160 Conn. at 396, 279 A. 2d at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In <em>McConnell, </em>the appellant had brought suit for damages for a fall on a defective sidewalk. In her direct testimony she set forth what her physical condition had been for several years preceding her injury \u2014 purportedly in contrast to her ailments and disabilities subsequent to the incident. Upon cross-examination she was asked: \u201cAre you willing that the physicians who have treated you for the past ten or fifteen years may disclose to this jury any conversation you made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>them, at times they treated you in reference to your condition?\u201d Upon objection being overruled, she answered that \u201cshe was not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The Iowa court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\u201cIt [the privilege] is a legal right, and a party should no more be required to state under oath that he did not want to surrender it than any other legal right he possessed. <em>We think a fair trial requires that such a matter should not even he referred to; that a jury should not he impressed with a belief that there is even reluctance to giving such assent. The subject-matter of such a waiver has no place for reference in the taking of testimony except by the party permitted to make it. </em>That prejudice resulted from the ruling in question is more than probable. After making oath that she would not consent to the testimony, the jury was left to assume something, \u2014 we know not what. It would naturally believe that, if assent had been given, testimony unfavorable to the plaintiff would have been the result. However, we need not speculate as to the probable consequences. It was clearly error.\u201d 80 Iowa at 303, 45 N.W. at 553.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Since counsel for Harrison did not object to the question propounded by the assistant prosecutor as to whether he had told his (former) attorney \u201cabout this conversation,\u201d and did not thus preserve the point for review, the holdings in <em>Rienzo </em>and in <em>McConnell </em>are inapposite. But, as pointed out in <em>Burgess, </em>\u201cit is evident that any objection of the witness on cross-examination to testify to the communication might well [itself] have been prejudicial\u201d since such objection, were it sustained, would obviously convey to the jury the idea that a different version had been communicated to the attorney. <em>See also McConnell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">As we see it, we do not think that the appellant\u2019s reply to the trial court when he stated \u201cI told my lawyer all about it\u201d in response to the court\u2019s question concerning any attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>to further converse with Strait, can be considered as constituting a waiver of the privilege. It was a general statement which did not disclose, or purport to disclose what words were used \u2014 or what the conversation was \u2014 nothing which was confidential was thereby revealed. <em>People v. Kor, supra. </em>Additionally, the answer \u201call about it\u201d was itself ambiguous. Although it could be strained to be construed as meaning that he had told his lawyer what Strait had told him in the jail and that he had tried to further converse with him but had been unable to do so, it could with equal force be construed as being limited to the fact that because Strait was in one section of the jail and he was in another he had told his lawyer that he had been unable to later come in contact with Strait.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Procedurally, we think Judge Harris erred in not conducting a preliminary inquiry out of the presence of the jury and hearing testimony of all the surrounding facts and circumstances to determine initially whether a confidential relationship existed between Harrison and Daneman, and if so, whether or not there had been a waiver of the privilege. It appears that the trial court required a disclosure of the communication without first determining the existence of the privilege. <em>Steiner v. United States, Miller v. Anderson, Huester v. Clements, Bieber v. State, </em>all <em>supra. </em>Although the trial court made its rulings upon a proffer in chambers by the assistant prosecutor, no inquiry was made at all as to whether Daneman intended to invoke confidentiality. <em>See </em>Canon 4, (A <em>Lawyer Should Preserve the Confidences and Secrets of a Client) </em>EC 4-1, 4-4-6, and Disciplinary Rules DR 4-101 (B) (1) (Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.), Maryland Rules, App. F, Code of Professional Resp., at 1019-20). Daneman not expressing any of the concern evidenced by attorney Rosen in <em>People v. Kor, supra, </em>neither asserted the privilege nor asked the court for guidance, <em>see State v. James, supra, </em>but apparently without any direction by the court disclosed the confidences of his erstwhile client to the prosecutor over the luncheon recess, and Daneman\u2019s disclosure became the predicate upon which the case was permitted to be re-opened and his impeaching testimony presented before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>We can find no basis in law in the ruling by the trial court when a distinction was drawn between \u201cthe disclosure of [the contents] of a communication\u201d as distinguished from the fact that \u201cno such communication was ever made between the client and the attorney.\u201d <em>See Rienzo v. Santangelo, supra. </em>The subject matter of the prosecutor\u2019s question went to a \u201cconversation\u201d between the appellant and his attorney, the subject-matter of the inquiry was directed to the dialogue between Harrison and the counsel then representing him and the discussions between them. The holding in <em>Morris v. State, supra, </em>noted by the trial court, as we read it, does not support such a distinction concerning what is within or without a \u201cconversation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Nowhere in Harrison\u2019s direct examination had any reference been made to any conversations with either his trial attorney or his former counsel. Nowhere did he undertake to relate in substance by words what he had factually disclosed to Daneman. Even accepting Professor McCormick\u2019s view it is not difficult, upon the facts here, to conclude that the appellant as \u201ca layman might not realize, upon cross-examination, when he anticipated making such an answer that there was any occasion to claim the \u25a0privilege.\u201d It is equally not difficult to conclude that there were then present \u201ccircumstances which show that the client [Harrison] was surprised or mislead\u201d by the question posed upon cross-examination \u2014 did you tell your attorney \u201cabout this conversation.\u201d It can certainly not be said that this response, in the context in which it was made, was voluntary and established \u201cdistinct and unequivocal\u201d evidence of an intention on his part to waive his privilege. In our view, considering the policy of this Court\u2019s steadfast recognition and protection of the confidentiality arising from the attorney-client relationship, it would be grossly unjust to conclude that Harrison, by this simple, nonsubstantive affirmative answer intended implicitly to surrender and waive the privilege of his communications with his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Upon the holdings of what we consider to be the better-reasoned cases, as we have set them forth, we cannot conclude, as did the Court of Special Appeals, that when, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>upon cross-examination, the appellant replied that he had told Mr. Daneman \u201cabout this conversation [with Strait]\u201d he waived the privilege personal to him, arising from his relationship. We hold that it was prejudicial error, over his counsel\u2019s vigorous objection, to have permitted Daneman to impeach that response by his testimony that no such conversation had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\n<em>Possession of Marijuana</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The Court of Special Appeals in rejecting the appellant\u2019s contention that he had been the victim of prejudicial error in the admissibility of evidence concerning his possession of marijuana, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">\u201cEvidence by which the State sought to show activities of Gary Wilson in addition to operating the Black Orchid nightclub, and, <em>at least by inference, activities of appellant as Wilson\u2019s employee, were directed at showing motive for the crime for which appellant was on trial. </em>Evidence that Wilson was a marihuana dealer led also to cross examination of appellant on that point, and brought out that when appellant was arrested on 2 August 1970 the police found several packets of marihuana in one of his boots. The trial judge limited this phase of appellant\u2019s cross examination to questions designed to bring out appellant\u2019s relationship to his employer\u2019s activities as a marihuana dealer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">After quoting from <em>Lowery v. State, </em>202 Md. 314, at 318, 96 A. 2d 20 at 22 (1953), the Court of Special Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">\u201cIn its quest for evidence of a motive the State produced very little of any substantial weight, but <em>failure to succeed does not affect the relevancy of the attempt. </em>We think the evidence <em>was relevant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>to motive or intent, </em>and <em>was admissible for that purpose. </em>It did not become inadmissible because it may have involved overtones of character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">As best we can surmise, it was apparently the thesis of the State that Morgan\u2019s murder was in some way related to a marijuana transaction. After Strait related facts from which it could be easily found that Morgan had been robbed, he testified upon the State\u2019s question that Gary Wilson \u201cwas pushing narcotics (marijuana),\u201d although he conceded that his information about such \u201canother business interest\u201d was from seeing such a transaction at Cicero\u2019s, he had never seen marijuana sold at the Black Orchid, where appellant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">At the very inception of the appellant\u2019s cross-examination, the prosecutor posed the question: \u201cAs you testified earlier, Mr. Wilson was also a dealer in narcotics, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d (No such testimony had been given by Harrison; it had been given by Strait.) The question rephrased to ask whether or not Wilson was a \u201cdealer in narcotics,\u201d brought the response that \u201cI really didn\u2019t know.\u201d Harrison was then asked whether at times he \u201cuse[d] or possessed] marijuana.\u201d Upon objection by his counsel the trial court at a \u201cbench conference,\u201d although directing the state\u2019s attorney not to elicit the fact that appellant was under indictment for the possession of marijuana, ruled that any question about such drugs would have to be \u201crelate [d] to his relationship with Wilson, and not a general question.\u201d The prosecutor represented that he would link the appellant with Wilson by evidence placing the appellant \u201cin the Black Orchid on August 2nd and proving that he had marijuana on him at that time.\u201d Although counsel persisted in arguing that evidence of such possession \u2014 20 days after the commission of the homicide \u2014 would not establish \u201cany relationship\u201d between Wilson and Harrison concerning the sale of marijuana, the trial court ruled that the prosecutor could \u201cask about anything that will bear upon his relationship with Mr. Wilson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>After the appellant denied that he had ever seen any sale of marijuana in the Black Orchid, he was asked \u201cas far as you know, there was never any marijuana in that club while you were working there?\u201d and the appellant responded \u201cNot until the night I got picked up.\u201d He was then asked: \u201cOn the night that you got picked up, who had marijuana in that club?\u201d When counsel\u2019s objection was overruled, the witness responded \u201cI did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Evidence of another crime which the accused has committed is inadmissible in a criminal trial where such other crime is unrelated to the crime charged. <em>Presley v. State, </em>224 Md. 550, 558, 168 A. 2d 510, 514 (1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U. S. 957 (1962), citing <em>Bryant v. State, </em>207 Md. 565, 115 A. 2d 502 (1955). <em>See also Dobbs v. State, </em>148 Md. 34, 46, 129 A. 275, 280 (1925). Such evidence is irrelevant where it has no tendency to prove some material fact in connection with the crime charged; it is admissible if evidence of another crime tends directly to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt of the crime charged. <em>Wood v. State, </em>191 Md. 658, 664, 62 A. 2d 576, 578-79 (1948). Where the other crime is so linked in point of time or circumstances as to show intent or motive, the exclusion rule does not apply. <em>Presley v. State, supra; see also Westcoat v. State, </em>231 Md. 364, 368, 190 A. 2d 544, 545-46 (1963). In <em>Bryant v. State, supra, </em>it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">\u201cIf evidence of another crime tends directly to prove the defendant guilty of the crime for which he is being tried, or if the other crime charged is so linked together in point of time or circumstances that one cannot be fully shown without proving the other, regardless of whether the crime incidentally shown is of the same or a different character from the one on trial, the general rule of exclusion does not apply. Where intent is material, the conduct of the accused is relevant to show that intent. Hence, evidence of collateral offenses is admissible, on the trial of the main charge, to prove the intent. To be admissible as relevent, such offenses need not be exactly concurrent. If they are committed within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>such time, <em>or show such relation to the main charge, as to make connection obvious, such offenses are admissible to show intent.

State, </em>182 Md. 653, 656, 35 A. 2d 916, 918 (1944); <em>see also Ward v. State, </em>219 Md. 559, 562, 150 A. 2d 257, 258 (1959). <em>In accord, </em>2 J.

State, </em>148 Md. 34,129 A. 275.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">\u201cBut the rule is equally established that where the testimony shows motive or intent it is entitled to be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Upon our review of the record there is no evidence of any kind to establish that there had been any sale or distribution of narcotics or marijuana from Gary Wilson, or from the appellant, to the victim, Morg\u00e1n. There is no evidence that at the time of his killing, Morgan was carrying any packets of marijuana or other narcotics which may have been taken in his robbery. Nor is there any evidence that the $213 given him by his girlfriend on the preceding evening was in any way to be used as a \u201cbankroll\u201d for the purchase of marijuana. Nor is there any evidence that the appellant was either a \u201chit\u201d man or an \u201cenforcer\u201d for Gary Wilson. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>record is totally devoid of any evidence which in any way relates the packets of marijuana found in the appellant\u2019s boot \u2014 20 days after the homicide \u2014 \u201cto show any connection\u201d with the decedent Morgan. If such evidence even remotely showed a \u201crelationship\u201d to Gary Wilson, there was utterly no nexus of that fact with the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Since evidence of acts, transactions or occurrences as to other matters with which an accused is not shown to have any connection are inadmissible, unless so inter-woven with other relevant evidence as to render the trial of his case impossible without the admission of that evidence; <em>see Perrera v. State, </em>184 Md. 51, 56-57, 40 A. 2d 53, 55 (1944), the admission of evidence that Gary Wilson had dealt in marijuana was \u2014 without any evidence of connection \u2014 itself irrelevant, and the fact that Harrison possessed it on August 2, 1970 even more irrelevant in his trial for the murder of Morgan. It certainly failed to show any motive or intent for the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In <em>Dobbs v. State, supra, </em>at 48-50, 129 A. 281-82 (1925), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">\u201c[W]hen the errors are of such a character, and so interwoven with the case, as to lead a fair and impartial mind, trained and experienced in judicial investigation, upon an examination of the whole case and all the rulings involved therein, to the conclusion that <em>there is a reasonable probability that such errors may have affected the determination of the case, they are prejudicial and reversible.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\u201cThe defendants were indicted for a murder, and while they were required to meet that charge, they were not required without warning or notice to be prepared to defend themselves against charges relating to alleged offenses <em>wholly independent of and in no wise connected with that crime, </em>for even if they were gangsters, thieves, or homeless vagabonds, that did not tend to prove that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>committed the specific crime for which they were indicted, and the evidence in the case should have been confined to the only issue before the court, which was whether they had in fact committed that crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><em>See also Kotteakos v.

After Harrison\u2019s earlier statement that he told his lawyer \u201call about it,\u201d referring to his conversation with Strait, the record reflects the following on cross-examination by the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">\u201cMR.

What he did was to testify in his defense to a statement by a key State\u2019s witness to him inconsistent with the testimony of that witness and thus damaging to the State\u2019s case. When asked, he stated, without objection from his trial attorney, that he had advised his earlier attorney of this conversation. Then he objected when the earlier attorney was called for the purpose of impeaching this statement by denying that the defendant had ever advised him of such a conversation. Public policy can be read behind the statement of Judge Pattison for this Court in <em>Shawmut Mining Co. v. Padgett, </em>132 Md. 397, 404, 104 A. 40 (1918), that a witness \u201ccan not be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases [of a communication to an attorney], to withhold the remainder.\u201d <em>Shawmut </em>was relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">The attorney-client privilege is intended to be a shield, not a sword. The opinion of the majority in this case turns it into a sword. Reason, the authorities, and what I regard as the better reasoned cases support my view here. The fact that Harrison testified on cross-examination does not make his testimony any less a waiver of the attorney-client privilege in the view of eminent authority. In 8 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 2327 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961) the author rejected intention as the sole criterion for waiver of the privilege. He pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\">\u201cIn deciding [what constitutes a waiver by implication], regard must be had to the double elements that are predicated in every waiver, i.e., not only the element of implied intention, but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the element of fairness and consistency. <em>A privileged person would seldom be found to waive, if his intention not to abandon could alone control the situation. </em>There is always also the objective consideration that when his conduct touches a certain point of disclosure, fairness requires that his privilege shall cease whether he intended that result or not. He cannot be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, to withhold the remainder. He may elect to withhold or to disclose, but after a certain point his election must remain final.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635-36. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Wigmore, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 2327, n. 3 at 637 rejects the position of the court in <em>Foley v. Poschke, </em>66 Ohio App. 227, 32 N.E.2d 858 (1940), that testimony on cross-examination cannot be considered voluntary for the purposes of a statute requiring \u201cvoluntary testimony\u201d for waiver of the attorney-client privilege, stating, \u201cthis ruling seems incorrect since the client could have refused to testify on cross-examination by invoking the privilege.\u201d In McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 93 (2d ed. Cleary 1972) that author also rejects the notion that failure to assert the privilege on cross-examination makes the disclosure involuntary, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">\u201cWaiver includes, as Wigmore points out, not merely words or conduct expressing an intention to relinquish a known right, but conduct, such as a partial disclosure, which would make it unfair for the client to insist on the privilege thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">\u201cOf course, if the holder of the privilege fails to claim his privilege by objecting to disclosure by himself or another witness when he has an opportunity to do so, he waives his privilege as to the communications so disclosed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">\u201cWhat if the client is asked on cross-examination about the communications with his lawyer, and he responds without asserting his claim of privilege? Is this a waiver? Unless there are some circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>which show that the client was surprised or misled, it seems that the usual rule that the client\u2019s failure to claim the privilege when to his knowledge testimony infringing it is offered, would apply here, and that <em>the decisions treating such testimony on cross-examination as being involuntary and not constituting a waiver are hardly supportable. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Support for the view I take here is also found in 3 Jones, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 21:22 at 804 (6th ed. S. A. Gard 1972); H. Underhill, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 333 at 840 (5th ed. 1956); and 2 Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 561 at 83 (13th ed. C. Torcia 1972). (These references do not deal specifically with cross-examination.) Wigmore, McCormick, and Wharton were cited by the Court of Special Appeals in support of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">I think a correct statement of the law is found in <em>Steen v. First Nat. Bank, </em>298 F. 36 (8th Cir. 1924), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">\u201cThe owner of the privilege of preventing the disclosure of confidential communications cannot, after testifying to or about them, or to or about any substantial part of them, without claiming his privilege, or objecting to testify on the ground of his privilege, invoke that privilege to prevent other parties to the communications from testifying to them. He cannot by his silence lay down the shield of his privilege, and assail another with the sword of his own testimony to the privileged communications, and, when his adversary essays to defend himself, or to attack him by his version of the testimony, or by the testimony of other parties or witnesses to such communications, again seize the shield of his privilege and shut out all testimony as to the confidential communications but his own. He has waived his privilege and \u2018such waiver is in no sense contrary to public policy; indeed, it is in the interest of truth and justice.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Kelly v.

It is neither proved nor claimed that he, the bank, or the state objected to his testifying at the preliminary examination on his cross-examination upon the ground that the subject of his testimony was privileged, or on the ground that the subject of it was not germane to his testimony upon his direct examination and legitimate cross-examination thereon. The legal presumption is that the cross-examination was legitimate, germane to and warranted by the direct examination of Mr. Boyd. That is the legal presumption, and there was no offer or claim to the contrary at the trial. In this state of the case, although we are aware that there is authority to the effect that such a waiver may not arise to matters disclosed upon cross-examination on the ground that such disclosure is not a voluntary one (Burgess v. Sims Drug Co., 114 Iowa 275, 280, 86 N.W. 307, 54 L. R. A. 364, 84 Am. St. Rep. 359), we are unable to resist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the conclusion that the stronger reasons and the more persuasive authorities sustain the rule that the waiver extends to every disclosure of the privileged communications made in a legitimate cross-examination upon the subject-matter of the testimony given upon the direct examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41-42.'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">After citing 28 Ruling Case Law, <em>Witnesses </em>\u00a7 30 at 443 (1921), concluding with the statement, \u201cEven a party to the action who voluntarily becomes a witness on his own behalf, and thus waives his privilege, cannot, on cross-examination, refuse to answer in reference to any matter testified to by him in his testimony in chief, on the ground that his answer would criminate him,\u201d the court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201cMuch less can a witness do so on the ground that his testimony on his legitimate cross-examination tends to disclose a privileged confidential communication against the disclosure of which he did not assert his privilege before or when he testified regarding the transaction upon either direct or cross examination.

Of course, if Atwater\u2019s testimony is to be considered, at least insofar as the communications as to the motivation for settlement are concerned between Beach and Brown, at Brown\u2019s office, these normally confidential communications between attorney and client are immediately divested of their privilege if Atwater, as the agent of Beach, testifies in open court as to them. This act as Beach\u2019s agent is that of Beach, and <em>Beach, by testifying and telling the public of these confidential communications, has turned what was once a confidence into public property. </em>He cannot open the door to part of the facts and close it as to the remainder. 8 Wigmore, (3rd Ed.)

Chamberlain testified on cross-examination that he told his attorney, Bailey, of a conversation with the president of the bank, which conversation was the basis of the agreement then before the court. The attorney was called as a witness on behalf of the defendants and asked by counsel for the bank, as one of the defendants, whether Chamberlain had told him that he had entered into an agreement with the bank president as outlined. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u201cThis question was excluded, and the bank made the offer of proof, namely, that the witness if required to answer would testify that Chamberlain never did tell him the things contained in the defendant\u2019s question, that is, that his answer would be \u2018No.\u2019 It is said in <em>Woburn v. Henshaw, </em>101 Mass. 193, at page 200: \u2018The policy of the law will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>allow the counsel himself to make disclosures of confidential communications from his client; but if the client sees fit to be a witness, he makes himself liable to full cross-examination like any other witness\u2019; and it was said in <em>Gossman v.

Evidence that Wilson was a marihuana dealer led also to cross examination of appellant on that point, and brought out that when appellant was arrested on 2 August 1970 the police found several packets of marihuana in one of his boots. The trial judge limited this phase of appellant\u2019s cross examination to questions designed to bring out appellant\u2019s relationship to his employer\u2019s activities as a marihuana dealer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201cAppellant argues that all of this evidence was an attack on his character, and thus on his credibility, by showing other unrelated criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">\u201cWe held in <em>Neam v.

App. 504 (1973) .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-12\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals, through Chief Judge Sobeloff, said in <em>Lowery v.

State, </em>148 Md. 34,129 A. 275.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u2018But the rule is equally established that where the testimony shows motive or intent it is entitled to be admitted.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cIn its quest for evidence of a motive the State produced very little of any substantial weight, but failure to succeed does not affect the relevancy of the attempt. We think the evidence was relevant to motive or intent, and was admissible for that purpose. It did not become inadmissible because it may have involved overtones of character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s attempt to show a motive for the killing was probative, just as was the case in <em>Lowery, </em>cited by the Court of Special Appeals. The weight of the evidence should be left to the jury. The prosecutor\u2019s theory was neither outrageous nor ridiculous. It was his theory that Harrison was an \u201cenforcer\u201d in Gary Wilson\u2019s drug trafficking operation and that he was in the process of collecting money due from the victim when the murder occurred. This would explain why the victim was holding Harrison\u2019s arms and why the right side of the pants of the victim, including the pocket, had been ripped out.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">I think in both instances the Court of Special Appeals correctly stated the law and correctly applied it to the facts of this case. Chief Judge Murphy authorizes me to say that he joins in the views here expressed as to the first point only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
