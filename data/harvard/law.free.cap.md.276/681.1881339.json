Supp.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7\u00a7 12-601\u201412-609 (the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act), the United States District Court for the District of Columbia has certified to us two questions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-13\">(i) What items in the record [of this case] constitute the \u201cwritten instrument in which the contract is set forth\u201d for purposes of Code [(1957, 1972 Repl. Vol.) Art. 48A, \u00a7 364]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-15\">(ii) What was the \u201cdate of issue\u201d of the involved policy <em>(i.e., </em>the \u201cwritten instrument in which the contract of insurance is set forth\u201d) for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>purposes of Code [(1957, 1972 Repl. Yol.) Art. 48A, \u00a7 390]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The relevant facts as stated in the order for certification are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The deceased, Per-Olof Holtze, while a resident of Maryland, made application to Equitable [Life Assurance Society of the United States (Equitable)] for a term life insurance policy in the amount of $100,000.00. Part I of the application was dated October 10, 1969, and Part II of the application was dated October 20,1969. Upon receipt of a first premium which was paid on October 24, 1969, a conditional receipt bearing that date was given to the deceased. The conditional receipt provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">\u201cIf a satisfactory Part II of the application is furnished to the Society and if the Society shall be satisfied after such investigation and such medical examinations as it may require that the Proposed Insured is on this date insurable and qualified under the Society\u2019s rules and standards for insurance in the amount and on the plan applied for and at the premium specified herein, the insurance applied for shall take effect and be in force subject to the provisions of the policy applied for from the date of this receipt. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The conditional receipt which was attached to the application, Part I provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">\u201cThis receipt must not be detached unless application is signed and first premium collected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">The conditional receipt was detached prior to the issuance of the formal policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">On November 28, 1969, Equitable issued a $100,000.00 term life insurance policy to Mr. Holtze on his life (Policy No. 69,401,197). In issuing this policy, Equitable relied upon the representations made by Mr. Holtze regarding his medical history which were contained in Part II of his written application for insurance dated October 20, 1969. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The annual premiums on this policy were due and payable on November 28,1970 and every 12 months thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">This policy, formally issued on November 28, 1969, contained a standard incontestability clause which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">\u201cINCONTESTABILITY. Except as to any disability or accidental death benefit provisions, this policy will be incontestable, except for non-payment of premiums, after it has been in force during the lifetime of the Insured for two years from the Date of Issue shown on page three.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Page three states: \u201cDATE OF ISSUE Nov. 28,1969.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Mr. Holtze died on November 19,1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">From the foregoing, it can be seen that whether the Equitable can resist the claim of Lillie Holtze, widow of Per-Olof Holtze and the beneficiary named in the policy, on the ground that the deceased insured made material misrepresentations as regards his medical history in his application for insurance turns on the question whether the date of issue for purposes of the two-year incontestability clause is November 28, 1969 (the date specified in the incontestability clause) or October 24, 1969 (the date of the conditional receipt and first payment of premium).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Article 48A, our Insurance Code, was substantially revised by Chapter 553, \u00a7 1 of the Laws of 1963. So far as we are aware, neither \u00a7 364:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-10\">\u201c \u2018Policy\u2019 means the written instrument in which the contract of insurance is set forth, and includes all clauses, riders, endorsements and papers attached thereto or made a part thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">nor \u00a7 390:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-12\">\u201cThere shall be a provision that the policy (exclusive of provisions relating to disability benefits or to additional benefits in the event of death by accident or accidental means) shall be incontestable, except for non-payment of premiums, after it has been in force during the life<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>time of the insured for a period of two (2) years from its date of issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">both of which are referred to in the order for certification, has previously been considered by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We have no hesitancy in concluding that the conditional receipt given to Mr. Holtze on October 24, 1969, together with Parts I and II of his application for insurance dated October 10 and October 20, respectively, came within the ambit of \u201cclauses, riders, endorsements and papers attached thereto [the contract of insurance] or made a part thereof\u2019 as set forth in \u00a7 364.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Simpson v. Prudential Insurance Co., </em>227 Md. 393,177 A. 2d 417 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Turning now to the provision of the conditional receipt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">\u201cIf a satisfactory Part II of the application is furnished to the Society and if the Society shall be satisfied after such investigation and such medical examinations as it may require that the Proposed Insured is on this date insurable and qualified under the Society\u2019s rules and standards for insurance in the amount and on the plan applied for and at the premium specified herein, the <em>insurance applied for shall take effect and be in force subject to the provisions of the policy applied for from the date of this receipt. . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">It is clear to us that the language of the conditional receipt is intentionally framed to provide coverage for the insured <em>from the date of the receipt </em>in the event of the acceptance of his application. When this is equated with the language of the incontestability clause,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">\u201cINCONTESTABILITY. Except as to any disability or accidental death benefit provisions, this policy will be incontestable, except for non-payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>premiums, after it has been in force during the lifetime of the Insured for two years from the Date of Issue shown on page three.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">the ambiguity is readily apparent: does the period of incontestability commence two years from the date of issue of a policy not then in existence, or two years from the date of the conditional receipt, when the policy \u201cshall take effect\u201d? The general rule is stated in 18 G. Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law \u00a7 72.33, at 62 (2d ed. 1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">\u201cWhere there is an ambiguity in an incontestable clause in an insurance policy, such ambiguity will be resolved in favor of the insured, as where the application provided that the insurance was to be effective as of a certain date but the policy was dated some months thereafter, the contestable period would start to run from the earlier date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">While this Court does not appear to have considered the effect of the issuance of a conditional receipt upon an incontestability clause, at least a portent can be discerned in <em>Simpson v. Prudential Insurance Co., supra, </em>227 Md. 393, 177 A. 2d 417. There, the insured, who had been issued a conditional receipt when he paid the initial premium on a basic life policy for $3,000.00, with additional, but diminishing term insurance in an amount of $10,000.00, was killed in an accident about two weeks after the issuance of the conditional receipt but before the delivery of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">After a careful consideration of the effect of so-called \u201cconditional\u201d or \u201cbinding\u201d receipts issued upon payment of the first premium on policies of life insurance, this Court, speaking through Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, concluded that a contract of insurance had been formed when the premium was paid and the receipt issued. Because the insured died before the policy was issued, the Court concluded that the insurer would be liable if the insured met an objective standard of insurability. <em>See </em>Annot., 2 A.L.R.2d 943, 986-87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>(1948); 1 J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 312, at 544-47 (1965 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Concededly, the cases elsewhere are in conflict, <em>see </em>Annot., 37 A.L.R.3d 933 (1971). Mrs. Holtze relies on <em>American National Insurance Co. v. Motta, </em>404 F. 2d 167 (5th Cir. 1968); <em>Schwartz v. Northern Life Insurance Co., </em>25 F. 2d 555 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>278 U. S. 628 (1928), and <em>Cotton States Life Insurance Co. v. Knowles, </em>45 Ala. App. 607, 234 So. 2d 886 (1970), all of which hold that the effectiveness of a suicide clause is calculated from the date of the conditional receipt,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on <em>Gaunt v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>160 F. 2d 599 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>331 U S. 849 (1947), where the insurer contended that one of the purposes of the earlier effective date was to make the policy incontestable sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Equitable, on the other hand, would have us adopt the rule exemplified by <em>Byram v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of United States, </em>180 F. Supp. 620 (W. D. La. 1959), <em>aff'd, </em>274 F. 2d 822 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>363 U. S. 830 (1960); <em>Crowley v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>196 F. 2d 315 (5th Cir. 1952) and <em>Davis v. Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>107 F. 2d 150 (4th Cir. 1939), which stand for the proposition that the two-year period of contestability begins to run at the date of issue and not at an earlier date when coverage commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We regard the cases relied on by Mrs. Holtze as the better reasoned and as more consonant with our holding in <em>Simpson v. Prudential Life Insurance Co., supra, </em>227 Md. 393, 177 A. 2d 417. Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol.) Art. 48A, \u00a7 390 requires any life insurance policy issued in Maryland to be incontestable \u201cafter it has been in force . . . for a period of two (2) years from its date of issue,\u201d and <em>Simpson </em>determined that a policy issued pursuant to a conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>receipt provides insurance from the date of the conditional receipt. We are of the opinion, also, that the statutory phrase \u201cafter it has been in force . . . for a period of two (2) years from its date of issue,\u201d read in light of <em>Simpson, </em>must mean that the period of contestability dates from the date of the conditional receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">In <em>Gaunt v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., supra, </em>160 F. 2d at 602, Judge Learned Hand observed for the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">. . [T]he ordinary applicant who has paid his first premium and has successfully passed his physical examination, would not by the remotest chance understand the clause as leaving him uncovered until the insurer at his leisure approved the risk; he would assume that he was getting immediate coverage for his money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In <em>Gaunt, </em>where the question was whether the insurance became effective upon completion of the application or upon issuance of the policy, the insurer, in support of its contention that coverage commenced only upon issuance of the policy, argued that among the benefits, in lieu of immediate coverage, conferred by the language on the application was that <em>the policy would sooner become incontestable. </em>It is generally assumed that the true function of a conditional receipt is to prevent a change of mind on the part of the applicant for insurance, <em>see </em>Comment, <em>Operation of Binding Receipts in Life Insurance, </em>44 Yale L. J. 1223 (1935) and Comment, <em>Life Insurance Receipts: The Mystery of the Non-Binding Binder, </em>63 Yale L. J. 523,534 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">In sum, although we are aware of the rationale of the cases on which Equitable relies, that while risk may attach upon issuance of the conditional receipt, the incontestability and suicide clauses commence to run only from the date of the issuance of the policy, we conclude, as did Judge Hand, that if this is what insurers intend, they should say so in the conditional receipt in language which can be understood by their insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">On the facts before us, we hold that (1) the conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>receipt, together with Parts I and II of the application, are part of the \u201cwritten instrument in which the contract is set forth,\u201d (2) \u201cthe date of issue\u201d of \u201cthe written instrument in which the contract of insurance is set forth\u201d was October 24, 1969, and that the two-year period of contestability commenced to run on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">\n<em>Questions of law answered as herein set forth; costs to abide the result.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-10\">. We are unpersuaded by Equitable\u2019s argument that the conditional receipt, because it was detached from the application, cannot be considered a part of the policy. \u00a7 364 states that \u201cpapers,\u201d in order to comprise part of the policy must be either \u201cattached thereto <em>or </em>made a part thereof.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\">. The date shown on page three was \u201cNov. 28,1969.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\">. We note that the phrase \u201cwithin two years from the Date of Issue\u201d appears in both the suicide and incontestability clauses of Holtze\u2019s policy. Thus, there is no discernible distinction between the effective date of the suicide and incontestability clauses; therefore, those cases dealing with suicide clauses are equally relevant to the issue of the effective date of the incontestability clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
