Simon argues that the district court erred in imposing an Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) enhancement pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) to his sentence. He also argues that the ACCA enhancement constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Simon has abandoned on appeal his argument that the application of the sentencing guidelines violates the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Simon argues that the predicate offenses used by the district court did not fit the definition of a burglary to warrant the application of the ACCA enhancement. Because Simon has preserved his argument in the district court, we review the issue de novo. <em>See United States v. Montgomery, </em>402 F.3d 482, 485 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Louisiana defines simple burglary as \u201cthe unauthorized entering of any dwelling, vehicle, watercraft, or other structure, movable or immovable, or any cemetery, with the intent to commit a felony or any theft therein.\u201d La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:62 (West Supp.2005). Louisiana\u2019s statute defines burglary more broadly than the \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d of a building that is contemplated by the ACCA. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 1254,1257,161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) . The district court thus was required to determine whether Simon\u2019s simple burglary convictions constituted \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d convictions. <em>See Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">Simon concedes that his prior conviction for burglary of Crowley Junior High School qualifies as a \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(e). The record reflects that he has at least two prior burglary convictions that also meet the generic burglary definition under \u00a7 924(e). <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Specifically, his burglaries of the businesses H &amp; M Meatpacking Company and Tiffani\u2019s Lounge necessitate the existence of a building or structure. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the ACCA enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-19\">Simon renews his argument raised in the district court that the application of the ACCA constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-20\">The ACCA has not been held unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 965, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) ; <em>United States v. Yirkovsky, </em>259 F.3d 704, 706-07 (8th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
