Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Njoya fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Nor can Njoya show that he was entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">Finally, we reject Njoya\u2019s claim that the Board erred in using the summary affirmance procedure, as set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2005), in this case. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\"> Njoya did not challenge the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture before the Board. We therefore lack jurisdiction to consider this argument on appeal. <em>Asika </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
