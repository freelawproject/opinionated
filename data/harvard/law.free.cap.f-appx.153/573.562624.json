Shaw argues that the order reducing his sentence should be reversed because he was not given notice of the government\u2019s motion, an opportunity to be heard on the motion, or the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">On appeal, Shaw argues that a court\u2019s action on a Rule 35(b) motion for reduction of sentence amounts to a re-sentencing, which gives the court discretion to modify the sentence, and, therefore, the same protections afforded a defendant during sentencing are necessary at the motion hearing. The government acknowledges that it erred in its attempted service of the Rule 35(b) motion, and submits that the district \u25a0 court\u2019s order on the motion should be vacated and the case remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is vacated and the matter remanded for reconsideration. Representation of counsel that begins on appeal continues automatically on remand; thus Shaw will have the assistance of counsel on remand because this Court\u2019s order appointing counsel for him will remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
