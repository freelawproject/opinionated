Cordoba argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d- and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), requiring that his sentence be vacated and the matter remanded for resentencing. He recognizes that under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), relief on this issue is foreclosed, but he states that he wishes to raise the issue to preserve it for further possible review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-24\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions are constitutional. <em>See id. </em>at 239^47, 118 S.Ct. 1219. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). We must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.2003)(quotation marks and citation omitted). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
