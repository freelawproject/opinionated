Blount contends that the sentencing enhancement he received for being an armed career offender is precluded by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">Blount\u2019s claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 520-23 (4th Cir.2005), in which we held that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury was not violated by the district court\u2019s reliance on his prior convictions for purposes of sentencing as career offender. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 350 (4th Cir.) (holding similarly in the context of the Armed Career Criminal Act), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. Oct. 3, 2005) (No. 05-6904). Moreover, Blount does not challenge any facts regarding the prior convictions, and he does not dispute the factual basis for the district court\u2019s conclusion that he was a career offender. Accordingly, Blount\u2019s assertion that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment is without merit. <em>See Collins, </em>412 F.3d at 523 (holding that when defendant did not dispute any facts supporting career offender status, there is no constitutional violation in relying on defendant\u2019s prior convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">Accordingly, we affirm Blount\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
