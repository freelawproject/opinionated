Estelle, </em>594 F.2d 144, 144-45 (5th Cir.1979) (internal citations omitted). <em>Jordan </em>held that where there is nothing in the record to support the affidavit testimony, it is error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>to deny habeas relief without an evidentiary hearing where the petitioner\u2019s allegations, if true, would entitle him to habeas relief. <em>See id. </em>at 146. Moreover, a petitioner who presents a facially adequate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is entitled to some form of evidentiary hearing in order to fully and fairly adjudicate his claims. <em>See Brown v. Johnson, </em>224 F.3d 461, 466-67 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">However, this court recognized in <em>McDonald v. Johnson, </em>139 F.3d 1056, 1060 (5th Cir.1998), that although a petitioner may not be precluded from obtaining a federal evidentiary hearing to resolve conflicting affidavit testimony, he is not necessarily entitled to one. This court held that if a district court has sufficient facts before it to make an informed decision such that an evidentiary hearing would not further develop material facts relevant to the constitutional claim, a petitioner is not entitled to a hearing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In the instant case, there is an absence of evidentiary support for either Smith\u2019s or counsel\u2019s affidavit testimony. Given the absence of any indication that the district court\u2019s credibility determination was supported by evidence in the record either corroborating counsel\u2019s affidavit testimony or refuting Smith\u2019s, the district court improperly relied on the conflicting affidavit testimony alone to resolve the constitutional issues. <em>See Jordan, </em>594 F.2d at 144-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Based on the foregoing, we VACATE the district court\u2019s dismissal and REMAND the case for further findings of fact relevant to (1) whether Smith was deprived of his right to an impartial jury and (2) whether counsel was ineffective for failing to strike jurors Tickles, Bonds, and Wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
