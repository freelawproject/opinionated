He argues that the waiver of appeal provision in his plea agreement does not bar his appeal because he reserved the right to appeal a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum punishment. In <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir. 2005), we determined that there was no indication in the plea agreement that the parties meant for the term \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d to be accorded the definition used in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Bond, </em>414 F.3d at 545-46. We therefore applied the usual and ordinary meaning of the term, i.e., \u201cthe upper limit of punishment that Congress had legislatively specified for violation of a statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">In light of <em>Bond, </em>we interpret the virtually identical appeal waiver in the instant case as using the usual and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d to mean the upper limit of punishment specified by Congress in enacting the statute under which Grad was convicted, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) &amp; (d). <em>See id. </em>Because Grad\u2019s 84-month sentence did not exceed the 25-year statutory maximum sentence for Grad\u2019s offenses, the exception to the waiver of appeal provision does not apply to Grad\u2019s appeal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d). Therefore, Grad\u2019s appeal of his sentence is barred by the appeal waiver, and Grad\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED. Because Grad waived the right to appeal his sentence, we need not address his Sixth Amendment claim relating to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-18\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
