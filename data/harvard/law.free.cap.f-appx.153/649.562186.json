Chili\u2019s Restaurant (\u201cChili\u2019s\u201d), appeals the grant of summary judgment for Chili\u2019s on her claim that Chili\u2019s retaliated against her for complaining about sexual harassment in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). She argues that her supervisor\u2019s threats constituted an adverse employment action and that her supervisor\u2019s threats, combined with the work environment, constituted constructive discharge. The adverse employment action claim was not preserved for appeal and also fails as a matter of law. The constructive discharge claim fails because Van der Meulen did not present evidence that would show that the environment was so intolerable that a reasonable person would be compelled to resign. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Van der Meulen, a female, filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that her former employer, Chili\u2019s, retaliated against her for complaining about sexual harassment under the Florida Civil Rights Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 760.01-.il (\u201cFCRA\u201d). Van der Meulen alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that while she was employed at Chili\u2019s as a mid-manager/server, her immediate supervisor, Brian Marks, subjected her to a sexually hostile environment and discriminated against her based on her gender. Rl-1 at Exh. A, Complaint at 2-3. She also alleged that Chili\u2019s had retaliated against her because she objected to Marks\u2019s treatment and that she was constructively discharged. She claimed that she suffered emotional anguish and distress as a result of the treatment and sought compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Chili\u2019s removed the case to federal court and, in answer to the complaint, denied that it had discriminated or retaliated against, or harassed Van der Meulen. Following discovery, Chili\u2019s moved for summary judgment. It argued that Van der Meulen\u2019s retaliation claim failed because she quit before she had given Chili\u2019s an opportunity to work through any issues, and because the circumstances were not sufficient to compel a reasonable person to resign. It maintained that a reasonable person would have found Chili\u2019s general manager, Andy York, and his boss, Tony Viola, responsive to her complaints and that they had been responsive to Marks\u2019s previous remarks. In support of their motion, Chili\u2019s submitted Van der Meulen\u2019s deposition, York and Viola\u2019s sworn declarations, and other exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">In her deposition, Van der Meulen testified that, after she began working for Chili\u2019s in 2000, she was promoted to a \u201ckey employee\u201d, in which she assisted a night restaurant manager. Rl-24 at 54. She was told by York, in May 2002, that she was one of the best key employees in the restaurant, and she responded that she was interested in a management position and gave him her resume. She was subsequently scheduled for more key employee shifts but was unaware of any available management positions at the restaurant where she was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">Van der Meulen said that Marks began working for Chili\u2019s during 2002. She said that, while she was waiting for food at the kitchen pass-through in May, Marks made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u201csexual\u201d comments to the cook about \u201cdoing your mother\u201d while looking at Van der Meulen. Id. at 111-12. She said that she told Marks that she was offended by the remark, but he just ignored her and she did not report the incident to York. Sometime in late May or early June, Marks told Van der Meulen that he had previously worked as a stripper and began doing a \u201cstrip tease kind of dance\u201d with \u201call kinds of thrusts.\u201d Id. at 109, 116-20, 122-28. Van der Meulen reported this episode to one of the other managers, Bill Cook, who told her that he would handle it.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">On 14 June 2002, Van der Meulen stated that she was working a key employee shift and asked Marks what they were going to do about lunch for the employees, because it was customary for managers to make lunch for the employees on Fridays. When she asked about the lunch plans, she found Marks in the manager\u2019s office with another employee, Michael Creech. In response to Van der Meulen\u2019s question, Marks said \u201cDeez nuts,\u201d under his breath, and Creech started laughing. Id. at 126-28. She asked him again what they were having for lunch, and Marks looked at her and repeated \u201cDeez nuts.\u201d Id. at 127. She asked him a third time, and he pointed to his groin area, thrust it out, and again said \u201cDeez nuts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127-28, 150-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Van der Meulen testified that she left the office, started crying, and went to the bathroom to compose herself. Two of the other servers joined Van der Meulen at the bathroom to check on her and she told them what had happened. She said that Marks\u2019s comment and gesture made her feel hurt, angry, offended, and betrayed, and that Creek\u2019s laughter made her feel inferior because he was laughing at her when she was supervising him. She stayed in the bathroom for about 15 minutes and then came out and told Marks that she needed to talk to him outside. After they both went outside, she told him that what he had done was wrong, that he should be ashamed of himself, and that she was hurt and offended. Marks apologized and she went back to work and finished her shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In her deposition, Van der Meulen admitted that she did not report this incident to York, but noted that the next time she saw York, he asked her to come into his office and told her that he had found out that Marks had done something inappropriate and that he needed to report it to his boss, Viola, to cover himself. She told York that he \u201cha[d] to do what [he] ha[d] to do\u201d, and then his demeanor changed, and he said \u201cI got to tell you, if you report this, your chances of going to management is going to be very slim. Who is going to want to work with someone who screams sexual harassment? What manager is going to want to work with you?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136. She felt betrayed by his statement which she believed implied he had a choice about reporting the incident and that, if she reported it, her chances of going into management would be affected. Later, York called her, told her Viola was available, and asked her if she wanted to speak with Viola. She didn\u2019t know what to say and told him she needed to think about it. When Van der Meulen returned to work, York told her that they would not \u201ctalk about this,\u201d and Van der Meulen agreed, because there were rumors running around the restaurant. <em>Id. </em>at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Van der Meulen admitted that, during the time between the 14 June incident, and when she quit, about three weeks later, Marks did not direct any inappropriate behavior or language toward her. Marks never touched her inappropriately or physically threatened her. Nevertheless, Van der Meulen testified that, after her conversation with York, she was not scheduled for as many key shifts as before, the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>of her going into management was avoided, and the managers no longer had time to show her things on her free time. She also felt that York withheld her resume from management consideration. She did not know of any management positions that became available while she was working at Chili\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">According to Van der Meulen, about three weeks after 14 June, one of the servers told her that Marks had warned him not to talk to her because she had claimed sexual harassment. On that day, Marks was in the restaurant, drinking in the dining room and talking with other employees. Another employee, Jen Kieser, told her that Marks was talking about the 14 June incident. Van der Meulen finished her shift and then informed the manager on duty that she quit. She testified that she quit because the issue had not been \u201cdropped [,] wasn\u2019t being investigated,\u201d and because the male servers at the restaurant had formed a \u201cgood old boy[s] network\u201d that continued to focus on her reaction to the incident with Marks. <em>Id. </em>at 162-63. Her continued reaction to the 14 June incident also played a role in her decision to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Van der Meulen acknowledged that York called her at home the next morning to ask if there was anything he could do, but she told him she was still upset and to call back. Viola called Van der Meulen the following day, and told her that he needed to take a report over the phone. He asked her if she wanted to come back to the restaurant, but she stated that she could not work there if the same people were still there. Viola asked her if she wanted to work at the Port St. Lucie restaurant, but she said it was too far to drive for the money that she would be paid. She testified that, although she would have accepted a management position at the Port St. Lucie store, she did not talk to Viola about such a position.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Van der Meulen claimed that when she left Chili\u2019s she was \u201cemotionally distraught.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43. She said that she did not see a psychiatrist, psychologist, or a mental health therapist because she could not afford it, but testified that she talked to her pastor twice about the events. She stated she did not want to return to employment at Chili\u2019s, even though both York and Marks no longer worked there.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">York stated in his declaration that, upon investigating the 14 June incident, he determined that Marks had acted inappropriately and contrary to Chili\u2019s guidelines and policies when he made an inappropriate comment to Van der Meulen. Viola declared that he had learned of the incident from York. York and Viola both stated in their declarations that York had prepared a summary of the incident that was signed by York, Marks, and Viola; counseled Marks regarding proper behavior; and given Marks a written warning for violating Chili\u2019s policies. York said that Van der Meulen did not complain to him about any inappropriate behavior by Marks between the time of the incident and Van der Meulen\u2019s resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">In opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Van der Meulen argued that she was constructively discharged and that Chili\u2019s did not attempt to rectify the situation, but rather caused her to quit by making her \u201cthe troublemaker\u201d and keeping Marks employed, even after another manager, Bill Cook, labeled Marks \u201ca sexual harassment risk.\u201d Rl-29 at 13. She maintained that she suffered the adverse employment action of constructive discharge and that the causal link between her complaint and her discharge was York\u2019s statements \u201cthat her complaint w[ould] hurt her chances to go into management, that no one would want to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>with her,\u201d and the subsequent reduction in her key employee shifts. <em>Id. </em>at 12-13. She did not specifically argue that York\u2019s statements were a separate, actionable adverse employment action. She stated that she was bringing her action against Chili\u2019s under Title VII, apparently for the first time, and under the FCRA. In support, she filed the depositions of former Chili\u2019s employee Kieser and manager Bill Cook.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Kieser testified during her deposition that she worked as a server and key employee at Chili\u2019s. She stated that Marks \u201cwas always hitting on the younger [female employees]\u201d, and making \u201csexual comments\u201d about their bodies and the way that they were dressed. Rl-30, Kieser Depo. at 9-12. One night, Marks invited some employees over to his house and showed them pornography on his TV. Kieser testified that she heard Marks tell people about the 14 June incident with Van der Meulen, and that eventually, everyone at Chili\u2019s restaurant was aware of the incident. A few days after the June 14 incident, Kieser was at a bar with Van der Meulen, and the bartender asked Van der Meulen if she was the \u201cthese nuts\u201d girl. <em>Id. </em>at 19. Finally, Kieser noted that, on the day that Van der Meulen quit, Marks, who was visiting the Chili\u2019s bar as a guest, was drinking with some other Chili\u2019s employees. Marks was talking so loudly and using such foul language that Kieser asked him to stop. When Marks continued with his offensive behavior, Kieser asked a manager to intervene and Marks subsequently left.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">By deposition, Cook testified that he had worked for Chili\u2019s as an assistant general manager. He felt that Marks \u201cwas a sexual harassment risk\u201d and notified his superiors, including Viola, of his concerns. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 17. He observed that Marks\u2019s choice of words and vocabulary was improper and that he inappropriately touched female employees. Four female bartenders and other employees complained to him about Marks\u2019s comments and behavior toward them. Cook said that he had heard that Van der Meulen had complained about an incident involving Marks. Van der Meulen also submitted excerpts from Marks\u2019s personnel file, documenting the 14 June incident, at Chili\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">In reply to Van der Meulen\u2019s response to summary judgment, Chili\u2019s did not object to Van der Meulen\u2019s characterization of her case as raising Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">The district court granted summary judgement in favor of Chili\u2019s. Referring to Title VII, the court found that a hostile work environment did not exist as a matter of law and that Van der Meulen\u2019s retaliation claim failed because there was no adverse employment action or constructive discharge. Specifically, the court found that no adverse employment action occurred because her subjective allegation of not receiving as many key assignments as she had previously was not substantial enough, and because she did not show that there was a management opening that she could have been considered for while employed by Chili\u2019s. The court further found that the working conditions did not rise to the level of being so intolerable as to constitute a constructive discharge, especially in light of Chili\u2019s remedial efforts post-termination. The district court did not explicitly rule on Van der Meulen\u2019s claims under the FCRA, but implicitly granted summary judgment on these claims as well. Van der Meulen\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">On appeal, Van der Meulen argues that she presented evidence to show that Chili\u2019s retaliated against her by threatening her promotional potential and constructively discharged her through the threats and a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Johnson v. Governor of Fla., </em>405 F.3d 1214,1217 (11th Cir.2005) (en banc). Summary judgment should be granted only when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\u201cTitle VII makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any individual with respect to h[er] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d <em>Walton v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Serv., Inc., </em>347 F.3d 1272, 1279 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (internal quotation omitted); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). It is also unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee because she has opposed an unlawful employment practice. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">\u201cTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is some causal relation between the two events.\u201d <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001). To prove that an adverse employment action has taken place, \u201can employee must show a <em>serious and material </em>change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\u201d that is \u201cmaterially adverse as viewed by a reasonable person in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Fla., </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2001). \u201c[T]he action must either be an ultimate employment decision or else must meet some threshold level of substantiality.\u201d <em>Stavropoulos v. Firestone, </em>361 F.3d 610, 616-17 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1850, 161 L.Ed.2d 727 (2005) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cConstructive discharge qualifies as an adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>See Poole v. Country Club of Columbus, Inc., </em>129 F.3d 551, 553 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">A. <em>York\u2019s statements as an adverse employment action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">Van der Meulen argues that she presented evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Chili\u2019s retaliated against her by threatening her regarding her promotional potential if she reported the sexual harassment, specifically through York\u2019s threat that, if she reported Marks\u2019s inappropriate conduct, her chances of going to management were going to be slim and that no one would want to work with her, and York\u2019s subsequent phone call asking her if she wanted to pursue the report any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">As an initial matter, Van der Meulen did not properly preserve this issue for appeal. Although Van der Meulen referred to York\u2019s comments, she never argued in her complaint, in opposition to summary judgment, or on reconsideration, that his comments, standing alone, constituted an adverse employment action but that the comments were part of the circumstances constituting her constructive discharge. The district court cited York\u2019s statements when discussing Van der Meulen\u2019s constructive discharge claim, but did not address whether York\u2019s comments constituted an adverse employment action separately. Rl-33 at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">Generally, we do not consider an issue or theory on appeal that was not raised in the district court. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see Algernon Blair Group, Inc. v. United States Fid. and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>Guar. Co., </em>821 F.2d 597, 602-03 (11th Cir. 1987) (confirming that factual assertions presented for the first time on appeal could not be used to defeat summary judgment, even where the facts were in the record at the time of summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">To the extent that the issue is not waived, the claim still fails, because York\u2019s \u201cthreat\u201d did not amount to an adverse employment action. In <em>Doe v. Dekalb County Sch. Disk, </em>145 F.3d 1441, 1448-51 (11th Cir.1998) (discussing the ADA), we recognized that the test for adversity should be objective, and that an employee\u2019s subjective feelings about an employer\u2019s actions should not be considered. Even accepting Van der Meulen\u2019s testimony, there is no objective basis for finding York\u2019s statements constituted an adverse employment action. York made only one \u201cthreatening\u201d statement to Van der Meulen that her chances of going into management might be affected if she reported the incident. <em>See </em>Rl-24 at 134-43, 146-49. This statement did not cause any objective change in her employment. She worked for three weeks after the threatening statement, acknowledged that she and York agreed not to discuss the incident further, and does not claim that York or anyone else at Chili\u2019s threatened her further. <em>See id. </em>Van der Meulen does not argue that she suffered a cut in pay or any change in her benefits or position.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She acknowledged that no management positions became available while she was working at Chili\u2019s, and that both York and Viola attempted to get her to come back to work after she quit. <em>Id. </em>at 91-92, 168-172, 175, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Additionally, Van der Meulen did not complain about or report the alleged threats to another Chili\u2019s manager, even when she was given a chance to talk to Viola on the phone after the threats. Thus, Chili\u2019s had no time to remedy the situation. <em>Id. </em>at 144. <em>See, e.g., Coates v. Sundor Brands, Inc., </em>164 F.3d 1361, 1364-66 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (holding that a hostile work environment plaintiff must notify the employer of the harassment and give the employer a chance to remedy the situation). Further, although Van der Meulen likens her case to Wide<em>man v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1453 (11th Cir.1998), in which we held that adverse actions falling short of ultimate employment decisions can be actionable under Title VII, we recognized, but did not establish, a level of substantiality that must be met for unlawful discrimination to be cognizable under the anti-retaliation clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1456. In <em>Wideman, </em>we concluded that the actions of which Wide-man had complained were collectively sufficient to constitute prohibited behavior. <em>Id. </em>Those actions included improperly listing her as a no-show on a day she was scheduled off, and requiring her to work when she brought the error to the attention of her supervisor; giving her written reprimands, for the first time in eleven months, which resulted in a one-day suspension; soliciting employees for negative comments on her performance; failing to schedule her for work; threatening to shoot her in the head; and delayed authorizing medical treatment for an allergic reaction she was having. <em>Id. </em>at 1455, 1456. Van der Meulen only alleged one statement made threatening her future management aspirations, and she was not suspended, given a formal reprimand, harassed or threatened after her first meeting with York, and did not have her schedule reduced. The adverse action alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>by Van der Meulen is highly insubstantial in comparison to the misconduct alleged in <em>Widemcm. </em>Although she may have been emotionally distraught over York\u2019s comments regarding her future management potential, the record shows that these comments had no real effect on her employment, and thus, did not constitute an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Bi <em>Evidence of constructive discharge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Van der Meulen also argues that York\u2019s threats, combined with Marks\u2019s continued drunken ranting about the incident, and other employees coming up to her and telling her that Marks was discussing the incident, created an environment where a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to resign. She contends that her key employee duties were reduced and signaled that her chance of a management position had been derailed, and that it is a disputed issue of material fact as to whether the efforts Chili\u2019s took to rectify the situation were transparent since Marks remained employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\u201cA constructive discharge occurs when a discriminatory employer imposes working conditions that are so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s position would have been compelled to resign. <em>Fitz v. Pugmire Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>348 F.3d 974, 977 (11th Cir.2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Because the standard of proof for a constructive discharge claim is higher than that for a hostile work environment claim, the plaintiff must show more than that she was subjected to actionable harassment. <em>Walton, </em>347 F.3d at 1282. \u201cA constructive discharge will generally not be found if the employer is not given sufficient time to remedy the situation.\u201d <em>Kilgore v. Thompson &amp; Brock Mgmt., Inc., </em>93 F.3d 752, 754 (11th Cir.1996) (affirming summary judgment where the employer began an investigation of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on a Friday and attempted to meet with the plaintiffs on the following Tuesday, and where the plaintiffs did not return to work after advising the employer of their complaints). \u201cPart of an employee\u2019s obligation to be <em>reasonable </em>is an obligation not to assume the worst, and not to jump to conclusions too fast.\u201d <em>Garner v. WalMart Stores, Inc., </em>807 F.2d 1536, 1539 (11th Cir.1987) (affirming summary judgment where the employee quit after one day in what she perceived as an unacceptable position).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">In <em>Fitz, </em>348 F.3d at 979, we upheld summary judgment for the employer where the plaintiff claimed that his employer\u2019s racial discriminatory conduct compelled him to resign. One of the facts used by the plaintiff to support his position was his co-workers statements that his employer planned to fire him because of his race sometime in the future. <em>Id. </em>at 978. Noting that the plaintiff never confronted his employer about the alleged plot, we \u201cdecline[d] to reach a holding that would encourage speculative litigation\u201d since the employer might \u201cnever carry out the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 978 &amp; n. 4. In contrast, we reversed the grant of summary judgment for the employer in the constructive discharge claim in <em>Poole </em>where the employee was relieved of all of her duties, moved to an office with only a chair and no desk, and her employer instructed other employees not to speak with her. <em>Poole, </em>129 F.3d at 552, 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">The working conditions that Van der Meulen argues were intolerable consist of York\u2019s statement that her promotional potential would be negatively effected if she reported the sexual harassment and a coworker\u2019s statement, three weeks later, that Marks was in the Chili\u2019s bar talking about the incident in which he made the \u201cDeez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>nuts\u201d comment and inappropriately gestured toward her. Although she claims that the environment was such that a reasonable person would feel compelled to resign, she specifically testified that no sexual harassment occurred between her first conversation with York about Marks\u2019s harassment and the day that she quit and that she quit because the issue had not been dropped and she felt it was not being investigated. The evidence, however, including documentation filed by Van der Meulen, indicates that Marks\u2019s inappropriate comments and behavior were investigated and Marks was reprimanded for the inappropriate comment he made to her on 14 June. Rl-24 at 164-65, Exh. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The actions taken by Chili\u2019s when made aware of Marks\u2019s inappropriate behavior appear successful, in that Van der Meulen admittedly suffered no further harassment. Although she was upset over hearing that Marks was still discussing the incident with other employees, she did not return to work after becoming aware that Marks was discussing the incident. Under the circumstances, she acted unreasonably in quitting without giving Chili\u2019s an opportunity to respond, as they had successfully done previously. Her constructive discharge claim amounts to two isolated incidents, three weeks apart. Her case is akin to the claims in <em>Fitz, </em>in that her employer\u2019s threats never materialized. She was never denied the opportunity to advance to a management position, and in fact, Chili's managers attempted to mend the employment relationship after she quit. Under these circumstances, a reasonable person would not have felt compelled to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Van der Meulen failed to establish a retaliation claim as a matter of law. She never argued in the district court that her supervisor\u2019s threat constituted an adverse employment action, but even assuming this argument is properly preserved, the threat was never carried out, and did not objectively change any of the terms and conditions of her employment such that it can be considered an adverse employment action. Even combined with her other complaints about the work environment, a reasonable person would not have felt compelled to resign, especially in light of Chili\u2019s previous successful measures to stop the harassment, and the fact that she never gave Chili\u2019s the opportunity to remedy the final incident she claims compelled her to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\">. Van der Meulen testified that she was scheduled for fewer key employee shifts after York's threat; however, she does not argue on appeal that this change in her schedule was an adverse employment action. <em>See </em>Rl-24 at 174-75.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
