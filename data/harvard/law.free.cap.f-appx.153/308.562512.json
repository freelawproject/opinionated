Kocevar argues for the first time on appeal that the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>sions found at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b) are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Kocevar\u2019s appeal waiver, contained in his plea agreement, does not bar review of this issue because he did not waive his right to appeal the conviction. Nevertheless, as he concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir. 2000). Therefore, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
