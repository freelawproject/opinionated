Gill appeals the district court\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) judgment dismissing several of the claims raised in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-19\">Gill contends that the district court erred when it dismissed his claims under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242 as legally frivolous. He also contends that the district court erred when it dismissed his failure to file criminal charges claims as legally frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-20\">Contrary to Gill\u2019s contention, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242 do not provide a basis for civil liability. <em>See Hanna v. Home Ins. Co., </em>281 F.2d 298, 303 (5th Cir.1960); <em>Ali v. Shabazz, 8 </em>F.3d 22 (5th Cir.1993) (unpublished). Further, decisions whether to prosecute or file criminal charges are generally within the prosecutor\u2019s discretion, and, as a private citizen, Gill has no standing to institute a federal criminal prosecution and no power to enforce a criminal statute. <em>See Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619, 93 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973); <em>United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 124, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed these claims as legally frivolous. <em>See Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Gill also contends that his ineffective assistance of counsel, false charge, unlawful arrest, involuntary confession, right to counsel, and false imprisonment claims were not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because the criminal charges against him were dismissed. He also contends that because the criminal charges against him were dismissed, he is entitled to pursue his malicious prosecution claims. In support of these contentions, Gill attaches an order dismissing the criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Gill did not present the order of dismissal to the district court prior to the district court\u2019s judgment, and this court may not consider evidence relating to the dismissal of Gill\u2019s criminal charges furnished for the first time on appeal. <em>See Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir.1999). Although Gill attached a copy of the order of dismissal to a motion to suppress filed prior to the district court\u2019s denial of Gill\u2019s motions to reconsider and amend the pleadings, Gill did not file an amended notice of appeal from the denial of these motions and, thus, this court does not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii); <em>Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185,186 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Gill also contends that the district court erred when it dismissed his slander claims as legally frivolous. His conclusional allegations that the defendants\u2019 slanderous statements resulted in lost friendships, lost livelihood, lost time, and physical injuries are insufficient to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Arnaud v. Odom, </em>870 F.2d 304, 307 (5th Cir.1989). Further, Gill\u2019s attempt to incorporate his district court pleadings by reference is an insufficient means of raising his arguments in this court. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Gill also contends that the district court erred when it denied his request for the appointment of counsel. Contrary to Gill\u2019s contention, his civil rights action was not complex, he was educated and able to adequately present his case, and he was not incarcerated or unable to adequately investigate his claims. Therefore, the district court\u2019s refusal to appoint counsel was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Gill does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that (1) he failed to state a claim against Mary Bednarz, Tom Gill, James \u201cJimmy\u201d Bednarz, Theresa Beyer, Linda Bednarz, Michael Chandler, Jeremy Judge, and FNU Sanchez and (2) any complaints regarding incidents alleged to have occurred two years before Gill filed the complaint were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Therefore, these claims are abandoned. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Finally, although Gill reasserts his conditions of confinement, excessive force, denial of medical care, access to the courts, safe and sanitary housing, religious practice, excessive bail, cruel and unusual punishment, and change of social security number claims, these claims were not dismissed in the judgment being appealed, and Gill has not filed an amended notice of appeal from the dismissal of these claims. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii). Therefore, this court is without jurisdiction to consider an appeal from the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>dismissal of these claims. <em>See Dison, </em>20 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, and Gill\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
