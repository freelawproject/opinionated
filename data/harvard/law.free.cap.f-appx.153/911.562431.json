Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-25\">Anderson claims on appeal that the district court unreasonably imposed his federal term of incarceration to run consecutive to, rather than concurrent with, a previously imposed state sentence. Under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>(2003), a court is directed to apply a consecutive term of imprisonment for any crime that occurs while a defendant is serving an existing term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(a). Anderson does not dispute that he was serving an existing term of imprisonment. In fact, Anderson\u2019s possession of the firearm occurred when he was attempting to escape from state custody, where he was incarcerated for multiple drug charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Instead, Anderson argues that the record is unclear as to whether the district court recognized that it had the authority to ignore the mandatory nature of \u00a7 5G1.3(a) and impose a concurrent sentence, in light of the now-advisory nature of the sentencing guidelines. He further contends that the district court made no reference to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) when determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Having reviewed the record, we find no error. The district court was adequately informed of the discretion it had to impose a concurrent sentence. Furthermore, the record reveals that the district court was aware of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and that the sentence took these factors into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
