Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court assessed a two-level enhancement to his sentence pursuant to- U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) for creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to his passengers based solely on judicially found facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">Where, as here, an error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), has been preserved in the district court, we \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless we can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cThe government bears the burden of showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To meet this burden, the Government must show that the <em>Booker </em>error did not affect the sentence that the defendant received, i.e., it must show \u201cthat the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-18\">The district court sentenced Estrada to the top of his guidelines range, but this factor is not conclusive to show that any error was harmless. <em>Cf. United States v. Rodriguez-Gutierrez, </em>428 F.3d 201, 204-05 (5th Cir.2005) (holding, under a plain error standard of review, that a sentence at the maximum end of the guidelines range is strong but not conclusive evidence that the district court would not have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme). Although the district court also found such a sentence to be \u201cadequate\u201d to meet the sentencing objectives of punishment and deterrence, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>contains no other indication by the district court that it would have imposed the same sentence absent <em>Booker </em>error. The Government thus cannot meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Accordingly, Estrada\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-13\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00ede. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
