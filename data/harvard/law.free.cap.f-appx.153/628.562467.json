Specifically, he maintains that his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent was violated when he was forced to choose between waiving his privilege in the criminal case or having his property administratively forfeited in the civil case. Hudson also contends that he was not afforded due process because the government began judicial criminal forfeiture proceedings with respect to the same property that was the subject of the administrative proceedings, but did not allow the criminal forfeiture proceedings to reach a conclusion before the government declared an administrative forfeiture. As the government asserted in its answer brief, the sole issue on appeal is whether Hudson waived his constitutional arguments because he did not raise them in the district court. In his reply brief, Hudson maintains that he did not have the opportunity to raise his constitutional claims below.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">As a general rule, appellate courts \u201cwill not consider a legal issue or theory raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Southern Fabricating Co., Inc., </em>764 F.2d 780, 781 (11th Cir.1985). \u201cThe decision whether to consider such an argument is left to the appellate court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have identified five exceptions to the general rule. <em>See Narey v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526 (11th Cir.1994). Specifically, we will exercise our discretion to consider arguments not raised in the district court where (1) the issue involves a pure question of law and refusing to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice, (2) an appellant had no opportunity to raise the issue at the district court level, (3) \u201cthe interest of substantial justice is at stake,\u201d (4) \u201cthe proper resolution is beyond any doubt,\u201d and (5) the issue involves \u201csignificant questions of general impact or of great public concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1526-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Because the record demonstrates that Hudson did not raise his constitutional arguments in the district court nor present arguments on appeal other than those based on constitutional violations, we refuse to exercise our discretion to consider Hudson\u2019s constitutional claims. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hudson\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion for return of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-12\">. In his motion for return of property, Hudson cited former Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e) as the basis for his motion. However, motions for return of property are now addressed in Fed. R.Crim.P. 41(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
