On appeal, Dominguez-Benavides\u2019 counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>opinion there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue as to whether the district court erred under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in computing his criminal history points and in imposing a sixteen-level enhancement based on a prior drug trafficking conviction. After the Supreme Court\u2019s issuance of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), counsel filed a supplemental brief arguing that Dominguez-Benavides was erroneously sentenced under a mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines. The Government has responded. Although informed of his right to file a pro se brief, Dominguez-Benavides has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Dominguez-Benavides first claims that the district court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history category and its imposition of a sixteen-level enhancement for a prior drug trafficking conviction for which the sentence exceeded thirteen months violated <em>Blakely </em>and subsequently <em>Booker. </em>Because Dominguez-Benavides preserved his objection at sentencing on both grounds, we review for harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">We find no Sixth Amendment error in Dominguez-Benavides\u2019 sentence. Based on the convictions listed in the presentence report, the district court established a criminal history category of II, and assessed a sixteen-level enhancement for having been previously deported after a conviction for a felony that is a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded thirteen months. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">In <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Supreme Court instructed that Sixth Amendment protections apply to disputed facts about a prior conviction that are not evident from \u201cthe conclusive significance of a prior judicial record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63. However, Dominguez-Benavides did not contest his criminal history or any particular prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 522-23 (4th Cir.2005) (finding no Sixth Amendment violation where nature and separateness of predicate offenses for career offender status was undisputed); <em>cf. United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834, 843 (4th Cir. 2005) (finding that district court\u2019s reliance on disputed facts about prior conviction to determine that it was a crime of violence violated the Sixth Amendment). Furthermore, the prior conviction on which the sixteen-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) was based was clearly pled in the indictment. The district court\u2019s finding that the prior conviction resulted in a sentence that exceeded thirteen months is not the type of fact found outside the indictment that is \u201ctoo far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>404 F.3d at 842 (citing <em>Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1262). We therefore conclude that the district court\u2019s determination of Dominguez-Benavides\u2019 sentence did not violate his Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">In his supplemental brief, Dominguez-Benavides argues that under <em>Booker, </em>the district court erred in failing to treat the guidelines as advisory. Because Dominguez-Benavides did not object below to the mandatory application of the guidelines, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.2005). As Dominguez-Benavides fails to present any non-speculative evidence or argument demonstrating that he would have received a lower sentence had the district court appreciated that the guidelines were not mandatory, we find that the district court\u2019s error of sentencing Dominguez-Benavides under a mandatory guidelines scheme did not affect his substantial rights. Accordingly, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issue for appeal. We therefore affirm Dominguez-Benavides\u2019 sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> Dominguez-Benavides asserts that this issue was properly preserved based on his objection under <em>Blakely </em>that was raised before the district court. We find, however, that his objection was narrowly tailored to the calculation of his criminal history category and the imposition of the sixteen-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
