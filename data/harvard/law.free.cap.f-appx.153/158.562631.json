German pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess crack cocaine and cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (2000). German\u2019s offense level was modified upward to 43 because he shot and killed a woman during the course of a drug deal gone bad. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(d)(l), 2A1.1 (2002). At sentencing, German argued the cross-reference for murder was improperly applied because the conduct was more likely second degree murder which called for a lower offense level. The court disagreed with German\u2019s argument and sentenced him to the statutory maximum, which was also the guideline sentence, of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, German argues the court erred using the sentencing guidelines\u2019 cross-reference for murder. He also argues the sentence violated the rules announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-21\">Under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(d)(l), \u201c[i]f a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply \u00a7 2A1.1 (First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Degree Murder).\u201d Section 1111 includes murder in the first and second degree. German argues that because his killing was closer to second degree murder, USSG \u00a7 2A1.2 should apply. The Government argues the plain language of \u00a7 2Dl.l(d)(l) compels the court to apply the cross reference to \u00a7 2A1.1 regardless of whether the murder was first or second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">We consider the plain language of the sentencing guidelines when deciding how they are to be applied. <em>See United States v. Warwick, </em>287 F.3d 299, 304 (4th Cir. 2002) (analyzing the plain language of the guidelines for downward reductions); <em>United States v. Houchins, </em>364 F.3d 182, 190 (4th Cir.2004) (analyzing the plain language of the guidelines for sentencing enhancements). Because the plain language of \u00a7 2D1.1 compels the district court to impose the offense level under \u00a7 2A1.1, we find the court did not err in setting German\u2019s base offense level at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">German did not object at sentencing to the district court\u2019s fact finding or the use of the guidelines as mandatory. Accordingly, our review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). To establish plain error, German must show an error occurred, the error was plain, and the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Even if German makes this three-part showing, correction of the error remains within our discretion, which should not be exercised \u201cunless the error \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">We find German admitted to the conduct that resulted in the increase in the offense level based upon the cross-reference for murder. For instance, counsel stated at sentencing that \u201cwe agree with the facts as set forth in the presentence report,\u201d specifically referring to the facts that supported the murder enhancement. (J.A. at 121). Thus, the district court was not called upon to engage in fact finding with respect to whether or not German engaged in the conduct that resulted in the increased offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">As a result, German\u2019s only argument is whether the district court plainly erred because of the mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. In <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir. 2005), we held the mandatory application of the guidelines is plain error. However, we also held prejudice from the error cannot be presumed. <em>Id. </em>at 219. Accordingly, German must show the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines was actually prejudicial and affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 223. We find German failed to establish actual prejudice. As a result, we affirm the sentence and leave German\u2019s unchallenged conviction undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">We grant German\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief. We dispense \"with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
