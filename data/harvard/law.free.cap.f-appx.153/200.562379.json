Rios was sentenced to 126 months in prison. He now appeals, arguing that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-24\">Rios\u2019 presentence report assigned a base offense level of 34 based on more than fifteen kilograms of cocaine. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3) (2003). Three levels were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. With a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of III, Rios\u2019 guideline range was 135-168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-25\">At sentencing, the district court considered Rios\u2019 objections based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to the calculation of the base offense level. The court concluded that Rios was responsible for at least five but less than fifteen kilograms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>cocaine and assigned base offense level 32. With the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Rios\u2019 guideline range was 108-135 months. The court sentenced him to 126 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">On appeal, Rios objects under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to the district court\u2019s determination of the base offense level. Rios contends that his base offense level should have been 30, representing the actual weight of cocaine (4.8 kilograms) seized from the trunk of his ear at the time of his arrest. He notes that he pled guilty to possessing with intent to distribute approximately five kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">We discern no Sixth Amendment error. Even if Rios is correct and his base offense level should be 30, his guideline range would be 121-151 months. Because his sentence of 126 months does not exceed the maximum authorized by the facts admitted, there is no Sixth Amendment violation. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">We accordingly affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
