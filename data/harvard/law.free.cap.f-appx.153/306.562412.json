Zamora was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 46 months to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Zamora argues that in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), it appears that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), was incorrectly decided and that, therefore, the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. He contends that the unconstitutional portions of the statute should be severed and that he should be resentenced to no more than two years of imprisonment for the lesser included offense provided under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Zamora recognizes that his argument is foreclosed by the existing precedent of the Supreme Court and this court; however, he wishes to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\"><em>Almendarez-Torres </em>held that the enhanced penalties contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) were sentencing factors and not elements of the offense. 523 U.S. at 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless the Supreme Court overrules it. <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984. Zamora\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
