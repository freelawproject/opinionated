Each plaintiff alleged that Lew, as director of the Office Of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB), violated their due process rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the equal protection clause, and raised a further claim under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-16\">The district court granted Lew\u2019s motion to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary judgment against Torres. It denied a similar motion by Lew against Patterson. Patterson\u2019s case proceeded to jury trial. The jury held against Patterson, finding that Lew had not violated his civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-18\">Both Patterson and Torres are black Cubans. They are both independent contractors with OCB. Patterson handled the production, writing and voicing of a half-hour radio show on Radio Marti. Torres made monthly appearances on \u201cMesa Redonda,\u201d a radio show on Radio Marti.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-19\">Both Patterson and Torres claim that Lew racially discriminated against them by hiring white Cubans, similarly situated and less qualified, and paying them more for their services. The government claimed that both lawsuits were barred by qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-21\">In granting the government\u2019s motion to dismiss or for summary judgment against Torres, the district court found that she had not offered any evidence that she was effectively replaced by a similarly situated white Cuban. Therefore, as she had not shown an adverse action, the district court held that Torres had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-22\">In denying the government\u2019s motion to dismiss or for summary judgment against Patterson, the district court found that the record was not fully developed as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>whether or not Patterson and the white Cuban were similarly situated. Patterson\u2019s case proceeded to jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">On appeal, Torres claims that she presented evidence sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to the truth or falsity of Lew\u2019s proffered reasons from his disparate treatment of Torres from a white. OCB contractor. She claims that she established a prima facie case of disparate racial treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">On appeal, Patterson claims that the district court abused its discretion in two evidentiary rulings made during his trial. As to the first, he contends that the district court erred by excluding evidence of Lew\u2019s treatment of Torres, the other black contractor, because it was relevant to show Lew\u2019s general pattern of racial discrimination. As to the second, Patterson contends that the district court erred in excluding evidence of Patterson\u2019s conversations with Rodriguez, Lew\u2019s designee, about the compensation of black contractors and the compensation of white contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">We have carefully reviewed the grant of Lew\u2019s motion to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary judgment against Torres by the district court, including the briefs, record and argument of counsel. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Torres, we find no error and affirm the judgment of the district court as to Torres. <em>See William Penn Life Ins. Co. Of New York v. Sands, </em>912 F.2d 1359, 1361 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">As to Patterson\u2019s appeal, we have also carefully reviewed the record, the briefs and the argument of counsel. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion as to two evidentiary rulings made during Patterson\u2019s trial and that the jury verdict should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">AFFIRMED as to Torres; AFFIRMED as to Patterson.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-13\">. The government represented Lew as the claims involved acts within his authority as an employee for the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
