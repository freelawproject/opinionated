Moore appeals the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of social security disability benefits. We affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"AXB8\">1. We agree with the analysis offered in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">2. Moore first argues that the district court exceeded its judicial review</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">function by affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision based upon grounds not relied upon or considered by the ALJ. Moore claims that the ALJ did not analyze his liver condition as to whether that condition met the requirements of 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 5.05 (2005). He claims that the district court\u2019s \u201cpost hoc rationalization\u201d is contrary to well-established precedent that an ALJ\u2019s decision may only be affirmed on grounds stated in the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">Without mentioning listed impairment 5.05, the ALJ indicated that Moore\u2019s severe impairments did not meet or medically equal a listing. Wfiiile the ALJ\u2019s reasoning certainly could have been clearer, \u201c[pjrocedural perfection in administrative proceedings is not required.\u201d <em>Mays v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1362, 1364 (5th Cir.l9[88]). Even assuming the district court engaged in impermissible \u201cpost hoc rationalization,\u201d Moore has failed to show that his substantial rights have been affected. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">Moore\u2019s liver condition did not meet the listing requirement for chronic liver disease. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 5.05 (2005). While Moore may have satisfied the criteria of this listing for a time, his bilirubin levels dropped below the listing levels within one year of the earliest testing, and thus, Moore did not meet the twelve month durational requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(d)(1)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-17\">3. Moore next argues that the ALJ erred by failing to order spirometric testing to evaluate whether he suffers from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A consultative examination for such additional testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>is required \u201cwhen the evidence as a whole, both medical and nonmedical, is not sufficient to support a decision on [a] claim.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1519a(b), 416.919a(b). As noted by both the district court judge and the magistrate judge, a number of medical reports indicate that Moore was not suffering from disabling COPD, and it was not necessary to order testing. Further, the district court indicated that Charity Hospital examined Moore and determined that testing was not called for. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision not to seek spirometric testing. [3,4] 4. Moore contends that the ALJ improperly relied upon the Medical-Vocational Guidelines (Grids) as a framework for decision-making, and such reliance is improper where a plaintiff is found to experience nonexertional limitations. He argues that the most he could do is sedentary work. He claims that the availability of sedentary work is immaterial because in his circumstances the Medical-Vocational Guidelines direct a finding of disability. Moore\u2019s arguments are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">The ALJ recognized that Moore was not capable of performing a full range of light work and it did not rely upon the Grid Rules. The Grids may nevertheless be consulted as a \u201cframework\u201d for consideration of how much the individual\u2019s work capability is further diminished in terms of any types of jobs that would be contraindicated by the nonexertional limitations when the claimant is so affected by a nonexertional impairment as to preclude resort to the Grids for a disability determination. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, \u00a7 200.00(e)(2) (2005). The ALJ found that Moore experienced nonexertional limitations, and therefore, relied upon vocational expert testimony to establish whether jobs exist in the national economy that Moore can perform. The vocational expert opined that there were a significant number of jobs that Moore could perform. The ALJ may rely upon the vocational expert\u2019s testimony provided that the record, as here, reflects an adequate basis for doing so. <em>Carey v. Apfel, </em>230 F.3d 131, 146-47 (5th Cir.2000). The ALJ\u2019s determination that Moore retained the residual functional capacity for a reduced range of light work is supported by substantial evidence \u2014 the opinions of five physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
