She presents two arguments on appeal. First, she argues that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the government to present rebuttal testimony by her son, Blaine Cockcroft. Specifically, Blaine testified that he was unaware that Cockcroft had been abusive to his family. Second, she argues that the district court committed reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by treating the federal sentencing guidelines as mandatory. We affirm the conviction but reverse and remand as to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">\n<em>Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>409 F.3d 1293,1297 (11th Cir.2005). In this case we cannot say the district court abused its discretion. The court permitted Blaine to answer the limited questions of whether his father had been abusive because, although not relevant to the offense charged, references to Allowitz\u2019s statements that she and her children were abused had been made throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">\n<em>Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-18\">In a second and separate majority opinion, the Supreme Court concluded that the sentencing guidelines must now be treated as advisory. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764. Accordingly, district courts are now required to consider not only the applicable guidelines range, but also the full array of sentencing factors enumerated at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-19\">We have noted that there are two types of <em>Booker </em>error. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1300-31 (11th Cir.2005). First, Sixth Amendment, or, \u201cconstitutional,\u201d <em>Booker </em>error occurs when a district court uses extra-verdict enhancements to increase a defendant\u2019s guidelines range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>and then treats that range as mandatory. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330. Conversely, statutory <em>Booker </em>error occurs every time a district court treats the guidelines range as mandatory, regardless of whether it imposes any extra-verdict enhancements. <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Because no extra-verdict enhancements were ultimately used to assign the base offense level or increase Allowitz\u2019s sentence, no constitutional error occurred under <em>Booker. See id. </em>at 1330. Because the district court sentenced her pursuant to the mandatory guideline scheme, however, a statutory error has been established. <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We have clarified that a preserved \u201cstatutory\u201d <em>Booker </em>error is subject to a \u201cless demanding\u201d standard than the harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard applicable to \u201cconstitutional\u201d <em>Booker </em>errors. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, \u201c[a] \u2018non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence],\u2019 \u201d or \u201chad but a very slight effect.\u201d <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1291-92. If one can say \u201cwith fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error, the [sentence] is due to be affirmed even though there was error\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292. The government bears the burden to demonstrate harmless error by showing that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274,1277 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Upon review of the district court record and the briefs of the parties, we find reversible error in this case. Although the district court sentenced Allowitz to the high end of the applicable guideline range, the district court did not indicate whether it believed that the 151-month sentence was the most appropriate sentence, or whether it would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory scheme. Because it cannot be said \u201cwith fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error,\u201d we vacate and remand for re-sentencing consistent with <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Based upon the foregoing, Allowitz\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED, and her sentence is VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
