Arreola argues, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that the district court erred in sentencing him because the court believed that the federal sentencing guidelines were mandatory, rather than advisory. He also contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional and that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">We review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005). With respect to the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines, Arreola concedes that he cannot demonstrate that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had it considered the guidelines to be advisory. Accordingly, he has not established plain error in his sentence. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-17\">Although the decision in <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>has been called into question, <em>see Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 1254,1264,161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring), the Supreme Court has not overruled it. Accordingly, Arreola\u2019s argument that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>should be overruled and that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) be declared unconstitutional is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
