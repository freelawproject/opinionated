To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacanas, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Lapian fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-24\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Lapian\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Lapian fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.
