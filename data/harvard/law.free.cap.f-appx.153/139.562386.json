Gray maintains on appeal, as he did below, that he never received the magistrate judge\u2019s May 14, 2003 Proposed Findings and Recommendation (\u201cPF &amp; R\u201d).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-24\">A party who fails to object in writing within ten days to a magistrate judge\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law is not entitled to de novo review of the magistrate judge\u2019s determinations and is barred from contesting these determinations on appeal. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985). However, the waiver of appellate rights for failing to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation is not a jurisdictional requirement. <em>United States v. Schronce, </em>727 F.2d 91, 93-94 (4th Cir.1984). Consequently, when a litigant is proceeding pro se, he must be given fair notice of the consequences of failing to object before a procedural default will result. <em>Wright, </em>766 F.2d at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">When objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s determinations have been filed, de novo review by an Article III judge is not only required by statute, <em>Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>687 F.2d 44, 47 \u2014 48 (4th Cir.1982), it is indispensable to the constitutionality of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Act. <em>See United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 681-82, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980). If Gray\u2019s contentions are true, he timely received neither the PF &amp; R nor notice of the consequences of failing to object to the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Accordingly, we grant a certificate of appealability, vacate the order of the district court, and remand so that the district court can determine whether Gray timely received adequate notice of the PF&amp;R. If the district court determines that the PF&amp;R was not timely received by Gray, the court should serve Gray with a copy of the PF&amp;R, permit Gray to file objections and then conduct the requisite review. Should the court find that Gray did timely receive the PF&amp;R and the attendant notice, it should reinstate its dismissal of the \u00a7 2255 motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-15\"> On remand from this court, the district court granted Gray\u2019s motion to reopen the time to note an appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6), finding that Gray did not receive timely notice of the district court\u2019s judgment order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
