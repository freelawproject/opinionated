On appeal, Marpoe argues that \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny. He contends that, prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi, </em>we considered the provisions in \u00a7 841(b) to be sentencing factors and not elements of the offense. He argues that our approach in <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(en banc), abrogated in part, United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1308 (11th Cir.2005), where we limited the scope of <em>Apprendi </em>to when judge-decided facts increase a sentence above the statutory maximum, would not survive a constitutional challenge, and contends that it is unclear whether, under <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00a7 841(b) contains elements or sentencing factors. He further argues that, in light of <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63, which held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d there are only three ways to preserve the constitutionality of \u00a7 841:(1) sever the unconstitutional section\u2014 \u00a7 841(b); (2) reinterpet the \u00a7 841(b) factors as elements of the offense; or (3) declare \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 846 unconstitutional in their entirety. Marpoe argues that only the third option is appropriate, and therefore, his conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Ordinarily, we review constitutional issues <em>de novo. United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1751, 161 L.Ed.2d 615 (2005). However, because Marpoe did not assert his constitutional claim in the district court, it is within our discretion whether to address the issue. <em>Id. </em>Where a defendant fails to raise his constitutional claim in the district court, we review his claim only for plain error. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>59 F.3d 1196, 1198 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">In <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1098-99 (11th Cir.2002), we relied on <em>Sanchez </em>in rejecting a facial challenge to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 similar to the one that Marpoe now makes to \u00a7 841. In <em>Sanchez, </em>we held that \u00a7 841 \u201cis impacted by <em>Apprendi </em>but only to the limited extent that judge-decided facts actually increase a defendant\u2019s sentence above the prescribed statutory maximum.\u201d 269 F.3d at 1268. As a result of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the requirements for a successful <em>Apprendi </em>facial challenge have changed since <em>Sanchez </em>and <em>Tinoco, </em>but Marpoe still must satisfy the requirements as they exist currently. Therefore, in the words of <em>Booker, Sanchez </em>now stands for the proposition that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply where a defendant\u2019s actual sentence falls within the range \u201cauthorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty ... [which] must be admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">In this case, Marpoe\u2019s sentence fell within the maximum authorized by the facts established by his guilty plea. Marpoe signed a written plea agreement, admitting that the 125 marijuana plants recovered on his property belonged to him, and during the plea colloquy, he admitted that the government\u2019s proffer \u2014 namely, possession with intent to distribute 125 marijuana plants with his wife \u2014 was true. Furthermore, Marpoe did not object to the Presentence Investigation Report, which stated that he possessed, with intent to distribute, 125 marijuana plants with his wife. Pursuant to \u00a7 841, and given these admitted facts, the minimum sentence that he could have received was five years\u2019 imprisonment, and the maximum was 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. Because Marpoe\u2019s sentence fell within the range authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d at 1268. Accordingly, Marpoe\u2019s facial challenge fails because he \u201ccannot demonstrate that no set of circumstances exist under which [\u00a7 841] would be valid,\u201d primarily because, under the circumstances of his own case, \u00a7 841(b) is constitutionally valid. <em>See Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d at 1101 (internal quotation omitted). Therefore, the district court did not plainly err in not finding that \u00a7 841 facially violates the Constitution, and we affirm Marpoe\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
