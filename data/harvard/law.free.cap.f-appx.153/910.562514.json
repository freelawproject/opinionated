We have reviewed the record and the district court order and affirm substantially for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Glover v. Secretary, HHS, </em>No. CA-04-693-CCB (D.Md. May 2, 2005).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-17\"> This court does not have jurisdiction to review the March 4, 2005 order dismissing Glover\u2019s complaint because Glover failed to file a timely notice of appeal from that order. When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). The district court\u2019s order of dismissal was entered on the docket on March 4, 2005. Glover's motion for reconsideration did not toll the sixty day period because it was not filed within ten days of the March 4 order. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4). Glover\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on June 6, 2005, or beyond the sixty day appeal period from the March 4, 2005 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
