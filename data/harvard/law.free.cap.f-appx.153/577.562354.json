On appeal, Arias argues that the district court erred when it sentenced him to 9 months of incarceration and 51 months of supervised release without granting credit for the time Arias had previously spent at a community corrections center (\u201cCCC\u201d), as a result of prior modifications to his prerevocation term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-25\">Arias failed to challenge the calculation of his post-revocation supervision before the district court, and we therefore review that court\u2019s calculation only for plain error. See <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. de</em>nied., \u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). We may not correct an error that a defendant failed to raise before the district court unless the district court: (1) committed error, (2) that was plain, and (3) that affected substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1298. If these criteria are met, we may, in our discretion, correct the plain error if it \u201c\u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)). Of course, when \u201cthe explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Arias invokes 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) and (h) in support of his position. Subsection (e)(3) provides that, upon revocation, a court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision, if the court ... finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, except that a defendant whose term is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve on any such revocation more than 5 years in prison if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a class A felony....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsection (h) permits a court to include an additional term of supervised release as part of a sentence imposed upon revocation and establishes the maximum length of such term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">When a term of supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment, the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment. The length of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAq\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h). Arias concedes that \u00a7 3583(h) does not require a district court \u201cto give credit for time previously served on supervised release when it revokes the initial term of supervised release and orders an additional prison term followed by a new term of supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Pla, </em>345 F.3d 1312, 1314 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201cthe only credit that subsection (h) clearly enumerates is time served in prison [after] revocation of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, Arias argues, the time he spent in the CCC was tantamount to imprisonment, and should therefore be credited against his post-revocation sentence. In other words, Arias contends that district court\u2019s \u201cmodification\u201d of the original terms of Arias\u2019s supervised release, to include periods of time at the CCC, was a <em>de facto </em>revocation-and the time spent at the CCC was \u201cimprisonment\u201d that must therefore be credited against his. current post-revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that \u00a7 3583(h) does, as Arias claims, entitle a defendant to credit for incarceration served on all <em>prior </em>revocations of supervised release, it is nevertheless clear that the district court did not commit plain error in calculating Arias\u2019s post-revocation sentence, for neither the statutory language nor controlling precedent establish that time spent in a CCC on supervised release amounts to \u201cimprisonment\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3583(h). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Arias argues that because the Bureau of Prisons sometimes places a federal prisoner in a CCC or halfway house for the final part of the prisoner\u2019s term of incarceration, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(c), the requirement that Arias spend time at a CCC on supervised release should be considered imprisonment. This argument is not persuasive, for we have held that in the context of a probationary sentence, \u201cresidence in a halfway house is not tantamount to imprisonment.\u201d <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>204 F.3d 1305, 1315 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(b)(ll).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Arias also argues that the statutory language governing modification of the conditions of supervised release does not permit a district court to require that he reside at a CCC without effecting a revocation. Section 3583(e)(2) authorizes a district court to \u201cmodify ... the conditions of supervised release ... pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation and the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the terms and conditions of post-release supervision.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2). Under \u00a7 3583(d) the court may, subject to certain limitations, order as a condition of supervised release \u201cany condition set forth as a discretionary condition of probation in section 3563(b)(1) through (b)(10) and (b)(12) through (b)(20), and any other condition it considers to be appropriate.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). Arias emphasizes that subsection (b)(ll), which allows the court to require residence at a CCC, is excluded as a possibility because it is not enumerated in \u00a7 3583(d). At least four circuit courts of appeals, however, have rejected this argument, finding that the omission of subsection (b)(ll) was due to a clerical error-and that district courts retain statutory authority to impose confinement in a CCC as a condition of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Del Barrio, </em>427 F.3d 280, (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. D\u2019Amario, </em>412 F.3d 253, 256 (1st Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 206, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005); <em>United States v. Griner, </em>358 F.3d 979, 982 (8th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Bahe, </em>201 F.3d 1124, 1136 (9th Cir.2000). Thus, the district court did not effect a revocation by modifying the conditions of Arias\u2019s original term of supervised release to include residence at a CCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Finally, Arias argues that the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) support his position, because they provide that a term of imprisonment ordered upon.the revocation of supervised release can, in certain circumstances, be satisfied by a term of supervised release that includes community confinement or home detention. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the Government points out, however, Arias\u2019s argument is not compelling because the Guidelines also permit residence in a CCC to be imposed as a condition of supervised release. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5D15(e)(l) and 5F1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">In light of the foregoing, and in the absence of controlling authority to the contrary, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error by declining to credit the time Arias spent at a CCC (due to modifications of the conditions of his supervised release) against his sentence upon revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\">. Arias's convictions for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and distribution of cocaine, both in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), were Class A felonies, as the maximum penalty for each was life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559. Accordingly, the term of supervised released authorized by statute was not more than five years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-12\">. In fact, this Court reached the same conclusion even when considering the language of \u00a7 3583(e)(3) separate and apart from the enactment of \u00a7 3583(h). <em>See United States v. Gresham, </em>325 F.3d 1262, 1265-68 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-6\">. We note that Arias does not contend that the circumstances of his residence at the CCC were actually similar to those of confinement in a jail or prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b605-16\">. Arias also notes that the Guidelines sometimes permit defendants to serve portions of their terms of imprisonment in a CCC. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
