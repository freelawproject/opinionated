The only issue he raises concerns the effect of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), on his sentence. As the government correctly concedes, there was non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error in this case, it was preserved, and the government cannot show it was harmless. Accordingly, Casey is entitled to be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED with instructions that Casey is to be resentenced in accord with the <em>Booker </em>decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
