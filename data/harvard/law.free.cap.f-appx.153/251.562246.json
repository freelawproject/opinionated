Gavin, federal prisoner # 10867-042, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g) motion for return of $19,395 in United States currency civilly forfeited pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881. The district court denied Gavin\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g) motion. Because the criminal proceeding against him had already concluded when he brought this action, we treat his Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g) motion as a civil action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, seeking the return of property, and treat the district court\u2019s denial of that motion as a grant of summary judgment in favor of the Government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-26\">Gavin argues, pursuant to <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that he was denied the predeprivation safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>guards of notice and a hearing in violation of his due process rights. <em>Good </em>is inapposite, however, because it dealt only with the seizure of real property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s holding that Gavin was not entitled to predeprivation notice and a hearing under due process is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Gavin additionally argues that the Government did not adduce adequate proof that it complied with the notice requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1607(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, the Government\u2019s Declaration of Administrative Forfeiture only conclusion-ally alleged, without supporting documentation, that notice was sent \u201cto all known parties, by certified mail, who may have [had] a legal or possessory interest in the property\u201d and that notice \u201cwas published once a week for three successive weeks in the <em>[NEW YORK TIMES </em>] in accordance with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1607,\u201d and it therefore cannot support summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Therefore, the grant of summary judgment to the Government is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings to determine whether Gavin received proper notice of forfeiture under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1607(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
