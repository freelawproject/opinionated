On appeal, Watkins\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Watkins\u2019 <em>Anders </em>brief asserts that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questions whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to allow substitute counsel. Watkins was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not respond. The Government adopted counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and elected not to file a separate brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Whether a motion for substitution of counsel should be granted is within a trial court\u2019s discretion, <em>United States v. Corporan-Cuevas, </em>35 F.3d 953, 956 (4th Cir. 1994), and an indigent defendant has no right to a particular attorney and can demand new counsel only for good cause. <em>United States v. Gallop, </em>838 F.2d 105, 108 (4th Cir.1988). A defendant does not have an absolute right to substitution of counsel. <em>United States v. Mullen, </em>32 F.3d 891, 895 (4th Cir.1994). In evaluating whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, this court must consider: (1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry; and (3) whether the attorney/client conflict was so great that it had resulted in total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense. <em>Gallop, </em>838 F.2d at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">Watkins timely filed his motion for new counsel (more than a month prior to the sentencing), although the district court did not address that motion until the sentencing hearing. Thus, the timeliness prong under <em>Gallop </em>may weigh in Watkins\u2019 favor. Nevertheless, the district court conducted an adequate inquiry into Watkins\u2019 reasons for wanting new counsel. Moreover, there was no evidence that a breakdown of communication between Watkins and his attorney prevented Watkins from receiving adequate representation. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Watkins\u2019 motion for new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Watkins\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
