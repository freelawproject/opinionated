See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b173-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Frank James Lineberger appeals from the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders denying his motion for relief from the automatic stay in Deloris Henry\u2019s bankruptcy case, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a) (2000), overruling his objection to confirmation of the bankruptcy plan, and confirming Henry\u2019s Chapter 13 plan. We find that the plan proposed an impermissible modification of the terms of the agreement between Henry and Lineberger, and therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">Section 1322 of the Bankruptcy Code provides in part that a proposed Chapter 13 plan may \u201cmodify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor\u2019s principal residence.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(b)(2) (2000). \u201c[Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, [the plan may] provide for the curing of any default within a reasonable time and maintenance of payments while the case is pending on any ... secured claim on which the last payment is due after the date on which the final payment under the plan is due.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">The final payment on the debt to Lineberger was due before Henry filed her petition in bankruptcy. Thus, Lineberger\u2019s claim was fully matured prior to the bankruptcy filing and cannot be \u201ccured\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1322(b)(5). <em>See In re Litton, </em>330 F.3d 636, 643 n. 7 (4th Cir.2003) (stating that \u201ccure provision applies only to secured claims that have yet fully to mature\u201d). Although the plan proposed to pay the total amount due with interest,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> this proposal constituted an impermissible modification of the terms of the debt because it sought to extend the term of repayment and to alter the interest rate. <em>See id. </em>at 644; <em>In re Gianguzzi, </em>145 B.R. 792, 794 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1992) (denying confirmation and lifting stay for mortgagee where debtor proposed to pay fully matured mortgage at reduced interest rate over five year term of plan). Because \u00a7 1322(b)(2) prohibits confirmation of a plan that seeks to modify the terms of a debt secured only by the debtor\u2019s principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>residence, we find that the bankruptcy court erred in confirming Henry\u2019s Chapter 13 plan, and the district court erred in affirming that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand with instructions for further remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-13\"> The parties disagree as to the amount of the claim and the applicable interest rate. We express no opinion on these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
