In his brief, which was filed before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Cerda-Tovar argues, to preserve for further review, that the viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is in doubt given <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that, under the view now held by a majority of the Supreme Court justices, the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348. We must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.) (quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003). Therefore, Cerda-Tovar\u2019s argument regarding the viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Cerda-Tovar also argues that the Government correctly conceded that constitutional error occurred under <em>Booker </em>and that the Government has the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. However, Cerda-Tovar asserts that (1) the <em>Booker </em>error in this case is structural and not susceptible to harmless-error analysis; (2) even if harmless-error analysis is appropriate, the error is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) application of a reasonableness standard of review is not appropriate because that standard was applicable to <em>pre-Booker </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">Here, the only enhancements to Cerda-Tovar\u2019s sentence were based on his prior convictions. However, the district court erred by imposing a sentence pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">We review such error, assuming without deciding that it was properly preserved, under the harmless-error standard. The Government has carried its burden of showing that, even absent the mandatory application of the guidelines, Cerda-Tovar\u2019s sentence would be the same. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, the error is harmless in light of the district court\u2019s statement that it would impose the same sentence. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
