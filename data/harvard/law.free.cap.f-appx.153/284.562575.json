Pineda-Rodriguez argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied in his case because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Pineda-Rodriguez acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
