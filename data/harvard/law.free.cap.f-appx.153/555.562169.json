In granting summary judgment in State Farm\u2019s favor on Kingsley\u2019s claim, the district court concluded that State Farm: (1) did not know, nor should it reasonably have known, that settlement within the Policy limits was possible; and (2) did not fail to take sufficient steps to obtain a settlement within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Upon a <em>de novo </em>review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the district court that there is no reasonable basis to conclude that State Farm tortiously refused to settle Kingsley\u2019s claim against its insured. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in State Farm\u2019s favor and denying Kingsley\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-18\">. Kingsley devotes a substantial portion of her brief to an argument concerning the district court\u2019s April 14, 2003 order disallowing her Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. However, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>cause Kingsley did not cite this order in her Notice of Appeal, we do not have jurisdiction to reach the merits of this issue. Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B); <em>see also Whetstone Candy Co. v. Kraft Foods, Inc., </em>351 F.3d 1067, 1079-80 (11th Cir.2003). In fact, at no point prior to filing her initial brief did Kingsley challenge this order of the district court by way of a motion for reconsideration, a motion to dismiss the complaint, or by seeking interlocutory review of the order. Instead, Kingsley filed an answer to State Farm's counterclaim, participated in discovery, and ultimately filed an unsuccessful motion for partial summaty judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
