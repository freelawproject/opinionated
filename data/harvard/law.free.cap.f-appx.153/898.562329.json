Myers appeals, contending that his sentence, which was imposed under the then-mandatory federal sentencing guidelines, violates <em>United States v. Book</em>er, \u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government asserts that Myers validly waived the right to appeal his sentence in the plea agreement. We agree with the Government and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402-03 (4th Cir.2000). To determine whether a waiver is knowing and intelligent, we examine \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the experience and conduct of the accused, as well as the accused\u2019s educational background and familiarity with the terms of the plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 400 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We review de novo the question of whether a defendant validly waived his right to appeal. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Our review of the plea agreement and the hearing conducted pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 leads us to conclude that Myers knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal. <em>See General, </em>278 F.3d at 400-01; <em>see also Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 169-73 (holding that a plea agreement containing a waiver of the right to appeal, which was accepted by district court prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>was not invalidated by change in law effected by that decision). Moreover, Myers\u2019 claim under <em>Booker </em>falls within the scope of the waiver. <em>See Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 170 (holding <em>Booker </em>claim is covered by appellate waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
