Chesson appeals his guilty-plea sentence for possession and pledge of a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(j) and 924(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Chesson renews his argument, preserved in the district court, that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the imposition of a two-level enhancement for being a prohibited person pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6)(A) was illegal because it was based on judicially found facts and facts to which he did not admit.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">The Government responds that any error in treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory was harmless because Chesson was sentenced to the maximum guideline range, thereby indicating that it is highly unlikely that he would have received a lesser sentence had the district court treated the guidelines as advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">Where, as here, an error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), has been preserved in the district court, we \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless [this court] can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted. \u201cThe government bears the burden of showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) <em>Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 284. To meet this burden, the Government must show that the <em>Booker </em>error did not affect the sentence that the defendant received, i.e., it must show \u201cthat the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-20\">Without the prohibited-person enhancement, Chesson\u2019s base offense level would have been 12, and his total offense level would have been 10 after a two-point downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. His resulting guideline imprisonment range would have been 10 to 16 months as opposed to 18 to 24 months. As such, the district court\u2019s sentencing error contributed to his sentence, and he was prejudiced by the error because the available sentencing range was increased beyond that for which he would otherwise have been eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, a sentence at the high end of the guideline range alone does not conclusively prove that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent a <em>Booker </em>error. <em>Cf. United States v. Rodriguez-Gutierrez, </em>428 F.3d 201, 204-05 (5th Cir.2005) (holding, under a plain error standard of review, that a sentence at the maximum end of the guidelines range is strong but not conclusive evidence that the district court would not have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines regime). If a maximum guideline sentence must be received \u201ctogether with relevant statements by the sentencing judge\u201d to show plain error, <em>see id. </em>at 205, it follows that the surrounding context must be examined to determine if any error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Under the foregoing construct, the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable because other than the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the high end of the guideline range, the record does not indicate that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent a <em>Booker </em>error. The Government thus cannot meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Accordingly, Chesson\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
