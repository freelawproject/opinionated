He argues that he was sentenced under a mandatory guideline sentencing system in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Benjamin contends that the district court may have imposed a lesser sentence under a discretionary system.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-26\">Sentencing a defendant pursuant to a mandatory guideline scheme, without an accompanying Sixth Amendment violation, constitutes \u201cFanfan\u201d error. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364 (5th Cir.2005)(discussing the distinction between the two types of error addressed in Booker). Where Fanfan error is raised for the first time on appeal, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuelw-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-29\">Benjamin has met the first two prongs of the plain error test because \u201cFanfan\u201d error is \u201cerror\u201d that is \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See id. </em>However, to meet the third prong of the analysis and show that the error affected his substantial rights, Benjamin bears the burden of \u201cestablish[ing] that the error affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Benjamin must show \u201cthat the sentencing judge\u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-32\">Benjamin cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights. There is nothing in the record indicating that the district court would have imposed a differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>ent sentence if it had known that it was not bound by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 677 (5th Cir.2005). Benjamin cannot demonstrate plain error. The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b963-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
