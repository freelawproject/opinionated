He asserts two bases for the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-22\">Hinojosa argues for the first time on appeal that the district court\u2019s belief during sentencing that the United States Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, rather than advisory, requires reversal by this court under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411- F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 464, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005) (No. 05-6242). Hinojosa\u2019s sentence, imposed pursuant to mandatory guidelines, constitutes error. <em>See id. </em>Hinojosa asserts that the error is structural, or at least presumptively prejudicial, such that he is not required to show prejudice. As he acknowledges, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 601. He admits that he cannot show that his sentence likely would have been different under an advisory application of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-30\">Hinojosa also asserts for the first time on appeal that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ed felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), controls this issue. We must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Thus, this issue is also foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
