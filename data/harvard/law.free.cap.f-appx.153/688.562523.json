McCray argues on appeal that the district court committed due process or quasi-ea; <em>post facto </em>violations<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by sentencing her pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), instead of pursuant to the pr <em>e-Booker </em>mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cfed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>eral guidelines\u201d), as interpreted in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment, which charged McCray with the above-referenced offenses, but did not include any tax loss amounts. McCray subsequently entered into a written plea agreement with the government, whereby she agreed to plead guilty as charged, and she acknowledged that her maximum statutory sentence for each charged offense was three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On February 24, 2004, during McCray\u2019s plea colloquy, the district court also personally advised McCray that her maximum statutory sentence for each of the charged offenses was three years\u2019 imprisonment, and that these sentences could run consecutively. The government then proffered that, if the case had proceeded to trial, it would have proven that, on different occasions from tax years 1997 through 2000, McCray had prepared false tax returns. These offenses, which generally were the same, involved McCray\u2019s (1) understating taxpayers\u2019 earnings or withholding on their W-2 forms, and (2) preparing false 1040 tax forms. The government also explained that, after each taxpayer knowingly filed a false tax return, he or she paid McCray a fee of up to $3,000. At the conclusion of this proffer, McCray conceded that the facts were true, and she plead guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Prior to sentencing, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), recommending that McCray be held responsible for both her charged and relevant conduct of preparing false tax returns, resulting in a total of 61 tax returns, a tax loss of $230,824, and a base offense level of 16 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T4.1(K) (offense level applicable for offenses involving tax losses greater than $200,000, but less than $325,000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The probation officer also recommended a two-level increase in this level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.4(b)(l)(B), because McCray was in the business of preparing or assisting in the preparation of tax returns, and a three-level downward adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for timely acceptance of responsibility. With an adjusted offense level of 15, and a criminal history category of I, McCray\u2019s resulting guideline range was 18 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">McCray objected to being held responsible for both the charged and relevant conduct. McCray also filed a supplemental objection to the PSI, arguing that, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Blakely, </em>the district court was barred from imposing a sentence falling outside the zero-to-six-month sentencing range that resulted after calculating her base offense level as 6 \u2014 the level applicable for offenses involving $1,700 or less of tax loss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In support of this <em>Blakely </em>objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>tion, McCray asserted that, because the tax loss amount was not charged in her indictment, the government could not rely on it in calculating her offense level. The government responded that the court should deny McCray\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection because <em>Blakely </em>did not invalidate the federal guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">On January 25, 2005, at sentencing, the court noted that, between the preparation of McCray\u2019s PSI and sentencing, the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>had extended its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the federal guidelines. The court also stated that it intended to \u201cessentially go forward as [it] ha[d] in the past and go through the computation of the guidelines and, once [it] ha[d] that as a background, ... the court [could] exercise its discretion in fashioning a sentence.\u201d McCray then reasserted her <em>Blakely </em>objection, arguing that (1) she should be sentenced \u201cunder the law set forth in Blakely,\u201d and (2) \u201cthere [was] a due process quasi <em>ex post facto </em>right that would limit the [c]ourt\u2019s consideration in computing the guidelines to only those facts set forth in the charging document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The government responded that the court should sentence McCray pursuant to <em>Booker. </em>The government also asserted that <em>Booker </em>\u201cd[id] not follow <em>Blakely </em>in the way the defense [was] trying to argue that it should have. What [the] defense [was] trying to do [was take] the part of <em>Blakely </em>that it liked and anticipated and overlafy] that over <em>Booker. </em>\u201d The government, however, explained that, if the court believed that McCray had been prejudiced by the change in the law, then it should allow her to withdraw her plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Agreeing with the government, the court stated that it was required \u201cto apply the remedial provision in the <em>Booker </em>case,\u201d that is, \u201cto consult the guidelines but to retain the discretion to impose whatever sentence the court ultimately conclude[d] to be a reasonable sentence in light of the guidelines, and in light of all of the other factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ].\u201d Nevertheless, the court instructed McCray that it would allow her to withdraw her plea. After McCray replied that she did not wish to withdraw her plea, the court explained that she would be \u201csubject to the law as it exists today.\u201d The government then proceeded to present testimony on the amount of tax loss resulting from McCray\u2019s relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">During this presentation of evidence, McCray agreed to stipulate that her combined charged conduct and relevant conduct had involved filing 62 tax returns, had resulted in an amount of tax loss between $120,000 and $200,000, and supported a base offense level of 14. As part of this stipulation, however, both the parties and the court agreed that McCray was preserving her objection concerning \u201cthe <em>ex post facto </em>[implications] <em>o\u00ed Blakely.\" </em>After noting that McCray had a total offense level of 14 and a guideline range of 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, the court discussed at length the sentencing factors contained in \u00a7 3553(a). The court ultimately sentenced McCray below the guideline range to concurrent sentences of 1 year\u2019 and 1 day\u2019 imprisonment, 1 year\u2019 supervised release, and a $1,000 special assessment fee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">McCray argues on appeal that the district court erred in sentencing her pursuant to <em>Booker, </em>instead of pursuant to the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory federal guidelines, as interpreted in <em>Blakely. </em>McCray contends that the court\u2019s application of <em>Booker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>at sentencing violated both her due process or quasi-ea; <em>post facto </em>rights because it involved a retroactive application of the law, deprived her of fair warning of \u201cincreased\u201d criminal penalties, and resulted in a more onerous sentence that she, otherwise, would have received. McCray also asserts that, although the Supreme Court held in <em>Booker </em>that cases generally should be applied to appeals pending when <em>Booker </em>was decided, this holding should not be \u201cforced\u201d upon her. McCray concludes that we should remand her case for the district court to sentence her under the mandatory federal guidelines, as interpreted in <em>Blakely, </em>which will result in a sentence based upon only the conduct for which she was indicted and to which she plead guilty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">McCray properly preserved her <em>Blakely </em>claim in the district court by citing to <em>Blakely </em>in her supplemental objection to the PSI and at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that a defendant either must (1) refer to the Sixth Amendment; (2) <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or another related case; (3) assert the right to have the jury decide the disputed fact; or (4) raise a challenge to the role of the judge as factfinder to preserve a <em>Blakely /Booker </em>claim). Thus, we review it <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). Similarly, the preserved constitutional issues of whether McCray\u2019s due process rights were violated and whether her sentences were imposed in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause are questions of law that are reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Noel, </em>231 F.3d 833, 836 (11th Cir.2000) (due process claim); <em>United States v. Abraham, </em>386 F.3d 1033, 1037 (11th Cir. 2004) <em>(ex post facto </em>claim), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 16, 2005) (No. 04-9334).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">To the extent McCray is rearguing her due process and quasi-ea; <em>post facto </em>challenges to being sentenced pursuant to <em>Booker, </em>\u201c[t]he <em>ex post facto </em>clause prohibits the enactment of statutes which ... make more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission....\u201d <em>Abraham, </em>386 F.3d at 1037 (quotation omitted). \u201c[T]he following two elements must be present in order for a court to find an <em>ex post facto </em>violation: (1) the law must be retrospective, meaning it applies to events occurring before its enactment; and (2) the offender must be disadvantaged by it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Although the Ex Post Facto Clause forbids both legislative creation of new criminal liability and legislative increases in punishment after the event, it does not apply of its own force to changes worked by judicial decisions, such as <em>Booker. See Rogers v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>Tennessee, </em>532 U.S. 451, 460, 121 S.Ct. 1693, 1699, 149 L.Ed.2d 697 (2001). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court in <em>Rogers </em>clarified that the Due Process Clause encompasses the <em>ex post facto </em>principles of fair warning. <em>Id., </em>532 U.S. at 460-61, 121 5. Ct. at 1699-1700.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Applying this analysis to McCray\u2019s challenge on appeal, we begin with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Prior to McCray\u2019s sentencing, the Supreme Court revisited that rule in <em>Blakely, </em>in the context of Washington state\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, and clarified that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the </em>defendant.... In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at -, 124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original). Applying these principles, the Supreme Court held that Blakely\u2019s sentence \u2014 which was enhanced under the state guidelines based on the court\u2019s additional finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Blakely committed his kidnaping offense with deliberate cruelty\u2014 violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at -, 124 S.Ct. at 2534-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Although the <em>Blakely </em>Court explicitly remarked in a footnote that \u201c[t]he [fjederal [gjuidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them,\u201d <em>id. </em>at-n. 9, 124 S.Ct. at 2538 n. 9, the Supreme Court, again prior to McCray\u2019s sentencing hearing, decided in <em>Booker </em>that \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance [existed] between the [federal guidelines] and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d in <em>Blakely. Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 749. Resolving the constitutional question left open in <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court held in <em>Booker </em>that the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. In extending its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the federal guidelines, the Court explicitly reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">In a second and separate majority opinion, the Court in <em>Booker </em>also concluded that, to best preserve Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable guideline range) \u2014 thereby effectively rendering the federal guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 764. Thus, the guideline range is now advisory; it no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>longer dictates the final sentencing result but instead is an important sentencing factor that the sentencing court is to consider, along with the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 20, 2005) (No. 05-5467), we reviewed a defendant\u2019s similar argument that <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial provisions, if applied retroactively, would increase the sentence authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict and, therefore, constitute an <em>ex post facto </em>law in violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1306-07. Examining whether the <em>Booker </em>opinion would violate the due process principles of fair warning, we determined that, when the appellant committed the offense of conviction, \u201cthe recognized state of the law looked to the United States Code as establishing maximum sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307-08. We further explained that, before <em>Blakely </em>was decided, every federal court of appeals had held that <em>Apprendi </em>did not apply to guideline calculations made within a defendant\u2019s statutory maximum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1308. Thus, we concluded that the defendant, who was sentenced within his statutory range, had sufficient warning to satisfy the due process concerns articulated in <em>Rogers. Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">In the instant case, both McCray\u2019s plea agreement and the district court correctly advised her that her maximum statutory sentence was three years\u2019 imprisonment for each offense. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2) (setting three-year maximum statutory sentence for offense of preparing a false tax return). The court also advised McCray that her sentences could be imposed consecutively, resulting in a total sentence of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) (providing that sentences may run consecutively if multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time). Thus, similar to the appellant in <em>Duncan, </em>McCray had fair warning that she could receive up to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment for her offenses, and her due process rights were not violated when the court sentenced her to 1 year\u2019 and 1 day\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1306-08. Moreover, to the extent McCray has attempted to distinguish <em>Duncan </em>by arguing that the appellant in that case, who was sentenced before <em>Blakely, </em>did not reasonably rely on it, McCray, similar to the appellant in <em>Duncan, </em>committed the instant offenses from 1997 through 2000 \u2014 well before <em>Blakely </em>was decided. <em>See United States v. Bordon, </em>421 F.3d 1202, 1205 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the <em>ex post facto </em>clause \u201coperates not to protect an individual\u2019s right to less punishment, but rather as a means of assuring that an individual will receive fair warning of criminal statutes and the punishments they carry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">In addition, McCray has misconstrued the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely, </em>along with failing to show that she was disadvantaged by the district court\u2019s treatment of the federal guidelines as discretionary. As discussed above, the Supreme Court in <em>Blakely, </em>in the context of Washington state\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, determined that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d See Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at-, 124 S.Ct. at 2537. We, however, have determined that a factual stipulation is the equivalent of a jury finding on a fact because it takes the issues away from the jury. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325,1330 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that a sentence enhancement based on drug quantity did not violate <em>Booker </em>where the defendant did not dispute, and in fact conceded, the factual accuracy of his PSI).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Because McCray stipulated at sentencing that she was responsible for an amount of tax loss of between $120,000 and $200,000, the court did not err in relying on this fact in determining McCray\u2019s guideline range, Thus, even if the district court had not increased McCray\u2019s offense level by two levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2T1.4(b)(l)(B), based on the fact that McCray was in the business of preparing or assisting in the preparation of tax returns, McCray\u2019s total offense level would have been 13,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and her sentence of 1 year\u2019 and 1 day\u2019 imprisonment would have fallen within her resulting guideline range of 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. Moreover, in following Booker\u2019s remedial holding and treating the federal guidelines as advisory, the district court sentenced McCray below her resulting guideline range of 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\u2019s sentencing of McCray pursuant to <em>Booker </em>did not result in either a due process or an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. We, therefore, affirm McCray\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-14\">. The Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I, section 9 of the U.S. Constitution provides that \"[n]o <em>... ex post facto </em>Law shall be passed.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3; <em>see also United States v. Simmons, </em>368 F.3d 1335, 1338 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that the Ex Post Facto Clause \"prevents the [gjovernment from imposing additional penalties for crimes that have already been committed\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">. The PSI reflects that the 1998 Edition of federal guidelines was used to calculate McCray's offense level for conduct that occurred from 1997 through 2000 because, although district courts normally use the federal guidelines in effect on the date that a defendant is sentenced, the 1998 federal guidelines was more favorable to McCray than the current edition. <em>See Simmons, </em>368 F.3d at 1338 (holding that, \"although courts must presumptively apply the Guidelines as they exist at the time of sentencing, they may not do so where those Guidelines would lead to imposition of a harsher penalty than that to which the defendant was subject at the time of the offense. In such cases, the Guidelines applicable at the time of the offense must be applied\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b715-13\">. Alternatively, McCray argued that the court only should hold her responsible for a tax loss of $38, 740 \u2014 the tax loss resulting from the ten offenses to which she plead guilty \u2014 resulting in a base offense level of 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\">. In imposing McCray\u2019s sentence, the court again explained that it was acting \"with full understanding of the range of discretion [afforded] by virtue of the [Supreme Court\u2019s] decision in the <em>Booker </em>case.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AEx\">. Although the government has responded that McCray\u2019s guilty plea was free and voluntary, McCray has not challenged her plea on appeal. Thus, we deem any arguments on it abandoned. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1275 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that an argument not raised in an appellant\u2019s opening brief is deemed waived). Regardless, McCray\u2019s plea colloquy does not reflect that the court erred in accepting her plea. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>117 F.3d 471, 477 (11th Cir.1997) (explaining that \"a voluntary plea of guilty intelligently made in the light of the then applicable law does not become vulnerable because later judicial decisions indicate that the plea rested on a faulty premise\u201d (quotation omitted)). Indeed, when given the opportunity at sentencing to withdraw her plea, McCray declined it. <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (holding that a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, must show \"a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">.
