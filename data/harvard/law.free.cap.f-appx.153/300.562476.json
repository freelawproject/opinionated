The district court sentenced Pineda to 57 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Pineda\u2019s sole issue on appeal is a challenge to the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and the use of his prior conviction to increase his sentence. Pineda asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional because they are treated as sentencing factors rather than as elements of the offense. Pineda concedes that his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent and admits that he raises the argument merely to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">As Pineda concedes, his arguments are foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 253, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005); <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.2003). The Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d at 470 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
