He contends that he was sentenced in contravention of <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">Cervantes-Garcia\u2019s plea agreement contained an express waiver of his right to appeal on all grounds, except \u201c(a) any punishment imposed in excess of the statutory maximum; (b) any upward departure from the guideline range deemed most applicable by the sentencing court; (c) arithmetic errors in the guidelines calculations; and (d) a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that affects the validity of the waiver itself.\u201d Our review of the record indicates that the waiver was knowing and voluntary and that under its plain language, it bars review of Cervantes-Garcia\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005). Cervantes-Garcia\u2019s appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
