Reversible error exists in part: we vacate Defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-17\">Defendant was involved in a conspiracy with several others, including his brother, Terrel Morris (\u201cTerrel\u201d), to commit credit card fraud by breaking into lockers at Atlanta-area health clubs, taking credit cards and driver\u2019s licenses, and using the stolen cards to buy electronic equipment at retail stores. For example, the indictment stated that, on 31 December 2002, Defendant was involved in the theft of credit cards from a locker at a suburban Atlanta-area health club and the unauthorized charging of nearly $5,000 in goods at local stores. Codefendant Randy Hackler, who lived in Marietta, Georgia, would receive the merchandise and then sell it on eBay or ship it to other states for resale.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-18\">Defendant challenges his sentence enhancements for (1) relocating to another jurisdiction to evade law enforcement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(A) (2002); (2) engaging in an offense involving more than 10 but less than 50 victims, \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A); and (3) a loss amount between $70,000 and $120,000, \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">With sentencing issues, we review a district court\u2019s fact findings for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Auguste, </em>392 F.3d 1266, 1267 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In fraud offenses, the guidelines authorize a two-level enhancement if \u201cthe defendant <em>relocated, </em>or <em>participated in relocating, </em>a fraudulent scheme to another jurisdiction to evade law enforcement or regulatory officials.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(A) (emphasis added). Defendant argues that his conduct could not be described as \u201crelocating\u201d: at best, his conduct showed that he operated in multiple locations but always sold the merchandise to Hackler, who remained in the same location.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government responds that it presented sufficient evidence that Defendant engaged in overt fraudulent acts outside the Northern District of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The guidelines and commentary do not define the term \u201crelocate\u201d: we must give that term its \u201cordinary meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Digiorgio, </em>193 F.3d 1175, 1178 (11th Cir.1999). To \u201crelocate\u201d means to \u201cestablish or lay out in a new place.\u201d Webster\u2019s 3d New Int\u2019l Unabridged Dictionary 1919 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">At sentencing, the government produced the testimony of codefendant Lamar Turner, who stated that sometimes Defendant or Terrel would go out of town with Turner to engage in credit card fraud. Turner would steal the cards while the other person bought the electronics. Several times Defendant traveled with Turner to Albany, Georgia \u2014 in the Middle District of Georgia \u2014 to perpetrate the fraudulent conduct. Sometimes Terrel\u2019s girlfriend would rent an SUV for these trips so that they could transport more merchandise. Turner testified that Defendant and Terrel recruited others who also made similar out-of-town trips. And Turner stated that, as part of the conspiracy, he visited the Carolinas, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Ohio, and Arkansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">The government presented evidence that Defendant left the Northern District of Georgia on occasion to perpetrate the offense conduct. But the government presented no evidence that Defendant or any member of the conspiracy tried to \u201crelocate\u201d the scheme to another jurisdiction, under the ordinary meaning of that word. The evidence about the rental cars suggests that the out-of-town trips were meant to be temporary and that Defendant always returned to the Northern District of Georgia. Also, one stage of the conspiracy was to deliver the goods to Hackler\u2019s home, located in the Northern District of Georgia, to allow Hackler to sell the merchandise. The evidence does not show that Hackler\u2019s residence changed. And while Turner testified that Defendant recruited others who also made similar out-of-town trips in other jurisdictions, the addition of co-conspirators implies an expansion, and not a relocation, of the conspiracy. In sum, the trips of Morris and his co-conspirators outside of the jurisdiction do not suggest \u201crelocation\u201d: the district court erred in applying the enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ment under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The district court, however, did not clearly err in enhancing Defendant\u2019s sentence enhancements for an offense involving more than 10 but less than 50 victims, under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A)(i). A victim is any person \u2014 including individuals, corporations, and companies \u2014 \u201cwho sustained any part of the actual loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(ii)). Turner\u2019s testimony suggested that Defendant had engaged in this sort of credit card scheme over a number of years, beginning in the late 1980s, and that Defendant and Terrel made between $10,000 and $15,000 on the more recent out-of-town trips. And Turner, a co-conspirator who worked with Defendant, admitted to being responsible for $200,000 in fraud losses. Also, Hackler made nearly $500,000 in sales of electronic equipment on eBay from 1998 until 2002. The presentence investigation report listed only one victim: a credit card issuer. But based on the evidence of the duration of Defendant\u2019s acts, the amount of money he, Terrel, and Turner made, and the amount of loss Turner admitted to causing, the district court committed no clear error in determining that the fraud conspiracy caused loss to more than ten victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Similarly, the district court did not clearly err in attributing to Defendant a loss amount between $70,000 and $120,000, under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(E). We note that the government did not provide explicit evidence of loss. But it is not unreasonable to assume that the loss that Defendant caused was comparable to the $200,000 loss caused by Turner. Defendant\u2019s involvement in the 31December theft of credit cards, which resulted in the unauthorized charging of nearly $5,000 in goods, was only one occasion in which Defendant was involved. The out-of-town trips resulted in between $10,000 and $15,000 in loss. And the evidence suggested that Turner and Defendant operated together in the same type of scheme for at least a few years. The district court\u2019s determination attributing to Defendant more than $70,000 but less than $120,000 in loss was reasonable and not impermissibly speculative. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>188 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir.1999) (because \u201coften the amount of loss caused by fraud is difficult to determine accurately\u201d, courts may make a reasonable estimate of loss); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>993 F.2d 214, 218 (11th Cir.1993) (district court must not speculate about the existence of a fact that would permit a more severe sentence under the guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">In sum, the district court committed no clear error in its enhancements for number of victims and loss. But, under the facts of this case, the district court erred in applying an enhancement for relocating to another jurisdiction to evade law enforcement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">. We reject Defendant\u2019s argument that this enhancement only was aimed at telemarketers. The Sentencing Commission noted that this enhancement addresses conduct that \"often relates to telemarketing fraud, although the conduct also may occur in connection with fraudulent schemes perpetrated by other means.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 577; <em>see United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 761 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\">. We thus need not decide Defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence did not show that the purpose of the out-of-town trips was to \u201cevade\u201d law enforcement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(8)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">. Defendant also challenges his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because the court, not a jury, made fact findings that increased his sentence. Defendant did not raise this issue below: we normally would review it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1186 (11th Cir.2005). But in the light of our decision to remand for resentencing, we do not address Defendant\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>argument. On remand, the district court may entertain this argument and should sentence Defendant consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
