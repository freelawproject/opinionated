Because Brandon preserved this issue by objecting under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to being sentenced as a career offender, review is de novo. <em>See United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003) (reviewing <em>Apprendi </em>claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2005) (requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable guideline range), and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its prior holding in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. This court has held that the application of the career offender enhancement falls within the exception for prior convictions where the facts are undisputed, making it unnecessary for the district court to engage in further fact finding about a prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005); <em>see also Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (holding that a court\u2019s inquiry as to disputed facts in connection with a prior conviction is limited to the terms of the charging document, a plea agreement, a transcript of the plea colloquy, or a compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>rabie judicial record). Accordingly, Brandon\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Moreover, we reject Brandon\u2019s contention that under <em>Booker, </em>the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by making impermissible factual findings in determining his criminal history category. In <em>Shepard, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that the prior conviction exception survived <em>Booker, </em>but held the Sixth Amendment protections apply to \u201ca disputed fact ... about a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1262. However, instead of challenging the accuracy or the \u201cfact\u201d of his prior convictions, Brandon asserts that the increase required more than just judicial notice of the \u201cfact\u201d of the prior convictions because the district court had to consider the type of conviction and whether it qualified as a violent felony, the length and type of sentence imposed, and recency of the prior convictions in relation to the instant offense. We find however, that the district court only had to take judicial notice that Brandon had been convicted and when the conviction occurred, both facts that are a matter of public record and require no interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court\u2019s recognition of the existence of Brandon\u2019s prior convictions and assessment of the timing of those convictions was not in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. <em>Id.; United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834 (4th Cir.2005). We therefore affirm Brandon\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-17\"> <em>See United States v.
