He was sentenced to 33 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-29\">For the first time on appeal, Mendez contends that he was illegally sentenced pursuant to the formerly mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Mendez\u2019s plea agreement contained a waiver-of-appeal provision in which he waived, inter alia, \u201cthe right to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined,\u201d except for a sentence above the statutory maximum or an upward departure from the applicable Guidelines range. Mendez contends that this waiver provision is not enforceable because, at his rearraignment, the magistrate judge incorrectly told him that he retained the right to appeal an \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d We agree. Because the magistrate judge inaccurately described the waiver provision, Mendez\u2019s waiver cannot be deemed knowing and voluntary with respect to an \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. ll(b)(l)(N); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Mendez contends that this court should review his <em>Booker </em>claim de novo and apply a harmless error standard. However, he concedes that these arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005), and that he must show plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">The district court\u2019s application of the guidelines in their mandatory form constituted error that is \u201cplain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520-21. However, as Mendez correctly concedes, he cannot establish that the error \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings[,]\u201d i.e., \u201cthat the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Alternatively, Mendez contends that the district court\u2019s error, sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines regime, was structural and that prejudice should be presumed. Mendez correctly concedes that this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005). Accordingly, Mendez has not satisfied the requirements under the plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Mendez also asserts, for the first time on appeal, that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. As Mendez concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which this court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">The conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b943-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
