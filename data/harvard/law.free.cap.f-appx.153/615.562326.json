In support of her argument, Mangra highlights her testimony about threats she and her husband received from members of the People\u2019s National Congress (\u201cPNC\u201d), her persecution based on her race (Indo-Guyanese), and her support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>of the People\u2019s Progressive Party (\u201cPPP\u201d). The IJ found that Mangra\u2019s credibility was \u201ccalled into serious question in these proceedings\u201d based on her admittedly false testimony to an immigration officer on two prior occasions and held that even if credible, Mangra did not demonstrate eligibility for INA or CAT relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s order without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the IJ\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). However, we examine factual findings, including determinations of credibility, under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under the substantial evidence test, we will \u201caffirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (withholding of removal claim). That evidence in the record may also support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir. 2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2245,161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). To reverse the IJ\u2019s decision, the record must <em>compel </em>a contrary conclusion. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). To qualify for asylum, the alien must be a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to her home country or to avail herself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution may be established based on (1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d and by overcoming any rebuttal by the INS; (2) a reasonable possibility of personal persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>within the subject country; or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is a part. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The petitioner\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution must be on account of, or because of, one of the statutorily listed factors, such as her political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The petitioner must establish this causal connection by \u201cpresenting specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of such an opinion.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Moreover, we held that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">An adverse credibility determination alone may be fatal to an asylum application. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Before addressing whether substantial evidence supports an adverse credibility determination, we first must determine whether the IJ even made an adverse credibility determination. <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. If the IJ makes an adverse credibility finding, then the IJ must provide specific, cogent reasons for doing so or the finding must be based on substantial evidence. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (citation omitted). An adverse credibility finding must go to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim and not be based on minor inconsistencies or omissions. <em>See Chebchoub v. I.N.S., </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). After an adverse credibility finding is made, the applicant bears the burden of showing this decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. We will affirm a properly supported IJ\u2019s decision because we \u201cmay not substitute [our] judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Here, the IJ\u2019s decision is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence and we are not compelled to reverse. Specifically, as found by the IJ, Mangra lied on two previous occasions about her husband being killed by PNC members, she gave inconsistent testimony, and embellished her claims of threats to her and her family. These discrepancies go to the heart of Mangra\u2019s claim of persecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On this record, Mangra has not met her burden to show the IJ\u2019s decision, including its credibility determination, was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Accordingly, we deny her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-18\">. We review only the denial of asylum under the INA. In her order, the IJ also denied relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d) and withholding of removal under the INA. However, because we find that Mangra has not established a case for asylum, we decline to address her arguments that she satisfied the higher standards for withholding of removal under the INA or the CAT. See <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir. 2005) (where an applicant fails to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, her other claims for withholding of removal under the INA or under CAT generally fail).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\">. Mangra\u2019s petition comes to this Court after the passage of the REAL ID Act, Pub. L. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231 (2005). Section 101(a)(3) of Title I of the REAL ID Act contains new standards governing asylum and withholding-of-removal credibility determinations. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 101(a)(3) &amp; (c). These standards are only applicable, however, to applications \"made on or after\u201d May 11, 2005 (the date of enactment). <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 101(h)(2). Mangra\u2019s application was filed prior to May 11, 2005 and, accordingly, the new standards for credibility determinations do not apply to this case. <em>Cf. Olujoke v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 16, 22 n. 4 (1st Cir.2005) (acknowledging that the REAL ID Act contained new standards for reviewing credibility determinations, but determining that these standards were not applicable to an application for asylum that was filed before the enactment of the REAL ID Act); <em>see also Chen v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 707, 709 (7th Cir.2005) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-7\">. We also observe that evidence in the record supported the possibility of reasonable relocation within Guyana, dispelling Mangra\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear of persecution. We have approved of a \"country-wide requirement\u201d in which a refugee must first pursue an \"internal resettlement alternative\u201d in his own country, or establish that this is not possible, before seeking asylum here. <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1326-27 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
