Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applying its holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Blakely </em>reaffirmed the rule that \u201c \u2018[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2536 (quoting <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-17\">Salinas argues that his sentence violates <em>Booker </em>because the court judicially determined the amount of drugs for which he was responsible and upon which his sentence was based. The district court\u2019s enhancement of Salinas\u2019s sentence based on its factual determination, other than the fact of a prior conviction, was error under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-18\">Because Salinas preserved this objection in the district court, <em>see United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376 (5th Cir.2005), review is for harmless error. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005). The Government bears the burden of establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error was harmless. <em>See id. </em>The Government has not met this burden. Thus, we need not reach Salinas\u2019s assertion of Fanfan error.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-19\">Salinas also argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi </em>because the statute\u2019s structure treats drug types and quantities as sentencing factors. Salinas concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir. 2000), but he raises the issue in order to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. Accordingly, Salinas\u2019s conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>is AFFIRMED, but we VACATE Salinas\u2019s sentence, and REMAND for resentencing in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b962-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
