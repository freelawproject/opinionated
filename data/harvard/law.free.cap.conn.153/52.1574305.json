The plaintiff, riding as a passenger in a car which he owned, was injured, and the defendant\u2019s decedent, who was driving the car, was killed, when the car veered off the road into a bridge abutment. The suit, seeking recovery for the injuries which the plaintiff received, was instituted against the defendant in her capacity as temporary administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate. The complaint alleged and the parties stipulated that written notice of the claim for damages was given to the defendant, as temporary administratrix, prior to the service of the complaint. It is not alleged, nor does it appear, that letters of administration have been granted on the estate as provided by \u00a7 45-195 of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The trial court directed a verdict for the defendant and denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict. It is from the judgment rendered on the latter motion that this appeal is taken. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 605, 600; <em>Felix </em>v. <em>Hall-Brooke Sanitarium, </em>140 Conn. 496, 498, 101 A.2d 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The memorandum of decision on the motion to set aside the verdict indicates that the court directed a verdict because the plaintiff failed to establish negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s decedent and because this action cannot be maintained against a temporary administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The appointment of a temporary administrator is authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 45-197.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>powers and duties of a temporary administrator are set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 45-198.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have not previously had occasion to interpret these two statutes or determine the limits of the authority of a temporary administrator in the circumstances presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Since the tort which is the subject of the suit is alleged to have been committed in Massachusetts, the law of that state created such right as the plaintiff may have, but the law of Connecticut where the suit is brought determines the remedy. <em>Ormsby </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>290 U.S. 387, 388, 54 S. Ct. 211, 78 L. Ed. 378; <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Ahern, </em>107 Conn. 174, 176, 139 A. 691; see <em>Bohenek </em>v. <em>Niedswiecki, </em>142 Conn. 278, 283, 113 A.2d 509. The basic question before us is whether this plaintiff may bind the estate of the decedent by notice of a claim to, and suit against, a tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>rary administratrix of the tort-feasor\u2019s estate appointed pursuant to the authority of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45-197 and 45-198, or whether such notice of claim must be given to, and suit brought against, an administrator who has been granted general letters of administration pursuant to \u00a7 45-195.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Our general law governing the process of administration of the estates of deceased persons is contained in chapters 786 through 796 of the General Statutes. The statutes included within these chapters provide a logical and definite procedure whereby the property of a decedent is taken into the custody of the law by placing it in the hands of an exechtor or administrator who, under the control and supervision of the Probate Court, inventories and marshals the assets, receives claims within such period of time as the court may fix, pays the expenses of administration, inheritance taxes and claims and ultimately distributes the remainder to those entitled thereto. 2 Locke &amp; Kohn, Conn. Probate Practice \u00a7 261. Consequently, in construing the relevant statutes, we must not only consider them in the light of their history, their language, the purpose they were designed to serve and the circumstances surrounding their enactment but, in determining their purpose and scope, make every part operative and harmonious with every other part so far as is possible. <em>Feldman </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>138 Conn. 724, 727, 89 A.2d 210. \u201cWe are called upon to look beyond the literal meaning of the words to the history of the law, its language, considered in all its parts, the mischief the law was designed to remedy, and the policy underlying it. <em>Giammattei </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>135 Conn. 666, 668, 68 A.2d 129. We must look, also, to the basic policy as disclosed by pre-existing legislation and the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>stances which brought about the enactment of the law under consideration. <em>Cedar Island Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Clinton Electric Light &amp; Power Co., </em>142 Conn. 359, 364, 114 A.2d 535.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>145 Conn. 355, 358, 143 A.2d 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The language of General Statutes 45-197 and 45-198 is clear and specific. These sections contain restrictions and qualifications implicit in the statutory designation of \u201ctemporary administrator\u201d not contained in \u00a7 45-195, which concerns the general administration of estates. Unlike the administrator of an estate appointed with general letters of administration pursuant to \u00a7 45-195, a temporary administrator may be appointed without notice. He may be appointed only if the Probate Court finds that \u201cthe granting of administration on . . . [the estate of a deceased person] or the probating of the will of such deceased . . . will be delayed, or that it is necessary for the protection of the estate of such deceased ... to hold and preserve the estate until the appointment of an administrator or . . . the probating of the will.\u201d Implicit in this language is the concept that the temporary appointee is a mere custodian for the preservation of assets \u201cuntil the appointment of an administrator.\u201d This interpretation is strengthened by the further provision that, if the Probate Court deems it more expedient, it may order any deputy sheriff or constable to take possession of the estate until the appointment of an administrator, executor or trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">When an administrator is appointed, legal title to the personal property of the decedent vests in him. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Skelly, </em>138 Conn. 376, 379, 85 A.2d 251; <em>Blodgett </em>v. <em>Bridgeport City Trust Co., </em>115 Conn. 127, 144, 161 A. 83. A temporary administrator, on the other hand, is only authorized by the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>to take possession \u201cto hold and preserve the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The temporary appointee is given but limited powers, all consistent with a temporary and emergency authority to protect and preserve the assets of the estate, but not extending beyond that. Thus, he may be authorized by the court to sell personal property perishable in nature, to complete fabrication of goods or materials in an unfinished state, or to continue any business \u201cso far as may be necessary for the preservation of the same.\u201d He is authorized to take possession of the estate\u2019s assets, collect debts and rents \u201cand do such further acts necessary for the preservation of . . . [the] estate as the court authorizes and approves.\u201d Significantly, there is no statutory authority for the temporary appointee to receive or pay claims or perform most of the multitudinous obligations of a general administrator of an estate. His only function is to hold and preserve the assets of the estate in either of the two circumstances set out in the statute and then \u201c[u]pon the appointment and qualification of the administrator\u201d exhibit to the court an account of his trust and \u201cdeliver to the administrator, executor or administrator with the will annexed all of the estate of . . . [the] deceased remaining in his hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 45-197 and 45-198 confirms a conclusion that the office of temporary administrator is distinct from that of the administrator of an estate to whom letters of administration are granted under \u00a7 45-195. It serves a limited purpose in an emergency. The term \u201ctemporary administrator\u201d first appears in the 1911 Public Acts when \u201cAn Act concerning Temporary Administrators of Estates of Deceased Persons\u201d was enacted. Public Acts 1911, c. 168. This act refers to the tern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>porary appointee as \u201ca special or temporary administrator\u201d and contains all of the provisions presently contained in \u00a7\u00a7 45-197 and 45-198 of the General Statutes. The 1911 act was incorporated into the 1918 Revision of the statutes in \u00a7\u00a7 4973, 4974 and 4975 with no material change except that the words \u201cspecial or\u201d were deleted. In the 1930 Revision, these three sections along with \u00a7 5026 of the 1918 Revision, which provided for the temporary appointment of \u201cany proper officer\u201d to preserve the assets of the estate of decedents or insolvent debtors pending the granting of administration or appointment of the trustee of the estate of an insolvent debtor, were consolidated into \u00a7\u00a7 4906 and 4907. These consolidated statutes are now General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45-197 and 45-198.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">It is significant that, when the General Assembly in 1911 first provided for the office of special or temporary administrator with limited custodial powers, there existed in the 1902 Revision in substantially their present form the statutes for the appointment of administrators (\u00a7 318), the presentation of claims to them (\u00a7 326) and the prohibition against the commencement of any suit against an administrator within the period allowed for the presentation of claims unless the administrator had given notice of disallowance of the claim. \u00a7 329. This latter statute is now General Statutes \u00a745-210 and, as amended by Public Acts 1959, No. 219, excludes from the limited prohibition against suit claims founded on tort provided that on such claims written notice shall be given to \u201cthe executor or administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Considering the language of the statutes, the general statutory scheme for the settlement of the estates of deceased persons, the long-established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>provisions for the appointment of administrators with the broad powers of administration pertaining to that office as contrasted with the limited powers granted to temporary administrators which are custodial in nature and to be exercised only \u201cuntil the appointment of an administrator,\u201d we conclude that such a temporary appointee is not the representative of the estate against whom an action may be brought to adjudicate a claim which existed against the decedent at the time of his death or to whom, when such claim is founded in tort, notice must be given prior to suit to comply with the provisions of the 1959 amendment to \u00a7 45-210.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">While similar statutory provisions for temporary appointees in other jurisdictions vary materially in language, our conclusion is in accord with the weight of authority that temporary administrators are not general representatives of the estate but emergency officers with but limited custodial duties and authority to care for and preserve the estate until an executor or general administrator is ascertained or appointed as its proper legal representative.

App.219, 222, 73 S.E. 519; <em>Vaught </em>v. <em>Struble, </em>65 Idaho 26, 33, 139 P.2d 456; <em>Szydelko </em>v. <em>Smith\u2019s Estate, </em>259 Mich. 519, 522, 244 N.W. 148; <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>72 Minn. 441, 442, 75 N.W. 699; <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Mercantile Trust Co., </em>296 Mo. 561, 591, 247 S.W. 396; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>91 N.H. 161, 163, 15 A.2d 866; <em>Higbee </em>v. <em>Schwarts, </em>185 Misc. 28, 31, 56 N.Y.S.2d 150; <em>Tolivar </em>v. <em>Lombardo, </em>88 S.W.2d 733 (Tex.

Jur., Executors and Administrators, \u00a7 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">A verdict may be directed where the decisive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>question is one of law. <em>Sedita </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>105 Conn. 1, 5, 134 A. 243; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>100 Conn. 274, 278, 123 A. 435; <em>McVeigh </em>v. <em>Ripley, </em>77 Conn. 136, 142, 58 A. 701; see <em>H. Wales Lines Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford City Gas Light Co., </em>89 Conn. 117, 127, 93 A. 129.
