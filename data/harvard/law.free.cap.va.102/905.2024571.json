V. C., sec. 437; Acts 1902-\u20193-\u20194, p. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">While the provision for more frequent assessments of that species of property is doubtless due to the circumstance that mineral lands are at present in process of development, and rapidly enhancing in value, there is nothing in the enactment calling for a construction which would result in the establishment of one period of the tax year for ascertaining the ownership and value of mineral property, and a different period for determining the same facts with respect to other property. Such an interpretation could serve no wise purpose, but would tend to introduce elements of uncertainty and inequality into a system, which, according to the spirit of the Constitution, should be homogenious and uniform. In some instances, the construction adopted by the commissioner and approved by the court would leave the question as to whether one person or another should be chargeable with taxes on property for any particular year to the caprice of the commissioner. Thus, where land had changed ownership between February 1 and August 1, 1903 (May 1, in subsequent years), the commissioner could impose the burden on the vendor or vendee at his election.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Again, in the case at bar, it was the duty of the commissioner to assess the cash in the hands of appellant on February 1, 1903, Subsequently that same money was expended in improving appellant\u2019s mineral land, and on July 25, thq commissioner assessed the improvements also. Unless the language of the act is imperative, a construction leading to such results ought not to-be adopted. According to the uniform interpretation placed upon the revenue laws of this State, February 1, the day which separates one tax year from another, has been fixed upon as the time for ascertaining the ownership and value of property for taxation, and a departure from that rule can only result in confusion and inconvenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">The order appealed from is, therefore, erroneous, and must be reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings to be had therein, in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
