Should any difference of opinion occur between my said executors or trustees as to the holding and retaining or reinvesting of property or securities, or otherwise, in the discharge of their duties, then, so long as there shall be three of them acting, the decision of two of them shall he conclusive; and, in the event there be <em>only two </em>of <em>them acting, </em>then the opinion of Henry 0. Norris shall prevail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Codicil.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">\u201cI, H. D. B. Norris, of Marshall, Fauquier county, Virginia, do make this my codicil to my will, dated the 25th day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>November, 1893, and I hereby expressly confirm my said will, excepting so far as the disposition of my property is changed by this codicil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\"><em>\u201cI </em>desire that my dear friend, Alexander <em>J. </em>Morrison, of London, England, in whose judgment and sense of justice I have full confidence, shall make settlement of all matters of business between my estate and my son-in-law, W. H. Saunders, both as to our personal accounts and the real estate business of W. H. Saunders <em>&amp; </em>Co., in the manner following: I do not desire any public appraisement of the business or the property owned by the said firm, but it is my will that our personal accounts, and the accounts of the said firm, be submitted to the executors of my will, and that they furnish Mr. Morrison with such statements and information as may be necessary to a settlement as aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">\u201cI direct, also, that my said son-in-law shall have such time as he may desire to make payment of any money that may be due my estate by him at the time of my death, such time not to exceed five years after my decease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">\u201cIf my said son-in-law do not concur in the aforesaid manner of settlement between him and my estate, or if my said friend, Alexander J. Morrison, be not living at the time of my death, then I direct that my executors make settlement with my son-in-law as to said private and firm accounts relying on their discretion and fairness to all concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">It is conceded that there were grandchildren of the testator living at the commencement of this litigation, who are yet living, and who are not parties to the proceeding. The issue as to the validity of the will is distinctly made by the pleadings ; and the question, whether or not the grandchilren have an interest in the subject matter of the litigation, and, if so, the extent of their interest, depends upon the determination of that question. This being the case, it is plain that the rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>grandchildren are directly involved in the controversy, and must he affected by any decree that may be pronounced. They are, therefore, indispensable parties to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The principle is fundamental, and lies at the foundation of the administration of justice; that every person whose interests are immediately involved in a cause must be made a party and afforded an opportunity to assert or defend his rights. Calvert on Parties to Suits in Equity, p. 2, upon a review of the authorities, concluded that \u201call persons having an interest in the object of the suit\u201d are necessary parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">In 1 Daniel\u2019s Chy. Pr., p. 244, the rule is stated thus: \u201cA person may be affected by the demands of the plaintiff in a suit either immediately or consequently. Where an individual is in the actual enjoyment of the subject matter, or has an interest in it, either in possession or expectancy, which is likely either to be defeated or diminished by the plaintiff\u2019s claim, in such case he has an immediate interest in resisting the demand, and all persons who have such immediate interests are necessary parties to the suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">And Mr. Barton says: \u201cIt is a general rule in equity that all persons interested in the subject matter of the bill, and which is involved in and to be affected by the proceedings and result of the suit, should be made parties, however numerous they may be.\u201d 1 Bar. Chy. Pr. (2nd Ed.), p. 141, and authorities cited. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Barraud, ante, </em>p. 324, 46 S. E. 318; <em>Loyd </em>v. <em>Loyd\u2019s Exor., ante, </em>p. 519, 46 S. E. 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">It follows from these views that the Circuit Court erred in passing the decree appealed from, in a suit to which the grandchildren of the testator were not parties; and, for that error, the decree must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings to be had therein in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
