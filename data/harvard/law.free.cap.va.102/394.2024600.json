A brief statement of the circumstances and uncontroverted facts bearing upon the casualty will show the utter groundlessness of plaintiff\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">At the time of the accident a freight train of the defendant, consisting of three box ears, attached to the rear end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>train\u2014thirteen flat cars and an engine\u2014was being propelled along Crawford street. As the train was passing a \u201cbaby stand,\u201d around which a crowd had assembled, the plaintiff ran ont from the throng, and attempted to catch hold of a cuff or socket (intended to receive a stanchion) on the hindermost flat car, when he slipped and fell between the two rear trucks, one of the wheels of which passed over his leg and inflicted the injury complained of. Fisher, the only witness for the plaintiff who saw the accident, was standing within ten yards of him when he fell. His attention was first directed to plaintiff by observing his arm raised and seeing him fall underneath the car. Witness ran to him at once, and plaintiff drew up the injured leg, and was in the act of stretching out the other leg, when he was drawn from between the wheels. While Fisher\u2019s testimony is not very clear, and differs from that of other witnesses in that he expressed the opinion that plaintiff was not attempting to jump on the car when he fell, it involves no question of veracity between them. Considered in the light of other evidence bearing directly upon the accident, it would seem that Fisher observed the plaintiff for the first time after he had failed to grasp the cuff on the flat car, and was in the act of falling. However that may be, his statement that he did not think plaintiff was endeavoring to jump on the car, which was but the expression of an opinion, is opposed to the allegation of the amended declaration, the oft-repeated admissions of the plaintiff, and to all the other evidence in the case upon that point. But, if his version of the occurrence were accepted, it would not affect the result, because, while it tends to exonerate the plaintiff from willful misconduct, it in no wise imputes negligence to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The only member of the train\u2019s crew who saw the accident was a switchman and brakeman, who was standing on the top of the middle box car. He testified that a number of boys were attempting to get on the train, and that, while a policeman was trying to keep them off on one side, he was similarly engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>on the other. He saw the plaintiff jump and attempt to clutch the cuff or socket on the flat car, when he lost his hold and fell. He also saw some one seize him, and immediately signal the engineer, but failed to' attract his attention. The occurrence was instantaneous, and, after plaintiff\u2019s danger became known to the brakeman, it was impossible for him to have averted the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">It was likewise in evidence that the plaintiff was an intelligent boy; that he lived on a street along which the railroad was located, and was accustomed to trains, and knew of the danger he incurred in attempting to ride on them. He had received repeated warning on the subject, and been punished for disregarding them. A year or two prior to the accident one of the yard conductors, who lived next door to plaintiff, remonstrated with him about riding on these trains, and several days after the accident plaintiff remarked to the physician who attended him that he would not have been hurt if he had heeded the conductor\u2019s advice. He had been ordered off another train of the defendant by a policeman and by one of his own witnesses not more than half an hour before the accident, notwithstanding these reiterated admonitions, while the train in question was passing, he endeavored to persuade one of his playmates to go with him and ride on the cars, and, despite the refusal and expostulation of his friend, made the attempt which terminated so disastrously.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">It cannot be affirmed of the plaintiff that he did not possess sufficient knowledge and discretion to understand the nature of his act and the peril he was encountering. But the case does not depend upon the capacity or incapacity of the plaintiff to commit negligence. The primary question is, has the defendant been guilty of negligence ? And that question, upon the evidence, admits of but one answer. To sustain the verdict of\u2019the jury in this case would present the anomaly of subjecting a defendant wholly free from fault to the payment of damages by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>way of compensation for an injury to a plaintiff which was the direct result of his own gross negligence and misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">It was suggested that the defendant was negligent with respect to the length and speed of the train, and in failing to ring the hell. Of that contention, it is sufficient to observe that no such grounds of negligence are alleged in the declaration, and, if alleged and proved, there would have been no causal connection whateyer between them and the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">For these reasons the lower court erred in overruling the motion of the defendant to set aside the verdict, and for that error its judgment must he reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
