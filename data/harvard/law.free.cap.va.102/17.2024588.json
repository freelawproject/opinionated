In respect -to these contentions, it is sufficient to remark: Of the first, that the requirement referred to has no application where, as in this case, the branch' road or lateral work does not exceed five miles in length; and of the second, that it is not sustained by the evidence. The controlling question in the case involves the power of the Southern Bailway Company to condemn the land in controversy for the purpose indicated. The contention of plaintiff in error in that regard is that the object of the proceeding was to build a spur track to a private enterprise, Manor Mills, whose output the Bailway Company already handled, for the sole benefit and convenience of the owners of that property. In other words, that is was an attempt on the part of the Bailway Company to condemn private property for private use, and was, therefore, without sanction of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">While the agreement between the Bailway Company and the Mill Company justifies the conclusion that the primary object in constructing the spur track was to reach that industry, it also appears that it was for the use of the Bailway Company and third parties (the public, who might choose to patronize the Bailway Company) as well. The circumstance that the Mill Company agreed, in the first instance, to contribute a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>amount to the cost of constructing the track, does not affect the legal aspect of the case. The contract stipulated that the sum so advanced was to he returned by the Railway Company, which was to become the absolute owner of the property. So that the transaction, in legal effect, amounted merely to a loan by the Mill Company to the Railway Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The authorities practically speak with one voice to the effect, that if the use to be subserved is a public use, the fact that the branch road enures to the advantage of a particular individual, or class of individuals, will not render the use any the less public.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Indeed, it is a matter of common observation, that the possibility of reaching industrial enterprises along the proposed route of a railway is a legitimate and important factor in determining the question of location.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Lewis, in his work on Eminent Domain, at see. 165, says: \u201c\u2018Public use\u2019 means the same'as \u2018use by the public.\u2019\u201d The test whether a use is public or not may be determined by the fact that, where the use is public a trust attaches to the subject condemned for the benefit of the public, of the enjoyment of which it cannot be deprived by the company without a reasonable excuse. And by the further fact that the State retains the power to regulate and control the franchises of the company, and to prescribe the amount of charges and tolls which it shall be lawful for the company to exact for the transportation of passengers and freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">The Legislature has expressly delegated to railway companies the power of eminent domain. In the exercise of that power, they represent the sovereignty of the State, and decide, within certain limitations, what and how much land of the citizen they will condemn for their purposes. Within those limitations, their discretion is practically absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">It is competent for the Courts to supervise the exercise of the power delegated, but they cannot invade the bounds set by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Legislature; and will not undertake to control the discretion of the companies in taking property for their use, unless there has been a very clear abuse of power. <em>St. Louis R. Co. </em>v. <em>Petty </em>(Ark.), 20 L. R. A. 434, 21 S. W. 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In that case the Supreme Court of Arkansas, speaking through Cockrill, C. J., says: \u201cThe appellee argues that the proof shows that the railway\u2019s proceeding to condemn is prosecuted, not for its own use, but for the use and benefit of the Western Coal &amp; Mining Company\u2014a corporation which owns and operates a coal mine near the appellant\u2019s line of railway. The managers of the railway were probably instigated by the Coal Company to institute the condemnation proceeding, and they doubtless intended that the Coal Company should derive a benefit therefrom. But those facts alone do not furnish a legal reason sufficient to warrant judicial interference with the power delegated to the corporation by the Legislature. If the land is needed for legitimate railroad purposes, the motive which influenced the railway managers in undertaking the work will not take from it its public character. A proposed public user will not be enjoined by the courts upon the ground that it will further private interests.\u201d . . . \u201cTo be public, the user must concern the public. If it is an aid in facilitating the business for which the public agency is authorized to exercise the power to condemn, or if the public may enjoy the use of it, not by permission, but of right, its character is public. When once the character of the use is found to be public, the court\u2019s enquiry ends, and the legislative policy is left supreme, although it appears that private ends will be advanced by the public user.\u201d The language of the learned judge in that case is peculiarly applicable to the facts in the case under consideration; and the doctrine there laid down finds distinct expression in numerous decisions cited in the opinion and in an exhaustive note to the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The annotators, in referring to the cases of <em>Kyle </em>v. <em>Texas &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>N. O. R. R. Co. </em>(Tex. App.), 4 L. R. A. 275, and <em>Pittsburg W. &amp; K. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Bentwood Iron Works, </em>31 W. Va. 710, 8 S. E. 453; 2 L. R. A. 680, relied on by plaintiff in error as sustaining a contrary doctrine, observe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cThese two cases are plainly in direct conflict with the cases cited in the former part of this note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cIndeed the court, in <em>Kyle </em>v. <em>Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co., supra, </em>expressly adopted the views expressed in a dissenting opinion delivered by Judge Trunkey in Getz\u2019s App. <em>supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The reports abound with decisions to the effect that a railway built for the purpose of reaching an industrial enterprise is for a public use, and the company is entitled to exercise the power of eminent domain in acquiring property necessary for its construction, provided the general public has the right to use it. Chicago &amp; N. W. R. Co. (Wis.), 56 L. R. A. 240, and cases cited in opinion and notes; 2 Min. Inst (4th Ed.) 25; 1 Wood Ry. Law, pp. 648-653.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">As remarked, the question of the necessity, propriety, or expediency of resorting to the exercise of the power of eminent domain, in the absence of constitutional provision to the contrary, is a legislative and not a judicial question. <em>Alex. &amp;c. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Alex. &amp; W. R. Co., </em>75 Va. 780, 40 Am. Rep. 743; <em>Roanoke </em>v. <em>Berkowitz, </em>80 Va. 616; <em>Tait </em>v. <em>Central Lunatic Asylum, </em>84 Va. 271, 4 S. E. 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">In a very recent case, this court had occasion to observe that the visitorial powers of a court over a private corporation do not authorize the substitution of its business judgment for that of the corporation. <em>Roanoke Cemetery Co. </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>101 Va. 605, 44 S. E. 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">It is plain from the authorities that the order complained of is without error, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
