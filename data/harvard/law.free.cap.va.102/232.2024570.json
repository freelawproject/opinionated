Such use of the streets is not a business, occupation or profession for which a license is required.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-9\">Error to a judgment of the Corporation Court of the city of Bristol, affirming a judgment of the police justice of said city, rendered upon a warrant charging the plaintiffs in error with a violation of an ordinance of the defendant in error.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b264-10\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-11\">The opinion states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-12\"><em>Peters &amp; Lavinder, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-13\"><em>S.

In conducting their business they use their own wagon and team in delivering merchandise to their customers in Bristol, Virginia, and in delivering merchandise sold by them and shipped out of the city, to the railway stations located in the city of Bristol, Virginia. They have no place of business in this State, and their wagon and team are kept in the State of Tennessee, except when engaged in the delivery of goods as above stated. It is not claimed that the defendant in error had imposed, or could impose, a license tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>upon them for conducting their business as furniture merchants and undertakers in the State of Tennessee. But the contention is that it had the right to impose a license tax upon them for the use-of its streets by their wagon and team, in delivering goods sold by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Conceding, for the purposes of this case, that the city of Bristol is authorized by its charter to impose a license tax upon persons hauling freight or passengers over its streets, and that section 78 of its ordinance does impose such tax, no penalty is provided for its violation unless the person charged with such violation is engaged in some business, occupation or profession, for the conduct of which a license is required by the defendant in error. The plaintiffs in error not being engaged in any business or occupation for the conduct of which the defendant in error has imposed upon them a license tax,-do not come within the provisions of section 80. And as that is the only section authorizing a fine to be imposed upon persons using the streets of the defendant city in violation of the provisions of section 78, the judgment complained of was unauthorized, and should have been set aside by the Corporation Court, and the warrant dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">This court will enter such judgment as the Corporation Court ought to have entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
