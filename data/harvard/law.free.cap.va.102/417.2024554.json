And defendant\u2019s counsel then and there excepted to said ruling and action of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The special plea, after stating the circumstances under which the contract was entered into, sets forth its terms as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A04\">\u201cAfter this plaintiff resumed its solicitations that defendant should buy its coal from it, and defendant, explaining to plaintiff the press of orders in its mill, entered into a contract with plaintiff in the month of May, 1902, to buy from plaintiff all of the coal for one year from the date of said contract, that it should use in said year in its said furnaces, which is the only contract that was made between the plaintiff and defendant, and plaintiff\u2019s claim against defendant grows out of that contract. By the terms of this contract plaintiff was to furnish defendant two carloads of its coal each week during the period of one year from the date of the same, of same quality as that supplied in the three carloads above described that defendant had used, and defendant was to pay plaintiff for same at the rate of $2 per ton of 2,240 pounds, free on board of cars at the mines, and plaintiff was to send to defendant each week two carloads of said coal, which defendant was to pay for at said rate, and defendant was to pay the freight on same from said mines to defendant\u2019s mill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The court refused to allow the contract set out in the writing to be introduced in evidence upon two grounds: Eirst, because it varied materially from the contract set up in the special plea, and, second, because it was an agreement not to be performed within a year, and was not signed by the party to be charged. Code, section 2840.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">If there was a variance between the contract offered in evidence and that set up in the plea, it is wholly immaterial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>whether or not it was within the statute of frauds, as to which we express no opinion, so far as its admissibility in evidence was concerned, for neither an oral nor a written contract is admissible in evidence when there is a material variance between it and the contract set up in the pleadings, if objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">That there is material variance between the contract set up in the plea and that which was sought to be proved at the trial by the introduction of the rejected writing, is clear. This we do not understand defendant\u2019s counsel to controvert, but his contention is that the court had no right to pass upon the question of variance until he had introduced all his evidence, since he was compelled by the court, at the instance of the plaintiff, to offer the writing in evidence when he did, although he insisted at that time that \u201cit is an incomplete paper, and that it will be necessary for the court to consider much other matter in order that it may find out from it all what the contract between the parties is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">It is true, the defendant\u2019s counsel did not offer the writing in evidence until objection was made that if the contract relied on was in writing, oral evidence as to the contents was not admissible, but as soon as that objection was made, counsel for defendant declared that the contract relied on in the pleading was in writing, and offered the writing in evidence of his own motion. When objection was made to a question asked one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses and sustained by the court, as disclosed by bill of exception !STo. 2,, counsel for defendant stated to the court that he had stated \u201call along to the court that the written contract which he showed to the court is only a part of the contract really made between the parties; that that contract is on its face incomplete, in showing its want of a date; and defendant\u2019s counsel is now undertaking to show all of the facts which led to the making of the agreement between the parties, of which that writing is only a part evidence, in order that the want of date may be shown, and the true meaning may be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>plained.\u201d In that statement counsel only claims that the written contract offered in evidence was incomplete in one respect, and that was as to its date. There is no claim that the writing offered in evidence and rejected by the court did not contain the terms of the contract between the parties, except its date. The variance between the contract set out in the writing, and the contract set up in the plea was not as to its date, but as to other matters, so that if the court had allowed evidence to be introduced to show that the correct date of the writing was other than that which it bore, it would not have cured the objection made to its admissibility by reason of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\"When the court held that there was a material variance between the contract set up in the plea and that contained in the writing, the defendant might have asked leave to amend his plea, -under section 3384 of the Code, which provides that if at the trial of any action there appears to be a variance between the evidence and the allegations or recitals, the court, if it consider that substantial justice will be promoted and that the opposite party cannot be prejudiced thereby, may allow the pleadings to be amended on such terms as to the payment of costs or postponement of the trial, or both, as it may deem reasonable; or, instead of the pleadings being amended, the court may direct the jury to find the facts and after such finding, if it consider the variance such as could not have prejudiced the opposite party, shall give judgment according to the right of the case. But no such motion was made then or at any time during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">There being a material variance between the contract sought to be proved and that set out in the plea, and no motion being made to amend the plea so as to conform its averments to the proof, or to otherwise take advantage of the provisions of section 3384 of the Code, the court did not err in excluding such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The court having rightly refused to allow a contract to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>proved different from that set up in the plea, there was no error in its other rulings, set out in bills of exception 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, refusing\u2019 to allow evidence to be introduced tending to prove that there was such a contract, and the damages that resulted from its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Upon the evidence before the jury, which is set out in bill of exceptions ZCsTo. 10, the verdict is clearly right, and the court did not err in refusing to set it aside and grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We are of opinion that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
