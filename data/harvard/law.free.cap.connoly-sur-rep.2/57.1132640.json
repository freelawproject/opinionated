Application is now made on behalf of the railroad company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>for leave to issue execution on this judgment to be enforced against the property of decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">I do not think the motion should be granted at present.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The recovery of this judgment did not give defendant any priority over the other creditors of the intestate. See Schmitz v. Langhaar, 88 N. <em>Y. </em>503.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">And before an execution issues, it should appear there were assets sufficient to pay all the debts of decedent, or at least an account should be filed showing fully the assets and the debts to be paid therefrom, so that the execution would direct only the application of the judgment debtor\u2019s \u201cjust proportion of the assets\u201d to the payment of this judgment. Sections 1825, 1826, and 2723, subd. 1, Code of Civil Procedure; Sippel v. Macklin, 2 <em>Dem. </em>219; Peters v. Carr, <em>Id. 22.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In no other way can the scheme for the enforcement of judgments recovered in other courts be made practical when the execution is to be collected out of property left by a decedent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
