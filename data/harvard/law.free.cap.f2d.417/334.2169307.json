While so incarcerated appellants filed a petition for a writ of injunction to enjoin the appellees from further subjecting them to allegedly illegal practices in the jail. The district court denied the petition as being frivolous and wholly insubstantial after holding a full evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-24\">Since docketing their appeal in this Court, appellants have been convicted of the charges against them and transferred to the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. Since appellants are no longer being subjected to the alleged conditions alleged to exist in the Val Verde jail, their appeal is moot and therefore is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
