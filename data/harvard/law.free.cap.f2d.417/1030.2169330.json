BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AG_Q\">Although this case involves a collision between the S/S Kimon and Continental Oil Company\u2019s drilling and production platform fixed on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana, that is the simplest thing about the litigation. What complicates it is not necessarily the United Nations complexion of the ship\u2019s company or notions of flag of convenience,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or the involvement of British underwriters<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whose mere mention evokes the strong exciting aroma of Lloyds\u2019 Coffee House. The complication comes from a Louisiana statute ostensibly designed to protect the public but long thought of in some quarters as a neat way to gain, through diversity jurisdiction, the benefit of a Seventh Amendment Federal Court jury trial in a civil law state where a jury\u2019s verdict carried no more, if as much, appellate weight than that of a Judge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is known as the Direct Action Statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and legislatively ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>punges the traditional \u201cno action\u201d clause of a liability policy to permit a party injured in Louisiana to sue the liability insurer directly without going through the process of suit and judgment against the Assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Like so much legal jousting, the principle may be worth more than the principal. This is just one more of the irrepressible efforts to force a Delphic answer to what fifteen years later has perhaps turned out to be something less than the riddle<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or \u201cgrisly spectre\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> supposed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> About the only new wrinkle, <em>cf. </em>Mike Hooks, Inc. v. Pena, 5 Cir., 1963, 313 F.2d 696, 1963 A.M.C. 355, is that here the occurrence takes place on, over, or around the high seas many miles beyond even the most extravagant of Louisiana claims of territorial sovereignty but within the area characterized as the Outer Continental Shelf by the Congressional Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that sought to compromise, if not solve, the rich intramural controversy over oil in the tidelands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-13\">What brings this all about is the damage caused when S/S Kimon, an ocean going vessel, collided with the offshore drilling platform rigged for the exploration for and production of oil, which was fixed to the ocean\u2019s floor in the Outer Continental Shelf. The occurrence, although formerly perhaps a nonmaritime claim, was clearly a maritime claim under the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>was so treated by Shipowner and drilling platform owner alike.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With no indication then, since, or now that the admiralty remedies were in any way incomplete, inconvenient or unavailable<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014either substantively or procedurally\u2014 the platform owner filed the instant suit in the Louisiana Federal Court against Shipowner\u2019s underwriter under the Louisiana Direct Action Statute (note 4, <em>supra) </em>to recover the identical damages occasioned by the fault of S/S Kimon, her owners, etc. In response to the defendant underwriter\u2019s motions<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Court dismissed the Louisiana direct action suit. Giving the maritime shoals (see notes 5, 6, and 7, <em>supra) </em>a wide berth, this knowledgeable Louisiana Admiralty Judge set his course solely on Louisiana law. He held that since the accident happened outside of Louisiana, and the Louisiana Courts had held that the Direct Action Statute would not be given extraterritorial effect, the Statute did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">That destination was correct and we affirm, although the course was wrong since the dead reckoning did not reckon with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and specifically whether under it Louisiana\u2019s Direct Action Statute has been adopted as federal law and made applicable to this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Disclaiming any prescience superior to that of the Trial Judge, Williams v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 405 F.2d 234, 239, the course has been plotted for us by the stellar-aided inertial guidance system of the recent intervening decision in Rodrigue v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 1969, 395 U.S. 352, 89 S.Ct. 1835, 23 L.Ed.2d 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">The problem facing Congress in establishing a statutory structure for Outer Continental Shelf Lands was what law should be prescribed. The Court in <em>Rod-rigue </em>traces the ebb and flow of legislative tides from which came the scheme of federal adoption of applicable adjacent state law as binding federal law. Under this scheme federal law and jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>are the sole sources of governmental power <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> with that federal law coming from (i) federal law and (ii), where applicable, law of the adjacent state.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">The Court summed up the legislative process, objective and result in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-5\">The purpose of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act was to define a body of law applicable to the seabed, the subsoil, and the fixed structures such as those in question here on the outer Continental Shelf. That this law was to be federal law of the United States, applying state law only as federal law and then only when not inconsistent with applicable federal law, is made clear by the language of the Act. Section 3 makes it the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d that the affected areas \u201cappertain to the United States and are subject to its jurisdiction, control, and power of disposition.\u201d Section 4 makes the \u201cConstitution and laws and civil and political jurisdiction of the United States\u201d apply \u201cto the same extent as if the outer Continental Shelf were an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State.\u201d Since Federal law, because of its limited function, in a federal system, might be inadequate to cope with the full range of potential legal problems, the Act supplemented gaps in the federal law with state law through the \u201cadoption of state law as the law of the United States.\u201d Under \u00a7 4, the adjacent State\u2019s laws were made \u201cthe law of the United States for [the relevant subsoil and seabed] and artificial islands and fixed structures erected thereon,\u201d but only to \u201cthe extent that they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>applicable and not inconsistent with * * * other Federal laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-4\">It is evident from this that federal law is \u201cexclusive\u201d in its regulation of this area, and that state law is adopted only as surrogate federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">395 U.S. at 355, 356-357, 89 S.Ct. at 1837-1838, 23 L.Ed.2d at 364-365. But the result obtained because there (i) was <em>no </em>federal law and (ii) there was a state law covering the precise situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">How different is our case. The damage was caused by collision of S/S Kimon with the structure itself and \u201cwhen the damage is caused by a vessel admittedly in admiralty jurisdiction, the Admiralty Extension Act [see note 9, <em>supra] </em>would now make available the admiralty remedy in any event.\u201d <em>Rod-rigue, supra, </em>at 395 U.S. 360, 89 S.Ct. 1839, 23 L.Ed.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">Thus there was a fully effective maritime right and remedy. (See note 10, <em>supra.) </em>In this situation is adjacent Louisiana law needed or permitted?</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">Whether intended as the analytical course in every instance, the Court in <em>Rodrigue </em>started with the inquiry: Was there a federal law? Finding none\u2014 which eliminated also the question of inconsistency \u2014 the state law which pertained to the occurrence became the exclusive federal law. It could readily do this: On accepted maritime principles for deaths resulting from accidents occurring completely on these \u201cartificial islands\u201d, the Death on the High Seas Act \u2014\u201cof its own force under admiralty principles\u201d \u2014 did not apply and \u201cthe Lands Act deliberately eschewed the application of admiralty principles to these novel structures.\u201d <em>Rodrigue, supra </em>at 395 U.S. 355, 89 S.Ct. 1837, 23 L.Ed.2d 364. In terms of Congressional divination the query technically turns on the meaning to be given \u201capplicable\u201d since adjacent laws become federal law only to \u201cthe extent that [i] they are applicable and [ii] not inconsistent with * * * Federal laws * * *.\u201d 43 \u00a7 1333(a) (2), (see note 15, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-11\">The platform owner contends that the term \u201capplicable\u201d as used in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \u201ccan only mean applicable to the subject matter in question.\u201d And, the argument continues, since this is a suit involving a policy of liability insurance, the Direct Action Statute by its terms covers that very situation. Thus the Direct Action Statute is \u201capplicable\u201d within the meaning of the Act, and being \u201capplicable\u201d affords its own direct relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-12\">On such reading the necessity for state law (in the sense of a right being lost in its absence) is not the significant factor. State law becomes merely a matter of affording some gain or benefit or advantage not available if state law can not be invoked. Such a reading, of course, puts almost 100% emphasis on the \u201cnot inconsistent * * * with federal laws\u201d element of \u00a7 1333(a) <em>(2) </em>\u2014 a problem which the platform owners circumnavigate by not only moving the Louisiana law out to sea but moving the occurrence back into Louisiana as though it had taken place on inland waters.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That is a lot of fictionalizing. And in more austere words it imputes to Congress the purpose generally to export the whole body of adjacent law onto the Outer Continental Shelf for automatic application to any and all occurrences <em>unless </em>\u2014 with the <em>unless </em>being limited to (a) specific provisions within the Act<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or (b) inconsistent federal law. By whatever characterization expressed, in determining what law is to govern, that approach accords initially a superiority to adjacent state law \u2014 the question of federal law comes into play only after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>this process excludes state law. This is hardly in keeping with the course of legislative history in which the notion of supremacy of state law administered by state agencies was expressly rejected.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Keeping in mind that the tidelands controversy<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> had deep political and emotional currents centered around the clash between national sovereignty and states\u2019 rights \u2014 a dispute in which geography separated the adversaries as inland states sought compensating advantages to offset those claimed by coastal states as historically and exclusively theirs <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 the deliberate choice of federal law, federally administered,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> requires that \u201capplicable\u201d be read in terms of necessity \u2014 necessity to fill a significant void or gap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">This is the recurring theme of <em>Rod-rigue. </em>Thus, early in the opinion the Court states since \u201cFederal law, because of its limited function in a federal system, might be inadequate to cope with the full range of potential legal problems, the Act supplemented <em>gaps </em>in the federal law with state law through the \u2018adoption of State law as the law of the United States\u2019.\u201d 395 U.S. at 357, 89 S.Ct. at 1838, 23 L.Ed.2d at 365 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">Again after referring to the Committee report which stated that \u201cParagraph (2) adopts State law as Federal law, to be used when Federal statutes or regulations of the Secretary of the Interior are inapplicable,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Mr. Justice White summed it up for the Court emphatically. \u201cThis language makes it clear that state law could be used to <em>fill </em>federal <em>voids.\u201d </em>395 U.S. at 358, 89 S.Ct. at 1838, 23 L.Ed.2d at 365 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">This approach was reflected by the statements of Senators Cordon, who presented the Act to the Senate, and Anderson, a member of the Conference Committee : \u201cAs Senator Anderson, a member of the conference committee, put it: \u2018The real point is * * * that the language in section 4 provides that Federal laws and regulations shall be applicable in the area, but that <em>where there is a void, the State law may be applicable </em>* * *.\u2019 Remarks of Senator Anderson, 99 Cong. Rec. 7164. Senator Cordon noted that this view was \u2018entirely correct\u2019 and added that \u2018These laws, by the terms of the act, are enacted as Federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rod-rigue, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 358, 89 S.Ct. at 1838, 23 L.Ed.2d at 365-366 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-14\">Of course there is no such necessity here. The collision was a classic maritime case within the validly extended Admiralty jurisdiction in which both substantive rights and remedies (see note 9, <em>supra.) </em>were quite ample. There is no void, there are no gaps. If there were, the Admiralty, under the guidance of a Judge having all of the flexibility of a sea-going Chancellor, <em>cf. </em>Hadjipateras v. Pacifica, S.A., 5 Cir., 1961, 290 F.2d 697, 1961 A.M.C. 1417, has adequate resourc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>es<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> without calling on adjacent state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">This approach likewise makes something more out of the \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d element of \u00a7 1333(a) (2) than a mere disjunctive for mechanical invocation and assessment. In determining whether it is appropriate to call in adjacent state law, it permits an analysis in the light of the interests sought to be served in the domestic intramural contest over the oil rich tideiands without disturbing interests of an International character having equal, if not greater importance in a day in which an incident on the High Seas may trigger a fissioned Armagged-on.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">Both by the terms of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and by International convention, sovereignty of the adjacent nation (not subsidiary state) is a \u201chorizontal\u201d one limited to the seabed and structures fixed thereon<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> with full freedom of the seas accorded to all nations in the surrounding waters.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">The United States has interests in its relations to other nations quite different from those among its own several states. Thus, while it does not offend the constitutional imperative for the uniformity of admiralty<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> for the Louisiana Direct Action Statute to apply to maritime cases occurring on inland waters of Louisiana,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> quite different considerations enter in mandatorily applying that to some \u2014but a very select class \u2014 eases on the Outer Continental Shelf. The class is select in the sense that it must somehow be physieally-eausally related to the structure (\u201cartificial island\u201d) without which Louisiana law is as irrelevant as that of Pakistan. This has nothing to do with so-called Louisiana interests. For no matter how closely related to Louisiana interests, for example, of local ownership of vessels involved, the Louisiana residence of operating crew members, performance of specific work for Louisiana based concerns, the transportation of men or materials to and from Outer Continental Shelf Land drilling sites, or the like, the Direct Action Statute could not be invoked for any one of a countless variety of maritime cases \u2014 collision, capsizing, personal injury, cargo loss \u2014 un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>less there is a causal connection with the fixed structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Since this demonstrates that Louisiana interests in <em>maritime cases </em>could not have been a matter of Congressional concern in its pattern of physically-restricted-adoptive law, in assaying congressional purpose the focus must be on National and International interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-15\">This brings into play both physical and legal factors. For these waters not only are legally \u201chigh seas\u201d (see note 25, <em>supra) </em>, they are in fact \u201chigh seas.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This means that these structures may be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>and often are,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> far from the adjacent shore in the very track of merchantmen of all flags and of all nations plying recognized sea lanes of the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf of Mexico.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">The major part of this traffic will have no concern with the particular adjacent state within whose artificial extended boundaries the structure happens to be. Many will be foreign flag vessels bound from a foreign place to an American port in a non-adjacent state. Many will be foreign flag ships en route to distant ports by way of the Panama Canal. Many will be American flag ships, cargo or tanker, under registry, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11, trading to and from foreign ports. Others will be American flag vessels, especially tankers under enrollment, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 251, 259, 278, in the coast-wise or intercoastal trade between United States ports in non-adjacent states <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-12\">In the midst of all this traffic to which the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and International Convention (see notes 24, and 25) assure full, traditional freedom of the seas, it is unthinking that Congress ever remotely considered \u2014 even for the briefest moment \u2014 that by the rare coincidence of hitting a structure located 50 miles off shore Louisiana a local, non-maritime Louisiana statute could leap this distance to subject a foreign vessel owner <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and her foreign, but amenable,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> underwriters to a suit in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>Louisiana Federal Court even though the vessel never had been and never would trade to and from Louisiana ports. If that is so, then it would be equally unthinking to suppose that Congress meant to import an exception by allowing adoption where, by a further rare coincidence, the foreign vessel, otherwise free to sail as she pleases, happens to hit the structure while bound to or from a Louisiana port. Any such \u201cexception\u201d would itself disrupt the basic underlying policy of non-interference with navigation on the high seas by making it necessary for underwriter or owner, or both, to first submit to the Louisiana Direct Action suit and then in it establish the right to the \u201cexception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">These considerations become more significant in the light of today\u2019s multiparty donnybrooks, see Grigsby v. Coastal Marine Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 412 F.2d 1011, A.M.C. in which theories of initial, contingent and secondary liabilities orbit to an imaginative apocenter. Without physically touching the off shore structure to trigger the Extension of Admiralty Act, (note 9, <em>supra) </em>it is quite conceivable that the conduct of the foreign vessel might be found to have brought about damage to the structure caused physically by some other craft under circumstances in which the law would conclude that in legal effect it was the foreign vessel that \u201chit\u201d the structure. Thus by a series of fictions and legal theories a foreign underwriter or owner, or both, find the freedom of the seas disrupted by a statute of a state not then visible and to which neither ever intended to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">In this approach both \u201capplicable\u201d and the \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d elements are interpreted together. The term \u201capplicable\u201d gets much of its meaning from factors bearing on \u201cnot inconsistent.\u201d Whether for off shore, unlike inland, maritime cases we would hold the Direct Action Statute inconsistent we need not here determine. Taking into account the National and International interests behind that element we do hold that for this maritime case the Direct Action Statute is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">.
