For the reasons set forth below we have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-18\">The memorandum opinion of the district court is reported. Frye v. Moran (D.C.W.D.Tex.1969) 302 F.Supp. 1291. Serious questions as to the construction of Title 18, U.S.C., Chapter 402, Sections 5005-5026, The Federal Youth Correction Act, specifically Section 5017, and its interplay in the overall statutory scheme with Title 18, U.S.C., Section 3568 and Rule 38(a) (2), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, are raised by that court\u2019s disposition of the issues. Despite the gravity of these issues, the result of the district court\u2019s decision is nevertheless simply to provide for appellant\u2019s unconditional release by November 3, 1969, at the latest rather than immediately as urged by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-19\">We do not believe that the screening process provides sufficient basis for disposition of the questions raised, but rather consider that they better lend themselves to disposition upon oral argument. Time and space limitations as to calendaring are such that the imminence of the release date does not provide sufficient time to calendar the case for oral argument and dispose of it before it is mooted.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-20\">In consideration of the foregoing, the judgment below is affirmed. This action should not be understood as either adoption or rejection of, either the district court\u2019s reasoning or its conclusions. Those matters are not passed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
