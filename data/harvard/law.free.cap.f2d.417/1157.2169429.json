ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1222-19\">Appellee petitioned the District Court for the appointment of a conservator for the person and property of Muriel C. Davis, her daughter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant, Mrs. Davis\u2019 husband, is a foreign service officer employed by the Agency for International Development, and at the time was on assignment to duty in Nigeria. The petition alleged that Mrs. Davis was a resident of the District of Columbia but that she was then being cared for in appellee\u2019s home in East Orange, New Jersey, following her release from a hospital after treatment for mental illness. As the basis for the appointment, the petition averred that Mrs. Davis, by reason of her mental illness, was unable to properly manage her property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-20\">Upon the filing of the petition, the District Court appointed appellee as temporary conservator for Mrs. Davis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a member of the bar as her guardian ad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>litem.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court\u2019s order fixed a date for a hearing, and directed service of a notice thereof on Mrs. Davis and on appellant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the hearing, conducted as scheduled, the guardian ad litem submitted his report and his unqualified recommendation that a permanent conservator be appointed as sought, and this the court announced it would do. Three days later, however, and prior to any order actualizing the announcement, appellant filed a motion in opposition to the petition. Therein he stated that he had not been notified of the hearing, and that he and his wife were residents of New Jersey. The motion requested that the court stay the entry of an order of appointment, and that the petition be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">The District Court, on the same day, denied appellant\u2019s motion and entered an order appointing appellee the \u201cConservator of the real and personal property of\u201d Mrs. Davis <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and \u201cas the person responsible for [her] personal welfare. * * \u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, appellant moved for reconsideration, impugning the order of appointment on claims of residence of the parties in New Jersey and omission of notice to him of the hearing. The court, finding that Mrs. Davis was a resident of the District of Columbia and concluding that notice of the hearing had been duly served, denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Appellant presents, in the main, two contentions demanding our consideration. The first is that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to appoint a conservator for his wife because both she and he were nonresidents of the District of Columbia. The court, however, was statutorily empowered to appoint a conservator for the property of \u201can adult residing in or having property in the District of Columbia [who] is unable, by reason of * * * mental illness, * * properly to care for his property,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and to \u201corder that the conservator * * * shall be responsible for the personal welfare of the person whose property is under conservatorship. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court found that Mrs. Davis was a resident of the District and on the whole record we cannot say that the finding was clearly erroneous. Moreover, the statute confers jurisdiction for the appointment of conservators not only for resident District property owners but also for nonresidents \u201chaving property\u201d within the District,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and at the time of the appointment Mrs. Davis was coowner with appellant of real estate situated here.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It follows, from either or both of these circumstances, that the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-16\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that he was an indispensable party to the proceeding leading to the appointment of the conservator and that failure to notify him of the hearing vitiated that proceeding. The relevant statutory requirement is that the District Court \u201cshall cause at least 14 days\u2019 notice [of the hearing] to be given to the person for whom a conservator is sought to be appointed, if he is not the petitioner, and to such other persons as the court directs.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As we have stated, the order fixing the hearing date specified that notice thereof be served on appellant, and the record discloses that counsel for appellee sent the notice intended for appellant by certified mail to the residence of his mother, who refused to accept it. Counsel told the District Court that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>was done because he did not have appeh lant\u2019s Nigerian address and that the mother\u2019s was the last address for appellant of which he had knowledge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">It is clear to us that appellant was not an indispensable party in the sense that his presence in the proceeding was essential to its validity. The statute does not explicate that requirement, and we are unable to imply it from a law so plainly designed to provide a simple procedure, and one which is expeditious in circumstances truly exigent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The statute positively enjoins notice only to \u201cthe person for whom a conservator is sought, if he is not the petitioner,\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and merely authorizes notice to others as the court may direct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Notice to Mrs. Davis was one thing;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> apart from a legislative mandate, notice to her husband, though highly desirable, was legally quite a different thing. The District Court very properly endeavored to have appellant notified of the hearing, and a different method of executing the court\u2019s direction may have been successful.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We do not, however, read the statute as imposing the desideratum of actual notice to him as an imperative condition to the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction. And since the court accepted the efforts of appellee\u2019s counsel as a satisfactory compliance with its order, we are hardly in position to demand more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-15\">Nonetheless, we do not close the book on the case at this point, for while it was pending this appeal the parties\u2019 situation has altered substantially. Appellant, we are informed, has returned to the United States and is currently residing in New Jersey. In that state, Mrs. Davis also remains in abode with her mother. With both parties now absent from the District of Columbia for the foreseeable future, the nexus between the instant problem and this community has minimized; New Jersey has become the sovereign of greater concern. While our statute empowers the court to commit to a conservator responsibilities concerning the personal welfare of the person whose property is under conservatorship,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the primary function of a conervatorship is the preservation of the property.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A committeeship or its New Jersey equivalent may now be more fitting than is a District of Columbia conservatorship. Indeed, in the circumstances related to us, any real need for a conservator to protect the parties\u2019 single asset in the District may be open to question.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To the end that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>Court may consider the change in the parties\u2019 circumstances, we remand the case to it.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">.
