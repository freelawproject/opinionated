The Board found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by interfering with, restraining, and coercing its employees in the exercise of their \u00a7 7 rights to organize, join and assist labor organizations, and also violated \u00a7 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act by transferring an employee named Snyder from his job and later terminating his employment in order to discourage union membership and activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">The company\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s decision and order ultimately rests upon the sufficiency of the evidence which was before the Board and its Trial Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">On consideration of the record as a whole, we conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings. We shall accordingly grant enforcement of its order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-33\">. 171 N.L.R.B. No. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
