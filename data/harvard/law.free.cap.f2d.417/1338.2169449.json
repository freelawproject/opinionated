S. Constitution in that there-had been prior relevant decisions of the Department which the Appellee Commissioner had not compiled, published or distributed, and that his failure to do so denied her access to them and hence denied her the full exercise of her right to a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-15\">Relying upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 for jurisdiction and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for a cause of action, she sought declaratory and injunctive relief and filed a motion for summary judgment. The Commissioner also moved for summary judgment on the ground that the federal district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-16\">In a perceptive opinion District Judge Blumenfeld ruled on the cross-motions in favor of the Commissioner, 305 F.Supp. 855; and we affirm upon that opinion the judgment entered below. See also McCall v. Shapiro (2 Cir. August 11, 1969), affirming 292 F.Supp. 268 (D. Conn. 1968).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
